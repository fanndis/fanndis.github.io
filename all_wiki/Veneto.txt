'''Veneto''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|v|ɛ|n|ə|t|oʊ|,_|ˈ|v|eɪ|n|-|,_|-|n|eɪ|t|-|,_|ˈ|v|ɛ|n|ɛ|t|oʊ}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/veneto|title=Veneto|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Veneto|access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Veneto|access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> {{IPA-it|ˈvɛːneto|lang}};<ref name="OED">{{Cite Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Venetia|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref> {{lang-vec|Vèneto}} {{IPA-vec|ˈvɛneto|}}) or '''Venetia'''<ref name="OED"/> is one of the 20 [[regions of Italy]]. Its population is about five million, ranking fifth in [[Italy]]. The region's capital is [[Venice]].

Veneto was part of the [[Roman Empire]] until the 5th century AD. Later, after a [[Feudalism|feudal period]], it was part of the [[Republic of Venice]] until 1797. Venice ruled for centuries over one of the largest and richest [[maritime republics]] and trade empires in the world. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Republic was annexed by the [[Austrian Empire]], until it was [[Italian unification|merged]] with the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1866, as a result of the [[Third Italian War of Independence]].

Besides [[Italian language|Italian]], most inhabitants also speak [[Venetian language|Venetian]]{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} which is divided into five varieties.

Since 1971 the [[Statute of Veneto]] has referred to the region's citizens as "the Venetian people".<ref>http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/upload_crv/statuto/statuto_precedente.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/leggi/2012/12st0001.html |title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Leggi Regionali |publisher=Consiglioveneto.it |access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref> Article 1 defines Veneto as an "autonomous Region", "constituted by the Venetian people and the lands of the provinces of Belluno, Padua, Rovigo, Treviso, Venice, Verona and Vicenza", while maintaining "bonds with Venetians in the world". Article 2 sets forth the principle of the "self-government of the Venetian people" and mandates the Region to "promote the historical identity of the Venetian people and civilisation". Despite these affirmations, approved by the [[Italian Parliament]], Veneto is not among the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous regions with special statute]], differently from its north-eastern and north-western neighbours, [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] respectively.

Veneto is home to a notable nationalist movement, known as [[Venetian nationalism]] or Venetism. The region's largest party is the [[Liga Veneta]], a founding component of the [[Lega Nord]]. The current [[President of Veneto]] is [[Luca Zaia]] (Liga Veneta–Lega Nord), re-elected in [[2020 Venetian regional election|2020]] with 76.8% of the vote. An [[2017 Venetian autonomy referendum|autonomy referendum]] took place in 2017: 57.2% of Venetians turned out, 98.1% voting "yes" to "further forms and special conditions of autonomy".

Having been for a long period in history a land of mass emigration, Veneto is today one of the greatest immigrant-receiving regions in the country, with 487,493 foreigners (9.9% of the regional population; January 2018), notably including [[Romanians]] (25.2%), [[Moroccans]] (9.3%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (7.1%),  [[Moldovans]] (7.0%) and [[Albanians]] (6.9%).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/str2017/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |access-date=6 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806142909/http://www.demo.istat.it/bil2016/index.html |archive-date=6 August 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="tuttitalia.it">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/veneto/statistiche/cittadini-stranieri-2018/|title=Cittadini Stranieri 2018 – Veneto|website=Tuttitalia.it}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Geomorphology===

[[File:Veneto SRTM.png|thumb|right|Relief map of Veneto]]
Veneto is the 8th largest region in Italy, with a total area of {{Convert|18398.9|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}. It is located in the north-eastern part of Italy and is bordered to the east by [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], to the south by [[Emilia-Romagna]], to the west by [[Lombardy]] and to the north by [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]. In its northernmost corner it also borders [[Austria]].

The north–south extension of Veneto is {{Convert|210|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Austrian border to the mouth of the [[Po (river)|River Po]]. By area, 29% of its surface is mountainous ([[Carnic Alps]], eastern [[Dolomites]] and [[Venetian Prealps]]). The highest massif in the Dolomites is the [[Marmolada]]-massif at {{Convert|3342|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Other dolomitic peaks are the [[Tre Cime di Lavaredo]] and the [[Pala group|Pale di San Martino]]. The Venetian Prealps are not as high and range between {{Convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. A distinctive characteristic of the Pre-alps are the cave formations, including chasms and sink holes; the [[Spluga della Preta]], situated in the [[Monte Lessini]] chain in the province of [[Verona]], has an explored depth of {{Convert|985|m|ft|abbr=on}}, being the deepest cave in Italy. Fossil deposits are also abundant there.

The [[Po Valley]], covering 57% of Veneto, extends from the [[mountains]] to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic sea]], broken only by some low hills: [[Euganean Hills]], [[Berici Hills]] [[Colli Asolani]] and [[Montello (TV), Italy|Montello]], which constitute the remaining 14% of the territory. The plain itself is subdivided into the higher plain (gravel-strewn and not very fertile) and the lower plain (rich in water sources and arable terrain). The lower plain is both a mainstay of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] production and the most populated part of the region.

[[File:20110720 Verona 3078.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Adige]] in [[Verona]]]]
Several rivers flow through the region: the [[Po (river)|Po]], [[Adige]], [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]], [[Bacchiglione]], [[Livenza]], [[Piave (river)|Piave]], and [[Tagliamento]]. The eastern shore of the largest lake in Italy, [[Lake Garda]], belongs to Veneto. The coastline covers approximately {{Convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}}, of which {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} are beaches.

The coasts of the [[Adriatic Sea]] are characterised by the [[Venetian Lagoon]], a flat terrain with ponds, [[marsh]]es and islands. The [[Po (river)|Po Delta]] to the south features sandbars and dunes along the coastline. The inland portion contains cultivable land recently reclaimed by a system of [[canal]]s and [[Levee|dykes]]. [[Fish]] ponds have been created there as well. The delta and the lagoon are a stopping-point for [[bird migration|migratory birds]].

Veneto's morphology is characterised by its:<ref name=vennum>{{cite web|title=Veneto in numbers: statistics pocket-guide: Year 2007 |url=http://statistica.regione.veneto.it/ENG/pubblicazioni_elenco.jsp |publisher=Regione del Veneto Department for Statistics |year=2008 |access-date=9 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710074005/http://statistica.regione.veneto.it/ENG/pubblicazioni_elenco.jsp |archive-date=10 July 2009 }}</ref>
* mountains (''montagna''): {{Convert|5359.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, (117 ''comuni'' being classified as mountainous);
* hills (''collina''): {{Convert|2663.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, (120 hilly ''comuni'');
* and plains (''pianura''): {{Convert|10375.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, (344 ''comuni'' mostly situated in the Po Valley).

===Climate===
The climate changes significantly from one area to another: while it is continental on the plains, it is milder along the Adriatic coast; around the [[Lake Garda]] and in the hilly areas. The lowlands are often covered by thick fog; precipitations that are scarce – 750&nbsp;mm per year – close to the [[river Po]], but are more abundant – from 750 to 1100&nbsp;mm per year – at higher altitudes; the highest values – up to 3200&nbsp;mm per year – are recorded in the Bellunese Prealps, near [[Mount Pasubio]] and on the [[Asiago plateau]].

==History==

===Venetic period===
Between the 2nd and 1st millennium BC, the region was inhabited by the [[Euganei]]. According to ancient historians, who perhaps wanted to link Venetic origins to legend of Roman origins in [[Troy]], the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]] (often called the ''Palaeoveneti'') came from [[Paphlagonia]] in [[Anatolia]] at the time of the [[Trojan War|Fall of Troy]] (12th century BC), led by prince [[Antenor (mythology)|Antenor]], a comrade of [[Aeneas]]. Other historians link Venetic origins with Celts.

In the 7th–6th centuries BC the local populations of Veneto entered into contact with the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and the [[Greeks]]. Venetic culture reached a high point during the 4th century BC. These ancient Veneti spoke [[Venetic language|Venetic]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language akin to, but distinct from [[Latin]] and the other [[Italic languages]]. Meanwhile, the Veneti prospered through their trade in [[amber]] and breeding of horses. [[House of Este|Este]], [[Padua]], [[Oderzo]], [[Adria]], [[Vicenza]], [[Verona]], and [[Altinum|Altino]] became centres of Venetic culture. Over time, the Veneti began to adopt the dress and certain other customs of their [[Celts|Celtic]] neighbours.

[[File:Venice – The Tetrarchs 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Tetrarchy|Tetrarchs]] were the four co-rulers who governed the [[Roman Empire]] as long as [[Diocletian]]'s reform lasted. Here they are portrayed embracing, in a posture of harmony, in a porphyry sculpture dating from the 4th century, produced in [[Anatolia]], located today on a corner of [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]]. ]]

===Roman period===
During the 3rd century BC, the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]], together with the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Cenomani]] [[Celts]] on their western border, sided with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], as [[Rome]] expanded and struggled against the [[Insubres]] and [[Boii]] ([[Celts]]). During the [[Second Punic War]] (218 – 202 BC), the Veneti even sent a contingent of soldiers to fight alongside the Romans against Hannibal and the invading Carthaginians.  These Venetians were among those slaughtered at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC).

In 181 BC a Roman [[triumvirate]] of [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica (consul 191 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica]], [[Gaius Flaminius|Caius Flaminius]], and [[Lucius Manlius Acidinus]] founded a Latin [[Colonies in antiquity|colony]] at [[Aquileia]] as a base to protect the territory of the Veneti from incursions of the hostile [[Carni]] and [[Istria|Histri]]. From then on, Roman influence over the area increased. In 169 BC 1,500 more colonising families were sent by Rome to Aquileia. In 148 BC the ''[[Via Postumia]]'' was completed connecting Aquileia to [[Genoa]]. In 131 BC, the ''Via Annia'' joined [[Adria]] to Patavium (modern [[Padua]]) to Altinum to Concordia to Aquileia.

The [[Roman Republic]] gradually transformed its alliance with the Veneti into a relationship of dominance. After the 91 BC Italic rebellion, the cities of the Veneti, together with the rest of ''Transpadania'', were granted partial rights of [[Roman citizenship]] according to the ''[[Lex Pompeia de Transpadanis]]''. Later in 49 BC, by the ''[[Lex Roscia]]'' granted full Roman citizenship to the Veneti. The ''[[Via Claudia Augusta|Via Claudia]]'' would be completed in AD 46 to connected Altinum, Tarvisium (modern Treviso), Feltria (modern [[Feltre]]), and Tridentum (modern Trento).  From Tridentum it continued northwards to Pons Drusus and further to Augusta Vindelicorum (modern [[Augsburg]]), and southwards from Trento to Verona and Mutina (modern [[Modena]]).

After the [[Battle of Philippi]] (42 BC) ended the [[Roman civil wars|Roman Civil War]], the lands of the Veneti, together with the rest of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], ceased to be a province. Between 8 and 6 BC, [[Augustus]] reorganized ''Italia'' into 11 ''regions.'' The territory of modern Veneto along with [[Istria]], modern [[Friuli]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]] and eastern [[Lombardy]] (including its cities of [[Mantua]], [[Cremona]], [[Brescia]], and [[Sondrio]]) became Region X (''Venetia et Histria'').  Aquileia, although not officially the capital was the chief municipium of the region.<ref name="Venetiae">Claudio Azzara, ''Venetiae: Determinazione di in' area regionale fra antichita e alto antichità e alto medioevo'', (Edizioni Fondazione Benetton Studi Ricerche: Treviso, 2002), 22-24.</ref>  Meanwhile, under the [[Pax Romana]], Patavium developed into one of the most important cities of northern Italy. Other Venetic cities such as Opitergium (modern [[Oderzo]]), Tarvisium, Feltria, Vicetia (modern Vicenza), Ateste (modern Este), and Altinum (modern Altino) adopted the [[Latin]] language and the culture of Rome. By the end of the 1st century AD Latin had displaced the original [[Venetic language]].

In 166 AD the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] invaded Venetia. It was the beginning of many barbarian invasions. [[Marcus Aurelius]] retaining the regions of ''Italia'', superimposed another layer of administration by ascribing Regions X and XI to the district of ''Transpadana'' under a ''iuridicus''.  The end of the 3rd c. brought further administrative changes when [[Diocletian]] abolished the regions and districts and established ''provinciae''.  Thus, Region X (''Venetia et Histria'') became Province VIII (''Venetia et Histria''), being enlarged in the west up to the [[Adda River]] governed by a ''corrector'' until 363 and from 368 to 373 by a ''consularius'' seated at Aquileia. ''Venetia et Histria'' remained one of the 16 Provinces of Italy in the 5th century when both [[Alaric I|Alaric]] the Goth and then [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] and the Huns devastated the area. Attila laid siege to Aquileia and turned it into a ruin in 452 AD. Many of the mainland inhabitants sought protection in the nearby lagoons which would become [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] in the east and [[Venice]] more to the west. On the heels of the Huns came the Ostrogoths who not only invaded, but also settled down in the region, especially near Treviso where the penultimate king [[Totila]] was born.<ref name="Venetiae 2">Claudio Azzara, ''Venetiae: Determinazione di in' area regionale fra antichita e alto antichità e alto medioevo'', (Edizioni Fondazione Benetton Studi Ricerche: Treviso, 2002), 31-35.</ref>

During the mid-6th century, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] reconquered Venetia for the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. An Exarch was established at [[Ravenna]] while a [[military tribune]] was set up in Oderzo. Greek-Byzantine rule did not last long. Starting in 568 AD, the Lombards crossed the [[Julian Alps]]. These invaders subdivided the territory of Venetia into numerous feuds ruled by Germanic dukes and counts, essentially creating the division of Veneto from Friuli.

The invasion provoked another wave of migration from the mainland to the Byzantine controlled coast and islands. In 643 AD the [[Lombards]] conquered the Byzantine base at Oderzo and took possession of practically all of Veneto (and Friuli) except for Venice and Grado. The 36 Lombard duchies included the Venetian cities of [[Vittorio Veneto|Ceneda]], Treviso, Verona, and Vicenza. A reminder of Lombard rule can be seen in the place names beginning with the word ''Farra''.

[[File:San Marco horses.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Horses of Saint Mark]], brought as loot from [[Constantinople]] in 1204.]]

===Middle Ages===

By the middle of the 8th century, the [[Franks]] had assumed political control of the region and the mainland of Veneto became part of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. Though politically dominant, these Germanic invaders were gradually absorbed into the Venetian population over the centuries.
In the late 9th century, [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar]], [[Margrave]] of the [[March of Friuli]] was [[elective monarchy|elected king]] of Italy. Under his tumultuous reign, the March of Friuli was absorbed into the [[March of Verona]] so that Verona's territory contained a large portion of Roman Venetia.

In the 10th century, the mainland of Veneto, after suffering raids from the [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] and the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gradually, the communes of the mainland grew in power and wealth. In 1167 an alliance (called the [[Lombard League]]) was formed among the Venetian cities such as Venice, Padua, Treviso, Vicenza, and Verona with other cities of [[Northern Italy]] to assert their rights against the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

The [[Peace of Constance|Second Treaty of Constance]] in 1183 confirmed the [[Treaty of Venice|Peace of Venice]] of 1177 in which the cities agreed to remain part of the Empire as long as their jurisdiction over their own territories was not infringed upon. The league was dissolved at the death of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] in 1250. This period also witnessed the founding of the second oldest [[university]] in Italy, the [[University of Padua]] founded in 1222. Around this time, [[Padua]] also served as home to [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]], the beloved Saint called simply "il Santo" ("the Saint") by the inhabitants of the town.

===Venetian Republic===
{{Main|Republic of Venice|History of the Republic of Venice}}

[[File:Il Ritorno del Bucintoro al molo nel giorno dell'Ascensione (c.1738) Canaletto - Wells-Next-The-Sea, The Earl of Leicester and Trustees of the Holkham Estate.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century view of [[Venice]] by [[Canaletto]].]]
As the barbarians were interested in the wealth of the mainland, part of the Venetian population sought refuge on some of the isolated and unoccupied islands in the lagoon, from which the city of ''Venetiae'' or [[Venice]] was born. After a period of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] domination in 8th century, [[Venice]] became an independent maritime [[Republic of Venice|Republic]] ruled by its elected [[doge]].

The Republic became a commercial superpower and its influence lasted through the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. In fact, the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]] enjoyed 1100 years of uninterrupted influence throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. By the 16th century, the Venetian Republic dominated Veneto, [[Friuli]], parts of [[Lombardy]] and [[Romagna]], [[Istria]], [[Dalmatia]], the [[Ionian Islands]] of Corfu, Cefalonia, Ithaca and Zante. From the 13th to 17th centuries, it held the island of [[Crete]] and from the mid-15th to mid-16th century, the island of [[Cyprus]].

Venetian mainland holdings led to Venetian involvement in European and in particular, Italian politics. Cities had to be fortified, two impressive examples are Nafplio in Peloponese and [[Palmanova]] in Friuli. The wise rule and prosperity brought by the "Serenissima" (most serene republic) made the cities of the ''terra firma'' willing subjects. Eastern Islands served as useful ports for Venetian shipping. However, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] grew more powerful and aggressive, Venice was often put on the defensive. Ottoman control of the eastern Mediterranean and the discoveries of sea routes to Asia around Africa and of the [[Americas]] had a debilitating effect on the Venetian economy.

In 1797, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] invaded the territory of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. Overwhelmed by more powerful forces, [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Ludovico Manin]] resigned and retired to his villa at [[Passariano]] in Friuli and the thousand year old Republic disappeared as an [[Sovereign state|independent state]]. This proved very unpopular in the mainland cities where sympathies were strong with the Republic of Venice. By the [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Treaty of Campoformio]] signed on 17 October 1797, part of the Venetian mainland was handed over to [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and a western part was annexed to the French backed [[Cisalpine Republic]]. The territory soon reverted to Napoleon in 1801.

=== Habsburg rule ===
Then in 1805–1806, it was conquered by [[First French Empire|Napoleon]]'s armies and included in the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. During 1809, the region revolted against the French-Italian rule,<ref>Ettore Beggiato, ''1809: l'insorgenza veneta – La lotta contro Napoleone nella Terra di san Marco'', Il Cerchio, 2009</ref> supporting the advancing Austrian troops during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. It was mainly a peasant revolt, less organised than the nearby [[Andreas Hofer]]'s revolt, while urban national guard troops fought on the French-Italian side. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], 1814–1815, Venetia was the eastern half of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]], a separate kingdom of the [[Austrian Empire]].

During the 1848 [[First Italian War of Independence]], Venetia rose against the central Austrian government, forming the [[Republic of San Marco]], which lasted 17 months. It asked to be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] to form an Italian confederation against Austria, then using the Italian tricolour in its flag, but, after the other Italian states left the war (May 1848) and Sardinia surrendered (August 1848, then March 1849), Venetia stood alone. It surrendered on 24 August 1849, when the [[Siege of Venice (1848)|Siege of Venice]] ended.<ref name="Encyc Rev 1848">{{citation | first = Ronald S | last = Cunsolo | url = http://www.ohiou.edu/~Chastain/rz/venrev.htm | title = Venice and the Revolution of 1848–49 | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Revolutions of 1848 | access-date = 22 November 2008 | publisher = Ohio University | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081220140052/http://www.ohiou.edu/~Chastain/rz/venrev.htm | archive-date = 20 December 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The Austrian imperial government was unpopular among upper and middle classes because of [[Metternich]]'s anti-[[liberalism|liberal]] politics, turned by [[Emperor Franz Joseph]] into [[Franz Joseph I of Austria#Imperial absolutism, 1848–1860|neo-absolutism]] after 1848, and for not granting Lombardo–Venetia any real autonomy (it was considered less than a [[puppet state]]). At the same time, it was appreciated for the efficient and honest administration, especially among lower classes, and long-standing strong cultural ties linked Venetia and Austria even after it was ceded to Italy. Despite this, after 1848–1849 there was no revolt against the Austrian rule.

Venetia remained under Austrian control until the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, when the [[Kingdom of Italy]] joined on the Prussian side and was promised Venetia in exchange for its assistance. Austria offered to sell Venetia to Italy, but the Italians refused, seeing it as a dishonourable act. This caused another southern front for Austria, the [[Third Italian War of Independence]].

Once the wars ended, the [[Treaty of Vienna (1866)|Treaty of Vienna]] ceded the region to neutral France, but left the fortresses under Austrian control for a time. Following protests, the Austrians left and the French ceded it to Italy on 20 October. A referendum – where only 30% of the adult population voted as was custom in the period, and did so under government pressure<ref>Genova Giovanni Thaon di Revel, ''La cessione del Veneto. Ricordi di un commissario piemontese incaricato alle trattative'', Lumachi, [[Florence]] 1906</ref> there was a 99.99% majority for Italy<ref>Ettore Beggiato, ''1866: la grande truffa'', Editoria Universitaria, 1999</ref><ref name="Borsetto">Giampaolo Borsetto, ''Venezia 1866: el grande inbrogio.

During the [[Fascism|fascist era]], due to the [[Italian nationalism#Fascism and World War II (1922 to 1945)|nationalist policy]] the Venetian language, as other local languages, was banned in public spaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/1997/08/08/Cultura/FASCISMO-E-IL-DUCE-DISSE-NON-SI-SCRIVA-IN-ROMANESCO_132100.php|title={{title case|FASCISMO: E IL DUCE DISSE, NON SI SCRIVA IN ROMANESCO}}|website=adnkronos.com}}</ref>

Due to uneven economic development reducing many to poverty, the 19th century and the first half of the 20th became a period of emigration. Millions of Venetians left their homes and their native land to seek opportunities in other parts of the world. Many settled down in South America, especially in [[Brazil]]; others in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States|United States of America]]. After the [[World War II|Second World War]], many Venetians emigrated to Western European countries. In many of these places, their descendants have maintained the use of their ancestral Venetian dialects.

Those who remained in Veneto would experience the turmoil of two [[World war|World Wars]]. In 1915, Italy entered the [[World War I|First World War]] on the side of the [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], after extricating itself from its alliance with [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Veneto became a major battlefront. After the Italians suffered an enormous defeat at [[Kobarid|Caporetto]] in November 1917, the combined Austro-Hungarian and German forces advanced almost unhindered through Veneto towards Venice until reaching the [[Piave (river)|Piave]] River. The [[Battle of the Piave River]] prevented their troops from advancing further and was celebrated in [[La Leggenda del Piave]]. Between 24 October and 3 November 1918, Italy launched the decisive [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]]. The battle's outcome assured Italy's victory. The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] which ended warfare between [[Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in [[World War I]], was signed at [[Villa Giusti]] near Padua.

Between 1943 and 1945, Veneto belonged to the [[Italian Social Republic]], while the province of Belluno was part of the [[Prealpine Operations Zone]]. Many towns in the region were bombed by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] during the Second World War. The most hit were Treviso and Vicenza, as well as the industrial area around [[Marghera]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Veneto}}

Veneto is a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[representative democracy]]. The [[Government of Veneto|President of the Region]], colloquially nicknamed Governor or even ''Doge'' in remembrance of Venice's traditional head of state, is also the head of the [[Government of Veneto|Regional Government]]. [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is exerted by the [[Regional Council of Veneto|Regional Council]], the local parliament. The [[Statute of Veneto|Statute]] (i.e. the law establishing and regulating the regional institution, which was first promulgated on 22 May 1971), uses the term "people" for Venetians, but, like in the case of [[Sardinian people|Sardinians]], this is not a legal recognition of any differences from other Italian citizens. Moreover, the region is not granted a form of autonomy comparable to that of neighbouring [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/leggi/1971/71ls0340.html |title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Leggi Regionali |publisher=Consiglioveneto.it |access-date=2009-05-06}}</ref> This is the reason why many municipalities have held referendums in order to be united to these regions.

Traditionally a very [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] region, Veneto was once the heartland of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], which won a record 60.5% of the vote in the [[Italian general election, 1948 (Veneto)|1948 general election]], polled above 50% in each and every general and regional election until 1983 and governed the region since its establishment in 1970 to 1994. After that, Veneto has been a stronghold of the [[centre-right]] coalition, which has governed the region since 1995, first under President [[Giancarlo Galan]] ([[Forza Italia]]/[[The People of Freedom]]) and, since 2010, [[Luca Zaia]] ([[Liga Veneta]]–[[Lega Nord]]). In the [[2020 Venetian regional election|2020 regional election]] Liga Veneta–Lega Nord won a combined 61.5% of the vote (sum of party list and Zaia's personal list), followed by the three main Italian parties of the time, the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (11.9%), the [[Brothers of Italy]] (9.6%) and [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] (3.6%).

According to [[Robert D. Putnam]], the "institutional performance" of Veneto's regional government is higher than average in Italy and Veneto belongs to the "civic North".<ref>Putnam, R. D. ''[[Making Democracy Work|Making Democracy Work. Civic traditions in modern Italy]]''. Princeton, NJ: [[Princeton University Press]], 1993.</ref>

===Venetian nationalism===
[[Venetian nationalism]] is a regionalist/nationalist [[political movement]] which gained prominence in Veneto during the 1970s and 1980s, demanding more autonomy, a [[Autonomous regions with special statute|special statute]] or even independence, and promoting Venetian culture, [[Venetian language|language]] and history. This is the political background in which the [[Liga Veneta]] was launched in 1980. Other regionalist/nationalist groupings, including [[Liga Veneta Repubblica]], [[North-East Project]] and the avowed separatist [[Veneto State]], [[Venetian Independence]] and ''[[Plebiscito.eu]]'', emerged but they have never touched the popularity of Liga Veneta, which was a founding member of [[Lega Nord]] in 1991.

Venetian Independence and other alike groups have been long proposing a referendum on the independence of Veneto from [[Italy]]. After the [[Regional Council of Veneto|Regional Council]] approved a resolution on self-determination (with an explicit reference to a referendum) in November 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?p=84&n=81&c=5&e=91&t=0&idEvento=4466|title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Sala stampa|website=consiglioveneto.it}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/attisp/RIS/Anno_2012/RIS_0044/testo_presentato.html|title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Progetti di legge e proposte|website=consiglioveneto.it}}</ref> a referendum bill was proposed in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/pageContainer.jsp?n=80&p=84&c=5&e=88&t=0&idNotizia=23517|title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Sala stampa|website=consiglioveneto.it}}</ref>

== Administrative divisions ==

[[File:Provinces of Veneto map.png|thumb|350px|Veneto's provinces.]]

Veneto is divided into the [[Metropolitan City of Venice]] and 6 provinces and also divided in 581 municipalities.<ref name=vennum/><ref name=tav0ZN1_2007/> Of the seven provinces of the region, the [[Province of Padua]] is the most populous and has the greatest density, with 424. 81 persons per km<sup>2</sup>, reaching 2268. 58 in the city of [[Padua]].

The region has about 4.8 million inhabitants, ranking Veneto as the fifth most populated region in Italy. Veneto has one of the highest [[population density|population densities]] among the Italian regions (265 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> in 2008). This is particularly true in the provinces of [[Padua]], [[Venice]] and [[Treviso]], where the inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> are above 300. [[Belluno]] is the least densely populated province, with 57 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.

Like the other regions of [[Northern Italy]] and [[Central Italy]], though with a certain time lag, Veneto has been experiencing a phase of very slow population growth caused by the dramatic fall in fertility. The overall population has so far been increasing – though only slightly – due to the net immigration started at the end of the 1980s, after more than 20 years of massive exodus from the poorer areas of the region.

Nearly 3 million Venetians were forced to leave their country between 1861 and 1961 to escape poverty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucemi.it/Notizie/Emigrazione_veneta_041007.pdf |title={{title case|L'EMIGRAZIONE VENETA NEL RAPPORTO 2007 DELLA MIGRANTES PRESENTATO OGGI A VENEZIA}} |publisher=Editrice SOGEDI s.r.l. – Reg. Trib. Roma n°15771/75 |access-date=2010-01-25}}</ref> Many emigrated to [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. After [[World War II]], they moved to other European countries. In 2008, there were 260,849 Venetian citizens living outside of Italy (5.4% of the region's population), the largest number was found in Brazil, with 57,052 Venetians, followed by [[Switzerland]], with 38,320, and [[Argentina]], with 31,823. There are several million people of Venetian descent around the world, particularly in Brazil, in the states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. Local names in [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] such as Nova Schio, [[Nova Bassano]], [[Nova Bréscia]], Nova Treviso, [[Nova Veneza, Santa Catarina|Nova Veneza]], Nova Pádua and Monteberico indicate the Venetian origin of their inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiannetwork.it/news.aspx?ln=it&id=4697 |title={{title case|ITALIANI ALL'ESTERO – PROGETTO "STORIE DI GENTE VENETA NEL MONDO".

Due to the impressive [[economic growth]] of the last two decades, Veneto has turned into a land of immigration and has been attracting more and more immigrants since the 1990s. In 2008, the Italian [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|national institute of statistics]] ISTAT estimated that 403,985 foreign-born immigrants live in Veneto, equal to 8.3% of the total regional population.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vincenzo Patruno |author2=Marina Venturi |author3=Silvestro Roberto |url=http://demo.istat.it/ |title=Demo-Geodemo. – Mappe, Popolazione, Statistiche Demografiche dell'ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |access-date=2009-05-06}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:Venedig Basilika.jpg|thumb|[[St Mark's Basilica]], the seat of the [[Patriarch of Venice]].]]
Veneto converted to [[Christianity]] during Roman rule. The region venerates as its patrons the 2nd-century bishop [[Hermagoras of Aquileia|St. Hermagoras]] and his deacon St. Fortunatus, both of Aquileia and both martyrs. [[Aquileia]] became the metropolitan see of Venetia. Aquileia had its own [[Christian liturgy|liturgical rites]] which were used throughout the dioceses of Veneto until the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]] when the [[Roman Rite]] replaced the [[Aquileian Rite]]. By the 6th century the [[bishop of Aquileia]] claimed the title of [[patriarch]]. Rejection of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553) led to a [[Schism of the Three Chapters|schism]] wherein the bishops of [[Aquileia]], [[Liguria]], [[Aemilia (Roman province)|Aemilia]], [[Milan]] and of the [[Istrian]] peninsula all refused to condemn [[Three-Chapter Controversy|the Three Chapters]] leading to the churches of Veneto to break communion with the [[Catholic Church|Church of Rome]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Councils of Aquileia}}</ref> The invasion of the non-Catholic Lombards in 568 only served to prolong the schism until 606 and then finally 699 when the [[Carmen de synodo ticinensi|Synod of Pavia]] definitively ended the schism.<ref>Nicholas Everett (2003), ''Literacy in Lombard Italy, c. 568–774'' (Cambridge), 286.</ref>

In 2004, over 95% of the population claimed to be [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. The region of Veneto along with the regions of Friuli and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol form the ecclesiastical region of Triveneto under the [[Patriarch of Venice|Patriarchate of Venice]]. The Patriarchate of Venice is an archdiocese and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan see]] of an ecclesiastical region which includes suffragan episcopal sees of Adria-Rovigo, Belluno-Feltre, Chioggia, Concordia-Pordenone, Padua, Treviso, Verona, Vicenza, and [[Vittorio Veneto]].<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|country|r15it|Triveneto Region|21 January 2015}}</ref>

The [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of Venice was elevated to an honorary [[Patriarchate]] by the pope on 8 October 1457 when the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], a successor to the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (Episcopal)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]], was suppressed. The first patriarch of Venice was St. [[Lorenzo Giustiniani|Laurence]], a nobleman of the Giustiniani family.

During the 20th century the patriarchs were usually appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and three cardinal patriarchs, [[Pope Pius X|Giuseppe Sarto]], [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]], and [[Pope John Paul I|Albino Luciani]], were elected pope: Pius X, John XXIII, and John Paul I, respectively. The [[Patriarch of Venice|Patriarchate of Venice]] claims [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] the Evangelist as its patron. The same saint, symbolised by a winged lion, had become the typical symbol of the Venetian Republic and is still represented on many civic symbols.

==Economy==
Under Austrian rule, Veneto's agriculturally based economy suffered, which later led to mass emigration. But, since the 1970s it has seen impressive development, thanks to the so-called "Veneto development model" that is characterised by strong [[export-oriented]] entrepreneurship in traditional [[economy|economic sectors]] (€64.47 billion of exports in 2019 <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nordesteconomia.gelocal.it/economia/2020/03/11/news/export-nordest-locomotiva-chiude-il-2019-a-2-3-1.38772302|title=Export, Nordest locomotiva chiude il 2019 a +2,3%|date=11 March 2020|website=Nord Est Economia|access-date=30 May 2020}}</ref>) and close social cohesion<ref>{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_geo.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805181218/http://www.circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_geo.htm |archive-date=2007-08-05 }}</ref> – making it actually the third richest region in terms of total GDP (€166.4 billion) after [[Lombardy]] and [[Lazio]].<ref>Eurostat [[Press release|News Release]] 19/2008: Regional GDP per inhabitant in [[European Union|the EU]] 2/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eds-destatis.de/de/press/download/08_02/019-2008-02-12.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – 19-2008 – de – ins.doc |access-date=2009-07-08}}</ref>

Geography and historical events have determined the present social and economic structure of the region, centred on a broad belt running from east to west. The plain and the Alpine foothills are the most developed areas in contrast to the [[Po (river)|Po delta]] and the mountainous areas, with the exception of the surroundings of [[Belluno]]. This is why the [[Alps]] and the province of [[Rovigo]] are suffering more than other areas, from a trend of declining and [[population ageing|ageing population]].

===Agriculture===
Though its importance has been decreasing for the past 20–30 years, agriculture continues to play a significant role in the regional economy. The [[agriculture|agricultural sector]] of Veneto is among the most productive in Italy. However, it is still characterised by an intensive use of labour rather than capital, due to the specialisation in [[market gardening]], fruit-growing and vine-growing throughout the plain and the foothills, requiring very much handicraft. In the south and in the extreme east of the region, [[Cereal|grain crops]] are more common and land holdings are larger than in the rest of the region; mechanisation is more advanced here. The cattle stock, although declining, still represented 15% of the national stock.<ref name="regportraits1">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526183748/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd3_eco.htm |archive-date=2013-05-26 }}</ref> [[Fishing]] is also still important in coastal areas.

The main agricultural products include [[maize]], [[pea|green peas]], vegetables, apples, cherries, [[sugar beet]]s, forage, tobacco, hemp. Moreover, Veneto is one of Italy's most important wine-growing areas, producing [[Venetian wine|wines]], such as [[Prosecco]], [[Valpolicella]], and [[Soave (wine)|Soave]]. Overall, Veneto produces more bottles of [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC wine]] than any other area in Italy. The [[Amarone della Valpolicella]], a wine from the hills around Verona, is made with high-selected grapes and is among the more expensive red wines in the world.

===Industry===
In the last 30–40 years industrialisation transformed the appearance of the landscape, especially in the plains.

The regional [[Manufacturing|industry]] is especially made of small and medium-sized businesses, which are active in several sectors: food products, wood and furniture, leather and footwear, textiles and clothing, gold jewelry, but also chemistry, metal-mechanics and electronics. This has led to the establishment of a strongly export-orientated system of industries.

Typical of Veneto is the partition of the territory into industrial districts, which means that each area tends to specialise in a specific sector. The province of Venice hosts large metallurgical and chemical plants in [[Marghera]] and [[Mestre]], but is also specialised in glass handicraft ([[Murano]]).
The province of Belluno hosts the so-called eyeglasses district, being the largest world manufacturer [[Luxottica]] a firm domiciled at Agordo. Other important firms are [[Safilo]], De Rigo, Marcolin.

[[Fashion|Fashion industry]] is extremely strong all over the region: [[Benetton Group|Benetton]], [[Bottega Veneta]], [[Geox]], [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]], [[Calzedonia]], [[Pal Zileri]], [[Dainese]], [[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]], [[Marzotto]] are all Venetian brands.

During the last 20 years, a large number of Venetian companies relocated their plants (especially the most dangerous and polluting productions) in [[Eastern Europe]], especially [[Romania]]. The Romanian city of [[Timișoara]] is also called "the newest Venetian province".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/febbraio/01/Timisoara_nuova_provincia_industriale_veneta_co_0_0102011149.shtml |title=Timişoara, la nuova provincia industriale veneta |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2007-01-02 |access-date=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206115743/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/febbraio/01/Timisoara_nuova_provincia_industriale_veneta_co_0_0102011149.shtml |archive-date=6 December 2008 }}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:Punta San Vigilio.jpg|thumb|The Punta San Vigilio on the [[Lake Garda]]]]
Although being a heavily industrialised region, tourism is one of its main economic resources; one-fifth of Italy's foreign tourism gravitates towards Veneto, which is the first region in Italy in terms of tourist presence, attracting over 60 million visitors every year, second after [[Emilia-Romagna]] in terms of hotel industry structures; the business volume of tourism in Veneto is estimated to be in the vicinity of 12 billion Euros.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regione.veneto.it/Notizie/Comunicati+Stampa/Febbraio+2008/294.htm |title=Comunicato Nr 294 – Sito Ufficiale della Regione Veneto |publisher=Regione.veneto.it |date=2008-02-22 |access-date=2009-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501191954/http://www.regione.veneto.it/Notizie/Comunicati+Stampa/Febbraio+2008/294.htm |archive-date=1 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Art and architecture===
[[File:Detail of Jesus and Judas by Giotto.jpg|thumb|300px|''Kiss of Judas'' by [[Giotto]], in Padua.]]

The Middle Ages stimulated the creation of monumental works such as the complex of churches on the island of [[Torcello]], in the Venetian lagoon, with the [[Torcello Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta]] founded in 639, its bell tower erected in the 11th century and the adjacent ''Martyrium of Santa Fosca'' built around the 1100, notable for the mosaics.
They saw the construction of the [[Basilica di San Zeno|Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore]] in [[Verona]], which was Veneto's main centre for that esthetic movement and we note, by the mixture of styles that Verona was an important crossroads to the north of [[Europe]].
Examples of [[Gothic art]], in addition to the Venetian church of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] and that of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, are the [[Scaliger Tombs]] in the historical centre of [[Verona]].

While in Veneto [[Byzantine Art|Byzantine art]] was important, an element of innovation was brought to Padua by [[Giotto]], bearer of a new pictorial tradition: that of Tuscany. Towards the 1302 he was commissioned by [[Enrico Scrovegni]] to paint the family chapel, now known just by the name of [[Scrovegni Chapel]], one of the most important artistic monuments of [[Padua]] and Veneto. The influences of the contribution of Giotto were felt immediately, as in the frescoes of [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]] in the [[Baptistry]] near the [[Cathedral of Padua]] and those of [[Altichiero]] in the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua|Basilica of Saint Anthony]].

[[File:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|thumb |[[Giorgione]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]''.]]

After a phase of development of [[Gothic art]], with the creation of important works including the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]], and the churches of [[Frari|Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] and of [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Saints John and Paul]] in Venice, the influence of the [[Renaissance]] ushered in a new era. In addition to [[Donatello]], an important Venetian Renaissance artist was [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431–1506), whose most important work in Veneto is perhaps the ''[[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]]'', found in Verona. With the mainland expansion of the Venetian Republic and the consolidation of its institutions, there was also an artistic development of exceptional stature: Mantegna, [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Bellini (painter)|Giovanni Bellini]], [[Cima da Conegliano]], [[Pordenone]] laid the foundations for what would be the age of Venetian painting.

[[Padua]] was a cradle of the Venetian Renaissance, Where influences from [[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]] filtered north. Amongst the Renaissance artists who worked there were [[Donatello]], who worked on an altar of the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony]], and [[Pisanello]], whose works are mainly in [[Verona]], for example, the fresco of [[Saint George]] in the [[Church of St. Anastasia]].

[[File:Padua 2.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Prato della Valle]] in Padua, a work of [[Italian Renaissance]] architecture.]]
In the first phase with Carpaccio and Bellini, the influences of international painting were still evident and the references to [[Flemish art]] were numerous. Artists of the successive phase included [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] and [[Lorenzo Lotto]]. Giorgione and Titian developed an original and innovative style, which characterised the painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] rather than other traditions. Giorgione's enigmatic style infused his work with allegory, and he created his paintings with less reliance on a preparatory drawing than previous painters. This innovation was looking for the imitation of natural phenomena by creating atmospheres with the colours and shifting the emphasis from the pursuit of artistic perfection. ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The storm]]'' (1506–1508), now in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Accademia]] in Venice, is an example of this use of colour, where the mixture colour and texture continue indefinitely without preparatory drawing for the painting work gives a special atmosphere.

Titian, born in Belluno [[Pieve di Cadore]], brought forward the use of this technique without pictorial design, creating masterpieces such as the ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (1516–1518),<ref name="dteofmkng">{{cite web | url=http://www.fineartprintsondemand.com/artists/titian/assumption_of_the_virgin.htm | title=Date of Completion | access-date=2011-01-24}}</ref> an [[altar]] made by imposing visible sizes on the main altar of the Basilica of [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] in Venice, a work whose suggestion is due to the use of colour. At the end of his long life, he had acquired fame and commissions across the continent.

[[Tintoretto]] (1518–1594) recast Roman Mannerism in a Venetian style, less linear, and with more use of colour to distinguish forms, highlighting the bright prospects for its operations, giving unusual deformations of perspective, to increase the sense of tension in the work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuffi|first=Stefano|title=One Thousand Years of Painting|year=2004|publisher=Electa|location=Milan, Italy|page=427}}</ref> His studio was prolific. Palaces and churches of Venice abound with his paintings. The [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] alone sports 66 paintings by this painter. The [[Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore|San Giorgio Maggiore]] houses a huge canvas by him depicting the ''Last Supper''.

[[Paolo Veronese]] (1528–1588) was about as prolific as Tintoretto, with works that celebrated the Venetian state,<ref name="Rosand, 107">Rosand, 107</ref> as well as decorating houses of Venetian nobles. He decorated large portions of the [[Doge's Palace|Palazzo Ducale]] and the decoration of many villas [[Andrea Palladio|Palladian]], including [[Villa Barbaro]].

[[Jacopo Bassano]] (1517–1592) and [[Lorenzo Lotto]] were active in the mainland, and reflected some of the influences of [[Milan|Milanese painters]] with the introduction of images taken from real life, enriched by a touch of drama.

[[File:VillaCornaro 2007 07 14 front 1.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Cornaro]].]]
In architecture, [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), born in [[Padua]], completed some highly influential works, including [[Palladian Villas of Veneto|Villas]] in the mainland, in [[Province of Vicenza|Vicenza]], [[Province of Padua|Padua]] and [[Province of Treviso|Treviso]]. In Venice, he designed the [[Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore]], the [[Il Redentore]], and [[Zitelle]] on the island of [[Giudecca]]. Palladian Villa architecture, in masterpieces such as [[Villa Emo]], [[Villa Barbaro]], [[Villa Capra]], and [[Villa Foscari]], evoked the imagined grandeur of antique classical Roman villas. This aesthetic, through his publications, proved popular and underwent a revival in the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] period. In his villas, the owner shall permit the control over production activities of the surrounding countryside by structuring the functional parts, such as [[porch]], close to the central body. In the case of Villa Badoer, the open barn, formed by a large circular colonnade, enclosing the front yard in front of the villa allows you to create a space that recalls the ancient idea of the [[Forum Romanum]], and bringing all campaign activities to gravitate in front of the villa itself.

[[File:Psyche revived Louvre MR1777.jpg|thumb|''[[Antonio Canova]]'s [[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss|Psyche Revived by Love's Kiss]]''.]]

The research style of Palladio has created an architectural movement called [[Palladianism]], which has had strong following in the next three centuries, inspiring architects, some of them his direct students, including [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]], after the death of the teacher who completed several works, including the first [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]].

[[File:Venice 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Church of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] in Venice]]

The 18th-century [[Venetian School (art)|Venetian school]] comprises many artists. Important painters include [[Giambattista Tiepolo]], his son [[Giandomenico Tiepolo|Giandomenico]], [[Giambattista Piazzetta]], [[Niccolò Bambini]], [[Pietro Longhi]], [[Marco Ricci|Marco]] and [[Sebastiano Ricci]], [[Sebastiano Bombelli]], [[Gianantonio Fumiani]], [[Gaspare Diziani]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], and the architect/painter [[Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna]].

Sculptors include [[Gianmaria Morlaiter|Morlaiter]], [[Filippo Parodi]], [[Bernard Torretti]] and his nephew [[Giuseppe Torretti]], and at the end of the republic [[Antonio Canova]]. Some other important artists are the architects [[Girolamo Frigimelica]], [[Giorgio Massari]], [[Giovanni Antonio Scalfarotto|Scalfarotto]], and [[Tommaso Temanza]]; the carver [[Andrea Brustolon]]; playwrights [[Carlo Goldoni]] and [[Gaspare Gozzi]]; the poets [[Alessandro Labia]] and [[George Whisker]]; and composers [[Benedetto Marcello]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]].

[[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1696–1770), described as "the greatest decorative painter of eighteenth-century Europe, as well as its most able craftsman."{{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}} was a [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]], who together with [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Canaletto]], [[Giovan Battista Piazzetta]], [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] and [[Francesco Guardi]] formed the ultimate group of traditional great Venetian [[old master]] painters of that period. [[perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] played a central role in Tiepolo's representations, and was forced beyond the usual limits in his ceiling decorations depicting levitating figures viewed from below.

Another characteristic feature of Venetian art is [[landscape painting]], which sees in [[Giovanni Antonio Canal|Canaletto]] (1697–1768) and [[Francesco Guardi]] (1712–1793) the two leading figures. Canaletto's rigorous perspective studies make for an almost "photographic" reality, in contrast to Guardi's more subjective [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]].

[[Antonio Canova]] (1757–1822), born in [[Possagno]], was the greatest of the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] artists.<ref>"Neo-Classical", ''The Dictionary of Art'': volume XXII, ed. Jane Turner, in thirty-four volumes, 1996. Grove's Dictionaries Inc., New York, 1998. Print.</ref> The [[Tempio Canoviano|Temple of Possagno]], which he designed, financed, and partly-built himself,<ref>Jean Martineau & Andrew Robinson, ''The Glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century.'' Yale University Press, 1994. Print.</ref> is among landmarks of neo-classical architecture. His most important works include ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss|Psyche Revived by Love's Kiss]]'' and ''[[The Three Graces (sculpture)|The Three Graces]]''.

After the [[Republic of Venice#Fall|fall of the Republic of Venice in 1796]], every city in Veneto created its own form of art. Important was, however, the role of [[Accademia di Belle Arti (Venezia)|Accademia di Belle Arti in Venice]], who was able to attract many young artists from the surrounding territory.

Among the many artists which were important in modern ages were [[Guglielmo Ciardi]], who incorporated the experience of [[macchiaioli]] movement, uniting the typical colour of the classic Venetian school, and yet bringing out from his paintings a chromatic essence, [[Giacomo Favretto]], who too as Ciardi, enhanced the colour, which was sometimes very pronounced, painter [[Frederick Zandomeneghi]], who deviates from the tradition of Venetian colouring to venture in a style similar to French impressionism, and finally [[Luigi Nono (painter)|Luigi Nono]], whose works feel realistic, even if, in addition to painting genre scenes, includes portraits of finity for psychological enhancement.

===Education===
Veneto hosts one of the oldest universities in the world, the [[University of Padua]], founded in 1222. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] investigations<ref>Oecd-Pisa 2005, Il livello di competenza dei quindicenni italiani in matematica, lettura, scienze e problem solving – Prima sintesi dei risultati di Pisa 2003, pag.7, also available on [http://www.invalsi.it/ www.invalsi.it]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813045440/http://www.invalsi.it/ |date=2007-08-13 }}</ref> show that school education achievements in North-Eastern Italy (whose population comes mainly from Veneto) are the highest in Italy. In 2003 the university had approximately 65,000 students.

===Language===
{{Main|Venetian language}}
Most of the people of Veneto speak Italian along with widespread usage of local varieties of the Venetian language. Within Venetian there are distinct sub-groups centered on the major cities, and distinctions are also found between rural and urban  dialects and those spoken in northern mountainous areas and on the plain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Payne |first1=Elinor |title=Rises and rise-plateau-slumps in Trevigiano |journal=Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics |date=2005 |volume=2 |pages=173–86}}</ref>

Venetian dialects are classified as [[Western Romance languages|Western Romance]]. Linguists identify five major types of Venetian: an Eastern or Coastal (Venice) group, a Central (Padua, Vicenza, Polesine) group, a Western (Verona) group, a North-Central (Treviso) group, and a Northern (Belluno, Feltre, Agordo, Cadore, [[Zoldo Alto]]) group of dialects. All dialects are mutually intelligible to varying degrees, are descended from [[Vulgar Latin]] and influenced to varying degrees by the [[Italian language]]. Venetian is attested as a written language in the 13th century.

The language of Venice enjoyed substantial prestige in the days of the [[Venetian Republic]], when it attained the status of a [[lingua franca]] in the [[Mediterranean]]. Notable Venetian-language authors include the playwrights [[Carlo Goldoni]] (1707–1793) and [[Carlo Gozzi]] (1720–1806), while [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzante]] (1502–1542) is best known for his rustic comedies "cast in mainland peasant ''Pavan'' 'Paduan'".<ref>{{cite book |last=Tuttle |first=Edward F.|editor1-last=Maiden |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Parry |editor2-first=Mair |title=The Dialects of Italy|date=1997 |chapter=The Veneto|page=263|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York}}</ref>

[[Ladin language|Ladin]], also Romance, is spoken in parts of the [[province of Belluno]], especially in the municipalities of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]], while [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] (Germanic) is spoken in two villages (Roana and Giazza respectively) of the [[Seven Communities]] and the [[Thirteen Communities]]. These are two historical groups of villages of Cimbric origin, which for a long time formed two distinct "commonwealths" under the rule of the Republic of Venice, among others. Furthermore, in the area around [[Portogruaro]] people speak [[Friulian language|Furlan]].

As the region does not enjoy a special status of autonomy, [[minority language]]s are not granted any form of official recognition. A motion to recognise Venetian as an official [[regional language]] has been approved by the [[Regional Council of Veneto|regional Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consiglioveneto.it/crvportal/leggi/2007/07lr0008.html?numLegge=8&annoLegge=2007&tipoLegge=Alr |title=Consiglio Regionale Veneto – Leggi Regionali |publisher=Consiglioveneto.it |access-date=2009-05-06}}</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main|Venetian literature}}
[[Venetian literature]] is the corpus of [[literature]] in [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the [[vernacular]] language of the region which roughly corresponding to [[Venice]] from the 12th century. The Venetian literature, after an initial period of splendour in the 16th century with the success of artists such as [[Ruzante]], reaches its maximum zenith in the 18th century, thanks to its maximum exponent, dramatist [[Carlo Goldoni]]. Subsequently, the literary production in Venetian undergoes a period of decline following the [[Republic of Venice#Fall|collapse of the Republic of Venice]], succeeding anyway during the 20th century to reach peaks with wonderful lyrical poets such as [[Biagio Marin]] of Grado.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Venetian cuisine}}

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Veneto|Music of Venice}}
Veneto, and in particular [[Venice]] and [[Verona]], are important Italian musical centres, home to a vibrant musical life.

The city of Venice in Italy has played an important role in the development of the [[music of Italy]]. The Venetian state—i.e. the medieval Maritime Republic of Venice—was often popularly called the "Republic of Music", and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that "In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere."<ref>Touring Club p. 79</ref>

In [[Padova]], musical ensembles such as the ''Amici della Musica di Padova'', the ''Solisti Veneti'' and the Padova-Veneto Symphony are found. Concerts are often held in the historic [[Loggia Comaro]], built in 1524. As well, the city is the site of the Teatro delle Maddalene, the Teatro delle Grazie, the Giuseppe Verdi Theater, and the [[Cesare Pollini]] music conservatory.

[[Rovigo]] is the site of the [[Teatro Sociale]], built in 1819. In the 20th century it was the venue for the career beginnings of [[Tullio Serafin]], [[Beniamino Gigli]] and [[Renata Tebaldi]]. The town of Rovigo is also the site of the Francesco Vanezza music conservatory.

The city of [[Verona]] is the site of the Roman amphitheater known as the "Arena" which has been hosting musical events since the 16th century, but more recently the spectacular outdoor staging of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Aida]], an event staged for the first time in 1913. The city also has the Felice Evaristo Dall'Abaco music conservatory;

* '''[[Teatro La Fenice]]''' is the main opera house of [[Venice]]. Repeatedly destroyed by fire and later rebuilt, it is home to an important opera season and to the International Festival of contemporary music. Teatro La Fenice in Venice was designed in 1790 by [[Gian Antonio Selva]] for the society of the Venetian artistocracy, and the Venetian Theatre was built rapidly despite the many controversies about its location and its rational structure and neoclassical style.
* '''[[Teatro Malibran]]''' is a Venetian theatre. In the 17th and 18th centuries it bore the name of Theater St. John Chrysostom.
* '''[[Teatro Stabile del Veneto "Carlo Goldoni"]]''' corresponds to the ancient Teatro Vendramin, also known as San Salvador or San Luke, and was opened in 1622. The Teatro Carlo Goldoni is located in the vicinity of the [[Rialto bridge]], in the historical centre of [[Venice]]. It is a film set, with rooms structured in four tiers of boxes, stalls and galleries. With a total of 800 seats, the stage is off 12 Underground and 11.20 deep and is [[lattice foundation|framed]] in [[iron]]. The Teatro Goldoni season hosts Prose organised by the Teatro Stabile del Veneto "Carlo Goldoni", the review of Children's Theatre, opera, concerts, ballets and other events in the concession.
* '''[[Teatro Verdi (Padua)]]''' is the main theatre in [[Padua]]. Commissioned by a society formed specifically for the purpose of establishing a major theatre in the city, it was built by the Paduan architect [[Giovanni Gloria]] (c.1684–1753) to designs by [[Antonio Cugini]] (1677–1765), an architect from [[Reggio Emilia]]. It opened in 1751, and was known as the ''Teatro Nuovo'' until 1884. Substantial restoration work was carried out in 1847, 1884 and 1920. Currently the Teatro Verdi is the operational headquarters of the Teatro Stabile del Veneto.
* '''[[Teatro Olimpico]]''' is a theatre designed by the Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] in 1580 and located in [[Vicenza]]. It is generally considered the first example of a modern indoor theatre set. The realisation of the theatre, in a pre-existing medieval complex, was commissioned by the Olympic Palladio for the staging of classical plays. Its construction began in 1580 and was inaugurated on 3 March 1585, after the realisation of the stationery scenes of [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]. These wooden structures are the only of the Renaissance to be extant, however, they are still excellent condition. The theatre is still the seat of performances and concerts and has been included in 1994 in the list of World Heritage Sites' s [[UNESCO]], as other works by Palladio to [[Vicenza]].
* '''[[Philharmonic Theater (Verona)]]''' is the main opera house of [[Verona]]. It is owned by the [[Accademia Filarmonica di Verona]], since its foundation, but is used by the foundation of the Arena as the site of the opera season in winter.
*'''[[Teatro Filarmonico]]''', is main theatre in Verona, built in the XVIII century.
* '''[[Arena of Verona|Roman Theatre of Verona]]''' is Verona's main arena, located in the northern part of the city at the foot of Colle San Pietro. This [[theatre]] was built at the end of [[Before Christ|BC]], a period in which [[Verona]] has seen from the monumental St. Peter of the hill. Before, it was built between the Stone Bridge and Gates of the embankments, which were built on Tyrol parallel to the theatre itself, in order to defend against the possible flooding of river. It is considered the largest Roman theatre in the north of [[Italy]]. Today it is used for theatrical and operatic productions during the summer.

[[File:VillaPisani Bagnolo 2007 07 06 2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Villa Pisani (Bagnolo)]]]]
[[Vicenza]] and the [[Palladian Villas of Veneto]] are a number of [[Palladio|Palladian]] villas which are [[World Heritage Site]]s. UNESCO inscribed the site on the [[World Heritage List]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/712 |title=UNESCO World heritage site number 712 |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |access-date=2010-04-24}}</ref> At first the site was called "Vicenza, City of Palladio" and only buildings in the immediate area of [[Vicenza]] were included. Various types of buildings were represented including the [[Teatro Olimpico]], ''[[Palazzo|palazzi]]'' and a few [[villa]]s. Most of Palladio's surviving villas lay outside the site. However, in 1996 the number of [[Palladian]] villas included in the site was expanded to include those in other parts of Veneto. The site was given its present name.

The term villa was used to describe a country house. Often rich families in Veneto also had a house in town called a palazzo. In most cases the owners named their palazzi and villas with the family surname, hence there is both a [[Palazzo Chiericati]] in Vicenza and a [[Villa Chiericati]] in the countryside, similarly there is a [[Ca' Foscari|Palazzo Foscari]] in [[Venice]] and a [[Villa Foscari]] in the countryside. Somewhat confusingly there are multiple [[Villa Pisani|Villas Pisani]], including two by Palladio.

There are these sorts of villas all over the Venetian plain, but especially in the provinces of [[Treviso]], [[Padua]], [[Vicenza]] and [[Venice]]. The date of construction of these villas ranges from the 15th to the 19th century. There are approximately five thousand Ville Venete, of which 1,400 are declared of historical and monumental interest.

Apart from the numerous Palladian villas, of which 24 are protected by [[UNESCO]], there are many villas spread across Veneto, mainly from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Many of them are museums, public institutions or private residences.
The 24 Palladian villas which are part of [[UNESCO]]:
* [[Villa Almerico Capra]], also called "La Rotonda" ([[Vicenza]])
