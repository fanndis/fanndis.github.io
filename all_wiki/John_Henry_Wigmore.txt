'''John Henry Wigmore''' (1863–1943) was an American lawyer and [[Jurist|legal scholar]] known for his expertise in the [[law of evidence]] and for his influential scholarship.  Wigmore taught law at [[Keio University]] in [[Tokyo]] (1889–1892) before becoming the first full-time dean of [[Northwestern University Law School|Northwestern Law School]] (1901–1929).  His scholarship is best remembered for his ''Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law'' (1904), often simply called ''Wigmore on Evidence,'' and a graphical analysis method known as a [[Wigmore chart]].

==Personal life and education==
John Henry Wigmore was born in [[San Francisco]] on March 4, 1863.  His parents were John and Harriet Joyner Wigmore. He was named after his father, a self-made lumberyard owner.  He was the second-oldest child of thirteen.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Porwancher|first=Andrew|url=|title=John Henry Wigmore and the Rules of Evidence: The Hidden Origins of Modern Law|date=2016|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8262-7363-5|location=|pages=|language=English}}</ref>

Wigmore attended [[Harvard University]] and earned the degrees [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] in 1883 and [[Master of Arts|AM]] in 1884.  Following his undergraduate work, he returned to San Francisco briefly, but then moved back to Cambridge to attend Harvard Law School where he received his [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] in 1887.<ref name=":0" />  While at Harvard, Wigmore was a member of the first ever editorial board of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swygert|first=Michael|last2=Bruce|first2=Jon|date=1985-01-01|title=The Historical Origins, Founding, and Early Development of Student-Edited Law Reviews|url=https://repository.uchastings.edu/hastings_law_journal/vol36/iss5/2|journal=Hastings Law Journal|volume=36|issue=5|pages=739|issn=0017-8322}}</ref> 

Following law school, Wigmore's parents expected him to return to San Francisco to run the family business.  Wigmore instead elected to stay in Boston, causing a rift to develop between himself and his parents.  Wigmore married Emma Hunt Vogl (b. July 26, 1860, d. 1943) of Cambridge,<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Guide to the John Henry Wigmore (1863-1943) Papers 1868/1999|url=http://uncap.lib.uchicago.edu/view.php?eadid=inu-ead-nua-archon-1119|last=|first=|date=|website=Northwestern University Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> whom he had met during Law School, in September 1889.  His parents did not attend the wedding.<ref name=":1" />  The couple departed for Tokyo just three days after their wedding.<ref name=":0" />

==Career==
Following his graduation from Harvard, Wigmore practiced law in [[Boston]].  While in practice, he served as a "long-distance clerk" for New Hampshire Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Doe and was mentored by future US Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis]].<ref name=":0" />  During this time he also published papers regarding [[election law reform]] issues including the [[Secret ballot|secret voting method]] (also known as the Australian Ballot<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fortier|first=John|last2=Ornstein|first2=Norman|date=2003-04-01|title=The Absentee Ballot and the Secret Ballot: Challenges for Election Reform|url=https://repository.law.umich.edu/mjlr/vol36/iss3/2|journal=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|volume=36|issue=3|pages=483–516|issn=0363-602X}}</ref>), and fair [[ballot access]] laws.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wigmore|first=John H.|date=1889|title=Ballot Reform: Its Constitutionality|journal=American Law Review|volume=23|pages=719}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Wigmore|first=John Henry|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2422918|title=The Australian ballot system as embodied in the legislation of various countries|date=1889|publisher=C.

=== Keio University and comparative law ===
In 1889, Wigmore was recruited as a [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|foreign advisor]] to [[Meiji period]] [[Empire of Japan]], and was assigned to teach law at [[Keio University]] in [[Tokyo]].  Wigmore was the only full-time professor at the University at the time and was "instrumental" in designing the law curriculum.<ref name=":1" />  He served at Keio University until 1892.  

Once he arrived in Tokyo he "came under the spell of what is called [[Comparative law|Comparative Law]]",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roalfe|first=William R.|date=September 1962|title=John Henry Wigmore--Scholar and Reformer|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol53/iss3/|journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|volume=53|issue=3|pages=288|doi=10.2307/1141464|jstor=1141464|access-date=|via=|website=}}</ref> although his interest pre-dated his experiences in Japan.{{Sfn|Roalfe|1962|p=297}} A key legacy of his time in Japan was a detailed study of the laws of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Edo period]] Japan, which he edited and published as a series of papers while at Keio University.  The collection of papers grew to 15 volumes under the collected title of ''Materials for the Study of Private Law in Old Japan'' before its completion in the mid-1930s.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1935/06/23/archives/edits-japanese-law-data-prof-wigmore-completing-work-on-records-of.html?sq=keio%2520university&scp=25&st=cse "Edits Japanese Law Data; Prof. Wigmore Completing Work on Records of 1600–1860,"] ''New York Times. June 23, 1935.''</ref>

Wigmore maintained his interest in comparative law for the rest of his life,<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Henry Wigmore|url=https://law.jrank.org/pages/11311/Wigmore-John-Henry.html|last=|first=|date=|website=law.jrank.org|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> becoming a prominent writer in the field and has been referred to as the "father of American comparative law",<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Riles|first=Annelise|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Rethinking_the_Masters_of_Comparative_La.html?id=Ks5It0NEVHUC&source=kp_book_description|title=Rethinking the Masters of Comparative Law|date=2001-10-09|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=|isbn=978-1-84113-289-1|editor-last=Riles|editor-first=Annelise|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Encountering Amateurism: John Henry Wigmore and the Uses of American Formalism}}</ref> although some critics found his work "imaginary" and "needlessly uncritical".{{Sfn|Roalfe|1962|p=289}}  Despite his prominence, he is remembered more for popularizing the field of comparative law than for his scholarly contributions to it.<ref name=":3" />  His continuing fascination with similarities between legal systems around the world is evident in a 1932 article: "The legal profession throughout the world has the strongest ties that ought to bind, - ties of sentiment, ties of public duty, ties of common experience in human nature."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wigmore|first=John H.|date=1932|title=Should the World's Legal Profession Organize - Reasons for Taking This Step - Outline of Plan for Consideration|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/abaj18&id=578&div=&collection=|journal=American Bar Association Journal|volume=18|pages=552}}</ref>

He was also a manager of the 1907-founded [[Comparative Law Bureau]] of the [[American Bar Association]], whose ''[[Annual Bulletin (CLB)|Annual Bulletin]]'' was the first [[comparative law]] journal in the United States.  

===Northwestern University Law School===
Wigmore accepted a teaching post at [[Northwestern University]] and returned to the United States in 1893.  He taught torts, comparative law, and evidence.<ref name=":0">{{Cite encyclopedia|title=John Henry Wigmore|date=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300113006|editor-last=Newman|editor-first=Roger K.|last=Friedman|first=Richard D.|pages=587-589|encyclopedia=The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law}}</ref> He became the first full-time dean of [[Northwestern University Law School|Northwestern Law School]] in 1901.  In 1906, Wigmore helped establish the ''[[Northwestern University Law Review]]'', which was a faculty-run publication in the early days.{{Sfn|Swygert|Bruce|1985|p=785}}

During his career at Northwestern, Wigmore "transformed a relatively modest institution into one of the leading law schools in the United States."<ref name=":7" /> As a result of his successes, he was actively recruited by rival institutions including Yale and Columbia.  Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to Northwestern.{{Sfn|Porwancher|2016|p=25}}

In 1926, a 37-note carillon was commissioned and installed at the Law School.  Now known as the "Wigmore Chimes," the carillon plays the "Counselor's Chorus,"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Counselor's Chorus - sheet music|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/history/documents/1926_Counselors_Chorus.pdf|last=Wigmore|first=John H.|date=|website=Northwestern Law Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a song written by Wigmore for the Law School.<ref name=":8" />

Wigmore served as Dean of Northwestern Law until 1929.  Following his deanship, he remained a professor at the Law School taking emeritus status in 1934.  He continued his work at Northwestern until his death on April 20, 1943<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|title=History|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/about/history/|last=|first=|date=|website=Northwestern Law School|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in a "freakish" taxi accident.<ref name=":0" />  His widow, Emma, died just four months later.<ref name=":2" />

Wigmore continues to be honored by the University: he is the namesake of a prominent alumni club<ref>{{Cite web|title=John Henry Wigmore Club|url=https://law.alumni.northwestern.edu/s/1479/04-law/law/index2.aspx?sid=1479&gid=4&pgid=473|last=|first=|date=|website=Northwestern Alumni & Friends|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and the annual student-run "Law School musical" is called the Wigmore Follies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Student Organizations|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/law-school-life/studentorganizations/|last=|first=|date=|website=Northwestern Law School|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Military service ==
In 1915, General Enoch Crowder, the Judge Advocate General of the Army, asked Wigmore to become a reserve officer.  Following the United States’ declaration of war on Germany, Wigmore was activated to duty as a major serving with the Judge Advocate General's Office in Washington DC.{{Sfn|Porwancher|2016|p=26}}  By 1918 he was promoted colonel.  His wartime duties included advising the War Department on labor law, liability for patent infringements on German pharmaceuticals, and the law of war.  He also had a significant role in the drafting of the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the Espionage Act,  At the conclusion of the war, he sided with Crowder over General Samuel Ansell who insisted that courts-martial were in need of reform.<ref>Joshua E. Kastenberg, To Raise and Discipline an Army:  Major General Enoch Crowder, the Judge Advocate General's Office, and the Realignment of Civil and Military Relations in World War I(DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2017), 80–114</ref>

Wigmore's legacy is made apparent in a 1917 U.S. Army Military Law manual which credits the chapters on 'Evidence' to "the assistance of Prof. Wigmore of Northwestern University, recently commissioned a major and judge advocate in the Officers' Reserve Corps."<ref>{{Cite book|last=WAR DEPARTMENT, Office of the Judge Advocate General.|first=|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/manual-1917.pdf|title=A MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL COURTS OF INQUIRY AND OF OTHER PROCEDURE UNDER MILITARY LAW|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=April 15, 1917|isbn=|location=Washington|page=XIV|pages=|format=pdf}}</ref>

Following his military service, Wigmore's preferred mode of address became "Colonel" and remained so for the rest of his life.{{Sfn|Porwancher|2016|p=26}}

== Writings and scholarship ==
Wigmore's high productivity as a writer was noted by his contemporaries.<ref name=":5" />  In examining his life's work, one biographer calculated that "[t]he sheer magnitude of [his] achievement is [...] more than 18 feet of shelf space or an entire section of standard library shelving."{{Sfn|Roalfe|1962|p=291}} consisting of over 900 books and other works.<ref name=":6" />  In 1943, the Association of American Law Schools claimed "no great law writer or even any great novelist, such as Scott or Dumas, ... appears to match Dean Wigmore in the volume of published achievement."{{Sfn|Roalfe|1962|p=291}}

==={{Anchor|Treatise}}''Wigmore on Evidence''===
In 1904 Wigmore began publication of his most famous work, a [[treatise]] that would serve as an encyclopedic survey of the development of the law of evidence.
