==History==

===James Kent and the early study of law at Columbia University===

[[File:James Kent by Peale.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Kent]]]]

The teaching of law at Columbia reaches back to the 18th century. Graduates of the university's colonial predecessor, King's College, included such notable early American judicial figures as [[John Jay]], who would later become the first [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] of the United States. Columbia College appointed its first professor of law, [[James Kent]], in 1793. The lectures of Chancellor Kent in the course of four years had developed into the first two volumes of his Commentaries, the second volume being published November 1827. Kent did not, however, succeed in establishing a law school or department in the College. Thus, the formal instruction of law as a course of study did not commence until the middle of the 19th century.<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889">Theodore W. Dwight, "Columbia College Law School, New York," 1 Green Bag 141 (1889)</ref>

===Theodore Dwight and the founding of the law school===

The Columbia College Law School, as it was then officially called, was founded in 1858.<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889"/>  The first law school building was a [[Gothic Revival]] structure located on Columbia's [[Madison Avenue]] campus. Thereafter, the college became Columbia University and moved north to the neighborhood of [[Morningside Heights]]. As Columbia Law Professor [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]] observed, at its founding the demand for a formal course of study in law was still speculative:

<blockquote>It was considered at that time mainly as an experiment. No institution resembling a law school had ever existed in New York. Most of the leading lawyers had obtained their training in offices or by private reading, and were highly skeptical as to the possibility of securing competent legal knowledge by means of professional schools. Legal education was, however, at a very low ebb. The clerks in the law offices were left almost wholly to themselves. Frequently they were not even acquainted with the lawyers with whom, by a convenient fiction, they were supposed to be studying. Examinations for admission to the bar were held by committees appointed by the courts, who, where they inquired at all, sought for the most part to ascertain the knowledge of the candidate of petty details of practice. In general, the examinations were purely perfunctory. A politician of influence was not readily turned away. Few studied law as a science; many followed it as a trade or as a convenient ladder whereby to rise in a political career."<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889"/></blockquote>

[[File:Columbia law madison.gif|thumb|The Gothic Revival Law Library on Columbia's Madison Avenue Campus]]

Indeed, Columbia Law School was one of the few law schools established in the United States before the [[Civil war|Civil War]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries, most legal education took place in law offices, where young men, serving as apprentices or clerks, were set to copying documents and filling out legal forms under the supervision of an established attorney. For example, in New York John Jay, revolutionary founding father and first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, read law with Benjamin Kissam, whose busy practice kept his clerks occupied in transcribing records, pleadings, and opinions. Jay was fortunate to have attentive supervision because the quality and time of learning the law varied greatly within the profession. Theodore Dwight, who had been head of the law department of [[Hamilton College]] in Clinton, New York, believed formal legal education, conducted in the classroom with regular lectures, was far superior to casual law office instruction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.law.columbia.edu/EarlyHistoryColumbiaLaw/index.html |title=Early History of Columbia College Law School |publisher=Library.law.columbia.edu |access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref>

At its founding, four distinct courses of lectures of this class were then established: one on [[Philology]], offered by distinguished scholar and statesman, [[George Perkins Marsh|George P. Marsh]]; a second by Dr. Francis Lieber, a standard writer upon topics of political science and of international law, then a professor at Columbia College; a third course on [[Ethics]], by Professor Nairne, also of the College; and a fourth on Municipal Law, by Theodore W. Dwight, then Professor of Law in Hamilton College, New York, which at the time already had a flourishing law school.<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889"/>  The original course of study to obtain a degree consisted of just two years, rather than the modern standard of three.<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889"/> The first lecture in the law school was delivered on Monday, November 1, 1858, by Mr. Dwight, at the rooms of the Historical Society. It was an introductory lecture, afterwards printed. The audience consisted mainly of lawyers. It was plain that many of them could be counted upon as friends of a system of legal education. The result was an immediate attendance of 35 students, who showed their intention of pursuing a regular course of study by at once paying a tuition fee for instruction throughout the year. Such assurances were given of a future increase of numbers that it was determined to divide each class at the beginning of the coming year into two sections, for their convenience. The next year, the number of students was 62; in the third year, there were 103. Many of these early students were members of the bar.<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889"/> In 1860, in order to stimulate excellence in attainments of the students, a series of annual prizes was established, commencing with $250, and diminishing regularly by $50, until the sum of $100 was reached. These were adjudicated by leading members of the bar upon the combined merits of written answers to printed questions, and of essays upon topics selected by the instructors. None could compete for the prizes except those who had fully completed the two years' course. The questions covered the range of studies for the whole course. Stringent rules were adopted in reference to the answers, so as to secure the absolute fidelity of the candidates in their work.<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889"/>

===The Dwight Method===

Professor Dwight believed a course of legal study should focus on the application of basic legal principles, as learned through the study of legal treatises, coupled with frequent [[moot court]]s which would permit students to demonstrate their proficiency in applying those principles to new legal problems.<ref name="library.law.columbia.edu">http://library.law.columbia.edu/EarlyHistoryColumbiaLaw/articles/15AmLaw419-422.pdf</ref>  In this way, Dwight's method of teaching diverged significantly from the "case method" which had then been popularized by Dean Langdell of the [[Harvard Law School]] which focused on the study of individual cases and the use of inductive reasoning to distill governing legal principles from those case with little time spent on the practical application of those principles.<ref name="library.law.columbia.edu"/>

[[File:Theodore W. Dwight cph.3b29639.jpg|thumb]]

Dwight believed that his method was superior to the case method because it helped to create trained legal practitioners ready to enter the profession rather than academics more suited to teaching.<ref name="library.law.columbia.edu"/> In support of his position, Dwight cited the example of legal study throughout the Western World since the Roman empire: "It is not out of place in this connection to refer to the chosen methods of acquiring the Roman law, both as sanctioned by great jurists and by imperial authority, after an experience continuing through centuries . . .The Roman jurists had "cases" to deal with, precisely as we do. They were not mere legal philosophers, but disposed of practical and "burning" questions of their time. They were, however, in the habit of referring back to a legal principle in disposing of a concrete case, and believed that great principles could be so stated as to win the attention of students and give them a solid basis for future detailed acquisitions.".<ref name="Theodore W. Dwight 1889"/>

By the late 19th century, Dwight's method gave way to the case method which by the turn of the 20th century had become the standard curriculum at all of the other premier American law schools at Harvard, [[Yale University|Yale]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name="library.law.columbia.edu"/> In 1891, in response to Columbia's adoption of the case method, Dwight and a number of other professors left the law school to found [[New York Law School]] in Manhattan's [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===Columbia Law in the 20th century===

After Dwight's departure, William Albert Keener of [[Harvard Law School]] became dean of the law school from 1891 to 1901 when he was succeeded by George Washington Kirchwey. Future Supreme Court Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] graduated from the law school in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ag/aghistpage.php?id=51 |title=USDOJ: About DOJ: Attorneys General of the United States 1789 โ Present: Harlan Fiske Stone |publisher=Justice.gov |access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> While practicing law in New York, he began lecturing at Columbia Law School in 1899 and joined the faculty as a full professor. He subsequently became dean of the law school in 1910 and held the position until 1923 when he left to join [[Sullivan and Cromwell]] as a partner. Stone became Attorney General of the United States in 1924 and held that Office for almost a year before joining the Supreme Court of the United States as an associate justice.

In the 1920s and 30s, the law school soon became known for the development of the [[legal realism]] movement. Among the major realists affiliated with Columbia Law School were [[Karl Llewellyn]], [[Felix S. Cohen]] and [[William O. Douglas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/jd_applicants/aboutcls/ourhistory/beginnings |title=The History &#124; J.D.

In September 1988, Columbia Law School founded the first AIDS Law Clinic in the country, taught by Professor Deborah Greenberg and [[Mark Barnes]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Constance L. |last=Hays |title=Students Protest Possible Closing Of Legal Clinic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/nyregion/students-protest-possible-closing-of-legal-clinic.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 16, 1989 }}</ref>

In addition, the Columbia Business and Law Association (CBLA), the law school's principal student group dedicated to the interaction between law and business, routinely sponsors lectures, workshops, and networking events from traditional areas of interest such as investment banking, management consulting, venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, and entrepreneurship. CBLA also serves as a center for members of the Columbia Law School community interested in many aspects of business law, including corporate governance and securities regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/cbla/index.php |title=Columbia Business and Law Association - Home |publisher=.law.columbia.edu |access-date=2013-11-14}}</ref> 

==Facilities==

Columbia Law School's main building, [[Jerome L. Greene]] Hall, was designed by [[Wallace Harrison]] and [[Max Abramovitz]], architects of the [[United Nations]] Headquarters and [[Lincoln Center|Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] (which for many years served as the site of Columbia Law School's graduation ceremonies). It is located at the intersection of Amsterdam Avenue and West 116th Street. One of the building's defining features is its frontal sculpture, ''Bellerophon Taming Pegasus'', designed by [[Jacques Lipchitz]], symbolizing man's struggle over (his own) wild side/unreason.

In 1996, the law school was given an extensive renovation and expansion by Polshek Partnership (now Ennead Architects), including the addition of a new entrance faรงade and three story skylit lobby, as well as the expansion of existing space to include an upper-level students' commons, lounge areas, and a cafรฉ. In the summer of 2008, construction of a new floor in Jerome Greene Hall was completed providing 38 new faculty offices. Other Columbia Law School buildings include William and June Warren Hall, the Jerome Greene Annex (which Jerome Greene's representatives politely declined to have renamed after the building of Jerome Greene Hall), and William C. Warren Hall (or "Little Warren").

Lenfest Hall, the law school's premier residence, opened in August 2003. The hall was named for [[H. F. Lenfest]] '58 and his wife Marguerite. Lenfest contains more than 200 luxury student residences, including private studio apartments and one-bedroom apartments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/lenfest/htmls/ |title=Lenfest Hall - Columbia Law School |publisher=.law.columbia.edu |access-date=2013-11-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521225401/http://www2.law.columbia.edu/lenfest/htmls/ |archive-date=May 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  In addition to Lenfest Hall, the majority of Columbia Law students live in the university's Graduate Student Housing consisting of single and shared apartments in buildings throughout Morningside Heights. All Columbia Law students are guaranteed housing on campus for the duration of their law school studies.

==Columbia graduate legal studies program==

Columbia offers a Graduate Legal Studies Program, including the [[Master of Laws]] ([[LL.M.]]) and the Doctor of the Science of Law ([[Doctor of Juridical Science|J.S.D.]]) degrees. The LL.M. Program is considered one of the best in the United States and has been ranked very highly according to private studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upstartraising.com/reports/llm_programs2.html |title=LLM Reviews - Guide to Masters of Law Programs in the United States |publisher=Upstartraising.com |access-date=2013-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auap.com/llm.html |title=AUAP LLM-Master of Law |publisher=Auap.com |access-date=2013-11-14}}</ref> Each year the law school enrolls approximately 210 graduate students from more than 50 countries with experience in all areas of the legal profession, including academia, the judiciary, public service, civil rights and human rights advocacy, [[non-governmental organization]]s, international organizations, and private practice. Graduate students are an important component of the law school community. They participate in many co-curricular activities, including student journals, moot courts, and student organizations. Graduate students also organize and speak at conferences, workshops, and colloquia on current legal issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/llm_jsd |title=Graduate Legal Studies &#124; Columbia Law School |publisher=Law.columbia.edu |access-date=2013-11-14}}</ref>

==U.S. Supreme Court clerkships==

Since 2005, [[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States|24 Columbia Law alumni]] have served as judicial clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the most distinguished appointments a law school graduate can obtain. This record gives Columbia a ranking of [[Talk:List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States#Some final observations on numbers of clerks and a count of law schools|fifth among all law schools]] for supplying such law clerks for the period 2005โ2017. Columbia has placed [[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States|135 clerks]] at the U.S. Supreme Court in its history, one of the top five law schools for clerks; this group includes [[Lee Bollinger]], who clerked for Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] in the 1972 Term, and is now the president of Columbia University.
