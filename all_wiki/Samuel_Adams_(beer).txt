The brand name (often shortened to '''Sam Adams''') was chosen in honor of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]] [[Samuel Adams]]. Adams inherited his father's brewery on King Street (modern day State Street). Some historians say he was a brewer, while others describe him as a [[maltster]].<ref>Most historical evidence suggests that Adams worked as a [[maltster]] and not a brewer; Stanley Baron, ''Brewed in America: The History of Beer and Ale in the United States'' (Boston: Little, Brown, 1962), pp. 74–75. However, Ira Stoll in ''Samuel Adams: A Life'' (New York: Free Press, 2008; {{ISBN|978-0-7432-9911-4}}; {{ISBN|0-7432-9911-6}}), p. 275n16, notes that James Koch, founder of the Boston Beer Company, reports having seen a receipt for [[hops]] signed by Adams, which indicates that Adams may have done some brewing.</ref> The Samuel Adams brewery is located in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], United States, where visitors can take a tour, and shop beers and merchandise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.samueladams.com/brewery-and-craft/brewery-tours|title=Boston Brewery {{!}} Brewery Tours|website=www.samueladams.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref> Samuel Adams beer is brewed by the Boston Beer Company, which was founded by [[Jim Koch]] in Cambridge, MA, where he started the micro-brewery out of his home.
