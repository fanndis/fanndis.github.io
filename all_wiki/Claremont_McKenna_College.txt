It has a curricular emphasis on government, economics, public affairs, finance, and international relations. CMC is a member of the [[Claremont Colleges]] consortium.

== History ==
=== Early History ===
Claremont McKenna College was founded as Claremont Men's College in September 1946 with a founding class of 86 students and seven faculty.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.edu/about/history.php|title=History of the College|work=cmc.edu|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref> Many of its first students were war veterans of [[World War II]] attending college on the [[G.I. Bill]].<ref name="star1">{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |date=1998 |page=1 |title=Commerce and Civilization: Claremont McKenna College, The First Fifty Years 1946–1996}}</ref> Claremont Men's College was the third Claremont College, following [[Pomona College]] and [[Scripps College]]. CMC founded with the mission to foster leadership in its students in the fields of government, economics, and international affairs. The college's motto is "''Crescit cum commercio civitas''", or "Civilization prospers with commerce".

=== Becoming Claremont McKenna College ===

Following a national trend toward [[coeducation]] among colleges such as [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Williams College|Williams]], [[Amherst College|Amherst]] and [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], Claremont Men's College faced compelling arguments to admit women in the 1970s. With support from students represented by the Associated Students of Claremont's Men College, the trustees of the college voted to admit women to CMC with a two-thirds vote.<ref name="star2">{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |date=1998 |pages=244–247 |title=Commerce and Civilization: Claremont McKenna College, The First Fifty Years 1946–1996}}</ref> A year later, in 1976 Claremont Men's College admitted their first women to their freshman class. The President of Claremont Men's College during this transition [[Jack Stark]] would later say the admission of women was the college's most important moment.<ref name="star2" /> The women of the earliest classes of CMC are known as "Pioneers" and graduated with degrees that still bore the "Claremont's Mens College" moniker.<ref name="pioneers">{{cite magazine |last=Bosley |first=Lisa |url=https://www.cmc.edu/magazine/spring-summer-2015/holding-their-own| title=Holding their own| date=Spring–Summer 2015 |magazine=CMC Magazine | access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref> It wasn't until 1981 that the college was renamed Claremont McKenna College after [[Donald McKenna (philanthropist)|Donald McKenna]], a founding trustee.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.edu/about/donald-mckenna.php|title=Donald McKenna Biography|work=cmc.edu|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref>

In November 1989, a father of a CMC student hired a [[stripper]] to perform in the college's dining hall, sparking protests among some students. Then-president Jack Stark told ''[[The New York Times]]'' he did not wish to comment on "whether [the incident] was or was not degrading to women".<ref name="Striptease">{{cite news |title=Campus Life: Claremont McKenna; Striptease At Salad Bar Provokes Protest |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/style/campus-life-claremont-mckenna-striptease-at-salad-bar-provokes-protest.html |accessdate=21 November 2018 |agency=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 12, 1989}}</ref>

=== 2000s ===

On the evening of March 9, 2004, visiting Assistant Professor of Psychology Kerri Dunn reported that her car had been vandalized and painted with racist, sexist and anti-semitic slurs. In response, there was a series of demonstrations, candlelight vigils and community meetings. The investigation by the City of Claremont's police department and the [[FBI]] revealed that Dunn had slashed her own tires and applied the insulting phrases to her own vehicle. She was found guilty of filing a false police report and attempted insurance fraud. She was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay a fine of approximately $19,000 in restitution.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Antenen |first1=Jay |title=Dunn Faces One Year in Prison, Still Claims Innocence |url=http://www.tsl.pomona.edu:80/index.php?article=432 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401031051/http://www.tsl.pomona.edu/index.php?article=432 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 1, 2007 |accessdate=September 25, 2018 |agency=[[The Student Life]] |date=February 11, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Thermos |first1=Wendy |title=Teacher Gets Prison in Hate Crime Hoax |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/16/local/me-dunn16 |accessdate=September 25, 2018 |agency=Los Angeles Times |date=December 16, 2004}}</ref>

On September 27, 2007, the college announced a $200 million gift from alumnus and trustee [[Robert Addison Day]] to create the "Robert Day Scholars Program" and a master's program in [[finance]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/facevalue/index.php?id=673|title=Claremont McKenna Gets $200-Million Donation|date=September 27, 2007|accessdate=October 6, 2007}}</ref> CMC literature professor Robert Faggen sent a letter signed by several other literature professors to CMC president [[Pamela Gann]], saying they were concerned that the gift will "distort the college into a single focus trade school."<ref>{{cite web|work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/27/local/me-claremont27|title=Claremont McKenna gets huge donation |date=September 27, 2007 |first=Larry|last=Gordon}}</ref> In June 2020, [[Research Papers in Economics|RePEc]] ranked the College's economics department, the [[Robert Day School]], as #4 in its list of top US Economics Departments at Liberal Arts Colleges.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 2020|title=Top 25% US Economics Departments at Liberal Arts Colleges, as of June 2020|newspaper=RePEc IDEAS|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.uslacecon.html}}</ref>

On January 30, 2012, President Gann revealed that a "high-ranking admissions official," later identified as the school's former dean of admissions, Richard C.

In November 2015, the college's [[dean of students]] resigned after students protested what they called a lack of institutional resources for [[marginalization|marginalized]] students; the dean had implied in an email that minority students didn't fit the "CMC mold" and her response to an incident of allegedly [[cultural appropriation|culturally appropriative]] [[Halloween costumes]] was seen as lacking. These protests closely followed and were associated with the [[2015 University of Missouri protests]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laist.com/2015/11/12/claremont_spellman_resignation.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115105048/http://laist.com/2015/11/12/claremont_spellman_resignation.php |archive-date=November 15, 2015 }}</ref><ref>http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/11/12/55617/claremont-mckenna-college-dean-resigns-after-stude/</ref>

On April 6, 2017, a group of approximately 300 student protesters (most of whom attended the other Claremont Colleges) blockaded the [[Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum]] in an attempt to shut down a speech by conservative pundit [[Heather Mac Donald]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Breslow|first1=Samuel|title=Students Blockade Athenaeum to Protest Conservative Speaker|url=http://tsl.news/news/6695/|newspaper=[[The Student Life]]|date=April 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Blume |first1=Howard |title=Protesters disrupt talk by pro-police author, sparking free-speech debate at Claremont McKenna College |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-macdonald-claremont-speech-disrupted-20170408-story.html |accessdate=August 18, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 9, 2017}}</ref> The college livestreamed the talk, as audiences were unable to enter the building.

Tuition for the 2018–2019 school year is $54,160 ($27,080 per semester) for a full-time student, and room and board is on average $15,930 ($7,965 per semester for double room and 12 meals per week), for a total annual cost of attendance of $70,212.50 with other expected costs included.<ref name="Tuition and Fees">{{cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/student-accounts/tuition |title=Tuition and Fees |publisher=Claremont McKenna College}}</ref> CMC admits students on a need-blind basis and guarantees to meet the financial need of all its students as determined by the [[FAFSA]] and the [[College Board]]'s [[CSS Profile]].<ref name="Financial Aid">{{cite web|url=http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/finanaid/faq_general.php  |title=Financial Aid FAQ |publisher=Claremont McKenna College}}</ref> For the 2016–2017 year, CMC awarded a total of $27,021,024 in financial aid. 38.9% of students received need-based financial aid with an average total grant aid package of $42,445, while 5.8% of students received merit aid, with an average award of $15,744.<ref name="CDS 2016-2017" />

The college, which operates on a semester system, has 12 academic departments, 11 research institutes and 33 on-campus majors, the most popular of which are economics, government, psychology, economics-accounting and international relations.<ref name=Facts/> However, as a member of the Claremont Colleges, students at CMC also have the option to study any major that is not offered at CMC given that one of the other colleges has such a major. A popular example is computer science, which is offered by both [[Harvey Mudd College]] and [[Pomona College]]. The student to faculty ratio is 8:1 with an average class size of 18. 85% of the classes have fewer than 19 students. The six-year graduation rate is 93.3%, and the freshman retention rate is 92.7%.<ref name="CDS 2016-2017" />

=== Curriculum ===
About one third of the classes students complete are general education requirements. These include a humanities seminar and a writing seminar their first year, three semesters of a foreign language or demonstrated proficiency, a mathematics or computer science course, one laboratory science course and three semesters of a P.E. course or two seasons on a sports team. In addition, students must complete at least two humanities courses and three social science courses, all in areas outside the student's major. All students must complete a senior thesis, which can be either one-semester in length or, to receive departmental honors, two semesters. Claremont McKenna's curricular emphasis is on its social sciences, particularly economics, government, international relations, and psychology. CMC also offers an Oxford-style tutorial [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] major with two separate tracks of 14 students each. Other multi-disciplinary majors include management engineering, philosophy and public affairs, science and management, econ-accounting, biology-chemistry, and environment, economics, and politics (EEP). CMC also offers the Robert A. Day 4+1 BA/MBA, in which students receive both their [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from Claremont McKenna and their [[MBA]] from the Drucker School of Management at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 5 years.

CMC's science program is currently offered through the Keck Science Department of Claremont McKenna, Pitzer and Scripps Colleges. The Keck Science Department offers a double year-long introductory science class to allow more flexibility than the former 3 year-long introductory biology, chemistry and physics courses that most science majors must complete. In October 2018, CMC announced that it plans to withdraw from Keck to create its own science department.<ref name="Kexit">{{cite news |last1=Breslow |first1=Samuel |last2=Bobrowsky |first2=Meghan |title=CMC To Withdraw From Keck Science Department, Create Own Department |url=https://tsl.news/cmc-to-withdraw-from-keck-science-department-create-own-department/ |accessdate=31 October 2018 |agency=[[The Student Life]] |date=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

Many CMC students study abroad or participate in one of two domestic programs, one in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the other in the [[Silicon Valley]]. In both of these programs, students complete a full-time internship with a business or government department, remaining full-time students taught at night by CMC professors stationed in the two locations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/washington/|title=Washington Program|work=cmc.edu|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref>

More than 75% percent of students attend graduate school within five years of graduation, and those who choose to go straight to the workforce average a starting salary of $57,156 for the class of 2014, with average signing bonuses averaging $7,905.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.edu/sites/default/files/outcomes/CSC-2014-OutcomesBrochure.pdf|title=2014 Outcomes|accessdate=July 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711123112/http://www.cmc.edu/sites/default/files/outcomes/CSC-2014-OutcomesBrochure.pdf|archive-date=July 11, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of those CMC graduates applying to medical school, 80% get into their first or second choice institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/admission/ |title=Admission, Claremont McKenna College |publisher=Claremontmckenna.edu |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>

== Campus life ==

[[File:Kravis Center, Claremont McKenna College, July 2015.jpg|thumb|350px|left|View of the Kravis Center, completed in 2011, from Columbia Avenue.]]

CMC is known for its active party scene and relatively lenient policies on alcohol use.<ref>{{cite news |title=School Profile: Why Students Are so Happy at Claremont McKenna College |url=https://www.veritasprep.com/blog/2014/03/school-profile-why-students-are-so-happy-at-claremont-mckenna-college/ |accessdate=21 November 2018 |agency=Veritas Prep |date=March 11, 2014 |quote=Claremont McKenna College has a reputation among the consortium as a party school.

A 2012 Campus Climate Task Force report published by the school described a "pervasive, 'hyper-masculine' and heteronormative ethos at CMC" and noted that "while female students are valued as friends and intellectual colleagues during the day, at night and particularly on the weekends, female students reportedly feel they are objectified targets for sex or 'hook-ups.'"<ref name="CCTF Report">{{cite web |title=Report of the Campus Climate Task Force Claremont McKenna College 2011 – 2012 |url=https://www.cmc.edu/sites/default/files/ir/CCTFReport.pdf |website=Claremont McKenna College |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref> Since 2015, CMC and the other consortium schools have ramped up efforts to reform this culture, including hiring a dedicated Title IX staff member,<ref name="cmc.edu">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/title-ix/sexual-assault-and-campus-climate-survey|title=Sexual Assault and Campus Climate Survey|website=cmc.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> creating the 7c EmPOWER Center,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.7csupportandprevention.com/empower-center|title=7C Violence Prevention and Advocacy {{!}} EmPOWER Center|website=support-prevention|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> conducting bystander training under the Teal Dot certification<ref name="cmc.edu"/> and the establishing a student-run advocates organization that provides 24/7 support for victims of sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/CMCadvocates/|title=CMC Advocates for Survivors of Sexual Assault|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>

=== The Claremont Colleges ===
Claremont McKenna College is a member of the [[Claremont Colleges]] Consortium, and most social activities revolve around the five colleges, or "5Cs". Claremont McKenna College, [[Pomona College]],  [[Scripps College]], [[Pitzer College]], and [[Harvey Mudd College]] share dining halls, libraries, and other facilities throughout the contiguous campuses. All five colleges, along with [[Claremont Graduate University]] and the [[Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences|Keck Graduate Institute]], are part of the [[Claremont University Consortium]]. Notable benefits of being in the consortium include equal access to seven dining halls and 10 additional on-campus eateries, the fifth largest private library collection in California, interaction with over 7,000 students, access to programs such as Harvey Mudd's Clinic Program and Claremont McKenna's Semester in Washington (DC) program, and the opportunity to do a housing exchange with a student at another college.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pitzer Road Piece|url=https://www.pitzer.edu/admission/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2017/08/RoadPiece-2017.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916140423/https://www.pitzer.edu/admission/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2017/08/RoadPiece-2017.pdf|archive-date=September 16, 2017|accessdate=September 16, 2017|publisher=Pitzer College}}</ref> Most events sponsored by each school are open to students from all of the Claremont Colleges, including invited speakers and performers, employment and recruiting events, and social events.

=== Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum ===
The Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum hosts more than one hundred dinner and lecture events with speakers representing a range of disciplines and ideological perspectives each year, serving as the college's central intellectual and social hub. The Athenaeum hosts speakers four nights a week,<ref name="Ath">{{cite web |title=Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum |url=https://www.cmc.edu/athenaeum |website=Claremont McKenna College |accessdate=20 March 2019}}</ref> and also serves daily afternoon tea in its library, featuring chocolate-covered strawberries and pastries. Afternoon tea is free to students, faculty and staff. The Athenaeum has hosted such speakers as former [[United States President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] of South Africa, former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]], authors [[Gore Vidal]] and [[Salman Rushdie]], [[cybernetics]] expert [[Kevin Warwick]], former Attorney General [[Janet Reno]], filmmaker [[Spike Lee]], environmentalist [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]], former Prime Minister of Israel [[Ehud Barak]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Thomas Friedman]], Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], [[U2]] frontman and activist [[Bono]], [[CNN]] journalist [[Anderson Cooper]], former Deputy White House Chief of Staff [[Karl Rove]], former Senate Majority Leader [[Tom Daschle]], House Majority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], New York Times columnist [[Maureen Dowd]], Harvard Professor [[Danielle Allen]], former Secretary of Homeland Security [[Michael Chertoff]], former Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], retired U.S. Army General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]] and former governor of [[Massachusetts]] and 2012 presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]].

=== Housing ===
As a residential community, student life is centered on campus with 96% of students living on campus;<ref name="Fact Sheet"/> four years of housing is guaranteed.<ref name="house">{{cite web |url=https://www.cmc.edu/dean-of-students/reslife|title=Residential Life|publisher=Claremont McKenna College |accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> Claremont's dorms are divided into three regions: North Quad, Mid Quad, and South Quad. In addition, the student apartments sit on the East edge of campus, and are occupied primarily by seniors. All dorm rooms are attended to by housekeeping staff every week. North Quad is made up of Appleby, Boswell, Green and Wohlford Halls, which were the campus's first dorms. In north quad, every room opens to the outdoors instead of opening to an interior hallway. North quad rooms are all doubles grouped into suites of four rooms that share a bathroom.

CMC's Mid Quad is home to Beckett, Berger, Benson, Phillips, Crown, Marks and Claremont Halls, which feature long interior corridors, double and single rooms, large shared-bathroom facilities and all-dorm lounge areas.<ref name="house"/> Berger, Claremont and Benson Halls are connected, and make up a larger building known on campus as BCB.

The tallest buildings in Claremont are "The Towers", Auen, Fawcett, and Stark Halls, which make up South Quad. Each tower has seven floors with approximately twelve students per floor. Each floor has a common area and a large shared bathroom, while there is also an all-dorm lounge area on the ground floor. Stark Hall, the newest of the South Quad dorms, is substance-free. Auen and Fawcett underwent complete interior renovations in the summer of 2008.[[Image:Claremont-hall.jpg|thumb|300px|Crown Hall|left]]

The Student Apartments lie to the east of the college's athletic facilities and to the west of Claremont Boulevard. Each apartment is divided into four bedrooms and two bathrooms. Until recently, half the apartments were reserved for men and half for women, and apartments were allotted based on credits. In any given year, most of CMC's 260–300 seniors can live in the apartments.<ref name="house"/>

Living in the apartments is considered highly desirable amongst CMC's senior class. Seniors get the chance to live with three friends of their choice, and they also have the option to stay on a meal plan and eat at one of the 5-C dining halls, or cook for themselves. Apartment dwellers do not get the maid service of the dorms, but they do get a [[cable television]] hookup. Noise levels are more manageable, and tend to be quiet during much of the week and in the days leading up to thesis, and loud from Thursday to Saturday. Most parties and social events at the apartments take place between buildings.

=== Student Government ===
The Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC) is the official student government of Claremont McKenna College.<ref>http://www.associatedstudentsofclaremontmckennacollege.org/</ref> ASCMC is composed of an executive board and a student senate. The executive board consists of both elected and appointed positions. It is chaired by the President, and meets weekly to discuss long-term projects and endeavors. Permanent committees led by members of executive board include the events team, the diversity & inclusion committee, and the residential life committee. Additionally, each class president has a cabinet to carry out class programming. The Senate is chaired by the executive vice president of ASCMC, and is tasked with passing resolutions to influence institutional policy, funding student-led initiatives, and bringing in administrators and other college stakeholders for town hall discussions. Senate has four standing committees: administrative affairs & appropriations (AAA), environmental affairs, campus improvements, and student engagement.

=== Affinity Groups ===
CMC has a host of identity-based clubs and organisations, including 1 Gen, for first generation college students), Asian Pacific American Mentors, Black Student Associations, ¡Mi Gente! (for Latinx students), Sexuality and Gender Alliance, Women's Forum, and International Connect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.associatedstudentsofclaremontmckennacollege.org/campusorganizations|title=Clubs and Organizations|website=ASCMC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> These clubs and organisations host a variety of support programming and social events for students to participate in.

=== Student journalism ===
[[Image:Towers cmc.jpg|thumb|300px|Towers at South Quad]]
CMC attracts many students with an interest in journalism. Its student publications include the following:
* ''[[The Student Life]]'': ''The Student Life'' (abbreviated ''TSL'') was founded in 1889. It is the oldest college paper in Southern California and the largest media organization at the Claremont Colleges, and is generally regarded as the colleges' publication of record. It prints weekly on Fridays, featuring news, opinions, lifestyle articles, and sports coverage of all five undergraduate Claremont Colleges. It is jointly funded by the 5C student governments.
* ''The CMC Forum'': The ''Forum'' is the oldest CMC-specific publication on campus. It features campus news, opinions, and lifestyle articles. Although originally a newspaper, the ''Forum'' is now solely an online news source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmcforum.com/ |title=Forum |publisher=Cmcforum.com |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>
* ''The Claremont Independent'': The ''Independent'', founded in 1996, is a magazine of conservative and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] writers that has frequently produced stories about the political culture of the Claremont Colleges that have been picked up by national conservative media outlets and drawn intense criticism from many students.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Editorial Board|title=No More Clickbait, Please|url=http://tsl.news/opinions/5853/|newspaper=[[The Student Life]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Liam|title=I'm [sic] Of How the Claremont Independent Belittles Its Sources|url=https://medium.com/@liambrooks/im-sic-of-how-the-claremont-independent-belittles-its-sources-7c7012346e0c#.r9to0ujq7|publisher=Medium}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Coleman|first1=Libby|title=The College Conservative Calling Out His Classmates|url=http://www.ozy.com/2016/the-college-conservative-calling-out-his-classmates/67883|publisher=Ozy}}</ref> It is funded entirely through private donations.
* ''The Claremont Radius:'' The ''Claremont Radius'' is a student-founded, student-run, and student-intended online publication that aims to spark political discourse across campus by providing students of all political backgrounds the tools they need for effective debate and discussion on the big issues affecting our society. Founded in 2015, it seeks to provide bi-partisan coverage on issues it discusses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://claremontradius.com/about/|title=About – Claremont Radius|work=Claremont Radius|access-date=June 9, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Rivals===
The other sports combination of the Claremont Colleges, and CMS' primary rival, is the team made up of [[Pomona College]] and [[Pitzer College]] known as the [[Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens]] (P-P).

== Traditions ==
* All incoming freshmen participate in W.O.A!, or "Welcome Orientation Adventure" W.O.A! is a student-run pre-orientation program.  Options have included backpacking, camping and rock-climbing at Yosemite, canoeing down the Colorado River and community service in Los Angeles. Each trip is led by current students. W.O.A.! allows incoming students to develop friendships and get a sense for the college community before the formal beginning of their college careers.
* The "Madrigal Feast" was an annual dinner held in the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum. Both current students as well as alumni typically attended. Guests were treated to a medieval-themed feast, complete with wassail and a spirited musical performance put on by other students in medieval dress. This 26 year tradition was suspended in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmcforum.com/opinion/11062009-who-killed-madrigals |title=Who Killed Madrigals? – Forum |publisher=Cmcforum.com |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>
* The Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College host a "Monte Carlo" night which doubles as the school's homecoming dance. This tradition dates back to 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cmcforum.com/2011/news/11072011-announcing-monte-carlo-2011| title=Announcing Monte Carlo 2011 | publisher=CMC Forum |date=November 7, 2011}}</ref>

Several of Claremont McKenna College's traditions are water-related:
* At noon on the due dates of senior theses, the students turn in their theses to the registrar, after which they are given a bottle of [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] by the registrar. In recent years, the class president has provided the champagne. The students spend the remainder of the afternoon in the fountains at the school, drinking, singing, celebrating and enjoying the warm California sun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmcforum.com/news/11282011-congratulations-seniors-alert-senior-thesis-fountain-party-is-on |title=Congratulations Seniors!

*At midnight of a student's birthday, their friends will throw them in the fountains in the center of campus while singing Happy Birthday, a tradition known as 'ponding.' <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cmcforum.com/2012/life/03132012-the-cmc-bucket-list-2?rq=ponding|title=The CMC Bucket List|work=The Forum|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}</ref>

== The Consortium ==
All seven colleges are part of the [[Claremont University Consortium]], also known as "the 7-Cs". Together the campuses cover over {{convert|300|acre|ha}} and enroll over 6,000 students. In addition there are over 3,500 faculty and staff and more than 2,500 courses available. [[Image:Garrison scripps.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Garrison Theater at Scripps College]]
Student life revolves around the colleges as they interact socially and also share seven dining halls, four main libraries and other facilities spread throughout the campuses.  Notable facilities include:
* Honnold/Mudd Library and the Libraries of the Claremont Colleges, the largest collection of any liberal arts college<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voxlibris.claremont.edu/|title=Claremont Colleges Library|accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref>
* W.M. Keck Science Center
* Monsour Counseling Center
* Huntley Bookstore

Students attending Claremont McKenna can enroll in up to 2/3 of their classes at the other undergraduate colleges and can also major at any of the other colleges if the major is not offered at CMC. This is the general academic policy at the schools and is meant to give students the resources of a larger university while still maintaining the qualities of a small, liberal-arts college.

== Research institutes ==
CMC sponsors twelve different on-campus research institutes and centers. They seek to produce new research and publications while involving undergraduate students in rigorous academic work. 
* The Berger Institute for Work, Family and Children
* The Financial Economics Institute
* The Center for Human Rights Leadership
* The Family of Benjamin Z. Gould Center for Humanistic Studies
* The Keck Center for International and Strategic Studies
* The [http://kravislab.cmc.edu Kravis Lab for Social Impact]
* The Kravis Leadership Institute
* The Lowe Institute of Political Economy
* The [[Roberts Environmental Center]]
* The [[Rose Institute of State and Local Government]]
* The Salvatori Center for the Study of Individual Freedom in the Modern World<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/salvatori/ |title=Salvatori Center, Claremont McKenna College |publisher=Claremontmckenna.edu |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>
