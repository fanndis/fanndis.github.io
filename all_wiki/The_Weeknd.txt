Tesfaye met Jeremy Rose in 2010, a producer who had an idea for a dark [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] musical project<!-- not a typo; cited in the source -->. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician [[Curtis Santiago]], Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who [[freestyle rap]]ped over it. This led to the two collaborating on an album. Rose produced three songs – "What You Need", "Loft Music", and "The Morning" – and others that Tesfaye had rapped on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would ultimately be credited for them.<ref name="McGuire" /> In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded "What You Need", "Loft Music" and "The Morning" to [[YouTube]] under his stage name,<ref name="nytimes">{{Cite news |last=Caramanica A-Train |first=Jon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/arts/music/02playlist.html?_r=4&ref=music |title=Screams That Charmed, and Other Overlooked Highlights |date=December 26, 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref> although his identity was initially unknown.<ref name="pforkwynreview">{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12131-what-you-need/ |title=The Playlist – The Weeknd – ''What You Need'' |last=Fitzmaurice |first=Larry |date=March 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326174005/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12131-what-you-need |archive-date=March 26, 2011 |access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name="washpost">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/14/AR2011031403984.html |title=Singles File: Da Phuture, The Weeknd, Fever Ray |last=Stewart |first=Allison |date=March 14, 2011 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=March 29, 2011}}</ref> The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]].<ref name="McGuire" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thirteen.org/riffcity/music/love-and-other-drugs-the-weeknds-altered-state-rb/ |title=Love and Other Drugs: The Weeknd's Altered-State R&B |last=Shepherd |first=Julianne Escobedo |date=March 23, 2011 |publisher=[[WNET]] |access-date=January 21, 2013}}</ref> The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

We were thrilled when we found out he would be performing at the upcoming Super Bowl and we would have loved to have him also perform on the Grammy stage the weekend before. Unfortunately, every year, there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists. But as the only peer-voted music award, we will continue to recognize and celebrate excellence in music while shining a light on the many amazing artists that make up our global community. To be clear, voting in all categories ended well before The Weeknd's performance at the Super Bowl was announced, so in no way could it have affected the nomination process. All Grammy nominees are recognized by the voting body for their excellence, and we congratulate them all.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Weeknd Lashes Out at Recording Academy: "The Grammys Remain Corrupt" |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-weeknd-lashes-out-at-recording-academy-the-grammys-remain-corrupt?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>
