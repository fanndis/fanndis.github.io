'''Marcus Simon Sarjeant''' (born 1964) is a Briton who fired six [[Blank (cartridge)|blank]] shots at [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as she rode down [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] to the [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony in 1981.<ref name="treason cases">{{cite news|title=Treason in the UK: recent cases|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4131696.stm|accessdate=18 August 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=8 August 2005}}</ref>

==Background==
Sarjeant, who was from [[Capel-le-Ferne]], near [[Folkestone]], [[Kent]], went to [[Astor College|Astor Secondary School]] in [[Dover]]. He was a member of the [[The Scout Association|Scouts]], becoming local patrol leader before leaving to join the [[Air Training Corps]] in 1978. In the ATC, Sarjeant won a marksman's badge, and he owned an air rifle. After leaving school in May 1980 with seven [[Certificate of Secondary Education|CSE]] passes, Sarjeant applied to join the [[Royal Marines]] but left after three months, claiming that officers bullied him. He also tried to join the [[British Army|Army]] but stayed only for two days of an induction course.<ref name="Fame">{{Cite news|first=Stewart|last=Tendler|title=The teenager who wanted fame|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|page=30|date=15 September 1981|issue=61033}}</ref>

After failed applications to join the police and the fire service, he worked at a zoo and at an arts centre in Folkestone. Under the [[Youth Training Scheme]] he worked at a youth centre in [[Hawkinge]].<ref name="Queen's safety">Stewart Tendler, "The Queen's safety is being reviewed", ''The Times'', 15 June 1981, p. 1.</ref>  Friends reported that Sarjeant joined the Anti-Royalist Movement in October 1980. At the time of the incident at the [[Trooping the Colour]], he was unemployed and living with his mother, while his father was working abroad.<ref name="Queen's safety" />

He tried unsuccessfully to find ammunition for his father's [[.455 Webley]] revolver, and to get a gun licence of his own, he joined a local gun club. Through mail order he paid Â£66.90 for two [[Blank (cartridge)|blank-firing]] replica [[Colt Python]] revolvers. In the run-up to the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony, Sarjeant sent letters to two magazines, one of which included a picture of him with his father's gun. He also sent a letter to [[Buckingham Palace]] which read "Your Majesty. Don't go to the Trooping the Colour ceremony because there is an assassin set up to kill you, waiting just outside the palace". The letter arrived on 16 June,<ref name="Fame" /> three days after the ceremony.

==Trooping the Colour incident==
On 13 June 1981, Sarjeant joined the crowds for Trooping the Colour, finding a spot near the junction between The Mall and Horseguards Avenue. When the Queen came past riding her 19-year-old horse [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]], Sarjeant quickly fired six blanks from his starting pistol. The horse was momentarily startled but the Queen brought it under control and was unharmed. Corporal Galloway of the [[Scots Guards]] seized Sarjeant and pulled him over the crowd control barriers, where Galloway and others disarmed and subdued him.<ref name="OTD 13 June">{{cite news|title=13 June 1981: Queen shot at by youth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/13/newsid_2512000/2512333.stm|accessdate=18 August 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=13 June 1981}}</ref><ref>[http://news.sky.com/story/guard-i-saw-shots-being-fired-at-queen-10310327 Guard: I Saw Shots Being Fired At Queen], Sky News on-line, by Alastair Bruce, 11 June 2016, accessed 9 October 2016.</ref> Sarjeant told them, "I wanted to be famous. I wanted to be a somebody".<ref name=Fame />

The incident happened fifteen minutes after the Queen's departure from Buckingham Palace. Immediately the Sovereign's Escort was ordered by the [[Gold Stick and Silver Stick|Gold Stick-in-Waiting]] to "close up" around her. The Queen continued to [[Horse Guards Parade]].

==Investigation==
In questioning, Sarjeant said he had been inspired by the [[Death of John Lennon|assassination of John Lennon]] in December 1980,<ref name="Jailed">Stewart Tendler, "Treason case youth jailed five years", ''The Times'', 15 September 1981, p. 1.</ref> and the attempts on the lives of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|Pope John Paul II]]. In particular he noted the ease with which [[Mark David Chapman]] had become famous after killing [[John Lennon|Lennon]]. A friend said that at the time of [[John Hinckley, Jr.]]'s attempt on the life of President Reagan, Sarjeant had said "I would like to be the first one to take a pot shot at the Queen".<ref name="Jailed" /> The police found that Sarjeant had written "I am going to stun and mystify the world. I will become the most famous teenager in the world." Investigations by psychiatrists found that Sarjeant did not have any abnormalities defined as treatable under the [[Mental Health Act 1959]].

==Trial==
Sarjeant became the first person since 1966 to be prosecuted under the [[Treason Act 1842]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/14/newsid_2516000/2516713.stm|title= BBC ON THIS DAY| date=14 September 1981 | work=BBC News}}</ref> and was brought to trial before the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lord Lane]], on 14 September 1981. He pleaded guilty, and Lord Lane, in sentencing him to five years' imprisonment, said that "the public sense of outrage must be marked. You must be punished for the wicked thing you did".<ref name="lodi news">{{cite news|title=Fake Assault Nets Man Five Years|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b2czAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SDIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=5467,1663668&dq=marcus+sarjeant+outrage&hl=en|accessdate=18 August 2010|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=15 September 1981|agency=UPI}}</ref> He was found guilty of an offence under Section Two of the Treason Act in that he "wilfully discharged at or near Her Majesty the Queen a gun with the intent to alarm or distress Her Majesty."<ref>{{cite news|title=Treason case youth jailed for five years|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|first=Stewart|last=Tendler|date=15 September 1981|page=1|issue=61033}}</ref> Sarjeant appealed against the length of the sentence, but the appeal was refused.<ref>"No Appeal For Queen's Attacker", ''The Times'', 3 February 1982, p. 5.</ref>
