The '''Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010''' ({{USBill|111|H.R.|2965}}, {{USBill|111|S.|4023}}) is a landmark [[Law of the United States|United States federal statute]] enacted in December 2010 that established a process for ending the [[Don't ask, don't tell]] (DADT) policy ({{usc|10|654}}), thus allowing gay, lesbian, and bisexual people to serve openly in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. It ended the policy in place since 1993 that allowed them to serve only if they kept their [[sexual orientation]] secret and the military did not learn of their sexual orientation, which was controversial.

The Act established a process for ending the "Don't ask, don't tell" policy. According to the [[Congressional Research Service]], the Act:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2965/show |title= H.R.2965 - Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act of 2010 |publisher= OpenCongress.org |access-date= 2010-12-18 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120908212717/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2965/show |archive-date= 2012-09-08 |url-status= dead }}</ref>
{{quote|Provided for repeal of the current Department of Defense (DOD) policy concerning homosexuality in the Armed Forces, to be effective 60 days after the Secretary of Defense has received DOD's comprehensive review on the implementation of such repeal, and the President, Secretary, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) certify to the congressional defense committees that they have considered the report and proposed plan of action, that DOD has prepared the necessary policies and regulations to exercise the discretion provided by such repeal, and that implementation of such policies and regulations is consistent with the standards of military readiness and effectiveness, unit cohesion, and military recruiting and retention.}}

The Act did not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the military, as provided for in the proposed [[Military Readiness Enhancement Act]].

[[US President|President]] [[Barack Obama]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Leon Panetta]], and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Mike Mullen]] provided the certification required by the Act to Congress on July 22, 2011. Implementation of repeal was completed 60 days later, so that DADT was no longer policy {{as of|2011|September|20|lc=y|df=US}}.

DADT was controversial from the time it was implemented, but it became increasingly a matter of public debate after 2004. In July 2004 the [[American Psychological Association]] issued a statement that "Empirical evidence fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including unit cohesion, morale, recruitment and retention."<ref>American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/military.aspx Proceedings of the American Psychological Association for the legislative year 2004.

==Legislative history==

The Democratic leadership in both the House and Senate tried to end the "don't ask, don't tell" policy with an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill.

Susan Collins of Maine voted in favor of [[cloture]] on the bill and Sen Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted against [[cloture]].

On December 9, 2010, in reaction to the failure to open discussion on the Defense Authorization Act, Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Susan Collins]] introduced a bill that included the policy-related portions of the Defense Authorization Act that they considered more likely to pass as a stand-alone bill.

==Implementation==
Following enactment, the Department of Defense charged a committee led by [[Clifford Stanley]] to oversee its implementation. Stanley's committee commissioned a comprehensive review of current policies, the repeal, and whether the new status quo would be consistent with the goals of, in the words of Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]], "military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=62164 |title='Don't Ask' Remains in Effect as Gates, Mullen Tackle Plan|first=Donna|last=Miles|agency=American Forces Press Service|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |date=December 18, 2010}}</ref> On January 29, 2011, the Pentagon released its plan for [[DADT#Implementation of repeal|implementing the end of DADT]]. It called for a three-month period of training for all personnel, beginning in the third quarter of 2011. President Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen sent Congress the required certification that implementation of repeal would not have negative effect on military readiness and performance on July 22, 2011. Full implementation of the repeal occurred 60 days later on September 20, 2011.

The repeal of DADT did not alter the language of Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], which banned [[sodomy]] by service members. This prohibition was removed upon enactment of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=121444|title=New Law Brings Changes to Uniform Code of Military Justice|first=David|last=Vergun|agency=Army News Service|date=January 8, 2014|publisher=United States Department of Defense}}</ref>
