The FHLMC was created in 1970 to expand the [[secondary market]] for [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] in the US. Along with the Federal National Mortgage Association ([[Fannie Mae]]), Freddie Mac buys mortgages on the secondary market, pools them, and sells them as a [[mortgage-backed security]] to investors on the open market. This [[secondary mortgage market]] increases the supply of money available for mortgage lending and increases the money available for new home purchases. The name "Freddie Mac" is a variant of the [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] of the company's full name that was adopted officially for ease of identification.

On September 7, 2008, [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) director [[James B. Lockhart III]] announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the [[conservatorship]] of the FHFA (see [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]]). The action has been described as "one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades".<ref name="ofheo.gov">{{cite news |first=James B. |last=Lockhart III |title=Statement of FHFA Director James B.

<br />

==History==
From 1938 to 1968, the [[Federal National Mortgage Association]] (Fannie Mae) was the sole institution that bought mortgages from depository institutions, principally savings and loan associations, which encouraged more mortgage lending and effectively insured the value of mortgages by the US government. In 1968, Fannie Mae split into a private corporation and a publicly financed institution. The private corporation was still called Fannie Mae and its charter continued to support the purchase of mortgages from savings and loan associations and other depository institutions, but without an ''explicit'' insurance policy that guaranteed the value of the mortgages. The publicly financed institution was named the [[Government National Mortgage Association]] (Ginnie Mae) and it explicitly guaranteed the repayments of securities backed by mortgages made to government employees or veterans (the mortgages themselves were also guaranteed by other government organizations).

To provide competition for the newly private Fannie Mae and to further increase the availability of funds to finance mortgages and home ownership, Congress then established the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) as a private corporation through the [[Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970]]. The charter of Freddie Mac was essentially the same as Fannie Mae's newly private charter: to expand the secondary market for mortgages and mortgage-backed securities by buying mortgages made by savings and loan associations and other depository institutions.  Initially, Freddie Mac was owned by the Federal Home Loan Bank System and governed by the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]].

In 1989, the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989]] ("FIRREA") revised and standardized the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also severed Freddie Mac's ties to the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) was abolished and replaced by different and separate entities. An 18-member board of directors for Freddie Mac was formed, and subjected to oversight by the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD). Separately, The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) was created as an independent agency to take the place of the FHLBB, to oversee the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (also called district banks).

In 1995, Freddie Mac began receiving affordable housing credit for buying subprime securities, and by 2004, HUD suggested the company was lagging behind and should "do more".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/09/AR2008060902626.html |title=How HUD Mortgage Policy Fed The Crisis |first=Carol D. |last=Leonnig |date=June 10, 2008 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Freddie Mac was put under a [[conservatorship]] of the [[U.S. federal government]] on Sunday, September 7, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fhfa.gov/Conservatorship/Pages/History-of-Fannie-Mae--Freddie-Conservatorships.aspx |title=History of Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac Conservatorships {{!}} Federal Housing Finance Agency |website=www.fhfa.gov |access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>

==Business==
Freddie Mac's primary method of making money is by charging a guarantee fee on loans that it has purchased and securitized into [[mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds. Investors, or purchasers of Freddie Mac MBS, are willing to let Freddie Mac keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk. That is, Freddie Mac guarantees that the principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid back regardless of whether the borrower actually repays. Owing to Freddie Mac's financial guarantee, these MBS are particularly attractive to investors and, like other Agency MBS, are eligible to be traded in the "to-be-announced", or "TBA" market.<ref>Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', Chapters 2 and 4 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).</ref>

=== Conforming loans ===
The GSEs are allowed to buy only [[conforming loan]]s, which limits secondary market demand for non-conforming loans. The relationship between supply and demand typically renders the non-conforming loan harder to sell (fewer competing buyers); thus it would cost the consumer more (typically 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point, and sometimes more, depending on credit market conditions). [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight|OFHEO]], now merged into the new [[Federal Housing Finance Agency|FHFA]], annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan in response to the October to October change in mean home price. Above the conforming loan limit, a mortgage is considered a [[jumbo loan]]. The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in such high-cost areas as [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], [[Guam]] and the [[US Virgin Islands]],<ref name=FHFA>{{cite web |title=Conforming Loan Limit|url=http://www.fhfa.gov/Default.aspx?Page=185 |publisher=FHFA |access-date=17 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315163414/http://www.fhfa.gov/Default.aspx?Page=185 |archive-date=15 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and is also higher for 2–4 unit properties on a graduating scale. Modifications to these limits were made temporarily to respond to the housing crisis, see [[Jumbo loan]] for recent events.

===Guarantees and subsidies===

====No actual guarantees====
The FHLMC states, "securities, including any interest, are not guaranteed by, and are not debts or obligations of, the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States other than Freddie Mac."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freddiemac.com/debt/products/faq_fnotes.html |title=Freddie Mac Debt Securities: Freddie Notes FAQ |publisher=Freddiemac.com |access-date=2014-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705232138/http://www.freddiemac.com/debt/products/faq_fnotes.html |archive-date=2014-07-05 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The FHLMC and FHLMC securities are not funded or protected by the US Government. FHLMC securities carry no government guarantee of being repaid. This is explicitly stated in the law that authorizes GSEs, on the securities themselves, and in public communications issued by the FHLMC.

====Assumed guarantees====
There is a widespread belief that FHLMC securities are backed by some sort of implied federal guarantee and a majority of investors believe that the government would prevent a disastrous default. Vernon L. Smith, 2002 Nobel Laureate in economics, has called FHLMC and FNMA "implicitly taxpayer-backed agencies".<ref>Vernon L. Smith, "The Clinton Housing Bubble", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 18, 2007, pA20</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' has referred to "the implicit government guarantee"<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', "Fannie and Freddie ride again", July 5, 2007</ref> of FHLMC and FNMA.

The then director of the [[Congressional Budget Office]], Dan L. Crippen, testified before Congress in 2001, that the "debt and mortgage-backed securities of GSEs are more valuable to investors than similar private securities because of the perception of a government guarantee."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=2839&type=0 |title=CBO TESTIMONY Statement of Dan L. Crippen Director, Federal Subsidies for the Housing GSEs before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises Committee on Financial Services U.S. House of Representatives, May 23, 2001 |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=2001-05-23 |access-date=2014-06-19}}</ref>

====Federal subsidies====
The FHLMC receives no direct federal government aid. However, the corporation and the securities it issues are thought to benefit from government subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office writes, "There have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies. But in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises. Government-sponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers. The benefit is currently worth $6.5 billion annually." <ref>Congressional Budget Office, Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, May 1996</ref>

===The mortgage crisis from late 2007===
As mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label MBS, GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators. Competition between the GSEs and private securitizers for loans further undermined GSEs power and strengthened mortgage originators. This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis.

Investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk. Whereas the GSEs guaranteed the performance of their MBS, private securitizers generally did not, and might only retain a thin slice of risk.

From 2001 to 2003, [[financial institution]]s experienced high earnings due to an unprecedented re-financing boom brought about by historically low interest rates. When interest rates eventually rose, financial institutions sought to maintain their elevated earnings levels with a shift toward riskier mortgages and private label MBS distribution. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, [[fixed-rate mortgage]]s (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), and in the start of a sharp deterioration in [[mortgage underwriting]] standards.<ref name="LevitinWachter">{{cite journal |last1=Levitin |first1=Adam J. |last2=Wachter |first2=Susan M. |title=Explaining the Housing Bubble |journal=Georgetown Law Journal |date=April 12, 2012 |ssrn = 1669401}}</ref> The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share.<ref name="LevitinWachter"/>

The growth of private-label securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance<ref name="LevitinWachter"/> that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages—particularly with adjustable rate mortgages [[Adjustable-rate mortgage|(ARM)]]—caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system". The [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels.

===Investigations===
In 2003, Freddie Mac revealed that it had understated earnings by almost $5 billion, one of the largest corporate restatements in U.S. history. As a result, in November, it was fined $125 million—an amount called "peanuts" by ''Forbes'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2003/12/11/cx_aw_1211freddie.html |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |title=Shaking Steady Freddie |date=2003-12-11}}</ref>

On April 18, 2006, Freddie Mac was fined $3.8 million, by far the largest amount ever assessed by the Federal Election Commission, as a result of illegal campaign contributions. Freddie Mac was accused of illegally using corporate resources between 2000 and 2003 for 85 fundraisers that collected about $1.7 million for federal candidates. Much of the illegal fund raising benefited members of the [[House Financial Services Committee]], a panel whose decisions can affect Freddie Mac. Notably, Freddie Mac held more than 40 fundraisers for House Financial Services Chairman [[Michael Oxley]] (R-OH).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12373488 |title=Freddie Mac pays record $3.8 million fine |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=2006-04-18 |access-date=2014-06-19}}</ref>

=== Government subsidies and bailout ===

As of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market.<ref name="nytduhigg">Duhigg, Charles, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/business/11ripple.html?ex=1373515200&en=8ad220403fcfdf6e&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink "Loan-Agency Woes Swell From a Trickle to a Torrent"], ''The New York Times'', Friday, July 11, 2008</ref> This made both corporations highly susceptible to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of that year. Ultimately, in July 2008, the speculation was made reality, when the US government took action to prevent the collapse of both corporations. The [[US Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] took several steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including extending credit limits, granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks), and potentially allowing the Treasury Department to own stock.<ref name="cnnfnma">Luhby, Tami, [https://money.cnn.com/2008/07/13/news/economy/fannie_freddie_sunday/index.htm?postversion=2008071405], [[CNN Money]], July 14, 2008</ref> This event also renewed calls for stronger regulation of GSEs by the government.

On September 7, 2008, [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) Director James B. Lockhart III announced pursuant to the financial analysis, assessments and statutory authority of the FHFA, he had placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA. FHFA has stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company.<ref name="ofheo.gov"/><ref name='FHFA-Conservatorship-2008-09-07'/>

Under the reported plan, the federal government, via the FHFA, would place the two firms into conservatorship and for each entity, dismiss the chief executive officer, the present board of directors, elect a new board of directors, and cause to be issued new common stock to the federal government. The value of the common stock to pre-conservatorship holders would be greatly diminished, in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgage-backed securities.<ref name='Washington Post-Goldfarb, Cho & Appelbaum-2008-09-07'/><ref name='Washington Post-Hilzenrath & Goldfarb-2008-09-05'/><ref name='NYTimes-Labaton & Sorkin-2008-09-05'/><ref name='Washington Post-Hilzenrath, Irwin, Goldfarb-2008-09-06'/>

The authority of the U.S. Treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The July 30, 2008, law enabling expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased the national debt ceiling by US$800 billion, to  a total of US$10.7 trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks.<ref name='NYTimes-Herszenhorn-2008-07-27'>{{cite news |first=David |last=Herszenhorn |title=Congress Sends Housing Relief Bill to President |date=2008-07-27 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/washington/27housing.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=2008-09-06}}</ref><ref name='NYTimes-Herszenhorn-2008-07-31'>{{cite news |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |title=Bush Signs Sweeping Housing Bill |date=2008-07-31 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/business/31housing.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=2008-09-06}}</ref><ref>See HR 3221, signed into law as Public Law 110-289: ''A bill to provide needed housing reform and for other purposes.'' <br> Access to Legislative History: Library of Congress THOMAS: [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.03221:  A bill to provide needed housing reform and for other purposes.] <br>White House pre-signing statement: [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/sap/110-2/saphr3221-h.pdf Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 3221 – Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909183946/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/sap/110-2/saphr3221-h.pdf |date=September 9, 2008}} (July 23, 2008).
