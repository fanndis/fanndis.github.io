== Early life ==
Peter Brian Gabriel was born on 13 February 1950 in [[Chobham]], Surrey. He was raised in a middle-class family in Coxhill, a Victorian manor situated on Deep Pool Farm just outside Chobham.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=25}} His father, Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912–2012), was an electrical engineer and his mother, Edith Irene Gabriel (''née'' Allen), was from a musical family. His great-great-great-uncle, [[Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet]], was [[Lord Mayor of London]] from 1866 to 1877.<ref name=TT07>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355127/Family-detective-Peter-Gabriel.html|title=Family detective: Peter Gabriel|date=24 November 2007|first=Nick|last=Barratt|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 July 2019|archive-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702160342/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355127/Family-detective-Peter-Gabriel.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel attended Cable House, a private primary school in [[Woking]], Surrey, followed by St Andrews Preparatory School for Boys in [[Horsell]], Surrey.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=25}} During his time at the latter, his teachers noticed his singing talent, but he opted for piano lessons from his mother and developed an interest in drumming. At age 10, he purchased a floor tom-tom.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=26}}

Gabriel remarked of his early influences, "[[Hymn]]s played quite a large part. They were the closest I came to [[soul music]] before I discovered soul music. There are certain hymns that you can scream your lungs out on, and I used to love that. It was great when you used to get the old shivers down the back."<ref name="White Shadow pp12">[[Capital London|Capital Radio]] interview with [[Alan Freeman]], broadcast October 1982; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#3, pp12) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref> At age 12, Gabriel wrote his first song, "Sammy the Slug". Around this time, an aunt gave him money for professional singing lessons, but he used it to buy [[the Beatles]]' first album ''[[Please Please Me]]''.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=26}} In September 1963, he started at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], a [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Godalming]], Surrey.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} There, he was a drummer and vocalist for his first band: the [[trad jazz]] outfit the Milords (or M'Lords). This was followed by a holiday band called the Spoken Word.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=34}}

In 1965, Gabriel formed [[Garden Wall (band)|Garden Wall]] with school friends [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on piano and [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]] on drums. Banks had started at Charterhouse at the same time as Gabriel; the two were uninterested in school activities but bonded over music and started to write songs. At a final concert before they split, Gabriel, dressed in a kaftan and beads, showered the audience with petals he had picked from neighbouring gardens.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}

== Career ==
=== 1967–1975: Genesis ===
In 1967, after Garden Wall had disbanded, Gabriel, Banks, and Stewart were invited by fellow pupils [[Anthony Phillips]] and [[Mike Rutherford]] to work on a demo tape of songs. Gabriel and Banks contributed "She is Beautiful", the first song they wrote together. The tape was sent to former Charterhouse pupil turned musician [[Jonathan King]], who was immediately enthusiastic largely due to Gabriel's vocals. He signed the group and suggested a band name of Gabriel's Angels, but it was unpopular with the other members. They settled on King's other suggestion, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. After King suggested they stick towards more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote "[[The Silent Sun]]" as a pastiche of the [[Bee Gees]], one of King's favourite bands. It became Genesis's first single, released in 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=17}} It was included on their first studio album, ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' (1968), which saw Gabriel play the flute.

After the commercial failure of ''From Genesis to Revelation'', the band went their separate ways and Gabriel continued his studies at Charterhouse.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=22}} In September 1969, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, and Phillips decided to drop their plans and make Genesis a full-time working band. In early 1970, Gabriel played the flute on ''[[Mona Bone Jakon]]'' (1970) by [[Cat Stevens]]. The second Genesis album, ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970), marked Gabriel expanding his musical output with the accordion, tambourine, and bass drum, and incorporate his [[soul music]] influences. He wrote the lyrics to "[[The Knife (song)|The Knife]]" as a parody of a protest song. The album sold little and at one point, Gabriel secured a place at [[London Film School|London School of Film Technique]] because Genesis "seemed to be dying."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mark|last=[[Mark Blake (writer)|Blake]]|title=Cash for questions: Peter Gabriel|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=December 2011|page=46}}</ref> Genesis recruited guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] after Gabriel spotted his advert in the ''[[Melody Maker]]''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Their next album, ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971), features Gabriel playing the oboe. Its opener, "[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]", was their first song in which Gabriel incorporated a story and characters into the lyrics.

[[File:Peter Gabriel, April 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gabriel performing during [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour]], 1975]]

The shows supporting ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972) marked a key development in Gabriel's stage performance. He had started to recite stories to introduce numbers as a way to cover the silence between songs, while the band tuned their instruments, or while technical faults were being fixed.<ref name="uncut.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/peter-gabriel-you-could-feel-the-horror-29379|title=Peter Gabriel: "You could feel the horror ..." – Uncut|date=19 October 2012|website=Uncut.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023120219/http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/peter-gabriel-you-could-feel-the-horror-29379|archive-date=23 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> During a gig in [[Dublin]] in September 1972, he disappeared from the set during the instrumental section of "[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]" and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head, mimicking the album's cover. He kept the idea to himself as he felt the band would have voted against it. Despite some initial doubts from his bandmates, the incident received front-page coverage in ''Melody Maker'', giving them national exposure which allowed the group to double their performance fee. One of Gabriel's stories was printed on the liner notes of their live album, ''[[Genesis Live]]'' (1973). By late 1973, following the success of ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973), which centred around English themes and literary references, a typical Genesis show had Gabriel wear fluorescent make-up, a cape, and bat wings for "[[Watcher of the Skies]]", a helmet, chest plate, and a shield for "[[Dancing With the Moonlit Knight]]", various costumes for "[[Supper's Ready]]", and an old man mask for "The Musical Box".

''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' (1974) was Gabriel's final album with Genesis. He devised its story of the spiritual journey of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City, and the bizarre incidents and characters he meets on the way. Tensions increased during this period as Gabriel wanted to write all of the lyrics himself, and split with the band after director [[William Friedkin]] had invited him to work on a screenplay. The project dissolved, and Gabriel returned to work with Genesis. Matters were complicated further with the difficult birth of Gabriel's first daughter, resulting in periods of time away from the band. In the end, Gabriel was late to deliver the lyrics and relied on contributions from Banks and Rutherford. In the liner notes, Gabriel is credited with "experiments with foreign sounds". He had [[Brian Eno]] provide additional electronic effects.

During a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, early into the album's tour, Gabriel informed the band of his intention to leave at its conclusion.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}} Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary which irritated the rest of the band.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=93}} The tour ended in May 1975, after which Gabriel wrote a piece for the press on 15 August, entitled "Out, Angels Out", about his departure, his disillusion with the business, and his desire to spend time with his family.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=107}} The news stunned fans of the group and left commentators wondering if the band could survive without him.<ref name="Leaves Genesis">{{cite news|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-leaves-genesis/|first=Dave|last=Swanson|title=38 Years Ago: Peter Gabriel Leaves Genesis|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=13 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821051141/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-leaves-genesis/|archive-date=21 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Reunion">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10903747/Genesis-back-together-after-nearly-40-years.html|first=Anita|last=Singh|title=Genesis back together after nearly 40 years|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=13 August 2015|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924202057/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10903747/Genesis-back-together-after-nearly-40-years.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> His exit resulted in drummer [[Phil Collins]] reluctantly taking over on lead vocals after 400 singers were fruitlessly auditioned.

=== 1975–1985: Solo debut with ''Peter Gabriel'' albums ===
Gabriel described his break from music as his "learning period", during which he took piano and music lessons. He had recorded demos by the end of 1975; the fruits of a period of writing around 20 songs with his friend Martin Hall.<ref name=MM751206>{{cite web|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/interview-pg-gabriel-tells-all-melody-maker-6th-december/|title=Behind Peter Gabriel's mask|first=Chris|last=Welch|date=6 December 1975|work=Melody Maker|pages=8–9|accessdate=20 June 2019|archive-date=20 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620170128/https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/interview-pg-gabriel-tells-all-melody-maker-6th-december/|url-status=live}}</ref> After preparing material for an album Gabriel recorded his solo debut, ''[[Peter Gabriel (1977 album)|Peter Gabriel]]'' in 1976 and 1977 in Toronto and London, with producer [[Bob Ezrin]].

Gabriel did not title his first four albums. All were labelled ''Peter Gabriel'', using the same typeface, with designs by [[Hipgnosis]].

''Peter Gabriel'' (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 1: Car) was released in February 1977 and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. Its lead single, "[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]", is an autobiographical song about a spiritual experience on top of [[Solsbury Hill]] in Somerset. "It's about being prepared to lose what you have for what you might get&nbsp;..." said Gabriel. "It's about letting go."{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=203}} Gabriel toured the album with an 80-date tour from March to November 1977 with a band that included guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] often playing off stage and introduced as "Dusty Rhodes".

[[File:Peter gabriel 31081978 02 400.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gabriel on stage in 1978]]
In late 1977, Gabriel started recording the [[Peter Gabriel (1978 album)|second ''Peter Gabriel'' album]] (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch) in the Netherlands, with Fripp as producer. Its "Mother of Violence" was written by Gabriel and his first wife Jill. Released in June 1978, the album went to No. 10 in the UK and No. 45 in the US. Gabriel's tour for the album lasted from August to December 1978. On this tour, Gabriel and his band shaved their heads.

Gabriel recorded the [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|third ''Peter Gabriel'' album]] (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 3: Melt) in England in 1979. He had developed an interest in African music and drum machines and later hailed the record as his breakthrough. The album has been credited as the first to use [[gated reverb]] on the drums, creating a distinct sound.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Classic Tracks: Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight"| author=Flans, Robyn| url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_phil_collins_air/index.html| journal=Mix Online | date=1 May 2005| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317065230/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_phil_collins_air/index.html| archivedate=17 March 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref> While recording drums on "Intruder", one of the tracks featuring [[Phil Collins]], Gabriel had Collins play various rhythms without using cymbals for several minutes which he used to develop the song further. Collins used the gated effect on his debut solo single "[[In the Air Tonight]]" which became a signature sound in the 1980s and beyond.

[[Atlantic Records]] – Gabriel's US distributor, which had released his first two albums – refused to put it out. "[[John Kalodner|An American A&R person]] came over in the middle of recording and – other than attempting to make one track sound like [[the Doobie Brothers]], which he failed considerably to do – he was convinced that the thing was much too ''[adopts American accent]'' 'esoteric, Peter'… He wasn't convinced then that they would want to do anything with it. And, sure enough, when it was sent over there, it was given the big elbow."<ref>[[Capital London|Capital Radio]] interview with [[Nicky Horne]], broadcast 16 March 1980; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#1, pp8) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref>

In the US, it peaked at No. 22. The singles "[[Games Without Frontiers (song)|Games Without Frontiers]]" went to No. 4 and "[[Biko (song)|Biko]]" went to No. 36 in the UK. After a handful of shows in 1979, Gabriel toured the album from February to October 1980. The tour marked Gabriel's first instance of [[crowd surfing]] when he fell back into the audience in a crucifix position. The stunt became a staple of his live shows.<ref name=RS87/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/thearchive/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sounds-March-8th-1980-HF-reviews-pg-at-Edinburgh-1733x2500.jpg|title=On the road – The games people play|first=Hugh|last=Fielder|page=51|date=8 March 1980|work=Sounds|accessdate=22 June 2019|archive-date=13 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613102425/http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/thearchive/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sounds-March-8th-1980-HF-reviews-pg-at-Edinburgh-1733x2500.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref>

On [[Peter Gabriel (1982 album)|''Peter Gabriel'' four]] (a.k.a. Peter Gabriel 4: Security), Gabriel took on greater responsibility over the production than before. He recorded it in 1981 and 1982, solely on digital tape, with a mobile studio parked at his home, [[Ashcombe House, Somerset|Ashcombe House]], in Somerset. Gabriel performs a [[Fairlight CMI]] computer and incorporated electronic instrumentation with sampling world beat percussion. "Over the course of the last two albums," he observed, "I've got back into a rhythm consciousness. And the writing – particularly with the invention of these drum machines – is fantastic. You can store in their memories rhythms that interest you and excite you. And then the groove will carry on without you, and the groove will be exactly what you want it to be, rather than what a drummer thinks is appropriate for what you're doing."<ref name="White Shadow pp12"/>

The fourth ''Peter Gabriel'', released in September 1982, hit No. 6 in the UK and No. 28 in the US. The second single, "[[Shock the Monkey]]", became Gabriel's first top 40 hit in the US, reaching No. 29. To handle American distribution, Gabriel signed with [[Geffen Records]], which – initially unbeknown to Gabriel – titled the album ''Security'' to differentiate it from the first three. Gabriel's 1982 tour lasted for one year and became his first to make a profit.<ref name=MUS86/> Recordings from the tour were released on Gabriel's debut live release, ''[[Plays Live]]'' (1983).

Gabriel produced versions of the third and fourth ''Peter Gabriel'' albums with German lyrics. The third consisted of the studio recordings, overdubbed with new vocals. The fourth was remixed, with several tracks extended or altered.

In 1983, Gabriel developed the soundtrack for [[Alan Parker]]'s film ''[[Birdy (film)|Birdy]]'' (1984). This consisted of new material as well as remixed instrumentals from his previous studio album.

===1985–1997: ''So'', ''Passion'', and ''Us''===
After finishing the soundtrack to ''Birdy'', Gabriel shifted his musical focus from rhythm and texture, as heard on ''Peter Gabriel'' four and ''Birdy'', towards more straightforward songs.<ref name=MUS86>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/peter-gabriel-from-brideshead-to-sunken-heads|title=Peter Gabriel: From Brideshead to Sunken Heads|magazine=Musician|first=John|last=Hutchinson|date=July 1986|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|accessdate=23 June 2019|archive-date=23 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623111358/https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/peter-gabriel-from-brideshead-to-sunken-heads|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1985, he recorded his fifth studio album, ''[[So (album)|So]]'', which he co-produced with [[Daniel Lanois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/so-r1956656/credits|title=So – Peter Gabriel (credits)|work=AllMusic|accessdate=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525044337/http://allmusic.com/album/so-r1956656/credits|archive-date=25 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> ''So'' was released in May 1986 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US.

In 1988, Gabriel became involved as composer for [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988). Scorsese had contacted Gabriel about the project since 1983 and wished, according to Gabriel, to present "the struggle between the humanity and divinity of Christ in a powerful and original way".<ref name=UCR15>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-passion/|title=Revisiting Peter Gabriel's 'Passion' soundtrack|first=Ted|last=Asregadoo|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=22 June 2019|archive-date=22 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622184453/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-passion/|url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel used musicians from [[WOMAD]] to perform instrumental pieces with focus on rhythm and African, Middle Eastern, and European textures, using the [[British Library Sound Archive|National Sound Archive]] in London for additional inspiration.<ref name=UCR15/> The initial plan had dedicated ten weeks for recording before it was cut to three, leaving Gabriel unable to finish all the pieces he originally wanted to record.<ref name=UCR15/> When the film was finished, Gabriel worked on the soundtrack for an additional four months to develop more of his unfinished ideas. Its soundtrack was released as ''[[Passion (Peter Gabriel album)|Passion]]'' in June 1989. It won Gabriel a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Performance]] and a nomination for a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score – Motion Picture]]. In 1990, Gabriel put out his first compilation album, ''[[Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats]]'', which sold 2 million copies in the US.

From 1989 to 1992, Gabriel recorded his follow-up to ''So'', entitled ''[[Us (Peter Gabriel album)|Us]]''. The album saw Gabriel address personal themes, including his failed first marriage, psychotherapy, and the growing distance between him and his eldest daughter at the time.

Gabriel's introspection within the context of the album ''Us'' can be seen in the first single release "[[Digging in the Dirt]]" directed by John Downer. Accompanied by a disturbing video featuring Gabriel covered in snails and various foliage, this song made reference to the psychotherapy which had taken up much of Gabriel's time since the previous album. Gabriel describes his struggle to get through to his daughter in "Come Talk To Me" directed by [[Matt Mahurin]], which featured backing vocals by [[Sinéad O'Connor]]. O'Connor also lent vocals to "Blood of Eden", directed by [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson, the third single to be released from the album, and once again dealing with relationship struggles, this time going right back to [[Adam]]'s rib for inspiration. The result was one of Gabriel's most personal albums. It met with less success than ''So'', reaching No. 2 in the album chart on both sides of the Atlantic, and making modest chart impact with the singles "Digging in the Dirt" and the funkier "[[Steam (Peter Gabriel song)|Steam]]", which evoked memories of "Sledgehammer". Gabriel followed the release of the album with a world tour (with [[Paula Cole]] or Joy Askew filling O'Connor's vocal role) and accompanying double CD and DVD ''[[Secret World Live]]'' in 1994.

Gabriel employed an innovative approach in the marketing of the ''Us'' album. Not wishing to feature only images of himself, he asked artist filmmakers [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson to co-ordinate a marketing campaign using contemporary artists. Artists such as [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Rebecca Horn]], [[Nils-Udo]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[David Mach]] and [[Yayoi Kusama]] collaborated to create original artworks for each of the 11 songs on the multi-million-selling CD. Coulson and Bruce documented the process on Hi-8 video. Bruce left Real World and Coulson continued with the campaign, using the documentary background material as the basis for a promotional EPK, the long-form video ''All About Us'' and the interactive CD-ROM ''[[Xplora1]]''.

Gabriel won three more [[Grammy Awards]], all in the Music Video category. He won the [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video]] in 1993 and 1994 for the videos to "Digging in the Dirt" and "Steam" respectively. Gabriel also won the 1996 [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]] for his ''[[Secret World Live (DVD)|Secret World Live]]'' video.

===1997–2009: ''OVO'' and ''Up''===
In 1997, Gabriel was invited to participate in the direction and soundtrack of the [[Millennium Dome Show]], a live multimedia performance staged in the [[Millennium Dome]] in London throughout 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ovo-mw0000461812|title=Peter Gabriel – OVO|website=AllMusic|accessdate=22 June 2019|archive-date=18 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518165524/https://www.allmusic.com/album/ovo-mw0000461812|url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel said the team were given free rein, which contributed to the various problems they encountered with it, such as a lack of proper budgeting.

The Genesis greatest hits album ''[[Turn It On Again: The Hits]]'' (1999) features Gabriel sharing vocals with [[Phil Collins]] on a new version of "[[The Carpet Crawlers]]" entitled "The Carpet Crawlers 1999", produced by [[Trevor Horn]]. He stuck with soundtrack work for his next project, scoring for the Australian film ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' (2002) with [[worldbeat]] music. Released in June 2002, ''[[Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score – Motion Picture.

''[[Up (Peter Gabriel album)|Up]]'', Gabriel's first full-length studio album in a decade, was released in September 2002. He started work on it in 1995 before production halted three years later to focus time on other projects and collaborations. Work resumed in 2000, by which time Gabriel had 130 potential songs for the album, and spent almost two years on it before management at [[Virgin Records]] pushed Gabriel to complete it.<ref name=TG02>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/19/artsfeatures.popandrock1|title=Don't hurry, be happy|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=19 September 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2019|archive-date=22 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622224027/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/19/artsfeatures.popandrock1|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Up'' reached No. 9 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, and supported with a world tour with a band that included Gabriel's daughter Melanie on backing vocals. The tour was documented with two live DVDs: ''[[Growing Up Live]]'' (2003) and ''[[Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped]]'' (2005).

In 2004, Gabriel met with his former Genesis bandmates to discuss the possibility of staging ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' (1974) as a reunion tour. He ultimately dismissed the idea, paving the way for Banks, Rutherford, and Collins to organise the [[Turn It On Again: The Tour]]. Gabriel produced and performed at the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|Eden Project Live 8 concert]] in July 2005. He joined [[Yusuf Islam]] on stage to perform "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]" during [[Nelson Mandela]]'s [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] concert. In 2005, [[FIFA]] asked Gabriel and Brian Eno to organise an opening ceremony for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, but FIFA cancelled the idea in January 2006. At the opening ceremony of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Gabriel performed [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5201016&t=1559291469474 | title= Olympic Games Kick Off with Art, Fashion, Dance | work= [[NPR]] | date= 10 February 2006 | accessdate= 31 May 2019 | archive-date= 19 July 2020 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200719041439/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5201016&t=1559291469474 | url-status= live }}</ref>

In November 2006, the Seventh World Summit of [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Laureates]] in Rome presented Gabriel with the [[Man of Peace]] award. The award, presented by former President of the USSR and Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Walter Veltroni]], Mayor of Rome, was an acknowledgement of Gabriel's extensive contribution and work on behalf of human rights and peace. The award was presented in the Giulio Cesare Hall of the Campidoglio in Rome. At the end of the year, he was awarded the ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by American musician [[Moby]]. In an interview published in the magazine to accompany the award, Gabriel's contribution to music was described as "vast and enduring."

Gabriel took on a project with the [[BBC World Service]]'s competition "The Next Big Thing" to find the world's best young band. Gabriel judged the final six young artists with [[William Orbit]], Geoff Travis, and [[Angélique Kidjo]].

In June 2008, Gabriel released ''[[Big Blue Ball]]'', an album of various artists collaborating with each other at his Real World Studios across three summers in the 1990s.

Gabriel contributed to the ''[[WALL-E]]'' soundtrack in 2008 with [[Thomas Newman]], including the film's closing song, "[[Down to Earth (Peter Gabriel song)|Down to Earth]]", for which they received the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]]. The song was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. In February 2009, Gabriel announced that he would not be performing on the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 Academy Awards]] telecast because producers of the show were limiting his performance of "Down to Earth" from ''WALL-E'' to 65 seconds. [[John Legend]] and the [[Soweto Gospel Choir]] performed the song in his stead.

Gabriel's 2009 tour appearances included Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. His first ever performance in Peru was held in Lima on 20 March 2009, during his second visit to the country. His concert in Mexico City, on 27 March 2009, attracted more than 38,000 fans.

On 25 July 2009, he played at WOMAD Charlton Park, his only European performance of the year, to promote Witness.

===2009–present: ''Scratch My Back'', ''New Blood'', ''Rated PG'', ''Flotsam and Jetsam''===
[[File:Peter-Gabriel-2011I2.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Gabriel performing at the 2011 Skoll Awards.]]
In 2009, Gabriel recorded ''[[Scratch My Back]]'', an album of cover songs by various artists including [[David Bowie]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Radiohead]], [[Regina Spektor]], and [[Neil Young]]. The original concept was for Gabriel to cover an artists' song if they, in turn, covered one of his for an album simultaneously released as ''I'll Scratch Yours'', but several participants later declined or were late to deliver and it was placed on hold.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/10301880/Peter-Gabriel-interview.html|title=Peter Gabriel, interview|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305142157/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/10301880/Peter-Gabriel-interview.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live|date=12 September 2013|last1=McNulty|first1=Bernadette}}</ref> Gabriel avoided using drums and guitar in favour of orchestral arrangements, and altered his usual songwriting method by finishing the vocals first and then the song, for which he collaborated with [[John Metcalfe (composer)|John Metcalfe]].<ref name=NYT10>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/arts/music/02gabriel.html|title=Peter Gabriel Says, 'I'll Sing Yours, You Sing Mine'|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=1 March 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 June 2019|archive-date=23 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623145854/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/arts/music/02gabriel.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Released in February 2010, ''Scratch My Back'' reached No. 12 in the UK. Gabriel toured worldwide with the New Blood Tour from March 2010 to July 2012 with a 54-piece orchestra and his daughter Melanie and Norwegian singer-songwriter [[Ane Brun]] on backup vocals. The follow-up, ''[[And I'll Scratch Yours]]'', was released in September 2013.

During the New Blood Tour, Gabriel decided to expand on the ''Scratch My Back'' concept and, with Metcalfe's assistance, re-record a collection of his own songs with an orchestra. The result, ''[[New Blood (Peter Gabriel album)|New Blood]]'', was released in October 2011.<ref name=Q11>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/07003-peter-gabriel-interview|title=An Invasion of Privacy: Peter Gabriel Interviewed|first=John|last=Doran|work=The Quietus|date=19 September 2011|accessdate=23 June 2019|archive-date=20 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120004523/https://thequietus.com/articles/07003-peter-gabriel-interview|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2014, Gabriel was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a solo artist by [[Coldplay]] frontman [[Chris Martin]]. They performed Gabriel's "Washing of the Water" together. Gabriel performed [[Heroes (David Bowie song)|"Heroes"]] by [[David Bowie]] with an orchestra at a concert in Berlin to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], in November 2014.

In June 2016, Gabriel released the single "I'm Amazing".

Gabriel re-emerged in 2019 with the release of ''[[Rated PG (Peter Gabriel album)|Rated PG]]'', a compilation of songs that were created for film soundtracks throughout his career. The song selection spans over 30 years and includes tracks that had never been released on an official Gabriel album previously, including "[[Down to Earth (Peter Gabriel song)|Down to Earth]]" (from ''[[WALL-E (soundtrack)|WALL-E]]'') and "That'll Do" (from ''[[Babe: Pig in the City#Soundtrack|Babe: Pig in the City]]'') an Oscar-nominated collaboration with [[Randy Newman]]. Initially only released on vinyl for [[Record Store Day]] on 13 April, the album was eventually released on digital streaming services later that month.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://petergabriel.com/news/rated-pg-digital-release/ |title=Rated PG getting digital release |website=Peter Gabriel |accessdate=14 September 2019 |archive-date=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717042417/https://petergabriel.com/news/rated-pg-digital-release/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Later that same year, Gabriel issued another digital release on 13 September titled ''[[Flotsam and Jetsam (Peter Gabriel album)|Flotsam and Jetsam]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s, remixes and rarities that span Gabriel's entire solo career from 1976 to 2016, including his first solo recording, a cover of [[the Beatles]]' song "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://petergabriel.com/news/digital-release-for-b-sides-remixes-and-rarities/|title=Digital Release for Flotsam and Jetsam|website=Peter Gabriel|accessdate=14 September 2019|archive-date=15 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015162054/https://petergabriel.com/news/digital-release-for-b-sides-remixes-and-rarities/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Musicians and collaborators as a solo artist ==
Gabriel has worked with a relatively stable crew of musicians and recording engineers throughout his solo career. Bass and [[Chapman Stick|Stick]] player [[Tony Levin]] performed on every Gabriel studio album and every live tour except for ''Scratch My Back'', the soundtracks ''Passion'' and ''Long Walk Home'', and the New Blood Tour. Guitar player [[David Rhodes (guitarist)|David Rhodes]] has been Gabriel's guitarist of choice since 1979. Prior to ''So'', [[Jerry Marotta]] was Gabriel's preferred drummer, both in the studio and on the road. (For the ''So'' and ''Us'' albums and tours Marotta was replaced by [[Manu Katché]], who was then replaced by [[Ged Lynch]] on parts of the ''Up'' album and all of the subsequent tour). Gabriel is known for choosing top-flight collaborators, from co-producers such as Ezrin, Fripp, Lillywhite, and Lanois to musicians such as [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Elizabeth Fraser]], [[L. Shankar]], [[Trent Reznor]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Larry Fast]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Ane Brun]], [[Paula Cole]], [[John Giblin]], [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Papa Wemba]], [[Manu Katché]], [[Jabu Khanyile|Bayete]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Stewart Copeland]] and [[OneRepublic]].

Over the years, Gabriel has collaborated with singer [[Kate Bush]] several times; Bush provided backing vocals for Gabriel's "Games Without Frontiers" and "No Self Control" in 1980, and female lead vocal for "Don't Give Up" (a Top 10 hit in the UK) in 1986, and Gabriel appeared on her television special. Their duet of [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s "[[Another Day (Roy Harper song)|Another Day]]" was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.katebushencyclopedia.com/another-day|title=Another Day|website=katebushencyclopedia|access-date=27 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128034923/https://www.katebushencyclopedia.com/another-day|archive-date=28 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

He also collaborated with [[Laurie Anderson]] on two versions of her composition "Excellent Birds" – one for her 1984 album ''[[Mister Heartbreak]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mister-heartbreak-mw0000189067|title=Mister Heartbreak – Laurie Anderson {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312145114/https://www.allmusic.com/album/mister-heartbreak-mw0000189067|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and another version called "This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)", which appeared on [[audio cassette|cassette]] and CD versions of ''So''.

Gabriel sang (along with [[Jim Kerr]] of [[Simple Minds]]) on "Everywhere I Go", from [[The Call (band)|the Call]]'s 1986 release, ''Reconciled''. On [[Toni Childs]]' 1994 CD, ''[[The Woman's Boat]]'', Gabriel sang on the track, "I Met a Man".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-womans-boat-mw0000113374/credits|title=The Woman's Boat – Toni Childs {{!}} Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312144439/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-womans-boat-mw0000113374/credits|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1998, Gabriel appeared on the soundtrack of ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' as the singer of the song "That'll Do", written by [[Randy Newman]]. The song was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], and Gabriel and Newman performed it at the following year's Oscar telecast. He performed a similar soundtrack appearance for the 2004 film ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'', singing a cover version of "The Book of Love" by [[the Magnetic Fields]].

Gabriel appeared on [[Robbie Robertson]]'s self-titled album, singing on "Fallen Angel"; co-wrote two [[Tom Robinson]] singles; and appeared on [[Joni Mitchell]]'s 1988 album ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm]]'', on the track "My Secret Place".

In 2001, Gabriel contributed lead vocals to the song "When You're Falling" on [[Afro Celt Sound System]]'s ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realworldrecords.com/catalogue/volume-3-further-in-time/|title=''Volume 3: Further in Time''|website=Realworldrecords.com|accessdate=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714084340/https://realworldrecords.com/catalogue/volume-3-further-in-time/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the summer of 2003, Gabriel performed in Ohio with a guest performance by Uzbek singer [[Sevara Nazarkhan]].

Gabriel collaborated on tracks with electronic musician [[BT (musician)|BT]], who also worked on the ''OVO'' soundtrack with him. The tracks were never released, as the computers they were contained on were stolen from BT's home in California. He also sang the lyrics for [[Deep Forest]] on their theme song for the movie ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''. In addition, Gabriel has appeared on [[Angelique Kidjo]]'s 2007 album ''[[Djin Djin]]'', singing on the song "Salala".

Gabriel has recorded a cover of the [[Vampire Weekend]] single "[[Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa]]" with [[Hot Chip]], where his name is mentioned several times in the chorus. He substitutes the original line "But this feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / This feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too" with "It feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / and it feels so unnatural / to sing your own name."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== WOMAD and other projects ==
Gabriel's interest in [[world music]] was first apparent on his third solo album. According to Spencer Kornhaber in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2019: "When Peter Gabriel moved toward 'world music' four decades ago, he not only evangelized sounds that were novel to Western pop. He also set a radio template: majestic, with flourishes meant to read as 'exotic,' and lyrics meant to change lives."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/11/coldplay-everyday-life-album-review-vague-saviors/602605/|title=Coldplay Would Like to Save the World With Vagueness|website=[[The Atlantic]]|first=Spencer|last=Kornhaber|date=26 November 2019|accessdate=29 November 2019|archive-date=28 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128181950/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/11/coldplay-everyday-life-album-review-vague-saviors/602605/|url-status=live}}</ref> This influence has increased over time, and he is the driving force behind the [[World of Music, Arts and Dance]] (WOMAD) movement. Gabriel said: 

{{quote|The first time I really got into music from another culture was as a result of the shifting of [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], which I used to wake up to. I'd lost it on [[medium wave]] and was groping around in the morning on the dial, trying to find something that I could listen to, and came across a Dutch radio station who were playing the soundtrack from some obscure [[Stanley Baker]] movie called ''[[Dingaka]]''. That had quite a lot of stuff from – I think it was – Ghana. I can't remember now, but it really moved me. One of the songs I heard on that was a thing called 'Shosholoza', which I recorded on the b-side of the '[[Biko (song)|Biko]]' single.<ref>[[Capital London|Capital Radio]] interview with [[Alan Freeman]], broadcast October 1982; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#3, pp13) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref>}}

Gabriel created the [[Real World Studios]] and record label to facilitate the creation and distribution of such music by various artists, and he has worked to educate Western culture about such musicians as [[Yungchen Lhamo]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] and [[Youssou N'dour]].

He has a longstanding interest in human rights and launched [[Witness (human rights group)|Witness]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.witness.org |title=See it. Film it. Change it.

In 2006, his work with WITNESS and his long-standing support of peace and human rights causes was recognised by the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureates with the [[Man of Peace]] award.

In the 1990s, with Steve Nelson of Brilliant Media and director Michael Coulson, he developed advanced multimedia CD-ROM-based entertainment projects, creating ''Xplora'' (the world's largest selling music CD-ROM), and subsequently the ''EVE'' CD-ROM. ''EVE'' was a music and art adventure game directed by Michael Coulson and co-produced by the [[Starwave]] Corporation in Seattle; it won the Milia d'Or award Grand Prize at the Cannes in 1996.

In 1990, Gabriel lent his backing vocals to Ugandan political exile [[Geoffrey Oryema]]'s "Land of Anaka", appearing on Oryema's first album ''Exile'', released on Gabriel's ''Real World'' label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://realworldrecords.com/artists/geoffrey-oryema/|title=Geoffrey Oryema – Real World Records|website=Realworldrecord.com|accessdate=9 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031501/https://realworldrecords.com/artists/geoffrey-oryema/|archive-date=31 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1994, Gabriel starred in Breck Eisner's short film ''Recon'' as a detective who enters the minds of murder victims to find their killer's identity.

Gabriel helped pioneer a new realm of musical interaction in 2001, visiting [[Georgia State University]]'s Language Research Center to participate in keyboard jam sessions with [[bonobo]] apes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (This experience inspired the song "Animal Nation", which was performed on Gabriel's 2002 "Growing Up" tour and was featured on the ''[[Growing Up Live]]'' DVD and ''[[The Wild Thornberrys Movie]]'' soundtrack.) Gabriel's desire to bring attention to the intelligence of primates also took the form of ApeNet, a project that aimed to link great apes through the internet, enabling the first interspecies internet communication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=172|title=Peter Gabriel goes ape for research project|work=Top40-Charts.com|accessdate=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115158/http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=172|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

He was one of the founders of on Demand Distribution ([[OD2]]), one of the first online music download services. Its technology is used by MSN Music UK and others, and has become the dominant music download technology platform for stores in Europe.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} OD2 was bought by US company Loudeye in June 2004 and subsequently by Finnish mobile giant [[Nokia]] in October 2006 for $60&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1986, he started what has become a longstanding association with [[Amnesty International]], becoming a pioneering participant in all 28 of Amnesty's ''[[Human rights concerts]]'' – a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998.

Inspired by the social activism he encountered in his work with Amnesty, in 1992, Gabriel co-founded [[Witness (human rights group)|WITNESS]], a non-profit organisation that equips, trains and supports locally based organisations worldwide to use video and the internet in human rights documentation and advocacy.

In the late 1990s, Gabriel and entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]] discussed with [[Nelson Mandela]] their idea of a small, dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal interest to solve difficult global conflicts.

On 18 July 2007, in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, Nelson Mandela announced the formation of a new group, [[The Elders (organization)|The Elders]], in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. [[Kofi Annan]] serves as Chair of the Elders and [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Deputy Chair. The other members of the group are [[Martti Ahtisaari]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], [[Jimmy Carter]],<ref name="newstatesman.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/09/dream-factory|title=Peter Gabriel: Pop stardom and reimagining politics|website=Newstatesman.com|accessdate=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418074444/http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/09/dream-factory|archive-date=18 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Hina Jilani]], [[Graça Machel]], [[Mary Robinson]],<ref name="newstatesman.com" /> and [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. [[Desmond Tutu]] is an Honorary Elder, as was Nelson Mandela. The Elders is independently funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel.

The Elders use their collective skills to catalyse peaceful resolutions to long-standing conflicts, articulate new approaches to global issues that are causing or may later cause immense human suffering, and share wisdom by helping to connect voices all over the world. They work together to consider carefully which specific issues to approach.

In November 2007, Gabriel's non-profit group WITNESS launched The Hub, a participatory media site for human rights.

In September 2008, Gabriel was named as the recipient of Amnesty International's 2008 ''Ambassador of Conscience Award''. In the same month, he received [[Quadriga (award)|Quadriga]] ''United We Care'' award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with [[Boris Tadić]], [[Eckart Höfling]] and Wikipedia.

In December 2013, Gabriel posted a video message in tribute to the deceased former South African president and anti-apartheid leader [[Nelson Mandela]]. Gabriel was quoted:

{{quote|To come out of 27 years in jail and to immediately set about building a Rainbow Nation with your sworn enemy is a unique and extraordinary example of courage and forgiveness. In this case, Mandela had seen many of his people beaten, imprisoned and murdered, yet he was still willing to trust the humanity and idealism of those who had been the oppressors, without whom he knew he could not achieve an almost [[peaceful transition of power]].
