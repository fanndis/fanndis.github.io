"'''Sorry'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her sixth studio album ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' (2016). It was written and produced by [[Diana Gordon (singer)|Diana Gordon]], [[MeLo-X]] and Beyoncé, with [[Hit-Boy]] serving as a co-producer and Stuart White as an additional producer. [[Columbia Records]] serviced it to radio stations as the album's second single on May 3, 2016. "Sorry" is an [[Electro (music)|electro]]-[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with a thumping rhythm created by [[drum beat]]s, [[synthesizer]]s and [[bell]]s. The song's lyrics revolve around the protagonist dealing with betrayal of a partner with another woman referred to as "[[Becky (slang)|Becky]]".

Due to the numerous allegations featured in the song, media linked its subject matter to the singer and her husband, [[Jay-Z]]. Upon the release of ''Lemonade'', "Sorry" was deemed the most unapologetic song on the album; critics praised the self-empowering attitude adopted by the singer and praised its catchy lines. "Sorry" debuted and peaked at number eleven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for selling over 1,000,000 copies in the country.

The song's [[music video]] is part of a one-hour film with the same title as its parent album, ''Lemonade'', which originally aired on [[HBO]] on April 23, 2016. It was later released to [[Vevo]] on June 22, 2016 as the first standalone clip from the album. It features a spoken word poetry by Somali-English poet [[Warsan Shire]], Beyoncé dancing along with a group of female dancers with painted bodies and a cameo appearance by tennis player [[Serena Williams]]. Beyoncé performed "Sorry" live during [[The Formation World Tour]] (2016), at the [[Beyoncé 2018 Coachella performance|2018 Coachella festival]] and as part of the set list of her co-headlining tour with Jay Z, the [[On the Run II Tour]].

==Background and recording==
"Sorry" was written and produced by [[Wynter Gordon|Diana Gordon]], [[MeLo-X]], and Beyoncé.<ref name="credits" /> [[Hit-Boy]] served as the track's co-producer, Stuart White handled the additional production and Beyoncé was responsible for the vocal production. It was recorded with the guidance of Stuart White at the Beehive Studios in [[Los Angeles]]. White also handled the song's [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] and [[Mixing engineer|mix engineering]]. The [[Audio mastering|mastering]] of "Sorry" was finished by Dave Kutch at two studios: The Mastering Palace NYC and Pacifique Recording Studios located in North Hollywood. Crissy Collins provides [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]] throughout the song.<ref name="credits" />

Beyoncé first heard of MeLo-X after he had released an [[extended play|EP]] titled ''Yoncé-X'' (2014) consisting of unauthorized remixes of songs from her [[Beyoncé (album)|fifth self-titled studio album]]. She invited him to collaborate on various projects, including [[On the Run Tour (Beyoncé and Jay-Z)|On the Run]], her co-headliner tour with [[Jay-Z]].<ref name="pitch" /> The following year, MeLo-X was invited to work with the singer during the sessions for her sixth studio album, ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]''; two of the tracks he worked on, "Hold Up" and "Sorry" were included on its final track listing. During an interview with ''[[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]'', he elaborated about his work on "Sorry", recalling that it was written in the summer of 2015.<ref name="pitch" />  While conceiving the track, MeLo-X tried to incorporate [[dancehall]] influences, something that was part of his culture as a Jamaican. He described the idea behind "Sorry" as "pretty simple": "It was just some cool keys, drum patterns, and we started putting down vocal ideas and lyric ideas".<ref name="pitch" /> Later, Hit-Boy contributed to the song, adding various sounds and layers. MeLo-X further pointed out that "Sorry" was a "vital point" on the record due to "all these different emotions and different sounds and different layers".<ref name="pitch">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/65045-beyonces-lemonade-collaborator-melo-x-gives-first-interview-on-making-of-the-album/|title=Beyoncé's Lemonade Collaborator MeLo-X Gives First Interview on Making of the Album|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|first=Matthew|last=Strauss|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> "Sorry" was sent to [[rhythmic contemporary]] radio in the United States on May 3, 2016 as the album's second single.<ref name="top40r" /> It was also serviced to [[contemporary hit radio]] stations in Italy and the United States on May 6 and May 10, 2016 respectively.<ref name="italyradio" /><ref name="top40m" />

==Composition and lyrical analysis==
"Sorry" is an up-tempo [[Electro music|electro]]-[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] track with a thumping and bleeping beat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-beyonce-lemonade-review-20160424-story.html|title=Review Fierce Beyoncé puts Jay Z on final notice, then turns bitterness into 'Lemonade'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Mikael|last=Wood|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref><ref name="vox" /> ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' writer Giuseppe Zevolli called it an emulation of early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] [[contemporary R&B|R&B]].<ref name="dis" /> The 405's Samantha O'Connor described it as an "electro-infused" track.<ref name="fouroh">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefourohfive.com/music/review/beyonce-lemonade-146|title=Beyoncé  – Lemonade|publisher=The 405|first=Samantha|last=O'Connor|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> It is instrumentally complete with shattering [[drum beat]]s, [[synthesizer]]s and [[bell]]s, the latter instruments prominent throughout the chorus.<ref name="dis" /><ref name="nme" /><ref name="dx" /> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' writer Spencer Kornhaber likened the electronic layers of "Sorry" to the [[Sorry (Justin Bieber song)|2015 eponymous song]] by [[Justin Bieber]]. He further found its chorus similar to [[Top 40]] music, but with a "glassy-eyed distance to the song, a purposeful malaise".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/lemonade-beyonce-review-sex-relationships-gender-jay-z/479643/|title=Beyoncé's Lemonade and the Sacredness of Sex|work=[[The Atlantic]]|first=Spencer|last=Kornhaber|date=April 26, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref> Mike Wass of the website [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] felt that "Sorry" was intended as a female response to "[[IDFWU]]" (2014) by [[Big Sean]] and further found similar phrases.<ref name="idolator" />

The song's lyrics revolve around the protagonist's cheating lover and her way of coping with the [[adultery]]. Following the release of ''Lemonade'' speculations arose about the singer's husband [[Jay-Z]]'s alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as "Becky". [[Jon Pareles]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that many of the accusations were "aimed specifically and recognizably" at him.<ref name="pareles">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/arts/music/beyonce-lemonade.html|title=Review: Beyoncé Makes 'Lemonade' Out of Marital Strife|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Similarly, Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine noted the lines "Suck on my balls, I've had enough" were an "unmistakable hint" that the lyrics revolve around Jay Z."<ref name="sheffield" /> [[Alexis Petridis]] from ''[[The Guardian]]'' also interpreted the lines as Beyoncé declaring she was prepared to abandon him and take their daughter along. He also found the lyrics "Big homie better grow up" as a reference of the self-given title by Jay-Z during his guest appearance on their past collaboration "[[Crazy in Love]]" (2003).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with|title='Beyoncé is not a woman to be messed with' – Lemonade review|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|date=April 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> ''[[NME]]'' writer Larry Bartleet was of the opinion that the singer was "thrillingly honest sucker-punch" on the song's lyrics aimed at Jay-Z.<ref name="nme" /> On the other hand, Lindsay Mannering from ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' magazine felt that it was hard to determine whether the lyrics were inspired by the pair's private life due to the prominent usage of [[innuendo]]s. However, she later clarified that although the song may not necessarily be autobiographical, "Beyonce has a tendency to reveal her truth through music... so it's possible that 'Sorry' references her emotions after Jay allegedly cheated on her".<ref name="bustle">{{cite news|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/156550-is-sorry-about-jay-z-beyonces-new-song-has-some-telling-lyrics|title=Is "Sorry" About Jay Z?

==Critical reception==
Corinne Heller of ''E! Online'' dubbed "Sorry" as the "most controversial song" on ''Lemonade'' due to the alleged infidelity and "Becky with the good hair" mistress discussed in the lyrics.<ref name="eonline" /> Amy Zimmerman, writing for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' deemed "Sorry" by far the most iconic single and coined it as the song which "introduced the world to Jay Z's most infamous alleged mistress, 'Becky with the good hair'".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/22/beyonce-has-blessed-us-with-a-standalone-video-for-sorry-feat-serena-williams.html|title=Beyoncé Has Blessed Us With a Standalone Video for 'Sorry' feat.

[[File:Serena Williams (19799728872).jpg|thumb|American tennis player Serena Williams makes a cameo appearance in the music video for "Sorry"]]
A [[music video]] for the song, directed by [[Kahlil Joseph]] and Beyoncé herself, was included on the parent visual album as part of a one-hour film which premiered on [[HBO]] on April 23, 2016.
