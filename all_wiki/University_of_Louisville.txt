The '''University of Louisville''' ('''UofL''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].  It is part of the Kentucky [[state university system]]. When founded in 1798, it was the first city-owned public university in the United States and one of the first universities chartered west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. The university is mandated by the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] to be a "Preeminent Metropolitan Research University".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/about/mission.html |title=UofL Mission statement |access-date=June 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710085310/http://www.louisville.edu/about/mission.html |archive-date=July 10, 2006 }}</ref> The university enrolls students from 118 of 120 Kentucky counties,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://louisville.edu/~jbmorr03/Fall-05-Enrollment-by-County.pdf|title=UofL Fall '05 Enrollment by County|access-date=June 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201124647/http://louisville.edu/~jbmorr03/Fall-05-Enrollment-by-County.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2007}}</ref> all 50 [[U.S. state]]s, and 116 countries around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://louisville.edu/~jbmorr03/Fall-05-Enrollment-by-State.pdf |title=UofL Fall '05 Enrollment by State|access-date=July 7, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201124648/http://louisville.edu/~jbmorr03/Fall-05-Enrollment-by-State.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2007}}</ref>

==History==

===Founding and early years: 1798–1845===

[[File:ULJusticeCen.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Criminal Justice Building]]

The University of Louisville traces its roots to a charter granted in 1798<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/about/history.html |title=UofL History |access-date=June 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710192213/http://www.louisville.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=July 10, 2006 }}</ref> by the Kentucky General Assembly to establish a school of higher learning in the newly founded town of Louisville. It ordered the sale of 6,000 acres (24&nbsp;km²) of South Central Kentucky land to underwrite construction, joined on April 3, 1798 by eight community leaders who began local [[Fundraising|fund raising]] for what was then known as the [[Jefferson Seminary]]. It opened 15 years later and offered college and high school level courses in a variety of subjects. It was headed by [[Edward Mann Butler]] from 1813 to 1816, who later ran the first public school in Kentucky in 1829 and is considered Kentucky's first historian.<ref name="Public Schools">{{cite book|last=Botkins|first=Shirley|editor-first=John E.|editor-last=Kleber|year=2001|title=The Encyclopedia of Louisville|chapter=Public Schools |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC&pg=PA735|pages=735–737|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |isbn=0-8131-2100-0|oclc=247857447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC|access-date=September 7, 2016}}</ref>

Despite the Jefferson Seminary's early success, pressure from newly established public schools and media critiques of it as "elitist" would force its closure in 1829.<ref name="Public Schools" />

Eight years later, in 1837, the Louisville [[City council]] established the [[Louisville Medical Institute]] at the urging of renowned physician and medical author [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]]. As he had earlier at [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington's]] [[Transylvania University]], Caldwell rapidly led LMI into becoming one of the leading [[medical school]]s west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. In 1840, the Louisville [[Collegiate institute]], a rival medical school, was established after an LMI faculty dispute. It opened in 1844 on land near the present day [[Health science]]s campus.
[[File:University of Louisville School of Medicine Overview.jpg|right|thumb|The [[University of Louisville School of Medicine]] opened in 1837]]

===As a public municipal university: 1846–1969===
In 1846, the Kentucky legislature combined the Louisville Medical Institute, the Louisville Collegiate Institution, and [[University of Louisville School of Law|a newly created law school]] into the University of Louisville, on a campus just east of [[Downtown Louisville]]. The LCI folded soon afterwards. The university experienced rapid growth in the 20th century, adding new schools in the liberal arts (1907), [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] (1915), [[dentistry]] (1918), [[engineering]] (1925), [[music]] (1932) and [[social work]] (1936).

In 1923, the school purchased what is today the Belknap Campus, where it moved its liberal arts programs and law school, with the medical school remaining downtown. The school had attempted to purchase a campus donated by the Belknap family in [[The Highlands (Louisville)|The Highlands]] area in 1917 (where [[Bellarmine University]] is currently located), but a citywide tax increase to pay for it was voted down. The Belknap Campus was named after the family for their efforts. In 1926, the building that would later be dedicated as [[Grawemeyer Hall]], was built.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grawemeyer Hall — Campus Tours |url=https://louisville.edu/campustour/belknap/grawemeyer-hall |website=louisville.edu |language=en}}</ref>
[[File:Grawhallul.jpg|right|thumb|[[Grawemeyer Hall]] was built in 1926]]

In 1931, the university established the [[Louisville Municipal College]] for Negroes on the former campus of Simmons University (now [[Simmons College of Kentucky]]), as a compromise plan to desegregation. As a part of the university, the school had an equal standing with the school's other colleges. It was dissolved in 1951 when the university [[desegregation|desegregated]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Dwayne |last2=Morison |first2=William |date=2000 |title=The University of Louisville |location=Lexington, KY |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |page=89 |isbn=0813121426 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYoVg6RogawC|access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], Louisville was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name="louisville-v-12">{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/alumni/scholarships/alumni.html |title=Alumni Association Scholarships  |publisher=[[Louisville, Kentucky]]: University of Louisville |access-date=September 25, 2011 |year=2011}}</ref>

In the second half of the 20th century, schools were opened for [[business]] (1953), [[education]] (1968), and [[justice]] administration (1969).

===As a public state university: 1970–present===
Talk of Louisville joining the public [[university system]] of Kentucky began in the 1960s. As a municipally-funded school (meaning funding only came from the city of Louisville), the movement of people to the suburbs of Louisville created budget shortfalls for the school and forced tuition prices to levels unaffordable for most students. At the same time, the school's well-established medicine and law schools were seen as potential assets for the state system. Still, there was opposition to the university becoming a state institution, both from faculty and alumni who feared losing the small, close-knit feel of the campus, and from universities already in the state system who feared funding cuts that would be necessitated to accommodate UL. After several years of heated debate, the university joined the state system in 1970, a move largely orchestrated by then [[List of Governors of Kentucky|Kentucky governor]] and UL alumnus [[Louie Nunn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/ur/ucomm/mags/fall98/archives.html|title=Going State|access-date=June 8, 2006}}</ref>

The first years in the state system were difficult, as enrollment skyrocketed while funding was often insufficient. Several programs were threatened with losing accreditation due to a lack of funding, although schools of [[nursing]] (1979) and urban & [[Public administration|public affairs]] (1983) were added.

[[John W. Shumaker]] was named the university's president in 1995. Shumaker was a very successful [[fund raiser]], and quickly increased the school's endowment from $183 to $550 million. He developed the REACH program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reach.louisville.edu/about/ |title=About REACH |publisher=Reach.louisville.edu |access-date=August 5, 2009}}</ref> to encourage retention. In 1997, he hired [[Athletic director|athletics director]] [[Tom Jurich]], who restored the athletics program and raised over $100 million to raze abandoned factories and old parking lots next to campus and replace them with on-campus athletic facilities, which vastly improved the aesthetics of the Belknap Campus. Academically, Louisville moved closer to parity with the state's flagship [[University of Kentucky]] as retention rates and research funding increased, and average GPAs and ACT scores were much higher for incoming freshmen.

[[File:BrandeisLaw2.jpg|right|thumb|The [[University of Louisville School of Law|Louis D. Brandeis School of Law]] opened in 1846 and was named for [[Louis D. Brandeis]] in 1997]]

[[James R. Ramsey]], the university's 17th president, continued the endowment and fundraising growth started by Shumaker. However, Ramsey added more emphasis on improving the physical aspects of the Belknap Campus. To this end, he started a million-dollar "campus beautification project" which painted six overpasses on the Belknap Campus with a University of Louisville theme and planted over 500 trees along campus streets, and doubled the number of on-campus housing units. The university's federal [[research funding]] also doubled under Ramsey, and three buildings were built for nanotechnology and medical research. The university's graduation rate also increased from 30 percent in 1999 to 52 percent in 2012.

On June 17, 2016, Kentucky Governor [[Matt Bevin]] announced that the entire Board of Trustees of the university would be immediately disbanded and replaced and that Ramsey would be stepping down,<ref name=BevinRamsey>{{cite news|last1=Barton|first1=Ryland|title=U of L President James Ramsey To Step Down|url=http://wfpl.org/u-l-president-james-ramsey-step/|access-date=June 17, 2016|publisher=[[WFPL]]|date=June 17, 2016}}</ref> and this was confirmed in a statement issued by Ramsey on the same day.<ref name=RamseyStatement>{{cite web |url=http://louisville.edu/president/news-items/statement-to-the-campus-community-6-17-2016 |title=Statement to the campus community |date=June 17, 2016 |access-date=June 17, 2016 |publisher=University of Louisville}}</ref> Ramsey offered his resignation at a Board of Trustees meeting on July 27, 2016, which was accepted by the board. In December 2016, the university was placed on academic probation by its accrediting agency, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], over concerns that Governor [[Matt Bevin]]'s actions had "violated rules that require that universities be independent".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2016/12/06/accrediting-agency-puts-u-l-probation/95048080/ |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |title=Accrediting agency puts U of L on probation |last=Wolfson |first=Andrew |date=December 7, 2016 |access-date=December 17, 2016}}</ref> The probation was lifted a year later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/12/06/accreditor-lifts-louisville-probation |title=Accreditor Lifts Louisville Probation |first=Rick |last=Seltzer |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=December 6, 2017 |access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> The governor's actions were initially blocked by a judge but supported by new legislation passed by the Kentucky legislature in early 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/01/06/kentucky-legislature-moves-revamp-louisville-board |title=Kentucky Legislature Moves to Revamp Louisville Board |first=Rick |last=Seltzer |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=January 6, 2017 |access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref>

In the summer of 2017, the university again came into the national spotlight as a series of scandals became public. The university's foundation, the organization that manages its endowment and investments, reported "millions of dollars in unbudgeted spending, unapproved activities and endowment losses" in an audit. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) suspended the head coach of the men's basketball team, [[Rick Pitino]], for five games after an investigation revealed that a university employee paid escorts to strip and have sex with players and recruits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/28/university-louisville-pursues-different-strategies-different-scandals |title=Battling for Basketball |first=Rick |last=Seltzer |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=June 28, 2017 |access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after the NCAA announced its findings and penalties, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the office of the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] announced the arrest of 10 individuals connected with a [[2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal|"pay for play" scheme]] connected to sportswear manufacturer [[Adidas]] and many institutions, including Louisville.  Pitino was subsequently fired.

From 1895 to 2016, the university's Belknap Campus featured a [[Confederate Monument in Louisville|Confederate monument]], built before the campus grew to surround the land on which it stood. Commemorating the sacrifices of Confederate veterans who died in the [[American Civil War]], it was erected by the Muldoon Monument Company in 1895 with funds raised by the Kentucky Woman's Confederate Monument Association. Due to controversy in 2016, the statue was moved from its original location to [[Brandenburg, Kentucky]]. Relocation started in November and was completed in mid-December.

Neeli Bendapudi became the University of Louisville's 18th President on May 15, 2018.

==Campuses==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2015}}
The university has three campuses in the Louisville area, the Belknap, the Health Science, and the Shelby. It also has an International Campus in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]], as well as various satellite facilities in the state of Kentucky and abroad:

===Belknap Campus===
[[File:CardParkKY.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Completed in 2001, Cardinal Park is home to 5 Cardinal athletic teams]]

Acquired in 1923, the Belknap Campus is the school's main campus. It is located three miles (5&nbsp;km) south of downtown Louisville in the [[Old Louisville]] neighborhood. It houses seven of the 12 academic colleges and features one of the casts of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s ''[[The Thinker]]'' in front of the main administrative building, Grawemeyer Hall. The grounds of the campus were originally used as an orphanage, several of the original buildings used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.louisville.edu/uarc/digre/refuge.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904105011/http://library.louisville.edu/uarc/digre/refuge.html|archive-date=September 4, 2006|title=University of Louisville Buildings Once Housed Homeless Children|access-date=January 16, 2008}}</ref>

The Belknap Campus has expanded greatly in recent years, with land housing abandoned factories in the area being purchased and redeveloped. Projects built since 1998 include [[Cardinal Stadium]] and adjacent Trager Center fieldhouse, Owsley B. Frazier Cardinal Park (which includes Ulmer Stadium for softball, Trager Stadium for field hockey, Cardinal Track and Soccer Stadium, Bass-Rudd Tennis Center, locker rooms, a playground and a cushioned walking path), [[Jim Patterson Stadium]] for baseball, Ralph R. Wright Natatorium, Owsley Brown Frazier [[Sports medicine]] Center, and a lacrosse stadium. With new parking at Cardinal Stadium, non-resident parking was moved there and the [[parking lot]]s near campus were redeveloped with new dormitory buildings, including the Bettie Johnson Apartments,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aoinc.com/content/casestudies/cs2.cfm?return=1 |title=Bettie Johnson Apartments |website=Allen & O'Hara Development, LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415201658/http://aoinc.com/content/casestudies/cs2.cfm?return=1 |archive-date=April 15, 2007 |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref> Kurz Hall, Minardi Hall, and Community Park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.louisville.edu/student/communitypark/ |title=Welcome to Community Park at UofL |website=University of Louisville |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624001533/http://www.louisville.edu/student/communitypark/ |archive-date=June 24, 2007 |access-date=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:ULquad2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Quad on the Belknap Campus]]

Other points of interest on the Belknap Campus include the Rauch Planetarium;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://louisville.edu/planetarium/|title=Gheens Science Hall & Rauch Planetarium |publisher=University of Louisville|access-date=August 4, 2016}}</ref> the Covi Gallery of the Hite Art Institute, named for the painter  [[Marcia Shallcross Hite|Marcia Hite]] and her husband Allen;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/art/about|title=Hite Art Institute – UofL Libraries|access-date=March 22, 2017}}</ref> and the final resting place for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Louis D. Brandeis]] under the portico in the Brandeis Law School. Surrounded by, but not part of the campus, is the [[Speed Art Museum]], a private institution that is affiliated with the University of Louisville. The Kentucky State [[Data center]], the state's official [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] for census data and estimates, is located next to Bettie Johnson Hall.

Since 2008 the school has purchased three large tracts of land adjacent to the Belknap Campus, {{convert|55|acre|m2}} to the school's northwest campus, {{convert|17|acre|m2}} to the school's east campus – south of Hahn and {{convert|39|acre|m2}} south of the Speed School of Engineering. New student housing has been completed on one of the northwest segments with student parking slated for the other. A new engineering and applied sciences research park is planned for the land south of the Speed School of Engineering. It serves as the centerpiece of a Signature Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district, designed to stimulate economic growth in an area around the university's Belknap campus. The TIF district covers more than 900 acres stretching from Belknap Campus south to the Watterson Expressway. The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority recently approved the TIF, paving the way for what could be an estimated $2.6 billion over 30 years.

====Belknap Campus development projects====
[[File:ProvinceULou.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Construction for 2,000 new student housing units on Shipp Avenue on July 16, 2008]]

In 2009, the university unveiled its new master plan for the next 20 years with efforts from the University of Louisville Foundation and other affiliate partners. Several important projects under construction or planned at that time included a new student recreation center, soccer stadium, new residence halls and academic buildings. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the [[Interstate 65|I-65]] ramps to the Belknap Campus, converting the four lanes of [[Eastern Parkway (Louisville, Kentucky)|Eastern Parkway]] into a two-lane road with bike lanes and a landscaped median to improve pedestrian access to the [[J. B. Speed School of Engineering|Speed School]], the moving of several university offices to allow the existing facilities at Arthur Street and Brandeis Avenue to be converted to [[commercial property]] and restaurants. The [[Yum! Brands|Yum!]] Center (a men's basketball and volleyball practice facility) was completed in the fall of 2007. A {{convert|12000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Olympic sports]] training/rehab center adjacent to Trager Stadium is also under construction. Additionally, Trager Plaza, a small plaza with a fountain, statue, and garden has been built with donations by the Trager Family on the south part of campus. The $37.5 million Student Recreation Center, located on the Fourth Street corridor along the western border of campus, opened in October 2013. The Province, The Bellamy and Cardinal Towne are three new student housing developments built to the southwest of campus, near the recreation center. All three were built by private developers, and The Province was built in tandem with Louisville's properties. In the short term, university provost Shirley Willihnganz expects the university to continue partnerships with private entities to build student housing.

[[File:ULOvalRecnrst.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Reconstruction of The Oval at 3rd Street on July 16, 2008]]On another note several athletic facilities are being renovated, and the new $8 million academic center will be located beneath the Norton Terrace at the south end of Cardinal Stadium. It will be centrally located between two of the university's cornerstone buildings, the Swain Student Activities Center and Cardinal Stadium. It will have seating capacity for over 5,300 fans and will feature a 15,500 square foot training center that will include identical locker rooms for each team, coaches' offices and a sports medicine training room. This stadium will be the second largest project the athletic department has undertaken behind Cardinal Stadium. Furthermore, a $4 million expansion of Jim Patterson Stadium includes the addition of 1,500 chair back seats, two-tiered ground level terraces, a visiting team locker room, and a 6,400 square foot terrace atop the chair back seats connecting the first and third base sides. The new Jim Patterson Stadium will have a total capacity of 5,000. Along with the $2.75 million expansion of the university’s softball stadium will feature a team clubhouse with a locker room, a video room, and a players' lounge. The Dan Ulmer Stadium will see the addition of 200 chair back seats, bringing the seating capacity to 1,000. The project also will add a 2,380 square foot fan terrace wrapping around the back of the stadium, as well as a new press box that will more than double its current size.

===Health Sciences Campus===
[[File:Picture 159ULHSCPreston.jpg|thumb|right|[[Preston Street (Louisville)|Preston Street]] on the university's Med Campus]]

The University Health Sciences Center, also called the med campus, is located just east of [[Downtown Louisville]] in the Louisville medical park which contains two other major hospitals and several specialty hospitals, and it houses the remaining five colleges. This is the school's original campus, being continuously used since 1846, although none of the original buildings remain. Buildings of note on the HSC include the fourteen story Medical Research Tower and the ten-story University Hospital. Construction is finished for a recently opened, downtown Louisville Cardiovascular Research Innovation Institute building to be directed by a researcher, Stuart Williams from the [[University of Arizona]]; and an eight-story, $70 million [[biomedical research]] building. Faculty and students also work with neighboring hospitals including Norton Children's Hospital, as well as outreach programs throughout Kentucky, including in [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]], [[Campbellsville, Kentucky|Campbellsville]], and [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]].

====Health Sciences Campus development projects====
[[File:University of Louisville CTR Building.JPG|thumb|Clinical Translational Research Building at the University of Louisville Health Sciences Campus]]
The University of Louisville Health Sciences Campus has seen a large amount of new development in the past decade, include the completion of 3 new buildings (Baxter Research Complex, Cardiovascular Research Tower, and the Jackson Street Medical Plaza). Work is ongoing on the Biolab Research Tower, with a January 2009 completion date projected.

In 2007 Louisville announced plans to create a nine-acre medical research park on the so-called  [[Haymarket (Louisville)|Haymarket]] property roughly bounded by Market, Preston, Brook, and Jefferson Streets, along I-65 in [[Downtown Louisville]], now called the ''' Nucleus Research Park''', with {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2}} of research space. Nucleus, Kentucky's Life Science and Innovation Center, was established in 2008 by the University of Louisville Foundation to integrate university resources with those of the region to transform Louisville into a major life science research hub. Nucleus is assisting in the development of Louisville’s Health Science Campus downtown as well as improving the physical and economic health of Kentucky and the region.

Nucleus' work is integral to the development of the research park currently underway at Louisville’s Haymarket 30-block property in downtown Louisville. Nucleus Innovation Park will house multiple facilities in close proximity to expedite collaboration and shared expertise among researchers and companies creating a vibrant technology business district along the city's healthcare/university/riverfront corridor. The project is expected to cost $300 million and would be constructed from 2009 to 2017. A 200,000-square-foot, eight-story, $18 million building, is the first in a series of structures, broke ground in July 2011, and is expected to open in June 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2007/08/06/story1.html|title=Making hay: Haymarket project would represent nearly $300 million investment on East Jefferson|last=Green|first=Ed|date=August 3, 2007|work=Business First of Louisville|access-date=March 2, 2009}}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=what is going on with the project and is it completed?|date=March 2017}}

An important project adjacent to the Downtown Health Sciences Campus was the conversion of the  [[Clarksdale Housing Complex]] into a new mixed income development called [[Liberty Green (Louisville, Kentucky)|Liberty Green]].

===Shelby Campus===<!-- This section is redirected to. -->
The {{convert|230|acre|km2|adj=on}} Shelby Campus is located on [[U.S. Route 60 in Kentucky|Shelbyville Road]] near [[Kentucky Route 1747|Hurstbourne Parkway]] in Eastern Louisville. This campus was originally the home of Kentucky Southern College, a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] [[liberal arts]] college that operated from 1961 to 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://special.library.louisville.edu/display-collection.asp?ID=802 |title=UofL&nbsp;— Kentucky Southern College records |publisher=Special.library.louisville.edu |access-date=October 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630082148/http://special.library.louisville.edu/display-collection.asp?ID=802 |archive-date=June 30, 2010 }}</ref> After the college folded, it transferred all its assets and liabilities to the university. It currently only has three buildings which are used for night classes and seminars, although construction of a $34.6-million Center for Predictive Medicine, a Level 3 biosafety facility, is in the works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/community/biosafetylab/|title=Center for Predictive Medicine > University of Louisville|website=louisville.edu}}</ref>
The Shelby Campus is also home for the building which houses the Information Technology Resource Center (ITRC) for [[homeland security]]. The ITRC conducts communications and IT research for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] as well as seminars and training in [[Emergency management|emergency preparedness]] and response. When completed, the impressive ShelbyHurst Office Campus will have over 1.5 million square feet of modern office space managed, developed and leased by NTS Development Co., in partnership with the University of Louisville Foundation. The first three projects are in full swing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.TheiTRC.com/ |title=theitrc.com |access-date=August 5, 2009}}</ref>

The university’s Shelby campus is undergoing a major renovation, with two new entrances to the campus off Hurstbourne Parkway. The overall goal is to develop {{convert|108|acre|km2}} of the {{convert|230|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus for business, office, technology and research use, now known as the ShelbyHurst Research and Office Park. The university will spend $7.9 million on the road improvements on the campus. The roadway improvements began in August 2008, with work on a new four-lane boulevard through the campus, bordered by bike lanes, sidewalks, and will be heavily landscaped. The 600 North Hursbourne –  Transformation is evident at the busy northeast corner of ShelbyHurst with the completion of 600 North. The LEED-certified, 125,000-square-foot office building is 80 percent leased and serves as corporate headquarters to [[Churchill Downs Incorporated|Churchill Downs]], NTS, Semonin Realtors and Stifel Nicolaus.

500 and 700 North Hurstbourne
Planning and design is currently underway for 500 and 700 North, ShelbyHurst's newest properties. With construction set to begin later this year, these properties will have between 100,000 and 130,000 square feet of Louisville's most prestigious office space. ShelbyHurst was designed around a four-lane boulevard through the campus bordered by bike lanes and wide attractive sidewalks. Special attention was given to enhancing green space and improving the life of the surrounding community. The green design of the entire development, combined with the convenience of a new boulevard and modern throughways, will facilitate driving, walking and biking through the campus.<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Work to start soon on improving Shelby Campus infrastructure |url= http://php.louisville.edu/news/news.php?news=1204 |publisher=University of Louisville |date=August 12, 2008 |access-date=August 9, 2015}}</ref>

The [[Louisville Cardinals]] (commonly referred to as "the Cards") are the student athletes representing the university. There are 13 women's and 10 men's teams, all of which participate in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. Louisville was invited to the ACC on November 28, 2012 and began play in 2014. The Cardinals are well known nationally in [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|men's basketball]] with two national championships(2013 vacated)and 9 Final Four appearances(2013 vacated), ranking 5th in NCAA Tournament wins, 9th in winning percentage, and from 2nd to 5th in annual attendance every year since 1984. For the 2015–16 season, the men's basketball team held a self-imposed postseason ban due to a sex scandal involving recruits and former players.<ref>{{cite news|title=Louisville self-imposes postseason ban for men's hoops in 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/14721089/louisville-cardinals-basketball-self-imposes-postseason-ban-2015-16-season|access-date=August 12, 2016|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 5, 2016}}</ref> The [[NCAA]] put the Louisville men's basketball program on four years probation in June 2017 and imposed a number of penalties including a suspension of head coach [[Rick Pitino]], a reduction of scholarships and 123 vacated games as a result of its investigation into the program's stripper scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/sports/college/acc/university-of-louisville/article156309919.html|title=Coach suspension|access-date=June 15, 2017}}</ref>

In recent years other Cardinal teams have gained national prominence. The women's basketball team, coached by [[Jeff Walz]] and led by first team All-American [[Shoni Schimmel]], has been to two straight Sweet 16s and have been ranked in the top 10. In December 2008 the Cardinals broke the Big East paid attendance record when 17,000 fans filled Freedom Hall to watch the Cards defeat rival Kentucky, and later that season advanced to the NCAA championship game, losing to [[2008–09 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team|Connecticut]]. The Cardinals returned to the NCAA final behind [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] star [[Shoni Schimmel]] in 2013, losing again to [[2012–13 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team|Connecticut]], The following season, the Cardinals filled the KFC Yum! Center with over 22,000 fans, including an estimated 1,500 Native Americans from 40 states, for the final scheduled home game of the graduating Schimmel. Other Louisville teams with recent post season success includes track and field (two individual national championships), volleyball (consecutive Sweet 16 appearances and a [[three-peat]] as Big East Tournament Champions from 2008 to 2010, and [[List of Atlantic Coast Conference champions|Atlantic Coast Conference Champions]] in 2015) and [[Louisville Cardinals baseball|baseball]] (two [[College World Series]] appearances and consecutive Big East conference titles). The volleyball team has also accomplished achievements such as Head Coach Anne Kordes being named Coach of the Year in 2015, Senior Setter for Louisville, Katie George being named Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year, and Freshman Libero, Molly Sauer being named Freshman of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year.
