'''Minas Gerais''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈminɐz ʒeˈɾajs||Pt-br_Minas_Gerais.ogg}}){{efn|The presented pronunciation is in [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. The [[European Portuguese|Iberian Portuguese]] pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|ˈminɐʒ ʒɨˈɾajʃ|}}.}} is a state in [[Southeastern Brazil]]. It ranks as the second most populous, the third by [[Gross Domestic Product|gross domestic product]] (GDP), and the fourth largest by area in the country. The state's capital and largest city, [[Belo Horizonte]], is a major urban and finance center in Latin America, and the [[List of largest cities in Brazil#Top 115 most populous cities and state capitals|sixth largest municipality in Brazil]], after the cities of [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brasilia]] and [[Fortaleza]], but its [[metropolitan area]] is the [[List of metropolitan areas in Brazil|third largest in Brazil]] with just over 5,800,000 inhabitants, after those of [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=2204&id_pagina=1 |title=Sala de imprensa &#124; notícias &#124; IBGE divulga as estimativas populacionais dos municípios em 2012 |publisher=IBGE |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref> Nine [[President of Brazil|Brazilian presidents]] were born in Minas Gerais, the most of any state.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Gabriel Maia |author2=Gabriel Zanlorenssi |author3=Rodolfo Almeida |title=Os presidentes do Brasil: mandato, formação, cidade e idade |url=https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2018/02/28/Os-presidentes-do-Brasil-mandato-forma%C3%A7%C3%A3o-cidade-e-idade |website=Nexo Jornal |accessdate=11 June 2018 |date=28 February 2018}}</ref> The state has 10.1% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 8.7% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].

With an area of {{convert|586,528|km2}}—larger than [[Metropolitan France]]—it is the fourth most extensive state in Brazil. The main producer of [[coffee]] and [[milk]] in the country, Minas Gerais is known for its heritage of [[architecture]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[art]] in historical cities such as [[São João del Rei]], [[Congonhas]], [[Ouro Preto]], [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|Tiradentes]] and [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]]. In the south, the [[tourist]] points are the hydro mineral spas, such as [[Caxambu]], [[Lambari, Minas Gerais|Lambari]], [[São Lourenço, Minas Gerais|São Lourenço]], [[Poços de Caldas]], [[São Thomé das Letras]], [[Camanducaia|Monte Verde]] and the [[national park]]s of [[Caparaó National Park|Caparaó]] and [[Serra da Canastra National Park|Canastra]]. The landscape of the state is marked by mountains,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coluni.ufv.br/revista-antiga/docs/volume02/existemMontanhas.pdf|title=Existem Montanhas Em Minas Gerais|language=pt|publisher=Federal University of Viçosa}}</ref> valleys, and large areas of fertile lands. In the [[Serra do Cipó National Park|Serra do Cipó]], [[Sete Lagoas]], [[Cordisburgo]] and [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]], the [[cave]]s and [[waterfall]]s are the attractions. Some of Brazil's most famous caverns are located there.

==Etymology==
Two interpretations are given for the origin of the name Minas Gerais.<ref>[http://portal.matiascardoso.mg.gov.br:8080/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1016.6 João Batista de Almeida Costa. Os Berços de Minas Gerais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706155757/http://portal.matiascardoso.mg.gov.br:8080/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1016.6 |date=2011-07-06 }}</ref> It comes from "Minas dos Matos Gerais", the former name of the colonial province ("Mines of the General Woods"). So a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means "General Mines", with the word Gerais serving as an adjective to the mines, which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region. Another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history: the region of the mines (Minas), and the region of the Gerais ("Matos Gerais" or "Campos Gerais", which means something close to "General Fields"). These corresponded to the areas of [[Sertão]] which were farther and hard to access (with an economy based on farming and agriculture) from the mining spots (whose economic space was urban from its origin<ref>João Antônio de Paula: Raízes da Modernidade em Minas Gerais. Belo Horizonte: Editora Autêntica, 2000</ref>). The confusion comes from the fact that the term "Gerais" is taken as an adjective to "Minas" in the first version, although according to this point of view it refers to the region called Gerais (as a noun). A further complication is that this is not a well-defined area on the map of the state, but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots, more related to the geography of Sertão, and more isolated from the state's nucleus.

==Location==
Minas Gerais is in the north of the southeast region of Brazil, which also contains the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Espírito Santo]]. It borders on [[Bahia]] (north), [[Goiás]] (west and northwest), [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] (far west), the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] (south) and the state of [[Espírito Santo]] (east). It also shares a short boundary with the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Distrito Federal]] (northwest). Minas Gerais is situated between 14°13'58" and 22°54'00"&nbsp;S latitude and between 39°51'32" and 51°02'35"&nbsp;W longitude. It is larger in area than [[Metropolitan France]] or [[Spain]].

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Minas Gerais features some of the longest rivers in Brazil, most notably the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and to a lesser extent, the [[Doce River|Rio Doce]]. The state also holds many hydroelectric power plants, including [[Furnas Reservoir|Furnas]]. Some of the highest peaks in Brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state, such as [[Serra da Mantiqueira]] and Serra do Cervo, that mark the border between Minas and its neighbors [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The most notable one is the [[Pico da Bandeira]], the third highest mountain in Brazil at 2890 m, standing on the border with Espírito Santo state. The state also has huge reserves of [[iron]] and sizeable reserves of [[gold]] and [[gemstones]], including [[emerald]], [[topaz]] and [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] mines.  Emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best [[Colombia]]-origin emeralds, and are most often a bluish-green color.<ref>Arem, Joel [http://www.gemsociety.org/article/beryl-jewelry-gemstone-information/ Beryl Gemology Information] Retrieved December 30, 2014.</ref>

Each region of the state has a distinct character, geographically and to a certain extent culturally.
[[File:Rugendas - Mattosinho pres Sao Joao Del Rey.jpg|thumb|Town of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos c.1821–1825]]
* The central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky, with little vegetation on the mountains. Around [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]] and [[Sete Lagoas]] a typical [[Karst topography]] with [[caves]] and [[lake]]s is found. Some of the mountains are almost entirely [[iron ore]], which led to extensive mining (in some places at the expense of the environment). Recent advances in environmental policy helped to put limits to mining. About {{convert|200|km|mi}} to the east of [[Belo Horizonte]] is the second Metropolitan Region of the state, [[Vale do Aço metropolitan area|Vale do Aço]] (''steel valley''), which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the [[Rio Doce]] and its tributaries. Vale do Aço's largest cities are [[Ipatinga]], [[Coronel Fabriciano]] and [[Timóteo]]. Now that mining is restricted large areas of forest are being removed for timber, charcoal and to clear land for cattle ranching. The original forest cover of these inland hills is very much fragmented. The city of [[Governador Valadares]] is in the limit of this region with the poorer North.
* The south of Minas Gerais is hilly and green, with [[coffee]] and milk production. This region is notably cooler than the rest of the state, and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter. The region is also famed for its mineral-water resorts, including the cities of [[Poços de Caldas]], [[Lambari, Minas Gerais|Lambari]], [[São Lourenço, Minas Gerais|São Lourenço]] and [[Caxambu]]. Many industries are located at [[Varginha]] and [[Pouso Alegre]].
* The southeast of the state, called [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] (''Forest Zone'') was the richest region until the mid 20th century, nowadays the biggest city, [[Juiz de Fora]], remains an important industrial, cultural and educational center, being also the fourth largest in the Minas state. The day-to-day living in the Zona da Mata however, is better represented by a group of smaller cities like [[Manhuaçu]] [[Além Paraíba]], [[Viçosa, Minas Gerais|Viçosa]], [[Leopoldina, Minas Gerais|Leopoldina]], [[Cataguases]], [[Muriaé]], [[Ubá]], [[Astolfo Dutra]] and several others. Those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture, textiles and minerals. The city of the principal coffee region in Minas Gerais is [[São João do Manhuaçu]] situated in Zona da Mata.[[File:Neve itatiaia22.jpg|thumb|[[Snow]] in the [[Itatiaia National Park]], located in the states of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro.]]]]
* The west of Minas Gerais, also known as "''[[Triângulo Mineiro]]''" (which means "the Minas Triangle", due to the geographic shape of this region), is composed of a particular type of [[savanna]], known as the ''[[Cerrado]]''. This region was initially occupied by large free-wheeling [[beef]] ranches, which are still important for the economy of the region. Over the 1990s, extensive [[soybean|soy]] and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available. The Cerrado is also one of the principal coffee-growing areas of Brazil. The main cities of this region are [[Uberlândia]], [[Uberaba]], [[Patos de Minas]] and [[Araguari]].
* The north of Minas Gerais is part of the arid [[sertão]] of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Nordeste]], and is thus subject to frequent droughts. Recent irrigation projects use the water from the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco river]] for agriculture; the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state, which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern. The diamond mines of this region, mainly in [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], attracted miners but are now exhausted, and the remaining population lives in poor conditions, especially in the valley of the [[Jequitinhonha River]]. The region is, however, known for its high quality [[cachaça]] production. [[Salinas, Minas Gerais|Salinas]] in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage. The main cities of this region are [[Montes Claros]], [[Teófilo Otoni]], [[Pirapora]] and [[Janaúba]].

===Paleontology===
[[File:Maxacalissauro.jpg|thumb|''Maxakalisaurus''.]]
The discovery of the ''[[Maxakalisaurus topai]]'' (Dinoprata) [[fossil]]s was a significant [[Paleontology|paleontological]] find. The fossil is a genus of [[titanosaur]]id [[dinosaur]] found 45 kilometers (28&nbsp;mi) from the city of [[Prata (Minas Gerais)|Prata]] (Triângulo Mineiro), in the state of Minas Gerais in 1998. It was closely related to ''[[Saltasaurus]]'', a [[sauropod]] considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits, including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine; such osteoderms have also been found for Maxakalisaurus. The genus name is derived from the tribe of the [[Maxakali]].

The ''Maxakalisaurus'' fossils belonged to an animal about 13&nbsp;meters (43.3&nbsp;ft) long, with an estimated weight of 9&nbsp;tons, although, according to paleontologist [[Alexander Kellner]], it could reach a length of approximately 20&nbsp;meters (65&nbsp;ft). It had a long neck and tail, ridged teeth (unusual among sauropods) and lived about 80&nbsp;[[million years ago]]. Because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in [[South America]], they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world. A replica has been displayed at the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, since August 28, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acd.ufrj.br/~museuhp/CP/Bol-Geol/Bol%20Geol%20Kellner%20-%20PDF.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315192548/http://acd.ufrj.br/~museuhp/CP/Bol-Geol/Bol%20Geol%20Kellner%20-%20PDF.pdf |archive-date=2007-03-15 }}</ref>

==History==

=== Indigenous inhabitation ===

The region where Minas Gerais is today was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] as long ago as 11,400 to 12,000 years ago, based on the estimated age of ''[[Luzia Woman|Luzia]]'', the name of the oldest human [[fossil]] found in the [[Americas]]. Luzia was found in excavations in Lapa Vermelha, a cave in the region of [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]] and [[Pedro Leopoldo]], in the [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte]].<ref>Feathers, James; R. Kipnis; L. Piló; M. Arroyo & D. Coblentz (2010) "How old is Luzia?</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comciencia.br/reportagens/arqueologia/arq12.shtml|title=A colonização da América do Sul|date=9 September 2003|publisher=ComCiência}}</ref><ref name="Veja_Luzia">{{Cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/250899/p_080.html|title=A primeira brasileira|date=25 August 1999|publisher=Veja}}</ref> In the region of the municipalities of [[Januária]], [[Montalvânia]], [[Itacarambi]] and [[Juvenília]], in the north of the state of Minas Gerais, archaeological excavations have led to estimates that the initial settlement occurred between 11,000 and 12,000 years ago. Starting in this period, cultural characteristics emerged, such as the use of stone or bone, the creation of cemeteries and small grain silos, as well as cave paintings. Later, about four thousand years ago, it is speculated that vegetable cultivation occurred, in particular corn, and that two thousand years ago, ceramic products were already being manufactured.<ref name="FazCiência_Pré">{{Cite web|url=http://revista.fapemig.br/materia.php?id=175|title=A fascinante pré-história de Minas Gerais|date=August 2002|access-date=2019-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123091910/http://revista.fapemig.br/materia.php?id=175|archive-date=2011-01-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The discovery of Luzia in the 1970s led to the hypothesis that the settlement of the Americas was begun with the migration of hunter gatherers from Asia, probably through the Bering Strait, by way of a land bridge called Beringia (which was left by the recession of the sea during the last [[ice age]]).<ref name="Veja_Luzia"/><ref name="FazCiência_Pré"/> The indigenous peoples of Minas Gerais, as well as throughout Brazil and [[South America]], are descendants of the groups who migrated there through [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jequitinhonha.org.br/DetailsPage.aspx?process=ProcessMessage&id=116&entityId=26|title=De onde vieram os índios?|date=9 February 2010|publisher=Centro de Convivência Infanto Juvenil Curumim|access-date=9 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109114526/http://www.jequitinhonha.org.br/DetailsPage.aspx?process=ProcessMessage&id=116&entityId=26|archive-date=9 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Colonial era ===

[[File:Aleijadinho8.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Baruch, 18th century [[Baroque]] sculpture, by [[Aleijadinho]]]]

In [[colonial Brazil|the colonial era]], the [[Brazilian Highlands|Brazilian interior]] was colonized by Portuguese and [[bandeirantes]]. The [[Brazilian Gold Rush|Brazilian gold rush]] ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of [[gold]] (discovered 1693) and [[Gemstone|gems]], and later [[diamond]]s which come from the naturally occurring [[itacolumite]] rock that can be found in great numbers in the region. These helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages. In 1697, the Portuguese used enslaved African labor to start building the [[Estrada Real]], the "royal road," that would connect the ports of cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Paraty]] to the mineral-rich regions of [[Ouro Preto]], Serro, and, at the northernmost point, [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]].

Prior to 1720, Minas Gerais was part of the [[captaincy of São Vicente]] (later renamed [[São Paulo e Minas de Ouro]]). The first capital of Minas Gerais, and seat of the local see, was the city of [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]]; it was later moved to [[Vila Rica]]. In the late 18th century, Vila Rica was the largest city in Brazil and one of the most populous in America. As the gold mines were exhausted over the 19th century, the city lost its importance; it was later renamed [[Ouro Preto]] and remained the state capital until the construction of the all-new, planned city of [[Belo Horizonte]] at the turn of the 20th century. The gold cycle left its mark in cities such as Mariana, [[Ouro Preto]], [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], [[Sabará]], [[Tiradentes (MG)|Tiradentes]] and [[São João del Rei]]. The relative isolation from European influence, added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals, helped the local people to develop their own style of art, which became known as [[Barroco Mineiro]]. Prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities. The most important artist of this period was Antônio Francisco Lisboa, who became known as [[Aleijadinho]]. His sculptural and architectural work, as exhibited in the [[Twelve Prophets of Aleijadinho|Twelve Prophets]] and [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi]] in Ouro Preto, are highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside Europe at that time.

In addition to art and architecture, there was an explosion of musical activity in Minas Gerais in the 18th century. Printed copies of European music, as well as accomplished musicians, made the journey to the area, and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication. Several composers worked in Minas Gerais in the 18th century, mainly in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto), Sabará, Mariana, and other cities. Some of the names which have survived include [[José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Marcos Coelho Netto]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]] and [[Ignácio Parreiras Neves]]; they cultivated a style related to the [[Classical music era|classical]] European style but marked by more a more chordal, [[homophony|homophonic]] sound, and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments.

[[Guimarães Rosa]]'s literature is mostly situated in Minas Gerais, with locations widely located across the State (hence the term General, although more concentrated in its north) rather than delimited and identifiable. This northern area began to be colonized (with brutal conflicts with the large Amerindian population who lived in some parts, especially in [[Vale do Jequitinhonha]]) and became accessible to colonists departing from Bahia up north, which made the Portuguese crown insert the region within the state of Minas Gerais's borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight; thus the state of MG was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue.

[[File:Rugendas - Habitans de Minas.jpg|thumb|left|People of Minas Gerais in the 1820s]]
During the 18th century, mining exploration was strongly controlled by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Crown]], which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted (one fifth of all gold would go to the Crown). Several rebellions were attempted by the colonists, always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown. One of the most important was the [[Revolta de Felipe dos Santos|Felipe dos Santos revolt]] that ended with his execution but also with the separation of Minas Gerais of [[São Paulo]]. The most notable one, however, was the [[Inconfidência Mineira|Inconfidência]], started in 1789 by group of middle-class colonists, mostly intellectuals and young officers. They were inspired by the [[American Revolution|American]] and French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals. The conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled. The most famous of them, Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (known as [[Tiradentes]]), was hanged by order of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], becoming a local hero and a national martyr of Brazil. The Minas Gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background, along with the Latin motto "Libertas quæ sera tamen", "freedom albeit late"—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the "Inconfidentes", as the rebels became known.

In the economic history of Brazil, Minas Gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the Brazilian northeast (based on sugarcane, that starts declining in the 18th century) to the southeast of the country, which still remains the major economic center. The large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of Portugal back to Brazil, progressively turning Rio de Janeiro into an important port city, from where these would be shipped to Portugal and where the Portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in 1808 after Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Portugal (see [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]]).

Due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—Minas Gerais has also played an important role on national politics. During the 19th century, politicians such as [[José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva]] were instrumental in the establishment of the Brazilian Empire under the rule of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] and later his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]]. After the installation of the Brazilian Republic, during the early 20th century, Minas Gerais shared the control of the national political scene with [[São Paulo]] in what became known as the "[[Café com leite politics|Coffee with Milk]]" (''café com leite'') political cycle (coffee being the major product of São Paulo, and milk representing Minas Gerais' dairy industry, despite the latter also being an important coffee producer).

Minas Gerais was also home to two of the most influential Brazilian politicians of the second half of the 20th century. [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was president from 1956 to 1961, and he was responsible for the construction of [[Brasília]] as the new capital of Brazil. [[Tancredo Neves]] had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in 1984 to be the first civil president after the 1964 military countercoup. However, he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position. Also, Itamar, Brazil's previous president, lived there, though he was not born in Minas.

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] of 2008, there were 19,765,000 people residing in the state. The population density was {{convert|32.73|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}. [[Urbanization]]: 85% (2006); [[Population growth]]: 1.4% (1991–2000); [[House]]s: 5,741,000 (2006).<ref>Source: PNAD</ref>

The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 9,091,000 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (46%), 8,927,000 [[Brown people#Pardos in Brazil|Brown]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (45%), 1,802,000 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (9%), 40,000 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (0.2%), 37,000 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.2%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=pnad&o=3&i=P&c=262 |title=Sistema IBGE de Recuperação Automática - SIDRA |publisher=Sidra.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>

Ethnic groups found in Minas Gerais include: [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]], [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]], [[Afro-Brazilian|Africans]], [[Italo-Brazilian|Italians]], [[German Brazilian|Germans]] and [[Arab Brazilian|Lebanese]].

The ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town. For example, in Córrego do Bom Jesus, a small town located in the extreme south of Minas Gerais, [[White Brazilian|White people]] make up 98.7% of the population.<ref name="sidra.ibge.gov.br">{{cite web |url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl1.asp?z=cd&o=7&i=P |title=Sistema IBGE de Recuperação Automática - SIDRA |publisher=Sidra.ibge.gov.br |accessdate=2013-06-08 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805130623/http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl1.asp?z=cd&o=7&i=P |archive-date=2012-08-05 }}</ref> The South of Minas Gerais is both the most European and the most densely populated part of the state. On the other hand, in Setubinha, located in the northeast part of the state, 71.8% are [[Pardo|mixed-race]] and 14.7% [[Afro-Brazilian|Blacks]].<ref name="sidra.ibge.gov.br"/> It is historically explainable: southern Minas Gerais, in the border with [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], received larger numbers of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] farmers in colonial times. In the late 19th century, [[Italo-Brazilian|Italian]] immigrants also arrived. The north region, close to [[Bahia]], was a place to the arrival of many [[Slavery|African slaves]] since the 18th century. The central part of the state, where the capital [[Belo Horizonte]] is, has a more balanced ratio between Whites, Blacks and mixed people.

The population of Minas Gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples, particularly between Black Africans and Portuguese.<ref name=chica>{{cite book|title=Chica da Silva e o Contratador de Diamantes- o Outro Lado do Mito|author=Júnia Ferreira Furtado|pages=403|year=2009|publisher=Companhia das Letras}}</ref> In colonial Minas Gerais, the population was divided in five different categories: ''Whites'', mostly Portuguese; ''Africans'', who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin (for example ''Francisca Benguela'' would refer to [[Benguela Province|Benguela]]); ''Crioulos'' (Black people born in Brazil, usually to both African parents); Mulattoes (people of mixed Black and White ancestry, usually born to a Black mother and a Portuguese father) and ''Cabras'' (people of mixed ancestry, usually with high degree of Amerindian admixture). Blacks and Mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization.<ref name=chica/> By the 19th century, however, whites were already the largest single group in the Minas Gerais population.<ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br">{{cite web|url=http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/download/texto/cp057440.pdf |title=Domínio Público&nbsp;— Pesquisa Básica |publisher=Dominiopublico.gov.br |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref> Taking the population as a whole (all groups included), European genes account for the majority of the Minas Gerais genetic heritage, which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved African population and lower reproductive rate of African slaves (the vast majority of them were males, among other reasons for their lower reproductive success).<ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br"/> The Amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the European colonists and they did not have much of an impact either, especially in Minas Gerais, where European presence and colonization was massive.<ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br"/>

During the colonial period, the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp. The census of 1738 in Serro do Frio, which included [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], revealed that of the 9,681 inhabitants, 83.5% were men and 16.5% women. Among the slaves, women were only 3.1%.<ref name=chica/> The number of free "women of color" (Blacks and Mulattoes) was very high. The same census revealed that 63% of the former slaves were women and only 37% men. Since [[Miscegenation|interracial]] relationships between "women of color" and White men were widespread, the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves.<ref name=chica/>

The [[monogamous]] family structure that the Catholic Church tried to deploy in colonial Brazil was the exception in Minas Gerais. At that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in Minas Gerais, as well as in Brazil as a whole.<ref name=chica/> Monogamy and [[wedding]]s in churches would only take root in Brazil in the 19th century, fitting the moral standards imposed by the Church. The role of women in colonial Minas Gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time. Many women used to live on their own, were heads of family and worked, particularly the "women of color" and former slaves.<ref name=chica/> The society of Minas Gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves, mainly for women. In [[Tejuco]], the percentage of White males who were head of family (37.7%) was very similar to the percentage of Black women who were head of family (38.5%). Many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well. Some Blacks and mainly Mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of Minas Gerais, once restricted to Whites. This happened through a process of "whitening" their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the White elite, like being members of Catholic brotherhoods.<ref name=chica/>

[[Cohabitation]] was the most common [[crime]] in Minas Gerais. The [[Catholic Church]] was strict in the punishment of this crime, in order to prevent the widespread [[miscegenation]] between White, mostly Portuguese males with Black or Mulatto women.<ref name=chica/>

According to a 2013 autosomal DNA study, the ancestral composition of the state of Minas Gerais can be described as: 59.20% European, 28.90% African and 11.90% Native American <ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145|pmid=24073242|title=Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=9|pages=e75145|year=2013|last1=Saloum De Neves Manta|first1=Fernanda|last2=Pereira|first2=Rui|last3=Vianna|first3=Romulo|last4=Rodolfo Beuttenmüller De Araújo|first4=Alfredo|last5=Leite Góes Gitaí|first5=Daniel|last6=Aparecida Da Silva|first6=Dayse|last7=De Vargas Wolfgramm|first7=Eldamária|last8=Da Mota Pontes|first8=Isabel|last9=Ivan Aguiar|first9=José|last10=Ozório Moraes|first10=Milton|last11=Fagundes De Carvalho|first11=Elizeu|last12=Gusmão|first12=Leonor|pmc=3779230|bibcode=2013PLoSO...875145S}}</ref> A genetic study (with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state, the South of Minas Gerais), suggested that the "Whites" from Minas Gerais would have slightly lower levels of European (at 71%) ancestry among the Brazilian regions and higher levels (at 16%) of African admixture, with significant Amerindian (13%) admixture, the European reference population in the study being 95% European, 2.8% Native American and 2.6% African, which would give an actual percentage of European ancestry of about 75% actual European ancestry, and less than 15% of each, Native American and African ancestries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pena |first1=S.D.J. |last2=Bastos-Rodrigues |first2=L. |last3=Pimenta |first3=J.R. |last4=Bydlowski |first4=S.P. |title=DNA tests probe the genomic ancestry of Brazilians |journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research |date=11 September 2009 |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=870–876 |doi=10.1590/S0100-879X2009005000026 |pmid=19738982 }}</ref>

"A new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine ''American Journal of Human Biology'' by a team of the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lopes |first1=Reinaldo José |title=DNA de brasileiro é 80% europeu, indica estudo |url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ciencia/2009/10/633465-dna-de-brasileiro-e-80-europeu-indica-estudo.shtml |work=Folha de S.Paulo |date=5 October 2009 }}</ref>

During the time of the [[gold rush]], the largest European immigration of the colonial period to all of the Americas, about 600,000 Portuguese immigrated to Brazil during the gold rush, and most of them to Minas Gerais, the place where the gold rush activities took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/index2.html |title=Brasil 500 anos |publisher=Ibge.gov.br |accessdate=2013-06-08 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508154311/http://www.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/index2.html |archive-date=2013-05-08 }}</ref> Most of them came from Entre Douro e Minho, in Northern Portugal.<ref>[http://www.museu-emigrantes.org/Minas-Minho.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011924/http://www.museu-emigrantes.org/Minas-Minho.pdf|date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> The reference book for a large number of these families is "Velhos Troncos Mineiros" (Old Mineiro Branches) by Raimundo Trindade.

Minas Gerais (or simply Minas, as it is commonly called) is a major producer of milk, [[coffee]] and other agricultural commodities, as well as minerals. [[Electronics]] are also produced in Minas. The automakers [[Fiat]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] have factories there. [[Tourism]] is also an important activity for the state: historical cities like [[Ouro Preto]], Mariana, [[Sabará]], Congonhas, Diamantina, Tiradentes, and Sao João del Rey, are major attractions for visitors interested in their colonial architecture. Other cities, like [[Araxá]], [[Poços de Caldas]], Lambari, Caxambu, Lavras, and others, attract visitors interested in their mineral watersprings. [[Eco-tourism]] is a rising economic activity in the state, specially in localities situated on the several [[Serras de Minas Gerais|Serras]] (highlands) that exist in Minas Gerais.
[[File:Valadares .jpg|thumb|Governador Valadares City]]
The state has marked economic divisions. The southern part of the state (close to the [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] state borders) has several mid-sized cities with solid industrial bases such as [[Juiz de Fora]], [[Varginha]], [[Pouso Alegre]], and [[Poços de Caldas]], as well as [[Ipatinga]] in the east of the state, which is also a modern and major industrial city and [[Itabira]], considered mother city of mining company [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]], that has stocks quoted in [[Bovespa]] and [[NYSE]].

There are also large companies installed the automotive industry, as manufacturers [[FIAT]] in [[Betim]], [[IVECO]] in [[Sete Lagoas]] and suppliers of auto-parts, as [[STOLA]] and [[USIPARTS]]. The western part, the "''Triângulo Mineiro''", is less densely populated than the rest of the state, and it is now a focus of [[biotechnology]] investment, particularly on the cities of [[Uberlândia]], [[Uberaba]], [[Patos de Minas]] and [[Araguari]], which includes leading research on cattle, [[soy]] and [[maize|corn]] culture.

In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of [[coffee]], [[sugar cane]] and [[soy]], and also has large productions of [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[beans]], [[sorghum]], [[carrot]], [[potato]], [[banana]], [[tangerine]] and [[strawberry]], in addition to producing [[papaya]], [[persimmon]] and [[yuca]].

In 2020, Minas Gerais was the largest producer of [[Coffea arabica]] in the country, with 74% of the national total (1.9 million tons, or 31.2 million 60-kg bags).

Minas Gerais may be called ''Deep Brazil'' by analogy with ''France profonde''. It has a distinctly more native flavour than cosmopolitan [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], a more traditional slant than flashy [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], and is more Portuguese than the South and São Paulo with their great influx of Italians and other [[Central Europe]]ans, the North with its Native Americans, or the Northeast with its heavy Afro-Brazilian influence.

===People===
[[File:Carlos Drummond de Andrade, 1970.tif|thumb|[[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], considered one the most talented Brazilian poets. He often wrote about [[Itabira]] the interior of the state, the place where he was born and raised and where his parents were from.]]

Those born and raised in Minas Gerais, also called Mineiros, bear an unmistakable accent that sets them apart from fellow Brazilians, although people born in different regions of the state bear slightly different accents, some resembling those of neighboring states, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. They are considered reserved, prudent, relatively silent to the point of melancholy but welcoming and family-focused. It is one of the most religious states, with a large proportion of staunch [[Roman Catholic]]s and a burgeoning [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and neo-[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] population, with pockets of African religions. The [[Spiritist doctrine]] is also professed by a significant portion of the population, partly due to the influence of [[Chico Xavier]], the main spiritual icon of Brazil, who lived in Minas Gerais all his life.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Romeo_e_Julieta_e_doce_de_leite.jpg|thumb|''Romeu e Julieta'' (left; [[Minas cheese|''queijo Minas'']] with [[goiabada]]) and [[Dulce de leche|''doce de leite'']] (right), two sweets typical of Minas Gerais.]]
Minas Gerais is known nationally for its cuisine. The cultural basis of its cuisine is the small farmhouse, and many of the dishes are prepared using locally produced vegetables and meats, especially chicken and pork. Traditional cooking is done using coal- or wood-fired ovens and cast iron pans, making for a particularly tasty flavor; some restaurant chains have adopted these techniques and made this type of food popular in other parts of the country.

Many of the cakes and appetizers of the local cuisine use [[maize|corn]] or [[cassava]] (known there as ''mandioca'') flour instead of wheat, as the latter did not adapt well to the local weather. The best-known dish from Minas Gerais is "[[pão de queijo]]", a small baked roll (known internationally as "Brazilian cheese rolls") made with cheese and cassava flour that can be served hot as an appetizer or for breakfast.

The state is also Brazil's most traditional producer of [[cheese]]. [[Minas cheese]] is renowned nationwide as the distinct Brazilian cheese. [[Cachaça]] is also a local produce of some importance.

The state cuisine is showcased in various festivals year round and in many locations throughout the state, but the biggest festival is the month-long [[Comida de Buteco]] in Belo Horizonte, where 41 bars and restaurants are selected to create a dish using ingredients traditional to local cuisine. People from all over the country and abroad rate the food, the temperature of the beer, the ambiance and service. In 2007, over 400,000 people participated in the festival according to [[Vox Populi]] statistics.

Galinhada is one of the specialities in Minas Gerais. It's basically rice cooked with chicken, corn and peas. Usually, the meal is very spicy. 

===Museums===
[[File:Inhotim yayoi kusama 05.jpg|thumbnail|Yayoi Kusama at the [[Inhotim]] in [[Brumadinho]]]]
[[Mariano Procópio Museum]], in [[Juiz de Fora]], and [[Centro de Arte Contemporânea Inhotim]], in [[Brumadinho]], are among the most important cultural institutions.

===Music===
Music is one of the most striking features of Minas Gerais and has been part of the history of the state since the early 16th and 17th centuries.

From the 18th century, composers including [[Jose Joaquim Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], [[Marcos Coelho Neto]] and [[Manoel de Oliveira Dias]] reinforced the musical tradition of Minas with the composition of baroque pieces that are now revered as masterpieces. For classical music, the state features productions and performances of various orchestras and choirs.

Among them there are the Symphonic Orchestra of Minas Gerais and the Coral Lírico de Minas Gerais, a State Choir, maintained by Clovis Salgado Foundation, an institution linked to the Secretary of State for Culture. These and other groups have a strong presence in the capital and throughout the state, working for the popularization and democratization of classical music. One of the most prolific contemporary composers was born in Minas Gerais, Prof. Dr. Andersen Viana, which music has been recognized most frequently abroad.

The most varied rhythms and sounds have their origins in the state. [[Ary Barroso]], who in 1939 composed one of Brazil's best known songs throughout the world, [[Aquarela do Brasil]], was born in [[Ubá]], in the Zona da Mata Mineira.
[[File:Milton Nascimento.tif|left|thumb|[[Milton Nascimento]], one of the most iconic musicians of Minas Gerais, 17 March 1969.]]
In the 1960s and 70s streets in the traditional neighborhood of Santa Tereza, Belo Horizonte, were the scene of one of the most important movements of national music: [[Clube da Esquina]]. With a unique blend of Brazilian popular music with pop and jazz, the Club was met with talents like [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Wagner Tiso]], [[Toninho Horta]], [[Fernando Brant]], [[Lô Borges]], Beto Guedes, and Flávio Venturini.

In the 1980s and 90s a scene of Heavy Metal bands has been held in Belo Horizonte. It's the origin of important Brazilian bands of this genre, many of them are known worldwide, such as [[Sepultura]], [[Sarcófago]], Overdose, [[Mutilator]], [[Holocausto (band)|Holocausto]] and [[Chakal]].

The current scenario continues reflecting the vibrancy and dynamism of its culture. A new generation of artists is represented by names like [[Skank (band)|Skank]], [[Pato Fu]], [[Jota Quest]], Vander Lee, [[Uakti (band)|Uakti]], Marina Machado, Maurício Tizumba, Berimbrown, Copo Lagoinha and [[Amaranto]].

Moving freely through different rhythms like rock, reggae, heavy metal, [[samba]] and [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]], among others, the music in Minas Gerais continues the excellence and diversity that has always been a staple in the country.

The important International Festival of Colonial Brazilian Music and Ancient Music takes place in Juiz de Fora since 1989.

Brazil's most prestigious dance company, Grupo Corpo is also from Minas Gerais, having its headquarters in Belo Horizonte.

===Famous personalities===
Many famous Brazilian writers were born in Minas Gerais: [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], [[Fernando Sabino]], [[Pedro Nava (writer)|Pedro Nava]], [[Murilo Mendes]] and [[João Guimarães Rosa]]. Aviation pioneer [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] was born in Minas Gerais, as well as various politicians, such as Presidents [[Afonso Pena]], [[Venceslau Brás]], [[Delfim Moreira]], [[Artur Bernardes]], [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], [[Tancredo Neves]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]]. Former president [[Itamar Franco]] is usually included in lists of presidents born in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, but he was actually born prematurely in a ship travelling in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Current UFC fighters, Middleweight [[Paulo Costa (fighter)]] and Light Heavyweight [[Glover Teixeira]] were born in Minas Geiras too. Minas Gerais is often recognized abroad as the state where the [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] [[Pelé]] was born (he has lived in the state of São Paulo since childhood, though).

==Infrastructure==

===Airport===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:International Airport of BH.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tancredo Neves International Airport|Tancredo Neves/Confins International Airport]]. {{Deletable image-caption|date=March 2012}}]] -->
[[Tancredo Neves International Airport]] is located in the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and Confins, 38&nbsp;km (23&nbsp;mi) from Belo Horizonte, and was opened in January 1984. It was planned from the start for future expansion in steps to meet growing demand. The [[airport]] has one of the lowest rates of shutdown for bad [[weather]] in the country. However, the Confins airport was not using much of its capacity until 2005, when it was decided that a large part of the Pampulha Airport [[flight]]s (which is smaller and located inside Belo Horizonte's urban area) would move to [[Confins]].

The first step was undertaken with careful concern for the environment, including monitoring by specialized consultants, since the region has a rich [[archeological]] heritage. Among the hundreds of caverns in the region, the one at Lapa Vermelha stands out. Located 2.7&nbsp;km (1.6&nbsp;mi) from the airport, the oldest female [[Human cranium|cranium]] in the Americans was discovered there, dated at roughly 12 thousand years old. Confins is certified by the [[ISO 9001]] standard, covering ten processes in the administrative, operational, safety/security and maintenance areas.

The Tancredo Neves International Airport is currently the fifth busiest airport in the country, after [[São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport|Guarulhos]], [[São Paulo-Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]], [[Brasília International Airport|Brasília]] and [[Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport|Galeão]]. It is a main hub for [[Azul Brazilian Airlines|Azul]]. In addition to direct flights to over 40 destinations in Brazil, it also has regular scheduled international services to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Panama City]], [[Miami]] and [[Lisbon]].

In 2014 the airport was auctioned to the private sector. Renovations were concluded in 2016. A new terminal was built with 17 new jetways, increasing the airport's capacity to 22 million passengers a year and the runway is undergoing expansion. A new runway is planned to be built by 2020.

===Administrative center===
[[File:Cidade Administrativa MG 1.jpg|thumb|[[Palácio Tiradentes]], the seat of government of Minas Gerais]]
A new [[Administrative Center, Minas Gerais|Administrative Center]] (Cidade Administrativa de Minas Gerais) was completed in March 2010, for the state of Minas Gerais. Designed by the internationally renowned architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]], the center consists of four large buildings on an 800,000 square meter site. Two buildings accommodate 17 of the state ministries, the third building consists of an auditorium, with capacity for 540 guests. The fourth and most impressive building is the "Palacio do Governo", which is the world's largest [[suspended structure]], built in [[reinforced concrete]]. The building has a 150m span and its roof is supported by 4 columns.

===Highways===
[[File:Rodovia Fernão Dias.jpg|thumb|[[Rodovia Fernão Dias|Fernão Dias highway]]]]
Minas Gerais is the Brazilian state that harbors the highest mileage of highways. The state highway network is 269,545 kilometers, of which only 11,396 on federal roads and 21,472 on state highways and state coincide, corresponding to all other municipal roads. Because of its central position, the state is crossed by the most important national highways, like [[BR-116]] (Rio-Bahia), [[BR-040]] (Rio-Brasília) and others. Many of the most important Brazilian routes cross the state and, for this reason, it counts the greater proportion of car accidents per capita.

==Flag==
The flag of the state of Minas Gerais is the oldest one adopted in Brazil that was devised by Brazilians. It was remembered by the Republican Party, which opposed the Brazilian [[Brazilian Empire|Imperial Government]], and adopted unofficially as the flag of the state. It has been the official state flag since 1963.<ref name=flag>[http://www.mg.gov.br/governomg/portal/c/governomg/conheca-minas/5661-nossos-simbolos/26841-bandeira/5146/5044 Minas Flag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215093901/http://www.mg.gov.br/governomg/portal/c/governomg/conheca-minas/5661-nossos-simbolos/26841-bandeira/5146/5044 |date=2012-12-15 }}, Minas Gerais Government {{in lang|pt}}</ref>
[[File:Belo Horizonte Panorâmica.jpg|thumb|[[Belo Horizonte]]]]

The flag's Latin inscription, "Libertas quæ sera tamen", means "Freedom albeit late", and was the motto of the [[Inconfidência Mineira]], which fought for Minas' independence from Portugal in the 18th century. The phrase was taken from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' 1.30. The triangle is said to represent the [[Holy Trinity]].<ref name=flag /> The colors were chosen for their revolutionary meaning: white represents the desire to form a peaceful nation, discarding all colonial institutions, and red the flame of liberty or the blood of the revolutionary martyrs such as Tiradentes.
