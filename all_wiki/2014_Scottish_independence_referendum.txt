A referendum took place on Thursday 18 September 2014 on [[Scottish independence]] from the United Kingdom.<!-- no bolding per [[WP:BOLDTITLE]] --><ref name="BBC 2013-03-21">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21828424|title=Scottish independence: Referendum to be held on 18 September, 2014|date=21 March 2013|accessdate=13 March 2018|website=BBC News |publisher=BBC}}</ref> The referendum question was, "Should Scotland be an independent country?", which voters answered with "Yes" or "No".<ref>{{cite web |title=Scottish independence referendum – GOV.UK |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/scottish-independence-referendum/about |website=www.gov.uk |accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref> The "No" side won with 2,001,926 (55.3%) voting against independence and 1,617,989 (44.7%) voting in favour. The turnout of 84.6% was the highest recorded for an election or referendum in the United Kingdom since the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]], which was held before the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].

The [[Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013]] set out the arrangements for the referendum and was passed by the Scottish Parliament in November 2013, following an [[Edinburgh Agreement (2012)|agreement]] between the devolved Scottish government and the Government of the United Kingdom. The independence proposal required a simple majority to pass. All European Union (EU) or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizens residing in Scotland age 16 or over could vote, with some exceptions, which produced a total electorate of almost 4,300,000 people. This was the first time that the electoral franchise was extended to include 16 and 17 year-olds in Scotland.

[[Yes Scotland]] was the main campaign group for independence, while [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] was the main campaign group in favour of maintaining the union. Many [[List of endorsements in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum|other campaign groups]], political parties, businesses, newspapers, and prominent individuals were also involved. Prominent issues raised during the referendum included what currency an independent Scotland would use, public expenditure, EU membership, and [[North Sea oil]]. An exit poll revealed that retention of the pound sterling was the deciding factor for those who voted No, while "disaffection with Westminster politics" was the deciding factor for those who voted Yes.<ref name="AshcroftExitPoll"/>

==History==

===Formation of the United Kingdom===
{{Main|History of the formation of the United Kingdom}}

The [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[Kingdom of England]] were established as independent countries during the [[Middle Ages]]. After fighting a [[Wars of Scottish Independence|series of wars]] during the 14th century, the two monarchies entered a [[personal union]] in 1603 (the [[Union of the Crowns]]) when [[James VI of Scotland]] also became James I of England. The two nations were temporarily united under one government when [[Oliver Cromwell]] was declared [[Lord Protector]] of a [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] in 1653, but this was dissolved when the monarchy was [[restoration (England)|restored]] in 1660. Scotland and England [[Acts of Union 1707|united]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707. Factors in favour of union were, on the Scottish side, the economic problems caused by the failure of the [[Darien scheme]] and, on the English, securing the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Hanoverian line of succession]]. Great Britain in turn [[Acts of Union 1800|united]] with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1801, forming the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Most of Ireland left the Union in 1922 to form the [[Irish Free State]]; consequently, the full name of the United Kingdom since 1927 is the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''.

===Devolution===
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was committed to home rule for Scotland in the 1920s, but it slipped down its agenda in the following years.<ref name="devo hist">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/scotland_99/the_scottish_parliament/306850.stm |title=Devolution's swings and roundabouts |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 April 1999 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) was founded in 1934, but did not achieve significant electoral success until the 1960s.<ref name="devo hist"/> A document calling for home rule, the [[Scottish Covenant]], was signed by 2,000,000 people (out of a population of 5,000,000) in the late-1940s.<ref name="devo hist"/> Home rule, now known as [[Scottish devolution]], did not become a serious proposal until the late 1970s as the Labour Government of [[James Callaghan]] came under electoral pressure from the SNP.<ref name="devo hist"/>

A proposal for a devolved [[Scottish Assembly]] was put to a [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum in 1979]]. A narrow majority of votes were cast in favour of devolution, but this had no effect due to a requirement that the number voting 'Yes' had to exceed 40% of the total electorate.<ref name="1979 referendum">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/79referendums.shtml |title=The 1979 Referendums |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 January 2012}}</ref>

No further constitutional reform was proposed until Labour returned to power in a landslide electoral victory in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|May 1997]]. A [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|second Scottish devolution referendum]] was held later that year, as promised in the Labour election manifesto.<ref name="1997 referendum"/> Clear majorities expressed support for both a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] (74.3% in favour) and that Parliament having the power to [[Scottish variable rate|vary]] the basic rate of [[UK income tax|income tax]] (63.5% in favour).<ref name="1997 referendum">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/devolution/scotland/live/index.shtml |title=Scottish Referendum Live&nbsp;– The Results |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 January 2012}}</ref> The [[Scotland Act 1998]] established the new Scottish Parliament, [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elected]] on 6 May 1999,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or010104.htm#Col7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315174055/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or010104.htm#Col7 |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 March 2005 |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report – 12 May 1999 |publisher=Scottish Parliament }}</ref> with power to legislate on [[Reserved matter|unreserved matters]] within Scotland.

A commitment to hold an independence referendum in 2010 was part of the SNP's [[election manifesto]] when it contested the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]].<ref name=Manifesto12Apr2007/> The press were largely hostile towards the SNP, with a headline for ''[[The Scottish Sun]]'' in May 2007 stating – along with an image of a hangman's noose – "Vote SNP today and you put Scotland's head in the noose".<ref name = "Guardian 3May2007">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/03/theheatofthescottishsun |title=The heat of the Scottish sun |first=Iain |last=Macwhirter |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 May 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref> As a result of that election, the SNP became the largest party in the Scottish Parliament and formed a [[minority government]] led by the First Minister, [[Alex Salmond]].<ref name = "timeline">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19907675 |title=Timeline: Scottish independence referendum |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=15 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

The SNP administration launched a '[[National Conversation]]' as a consultation exercise in August 2007, part of which included a draft referendum bill, the ''Referendum (Scotland) Bill''.<ref name = "timeline"/><ref name=DraftBill2007/> After this, a [[white paper]] for the proposed Referendum Bill was published, on 30 November 2009.<ref name=Independent30Nov09SNPReveals/><ref name=ScottishGovernment30Nov09NewsYSYV/> It detailed 4 possible scenarios, with the text of the Bill and Referendum to be revealed later.<ref name=Independent30Nov09SNPReveals/> The scenarios were: no change; devolution per the [[Commission on Scottish Devolution|Calman Review]]; further devolution; and full independence.<ref name=Independent30Nov09SNPReveals/> The Scottish government published a draft version of the bill on 25 February 2010 for public consultation;<ref name=BBC25Feb2010Published/><ref name=ScottishGovernmentNews25Feb2010ReferendumConsultation/> ''Scotland's Future: Draft Referendum (Scotland) Bill Consultation Paper'' contained a consultation document and a draft version of the bill.<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/> The consultation paper set out the proposed ballot papers, the mechanics of the proposed referendum, and how the proposed referendum was to be regulated.<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/> Public responses were invited.<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultation25Feb2010/>

The bill outlined three proposals: the first was full devolution or 'devolution max', suggesting that the Scottish Parliament should be responsible for "all laws, taxes and duties in Scotland", except for "defence and foreign affairs; financial regulation, monetary policy and the currency", which would be retained by the UK government.<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/> The second proposal outlined Calman-type fiscal reform, gaining the additional powers and responsibilities of setting a Scottish rate of income tax that could vary by up to 10p in the [[Pound sterling|pound]] compared with the rest of the UK, setting the rate of [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom|stamp duty land tax]] and "other minor taxes", and introducing new taxes in Scotland with the agreement of the UK Parliament, and finally, "limited power to borrow money".<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/> The third proposal was for full independence.<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/>

In the [[3rd Scottish Parliament]] only 50 of 129 MSPs (47 SNP, 2 [[Scottish Green Party|Greens]], and [[Margo MacDonald]]) supported a referendum.<ref name=BBCQnA3Sep09/><ref name=Times3Sep09/> The Scottish government withdrew the bill in September 2010, after failing to secure opposition support.<ref name="timeline"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11196967 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |title=Scottish independence plan 'an election issue' |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

In the House of Lords, [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|Baroness Symons]] argued that the rest of the UK should be allowed to vote on Scottish independence because it would affect the whole country.

===Legality of a referendum===
There was debate as to whether the Scottish Parliament had the power to legislate for a referendum relating to the issue of Scottish independence, as the constitution is a matter reserved to the UK Parliament.<ref name=BBCQnA3Sep09/> The Scottish government insisted in 2010 that they could legislate for a referendum, as it would be an "advisory referendum on extending the powers of the Scottish Parliament",<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultation25Feb2010/> whose result would "have no legal effect on the Union".<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/>{{rp|17}} Lord Wallace, Advocate General for Scotland, said in January 2012 that holding a referendum concerning the constitution would be outside the legislative power of the Scottish Parliament<ref name="contrary">{{cite news |url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/politics/advocate-general-says-snp-s-referendum-plans-would-be-contrary-to-the-rule-of-law-1.49938|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109184938/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/politics/advocate-general-says-snp-s-referendum-plans-would-be-contrary-to-the-rule-of-law-1.49938|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 January 2014 |title=Advocate General says SNP's referendum plans would be 'contrary to the rule of law' |newspaper=The Courier |publisher=DC Thomson |first=David |last=Clegg |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Whitaker |url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/politics/scottish_independence_referendum_publish_legal_advice_or_be_damned_snp_warned_over_referendum_1_2061982 |title=Scottish independence referendum: Publish legal advice or be damned, SNP warned over referendum |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2012 |publisher=Johnston Press}}</ref> and that private individuals could challenge a Scottish Parliament referendum bill.<ref name="wallace">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16638746 |title=Scottish independence: Referendum vote 'needs approval' |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref>

The two governments signed the [[Edinburgh Agreement (2012)|Edinburgh Agreement]], which allowed for the temporary transfer of legal authority. Per the Edinburgh Agreement, the UK government drafted an [[Order in Council]] granting the Scottish Parliament the necessary powers to hold, on or before 31 December 2014, an independence referendum. The draft Order was approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, and the Order ("The Scotland Act 1998 (Modification of Schedule 5) Order 2013"), was approved by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at a meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 12 February 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/242/pdfs/uksi_20130242_en.pdf |title=2013 No. 242 Constitutional Law :Devolution Scotland |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> Under the powers temporarily transferred from Westminster under the section 30 Order, the Scottish Parliament adopted the [[Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2013/14/pdfs/asp_20130014_en.pdf |title=Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> The Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 14 November 2013 and received [[Royal Assent]] on 17 December 2013.

===Electoral supervision===
The [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] was responsible for overseeing the referendum, "with the exception of the conduct of the poll and announcement of the result, and the giving of grants. In its role of regulating the campaign and campaign spending, the Electoral Commission will report to the Scottish Parliament. (...)

===Campaign structures===
====Cost and funding====
In the 2010 Draft Bill, the Scottish government proposed that there would be one designated campaign organisation for each outcome, both of which would be permitted to spend up to £750,000 on their campaign and to send one free [[mailshot]] to every household or voter in the referendum franchise. There was to be no public funding for campaigns. Registered political parties were each to be allowed to spend £100,000.<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/> This proposed limit on party spending was increased to £250,000 in 2012.<ref name="campaign cash battle">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-independence-salmond-in-campaign-cash-battle-1-2573978 |first=Eddie |last=Barnes |title=Scottish independence: Salmond in campaign cash battle |newspaper=Scotland on Sunday |publisher=Johnston Publishing |date=14 October 2012 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, new proposals by the Electoral Commission for the 16-week regulated period preceding the poll were accepted. They allowed the two designated campaign organisations to spend up to £1.5 million each and for the parties in Scotland to spend the following amounts: £1,344,000 (SNP); £834,000 (Labour); £396,000 (Conservatives); £201,000 (Liberal Democrats); £150,000 (Greens).<ref name = "new question"/> An unlimited number of other organisations could register with the Electoral Commission, but their spending was limited to £150,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27228971 |title=Scottish independence: Questions raised over campaign spending rules |first=Lucy |last=Adams |publisher=BBC |website=BBC News |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> Groups spending more than £250,000 were required to submit audited returns to the Commission by 18 March 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32735695 |title=Scottish independence referendum campaigners spent £6.7m |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=14 May 2015 |accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

According to the Scottish government's consultation paper published on 25 February 2010, the cost of the referendum was "likely to be around £9.5 million", mostly spent on running the poll and the count. Costs would also include the posting of one neutral information leaflet about the referendum to every Scottish household, and one free mailshot to every household or voter in the poll for the designated campaign organisations.<ref name=ScottishGovernmentReferendumBillConsultationPaper25Feb2010/> In April 2013, the projected cost of the referendum was £13.3 million;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22014286 |title=Scottish independence: Referendum cost estimated at £13.3m |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref> the final administrative cost was £15.85 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/04/scottish-independence-referendum-cost-more-than-expected |first=Severin |last=Carrell |title=Scottish independence referendum cost £2m more than expected |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 September 2015 |accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref>

==Issues==
===Agriculture===
In 2013, as part of a European Union (EU) member state, Scottish farmers received £583 million in subsidy payments from the EU under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP).<ref name="farmers views">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27201675 |title=Scottish independence: Farmers give their views on referendum debate |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC|date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=30 April 2014 |first=Laura |last=Bicker}}</ref> Annual CAP payments are made to the UK, which then determines how much to allocate to each of the devolved administrations, including Scotland.<ref name="farmers impact">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27195830 |title=Scottish independence:How might a 'Yes' vote impact on farmers? |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=30 April 2014 |first=Colletta |last=Smith}}</ref> In the last CAP agreement, farmers in the UK qualified for additional convergence payments because Scottish farmers received a lower average single farm payment per hectare, mainly due to the mountainous terrain in Scotland.<ref name="farmers impact"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/Scotland-s-CAP-budget-cut-5f7.aspx |title=Scotland's CAP budget cut |publisher=Scottish Government |date=8 November 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> Supporters of independence therefore believed that an independent Scotland would receive greater agricultural subsidies as an independent state.<ref name="farmers impact"/> Opponents of independence believed that Scottish farmers benefited from the Union because the UK was one of the larger EU member states, and therefore had a greater say in CAP negotiations.<ref name="farmers impact"/> They also questioned whether an independent Scotland would immediately receive full subsidy payments from the EU, as recent new member states had their subsidies phased in.<ref name="farmers impact"/>

===Border controls and immigration===
[[File:England_-_Scotland_border_-_geograph.org.uk_-_477405.jpg|thumb|The Scottish government proposed that there would be no border controls on the [[Anglo–Scottish border]].]]
At the time of the independence referendum, the UK had some [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-outs from EU policies]]. One was the opt-out from the [[Schengen Area]], meaning there were full passport checks for travellers from other EU countries except the [[Republic of Ireland]], which was part of a [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA) with the UK. The Scottish government proposed that an independent Scotland would remain outside the Schengen Area and remain inside the CTA,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/11/5894/16 |title=Annex 7: Schengen and the Common Travel Area |accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref><ref name = "guardian border"/> ensuring that no passport controls would be needed at the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. Nicola Sturgeon commented that an independent Scotland would negotiate with the EU to have the same visa arrangements as the UK has.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/uc643-iv/uc643.pdf |title=The Foreign Policy Implications of and for an Independent Scotland |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref>

[[Alistair Carmichael]], the Secretary of State for Scotland, said in January 2014 that it would make sense for Scotland to be in the CTA, but it would have to operate similar immigration policies to the rest of the UK.<ref name="guardian border"/> This position was supported by Home Secretary [[Theresa May]], who said in March 2014 that passport checks should be introduced if Scotland adopted a looser immigration policy.<ref name="guardian border">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/14/passport-checks-needed-between-independent-scotland-and-england |title=Theresa May would seek passport checks between Scotland and England |first=Severin |last=Carrell |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> The Conservative MP [[Richard Bacon (politician)|Richard Bacon]] said there would be "no reason" for border controls to be implemented.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etwumT54Vik |title=Tory MP rubbishes border claims |date=4 November 2013 |accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref>

===Childcare===
In the white paper ''Scotland's Future'', the Scottish government pledged to expand childcare provision in an independent Scotland.<ref name="childcare">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25114249 |title=Scottish independence: Alex Salmond outlines childcare 'savings' |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-26587040 |title=Scottish independence: Could Scotland afford better childcare? |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The paper stated that this policy would cost £700 million, but that this would be financed by increased tax revenue from an additional 100,000 women returning to work.<ref name="childcare"/>

Scottish Labour leader [[Johann Lamont]] said that the policy should be implemented immediately if the Scottish government believed it would have a beneficial effect,<ref name="childcare"/> but Alex Salmond responded that under devolution the costs of the policy would have to be financed by cuts elsewhere in public expenditure.<ref name="childcare"/> In March 2014, the National Day Nurseries Association said that the plan could not be implemented unless greater funding was provided by local authorities to private nurseries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-26033775 |title=Scottish independence: childcare plan 'unworkable' without more funds |first=Marianne |last=Taylor |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> A report by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre questioned the economic benefit of the policy, pointing out that there were only 64,000 mothers of children aged between 1 and 5 who were economically inactive.<ref name="inactive">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26877767 |title=Scottish independence: Scottish government childcare plan questioned |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> A spokesman for Salmond said that the estimated total 104,000 women would enter the workforce over a longer period, as future generations of mothers would also be able to work, stating: "The key point about the policy is that it doesn't happen on one day or one year and then cease."<ref name="inactive"/>

===Citizenship===
The Scottish government proposed that all British citizens who had been born in Scotland would automatically become Scottish citizens on the date of independence, regardless of whether or not they were then living in Scotland. British citizens "habitually resident" in Scotland would also be considered Scottish citizens, even if they already held the citizenship of another country. Every person who would automatically be considered a Scottish citizen would be able to opt-out of Scottish citizenship provided they already held the citizenship of another country.<ref name="citizens">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scotland-citizenship-passport-plans-outlined-1-3209022 |title=Scotland citizenship, passport plans outlined |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=27 November 2013 |newspaper=The Scotsman |publisher=Johnston Publishing}}</ref> The Scottish government also proposed that anyone with a Scottish parent or grandparent would be able to apply for registration as a Scottish citizen, and any foreign national living in Scotland legally, or who had lived in Scotland for at least 10 years at any time and had an ongoing connection to Scotland, should be able to apply for naturalisation as a Scottish citizen.<ref name="citizens"/> UK Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] said the future policies of an independent Scottish government would affect whether Scottish citizens would be allowed to retain British citizenship.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/key-questions-on-independence-white-paper-answered-1-3209904 |title=Key questions on independence white paper answered |date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=27 November 2013 |newspaper=The Scotsman}}</ref> An analysis paper published by the UK government in January 2014 stated that it was likely that Scots would be able to hold dual citizenship;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/scots-to-stay-british-despite-vote.23257477 |title=Scots to stay British despite vote |first=Magnus |last=Gardham |newspaper=The Herald |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> however, the duality was considered for all other countries, not specifically to the rest of the UK.

===Defence===

Peter Jackson, professor of security at the [[University of Glasgow]], agreed that [[Special Branch]] could form a "suitable nucleus" of a Scottish equivalent of MI5 and that Scotland could forego creating an equivalent of [[MI6]], instead "relying on pooled intelligence or diplomatic open sources" like Canada or the [[Nordic countries]].<ref name="spy">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/spy-wars.21480718 |newspaper=The Herald |title=Spy wars |first=David |last=Leask |date=30 June 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref> [[Meta Ramsay, Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale|Baroness Ramsay]], a Labour peer and former case officer with MI6, said that the Scottish government's standpoint on intelligence was "extremely naïve" and that it was "not going to be as simple as they think".<ref name="spy" /> Nicola Sturgeon stated that Scotland would create a security service like MI5 to work alongside police and tackle terrorism, cyber-attacks and serious organised crime.<ref name="sturgeon embassies">{{cite news|first=Scott |last=MacNab |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/sturgeon-100-embassies-for-independent-scotland-1-2763247 |title=Sturgeon: '100 embassies' for independent Scotland |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref> She also stated that creating an external intelligence agency would remain an option.<ref name="sturgeon embassies" />

[[Deutsche Bank]] issued a report in the week before the referendum in which David Folkerts-Landau, the bank's chief economist, concluded: "While it may sound simple and costless for a nation to exit a 300-year-old union, nothing could be further from the truth". Folkerts-Landau claimed that the economic prospects after a "yes" vote were "incomprehensible," and cited [[Winston Churchill]]'s 1925 [[Monetary reform#Return to the gold standard|Gold Standard]] decision and the actions of America's [[Federal Reserve]] that triggered the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, as mistakes of a similar magnitude.

Another major economic issue was the currency that would be used by an independent Scotland.<ref name=issue>{{cite web |url=http://diplomatonline.com/mag/2012/04/the-case-for-scottish-independence/ |title=The case for Scottish independence |website=diplomatonline.com |date=12 April 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2012}}</ref> The principal options were to establish an independent Scottish currency, join the [[euro]], or retain the [[pound sterling]]<ref name="issue"/> (a form of [[currency substitution]]).<ref name="adamsm">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28869991 |title=Scottish independence: Scotland should use pound, says Adam Smith Institute |date=21 August 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 August 2014 |quote=[A] new report, written by the research director of the Adam Smith Institute, Sam Bowman, argued that sterlingization – using the pound without the use of a central bank – would be 'a significant improvement on Scotland's current arrangements'.}}</ref>

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the SNP's policy was that an independent Scotland should adopt the euro,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2002/jan/snp-accuse-labour-over-euro |website=www.snp.org |publisher=Scottish National Party |title=SNP Accuse Labour Over Euro |date=3 January 2002 |accessdate=18 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222033541/http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2002/jan/snp-accuse-labour-over-euro |archive-date=22 February 2014 }}</ref> though this was relegated to a long-term rather than short-term goal by the party's 2009 conference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8311435.stm |title=SNP European divisions laid bare |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 October 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/6376900/SNP-split-over-euro-membership.html |title=SNP split over euro membership |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=22 January 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |first=Simon |last=Johnson}}</ref> There was disagreement over whether Scotland would be required to join the euro if it became an EU member state in its own right. All new members are required to commit to joining the single currency as a prerequisite of EU membership, but they must first be party to [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|ERM II]] for two years. The Scottish government argued that this was a ''de facto'' opt-out from the euro, because EU member states are not obliged to join ERM II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/11/5894/15 |title=Scotland in the European Union |accessdate=31 December 2013 |publisher=Scottish Government}}</ref> For example, the people of [[Sweden and the euro|Sweden rejected adopting the euro]] in a [[2003 Swedish euro referendum|2003 referendum]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3108292.stm |title=Sweden says No to euro |date=15 September 2003 |accessdate=24 March 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC}}</ref> and its government subsequently refused to enter ERM II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riksbank.se/en/Press-and-published/Press-Releases/1998/EU-central-bank-agreement-on-ERM-II-operating-procedures/ |title=EU central bank agreement on ERM II operating procedures |publisher=Sveriges Riksbank |accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>

The SNP favoured continued use of sterling in an independent Scotland through a formal currency union with the UK, with the [[Bank of England]] setting its interest rates and monetary policy and acting as its central bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/26/scotland-share-uk-liabilities-currency-union-independence |title=Scotland could refuse to accept UK liabilities if currency union is blocked |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> The white paper ''Scotland's Future'' identified five key reasons that a currency union "would be in both Scotland and the UK's interests immediately post-independence": Scotland's main trading partner is the UK (⅔ of exports in 2011); "companies operating in Scotland and the UK [...have] complex cross-border supply chains"; there is high labour mobility; "on key measurements of an optimal currency area, the Scottish and UK economies score well"; and short-term economic trends in the UK and Scotland have "a relatively high degree of synchronicity".<ref name = "white paper"/>

====Hands Across The Border====
'''Hands Across The Border''' was a campaign founded in support of Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom. The campaign was the idea of Conservative politician [[Rory Stewart]], MP for [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and The Border]]. In July 2014, the campaign initiated the construction of a large [[cairn]] on the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] at [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]].

At the launch of the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign in May 2012, Alex Salmond said that the case for independence would be driven by community activism and "online wizardry".<ref>{{cite web |title=Scottish independence: One million Scots urged to sign 'yes' declaration |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18162832 |accessdate=24 August 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=25 May 2012}}</ref>

The not-for-profit and non-partisan ''What Scotland Thinks'' project tracked poll and survey data, including online activity, during the referendum campaign.

Professor [[John Curtice]] stated in January 2012 that polling showed support for independence at 32%–38% of the Scottish population, which represented a slight decline from 2007, when the SNP had first formed the Scottish government.<ref name="poll research" /> By 2012, there had been no poll evidence of majority support for independence, although the share "vehemently opposed to independence" had declined.<ref name="poll research">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16473265 |title=Q&A: Scottish independence row |publisher=BBC |website=BBC News |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref> According to Curtice, the polls were stable during most of 2013, with "no" leading by an average of 17% with a year to go.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24124631 |title=Scottish independence: What have the polls been saying? |first=John |last=Curtice |publisher=BBC |website=BBC News |date=18 September 2013 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref> Polling expert [[Nate Silver]] said in 2013 that the yes campaign had "virtually no chance" of winning the referendum.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/13/nate-silver-scottish-independence-referendum |title=Scottish independence campaign has almost no chance, says Nate Silver |first=Charlotte |last=Higgins |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref> After the referendum, Silver said that although his prediction had been proven "right" he had done little research beforehand.<ref name = "silver post">{{cite web |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/scotland-independence-referendum-polls-bad/ |title=The Scotland Independence Polls Were Pretty Bad |website=FiveThirtyEight |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>

The gap narrowed after the release of the Scottish government white paper on independence: an average of five polls in December 2013 and January 2014 gave 39% yes and 61% no, once 'don't knows' had been excluded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25917726 |title=Scottish independence: Are referendum polls on the move? |publisher=BBC |website=BBC News |date=27 January 2014 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref> The polls tightened further after the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]], stated in February that the UK government was opposed to a currency union; the average yes support increased to 43%, once 'don't knows' had been excluded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2014/03/yougov-reports-its-highest-yes-vote-yet/ |title=YouGov Reports Its Highest Yes Vote Yet |website=www.whatscotlandthinks.org |publisher=ScotCen Social Research |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=15 April 2014 |first=John |last=Curtice}}</ref> There was little movement in the following months, with the average continuing to show 43% yes and 57% no (excluding don't knows) in July 2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2014/07/tns-bmrb-portray-a-referendum-campaign-becalmed/ |title=TNS BMRB Portray a Referendum Campaign Becalmed |first=John |last=Curtice |website=www.whatscotlandthinks.org |publisher=ScotCen Social Research |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref> and August 2014.<ref name="aug 2014 summary">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28921754 |title=Scottish independence: 'Invaluable second chance' for Alex Salmond |publisher=BBC |website=BBC News |first=John |last=Curtice |date=25 August 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>

In early September, polls indicated that the vote would be closer than had been indicated earlier. On 6 September a [[YouGov]] poll gave those in favour 47% versus 45% for those against; excluding those undecided, the figures were 51% and 49%, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29096458 |title=Scottish independence: Vote 'will go to the wire' |publisher=BBC |website=BBC News |date=7 September 2014 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> The final polls, taken in the last few days of the campaign, indicated a lead for No of between 4% and 6%.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/18/final-poll-scottish-referendum-campaign |title=Scottish Final poll of Scottish referendum campaign shows six-point lead for no |first=Patrick |last=Wintour |newspaper=The Guardian |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> No [[exit poll]] was conducted.

Writing after the referendum, Nate Silver pointed out that the final margin of victory for No was greater than that indicated by the opinion polls.<ref name = "silver post"/> He suggested that this could have been due to less enthusiastic voters being more pro-Union, which may not have been reflected in the polls.<ref name = "silver post"/> Stephen Fisher, a sociology professor at [[Oxford University]], noted in a study of other constitutional referendums that pollsters had tended to overestimate the "Yes" option.<ref name = "ukparlbriefing">{{cite news |title=Scottish Independence Referendum 2014 – Commons Library Briefing |publisher=UK Parliament }}</ref>

==Voting==
===Administration===
The Scottish Independence Referendum Bill identified the Convener of the Electoral Management Board for Scotland as Chief Counting Officer for the referendum.<ref name="ccoa">[http://www.electionsscotland.info/emb/download/downloads/id/52/count_timing_for_2014_scottish_independence_referendum Report of 30 August 2013: Scottish Independence Referendum: The Chief Counting Officer's Approach], Accessed 14 September 2014</ref> The Chief Counting Officer, [[Mary Pitcaithly]],<ref name="hfpss">[http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=58768&sID=25275 Handbook for polling station staff], Accessed 14 September 2014</ref> was supported by a Counting Officer in each of the [[Council areas of Scotland|32 local authority areas of Scotland]],<ref name="hfpss" /> who was typically the Chief Executive for that local authority. Each Counting Officer had a referendum team, which included:
* Electoral Registration Officers. They compiled and maintained the electoral register and lists of postal and proxy voters.<ref name="hfpss"/>
* Presiding Officers (one per polling place).<ref name="hfpss" /> They were responsible for the overall management of the polling place.
* Poll Clerks.<ref name="hfpss" /> They assisted the Presiding Officer at their polling place.
* Polling Station Inspectors (optional).<ref name="hfpss" /> They toured the area polling stations (the specific part/room of the polling place in which votes were cast).

===Voting places and times===
Voting took place between 07:00 and 22:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-17/scotland-votes-as-u-k-s-future-hangs-in-the-balance.html |date=18 September 2014 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=18 September 2014 |title=Scotland Votes as U.K.'s Future Hangs in the Balance}}</ref> in "[[polling place]]s",<ref name="hfpss"/> which included schools, church halls, libraries and community centres.

===Count of votes===
Counting began after polls closed. Votes from the 32 local government areas were counted and announced by each area separately.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scotland's referendum count: When to expect what |first1=Martin |last1=Stabe |first2=Aleksandra |last2=Wisniewska |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e718e2b8-3e59-11e4-a620-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Scottish independence: Guide to Scotland referendum night |first=Vanessa |last=Barford |work=BBC News |date=15 September 2014 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29176884 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> Results came in during the early hours of 19 September, with the first result being from Clackmannanshire, and the last being from Highland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish independence: referendum results – live |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11106839/Scottish-independence-referendum-results-live.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref>

==Results==
55.3% voted against independence,<ref name=bbc-result>{{cite web |title=Scottish referendum: Scotland votes no to independence |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-29270441 |accessdate=19 September 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=19 September 2014}}</ref> with a turnout of 84.6%. 28 of the 32 council areas voted "No", although the four areas that voted "Yes" (Dundee, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire) contained over 20% of the Scottish electorate.

The overall turnout of 84.6% was very high for Scotland.<ref name="turnout" /> Turnout was around 50–60% for elections to the Scottish and UK parliaments in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Scotland turnout – all elections 1997 – 2007 |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Electionresults/2011%20election/5_Turnout_Region.pdf |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> The most recent [[United Kingdom general election]] with a comparable turnout was in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]], when 83.9% voted.<ref name="turnout">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29255449 |title=Scottish independence referendum in maps |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014 |first=Christine |last=Jeavans}}</ref> The last ballot in the United Kingdom with a higher turnout than 84.6% was in [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]], when no women and fewer men were allowed to vote (i.e., before [[universal suffrage]] applied to UK elections).<ref name="turnout" /> Of the 32 areas, East Dunbartonshire had the highest turnout at 91.0%, and Glasgow the lowest at 75.0%.<ref name="turnout" />

An academic study, surveying 5,000 Scottish voters soon after the referendum, found that the majority for No was formed by an "unusual alliance" of the very young, average earners, [[Scottish Reformation|Protestants]] and women.<ref name="study">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-34283948 |title=Study examines referendum demographics |first=Douglas |last=Fraser |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=19 September 2015 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC}}</ref> The study supported polling evidence that there was a gender gap, but countered beliefs that higher earners had supported No and that younger voters had mostly voted Yes.<ref name="study" />

According to [[John Curtice]], polling evidence indicates that support for independence was highest among those aged in their late 20s and early 30s, with a higher No vote among those aged between 16–24.<ref name="YesandNo">{{cite web |url=http://blog.whatscotlandthinks.org/2014/09/voted-yes-voted/ |title=So Who Voted Yes and Who Voted No? |first=John |last=Curtice |date=26 September 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2017 |website=What Scotland Thinks |publisher=Natcen}}</ref> There was an age gap at the referendum, with elderly voters being the most likely to vote against independence and younger voters aged under 55, except for those aged between 16–24, generally being more in favour of independence.<ref name="YesandNo" /> Those in [[NRS social grade|C2DE]], or "[[working class]]", occupations were slightly more likely to vote in favour of independence than those in [[NRS social grade|ABC1]], or "[[middle class]]", occupations' however, there was a significant discrepancy in voting between those living in the most deprived areas and those living in the least deprived areas, with those in more deprived areas being significantly more likely to vote in favour of independence and those in more affluent areas being more likely to vote against independence.<ref name = "YesandNo" /> This was picked up by other academics,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/people-politics-law/the-2014-scottish-independence-referendum-uneven-and-unequal-political-geographies |title=The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum – Uneven and unequal political geographies |first=Gerry |last=Mooney |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=4 August 2017 |website=www.open.edu |publisher=The Open University}}</ref> with data from the [[Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation]] study from 2012 indicating that the six most deprived local authorities in Scotland returned the highest Yes vote shares at the referendum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Social-Welfare/TrendSIMD |title=High Level Summary of Statistics Trend |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2017 |website=www.gov.scot |publisher=Scottish Government}}</ref>

=== Analysis of voters' reasons ===
{{content|Review: Scottish independence referendum, 2014#Voter demographics|date=October 2018}}
On the day of the referendum, [[Michael Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]] conducted a poll of over 2,000 voters to identify the major reasons for their voting choices. This poll found that among No voters, more than half (57%) stated the pound sterling was one of the most important factors in their decision. Among Yes voters, the biggest single motivation was "disaffection with Westminster politics".<ref name="AshcroftExitPoll">{{cite web |title=How Scotland voted, and why |url=https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2014/09/scotland-voted/ |website=Lord Ashcroft Polls |accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>

==Reactions to the result==
