Since 1945, '''immigration to the United Kingdom''' under [[British nationality law]] has been significant, in particular from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and from the former [[British Empire]] especially [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Randall Hansen|title=Citizenship and Immigration in Postwar Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qj8GEjW91oEC|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191583018}}</ref> Other immigrants have come from [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]], exercising one of the European Union's [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|Four Freedoms]], and a smaller number have come as [[asylum seekers]], seeking protection as [[refugees]] under the [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]].

About 70% of the population increase between the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001]] and [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011]] [[census]]es was due to [[Foreign-born population of Great Britain, 2001|foreign-born]] immigration. 7.5 million people (11.9% of the population at the time) were born overseas, although the census gives no indication of their immigration status or intended length of stay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Immigration Patterns of Non-UK Born Populations in England and Wales in 2011|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_346219.pdf|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Office for National Statistics|access-date=11 October 2014}}</ref>

Provisional figures show that in 2013, 526,000 people arrived to live in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] whilst 314,000 left, meaning that [[Net migration rate|net inward migration]] was 212,000. The number of people immigrating to the UK increased between 2012 and 2013 by 28,000, whereas the number emigrating fell by 7,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Migration Statistics Quarterly Report, May 201|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/may-2014/index.html|date=22 May 2014 |publisher=Office for National Statistics|access-date=11 October 2014}}</ref>

From April 2013 to April 2014, a total of 560,000 immigrants were estimated to have arrived in the UK, including 81,000 British citizens and 214,000 from other parts of the EU. An estimated 317,000 people left, including 131,000 British citizens and 83,000 other EU citizens.

In 2014, approximately 125,800 foreign citizens were naturalised as British citizens. This figure fell from around 208,000 in 2013, which was the highest figure recorded since 1962, when records began. Between 2009-13, the average number of people granted British citizenship per year was 195,800. The main countries of previous nationality of those naturalised in 2014 were: India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Nepal, China, South Africa, Poland and Somalia.<ref name=Blinder2015>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Briefing-Naturalisation.pdf|title=Naturalisation as a British Citizen: Concepts and Trends|first=Scott|last=Blinder|publisher=The Migration Observatory, University of Oxford|date=27 March 2015|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> The UK Government can also grant settlement to foreign nationals, which confers on them [[Permanent residency|permanent residence]] in the UK, without granting them British citizenship.

In comparison, migration to and from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] has increased since 2004 with the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession]] to the [[European Union]] of [[A8 countries|eight Central and Eastern European states]], since there is [[Freedom of movement for workers|free movement of labour]] within the EU.<ref>See [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title IV: Free Movement of Persons, Services and Capital|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].</ref> In 2008, the UK Government began phasing in a new [[Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|points-based immigration system]] for people from outside of the [[European Economic Area]].

According to an August 2018 publication of the [[House of Commons Library]], several definitions for a migrant exist in United Kingdom. A migrant can be:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06077 |title=Migration Statistics - Commons Library briefing - UK Parliament |publisher=Researchbriefings.parliament.uk |date=24 August 2018 |access-date=24 September 2018}}</ref>

*    Someone whose nationality is different to their country of residence.
*    Someone who changes their country of usual residence for a period of at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively becomes the country of usual residence.

==World War II==
{{further|German migration to the United Kingdom}}

In the lead-up to [[World War II]], many people from [[Germany]], particularly those belonging to minorities which were persecuted under [[Nazi]] rule, such as [[Jew]]s, sought to emigrate to the United Kingdom, and it is estimated that as many as 50,000 may have been successful. There were immigration caps on the number who could enter and, subsequently, some applicants were turned away. When the UK declared [[World War II|war on Germany]], however, migration between the countries ceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==British Empire and the Commonwealth==
From the mid-eighteenth century until at least 1956, and longer in many areas, the [[British Empire]] covered a large proportion of the globe. Both during this time, and following the granting of independence to most colonies after the [[Second World War]], the vast majority of immigrants to the UK were from either current or former colonies, most notably those in the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[South East Asia]], [[Oceania]] and the [[Caribbean]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} 

Following the end of the [[Second World War]], the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] allowed the 800,000,000<ref name="Turner"/> [[British subject|subjects]] in the British Empire to live and work in the United Kingdom without needing a [[Travel visa|visa]], although this was not an anticipated consequence of the Act, which "was never intended to facilitate mass migration".<ref>{{cite book|first=Randall|last=Hansen|title=Citizenship and Immigration in Post-war Britain|year=2000|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199240548|page=35}}</ref> This migration was initially encouraged to help fill gaps in the UK [[labour market]] for both skilled and unskilled jobs, including in public services such as the newly-created [[National Health Service]] and [[London Transport Executive|London Transport]]. Many people were specifically brought to the UK on ships; notably the ''[[Empire Windrush]]'' in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/item.asp?item_id=50|title=Windrush settlers|publisher=The National Archives|access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/jamaica-diverse-beginning-diaspora-developed-world|title=Jamaica: From Diverse Beginning to Diaspora in the Developed World|first1=Alex|last1=Glennie|first2=Laura|last2=Chappell|work=Migration Information Source|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|date=16 June 2010|access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/immigration-and-the-national-health-service-putting-history-to-the-forefront|title=Immigration and the National Health Service: putting history to the forefront|first1=Stephanie|last1=Snow|first2=Emma|last2=Jones|date=8 March 2011|access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/arrival-ss-empire-windrush|title=Arrival of SS Empire Windrush|first=Richard|last=Cavendish|journal=History Today|volume=48|issue=6|date=6 June 1998|access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref>

[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immigration, made up largely of [[economic migrants]], rose from 3,000 per year in 1953 to 46,800 in 1956 and 136,400 in 1961.<ref name="Turner">{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/westminster_hall/2003/mar/19/immigration#S6CV0401P0_20030319_WH_34|title=HC Deb 19 March 2003 vol 401 cc270-94WH.}}</ref> The heavy numbers of migrants resulted in the establishment of a Cabinet committee in June 1950 to find "ways which might be adopted to check the immigration into this country of [[Colored|coloured]] people from [[Crown colony|British colonial]] territories".<ref name="Turner"/>

Although the Committee recommended not to introduce restrictions, the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] was passed in 1962 as a response to public sentiment that the new arrivals "should return to their own countries" and that "no more of them come to this country".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1965/feb/09/immigrants-to-united-kingdom#S5CV0706P0_19650209_HOC_64|title=HC Deb 09 February 1965 vol 706 cc178-82.}}</ref> Introducing the legislation to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]] [[Rab Butler]] stated that:

The new Act required migrants to have a job before they arrived, to possess special skills or who would meet the "labour needs" of the national economy. In 1965, to combat the perceived injustice in the case where the wives of British subjects could not obtain British nationality, the British Nationality Act 1965 was adopted. Shortly afterwards, refugees from [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]], fearing discrimination from their own national governments, began to arrive in Britain; as they had retained their British nationality granted by the 1948 Act, they were not subject to the later controls. The Conservative MP [[Enoch Powell]] campaigned for tighter controls on immigration which resulted in the passing of the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] in 1968.<ref name="NatArch">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/commonwealth-immigration-control-legislation.htm|title=The National Archives, "Commonwealth Immigration control and legislation".}}</ref>

For the first time, the 1968 Act required migrants to have a "substantial connection with the United Kingdom", namely to be connected by birth or ancestry to a UK national. Those who did not could only obtain British nationality at the discretion of the national authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1968/feb/29/commonwealth-immigrants-bill-1#column_930|title=HL Deb 29 February 1968 vol 289 cc917-1217.}}</ref> One month after the adoption of the Act, Enoch Powell made his [[Rivers of Blood speech]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

By 1972, with the passing of the [[Immigration Act 1971|Immigration Act]], only holders of [[work permit]]s, or people with parents or grandparents born in the UK could gain entry – effectively stemming [[primary immigration]] from Commonwealth countries.<ref name="Brah">{{cite book|last=Brah|first=Avtar|title=Cartographies of Diaspora: Contesting Identities|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1996|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NaAzO-mE4BAC&q=end+of+primary+immigration&pg=PA37 | isbn=978-0-415-12126-2}}</ref> The Act abolished the distinction between Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth entrants. The Conservative government nevertheless allowed, amid much controversy, the immigration of 27,000 individuals displaced from Uganda after the [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by [[Idi Amin]] in 1971.<ref name="NatArch"/>

In the 1970s, an average of 72,000 immigrants were settling in the UK every year from the Commonwealth; this decreased in the 1980s and early-1990s to around 54,000 per year, only to rise again to around 97,000 by 1999. The total number of Commonwealth immigrants since 1962 is estimated at around 2,500,000.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Following the end of [[World War II]], substantial groups of people from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled territories settled in the UK, particularly [[Polish British|Poles]] and [[Ukrainian British|Ukrainians]].

[[British Indians|Indians]] began arriving in the UK in large numbers shortly after their country gained independence in 1947, although there were a number of people from India living the UK even in the earlier years.

==Immigration as influenced by the EU (1983–2020)==
The [[British Nationality Act 1981]], which was enacted in 1983, distinguishes between British [[citizen]]s and [[British Overseas Territories]] citizens. It also made a distinction between nationality ''by descent'' and nationality ''other than by descent''. Citizens by descent cannot automatically pass on British nationality to a child born outside the United Kingdom or its Overseas Territories (though in some situations the child can be registered as a citizen).

Immigration officers have to be satisfied about a person's nationality and identity and entry can be refused if they are not satisfied.<ref>[http://www.24dash.com/news/57/12221/index.htm Immigration staff can ask Muslim women to remove veils] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234444/http://www.24dash.com/news/57/12221/index.htm |date=26 September 2007 }} 24dash.com, 26 October 2006</ref>

During the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in [[Somalia]] led to a large number of Somali immigrants, comprising the majority of the current [[Somalis in the United Kingdom|Somali population in the UK]]. In the late-1980s, most of these early migrants were granted asylum, while those arriving later in the 1990s more often obtained temporary status. There has also been some secondary migration of Somalis to the UK from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]].

Non-European immigration rose significantly during the period from 1997, not least because of the [[First Blair ministry|government]]'s abolition of the primary purpose rule in June 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/06/0605/straw.shtml|title=BBC Politics 97}}</ref> This change made it easier for UK residents to bring foreign spouses into the country.
The former government adviser Andrew Neather in the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' stated that the deliberate policy of ministers from late-2000 until early-2008 was to open up the UK to mass migration.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23760073-dont-listen-to-the-whingers---london-needs-immigrants.do |title=Don't listen to the whingers – London needs immigrants |first=Andrew |last=Neather |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=23 October 2009 |access-date=26 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202101114/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23760073-dont-listen-to-the-whingers---london-needs-immigrants.do |archive-date=2 December 2009  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html |title=Labour wanted mass immigration to make UK more multicultural, says former adviser |first=Tom |last=Whitehead |work=Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=23 October 2009 |access-date=28 October 2009}}</ref>

The Immigration Rules, under the [[Immigration Act 1971]], were updated in 2012 (Appendix FM) to create a strict minimum income threshold for non-EU spouses and children to be given [[Indefinite leave to remain|leave to remain in the UK]]. These rules were challenged in the courts, and in 2017 the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] found that while "the minimum income threshold is accepted in principle" they decided that the rules and guidance were defective and unlawful until amended to give more weight to the interests of the children involved, and that sources of funding other than the British spouse's income should be considered.<ref name=guardian-20170222>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/22/supreme-court-backs-minimum-income-rule-for-non-european-spouses |title=Supreme court backs minimum income rule for non-European spouses |first=Alan |last=Travis |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 February 2017 |access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=cco-201508>{{cite report |url=https://www.jcwi.org.uk/sites/jcwi/files/CCO-Family-Friendly-Report-090915.pdf |title=The impact on children of the Family Migration Rules |publisher=Children's Commissioner for England |date=August 2015 |access-date=22 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125505/https://www.jcwi.org.uk/sites/jcwi/files/CCO-Family-Friendly-Report-090915.pdf |archive-date=23 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The foreign-born population increased from about 5.3 million in 2004 to nearly 9.3 million in 2018. In the decade leading up to 2018, the number of non-EU migrants outnumbered EU migrants while the number of EU migrants increased more rapidly. EU migrants were noted to be less likely to become British citizens than non-EU migrants.<ref name="migration_observatory_oxacuk" />

===Immigrants from the European Union===
One of the [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|Four Freedoms]] of the [[European Union]], of which the United Kingdom is a former member, is the right to the free movement of workers as codified in the [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]] and the [[EEA Regulations (UK)]].

Since the expansion of the [[European Union|EU]] on 1 May 2004, the UK has accepted immigrants from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]], although the substantial Maltese and [[Greek Cypriots|Greek-Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish-Cypriot]] communities were established earlier through their Commonwealth connection. There are restrictions on the benefits that members of eight of these accession countries ('A8' nationals) can claim, which are covered by the [[Worker Registration Scheme]].<ref>[http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/schemes_and_programmes/worker_registration.html The Worker Registration Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502050446/http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/schemes_and_programmes/worker_registration.html |date=2 May 2006 }} Home Office</ref> Many other European Union member states exercised their right to temporary immigration control (which ended in 2011)<ref>[http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/cha/c10524.htm Freedom of movement for workers after enlargement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718031206/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/cha/c10524.htm |date=18 July 2007 }} Europa</ref> over entrants from these accession states,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4497309.stm Barriers still exist in larger EU], BBC News, 1 May 2005</ref> but some subsequently removed these restrictions ahead of the 2011 deadline.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3513889.stm EU free movement of labour map], BBC News, 4 January 2007.

The United Kingdom uses statistics to predict migration that are produced primarily from the International Passenger Survey conducted by the [[Office for National Statistics]](ONS). The survey’s primary mission is to help government’s understand the effects of tourism and travel on their economy. Two parliamentary committees criticized the survey and found it to lack credibility. The actual net migration in 2015-16 from EU states to the United Kingdom, 29,000, was 16% higher than the ONS expected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49420730|title=EU migration to UK 'underestimated'|date=2019-08-21|access-date=2019-11-25|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Research conducted by the [[Migration Policy Institute]] for the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5 million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, but that many have returned home, with the result that the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK increased by some 700,000 over the same period.<ref name="MPI">{{cite book|url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/new_europeans.pdf |title=The UK's new Europeans: Progress and challenges five years after accession |last=Sumption |first=Madeleine |author2=Somerville, Will |date=January 2010 |work=Equality and Human Rights Commission Policy Report |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |page=13 |access-date=17 January 2010 |isbn=978-1-84206-252-4 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207074918/http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/uploaded_files/new_europeans.pdf |archive-date=7 December 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/17/eastern-european-uk-migrants|title=Young, self-reliant, educated: portrait of UK's eastern European migrants|last=Doward|first=Jamie|author2=Rogers, Sam|date=17 January 2010|work=The Observer|access-date=17 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Migration from Poland in particular has become temporary and circular in nature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8243225.stm|title=Migrants to UK 'returning home'|date=8 September 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=8 September 2009}}</ref> In 2009, for the first time since the enlargement, more nationals of the eight Central and Eastern European states that joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived.<ref name="A8 leaving">{{cite news|title=UK sees shift in migration trend|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10174019.stm|access-date=28 May 2010|date=27 May 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref> Research commissioned by the Regeneration and Economic Development Analysis Expert Panel suggested migrant workers leaving the UK due to the recession are likely to return in the future and cited evidence of "strong links between initial temporary migration and intended permanent migration".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/1854800.pdf|title=Impact of Economic Downturn and Immigration|author=Anne E.

The Government announced that the same rules would not apply to nationals of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] (A2 nationals) when those countries acceded to the EU in 2007.

In February 2011, the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]], [[Ed Miliband]], stated that he thought that the Labour government's decision to permit the unlimited immigration of eastern European migrants had been a mistake, arguing that they had underestimated the potential number of migrants and that the scale of migration had had a negative impact on wages.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8353794/Labour-accused-of-covering-up-warnings-about-immigration.html|title=Labour accused of covering up warnings about immigration|date=1 March 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=12 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/video-miliband--immigration-hit-wages-2228320.html|title=Video: Miliband – 'Immigration hit wages'|date=28 February 2011|work=The Independent|access-date=12 March 2011}}</ref>

Research published by [[University College London]] in July 2009 found that, on average, A8 migrants were younger and better educated than the native population, and that if they had the same demographic characteristics of natives, would be 13 per cent less likely to claim benefits and 28 per cent less likely to live in [[social housing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.ucl.ac.uk/cream/pages/CDP/CDP_18_09.pdf|title=Assessing the fiscal costs and benefits of A8 migration to the UK|last=Dustmann|first=Christian|author2=Frattini, Tommaso |author3=Halls, Caroline |date=July 2009|work=CReAM Discussion Paper|publisher=Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration, Department of Economics, University College London|access-date=8 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Jack | last=Doyle | title=EU migrants 'good for UK economy' | date=24 July 2009 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/eu-migrants-good-for-uk-economy-1759279.html | work =The Independent | access-date =25 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

==Managed migration==
[[File:UK Migration from 1970.svg|thumb|400px|Shows immigration and emigration with net figures, including British and non-British citizens. Data from [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2014/stb-msqr-august-2014.html Office for National Statistics].]]
"Managed migration" is the term for all legal labour and student migration from outside of the European Union and this accounts for a substantial percentage of overall immigration figures for the UK. Many of the immigrants who arrive under these schemes bring skills which are in short supply in the UK. This area of immigration is managed by [[UK Visas and Immigration]], a department within the [[Home Office]]. Applications are made at UK embassies or consulates or directly to UK Visas and Immigration, depending upon the type of visa or permit required.

In April 2006, changes to the managed migration system were proposed that would create one [[Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|points-based immigration system]] for the UK in place of all other schemes. Tier 1 in the new system – which replaced the [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]] – gives points for age, education, earning, previous UK experience but not for work experience. The points-based system was phased in over the course of 2008, replacing previous managed migration schemes such as the [[Work permit (United Kingdom)|work permit system]] and the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/ |title=The points-based system |publisher=Border & Immigration Agency |access-date=9 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512084839/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/ |archive-date=12 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/timetableforPBSlaunch |title=Timetable for PBS launch |publisher=Border & Immigration Agency |access-date=9 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720043527/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/timetableforPBSlaunch |archive-date=20 July 2008 }}</ref>

A points-based system is composed of five tiers was first described by the [[UK Border Agency]] as follows:
*Tier 1 – for highly skilled individuals, who can contribute to growth and productivity;
*Tier 2 – for skilled workers with a job offer, to fill gaps in the United Kingdom workforce;
*Tier 3 – for limited numbers of low-skilled workers needed to fill temporary labour shortages;
*Tier 4 – for students;
*Tier 5 – for temporary workers and young people covered by the Youth Mobility Scheme, who are allowed to work in the United Kingdom for a limited time to satisfy primarily non-economic objectives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/howitworks |title=How the points-based system works |publisher=UK Border Agency |access-date=6 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221012223/http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/managingmigration/apointsbasedsystem/howitworks |archive-date=21 February 2009 }}</ref>

The [[Migration Advisory Committee]] was established in 2007 to give policy advice.

In June 2010, The newly elected [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government]] brought in a temporary cap on immigration of those entering the UK from outside the EU, with the limit set as 24,100, in order to stop an expected rush of applications before a permanent cap was imposed in April 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ab202a4-8299-11df-85ba-00144feabdc0.html|title=Tories begin consultation on cap for migrants|work=The Financial Times|first=James|last=Boxell|date=28 June 2010|access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref> The cap caused tension within the coalition, and then-Business Secretary [[Vince Cable]] argued that it was harming British businesses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/17/vince-cable-migrant-cap-economy|title=Vince Cable: Migrant cap is hurting economy|agency=Press Association|work=The Guardian|date=17 September 2010|access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref> Others have argued that the cap would have a negative impact on Britain's status as a centre for scientific research.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/07/nobel-laureates-immigration-cap|title=Nobel laureates urge rethink over immigration cap|agency=Press Association|work=The Guardian|date=7 October 2010|access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref>

For family relatives of [[European Economic Area]] nationals living in the UK, there is the [[EEA family permit]] which enables those family members to join their relatives already living and working in the UK.

Though immigration is a matter that is reserved to the UK Government under the [[Scotland Act 1998|legislation]] that established devolution for Scotland in 1999, the [[Scottish Government]] was able to get an agreement from the [[Home Office]] for their [[Fresh Talent Initiative]] which was designed to encourage foreign graduates of [[Scottish universities]] to stay in Scotland to look for employment.<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/02/18984/33666 New Scots: Attracting Fresh Talent to meet the Challenge of Growth] scotland.gov.uk.

==Refugees and asylum seekers==

The UK is a signatory to the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Refugee Convention]] as well as the [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol]] and has therefore a responsibility to offer protection to people who seek asylum it and fall into the legal definition of a "[[Refugee#Legal definition|refugee]]", and moreover not to return (or refoule) any displaced person to places where they would otherwise face persecution.  Cuts to legal aid prevent asylum seekers getting good advice or arguing their case effectively.  This can mean refugees being returned to a country where they face certain death.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jul/19/lack-legal-aid-puts-asylum-seekers-lives-at-risk-charity-warns Lack of legal aid puts asylum seekers' lives at risk, charity warns] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 July 2018</ref>

This is denounced, by those seeking to ensure that the UK upholds its international obligations, as disproportionate. Concern is also raised about the treatment of those held in detention and the practice of [[dawn raid]]ing families, and holding young children in [[immigration detention]] centres for long periods of time.<ref name="Nicol Stephen">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6320959.stm|title=Nicol Stephen condemns dawn raids|date=1 February 2007|work=BBC News|access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="Children">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8384860.stm|title=Migrant children held 'too long' in detention, MPs say|date=29 November 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref> The policy of detaining asylum-seeking children was to be abandoned as part of the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement|coalition agreement]] between the Conservatives and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who formed a government in May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7124648.ece|title=Detention of asylum-seeker children to be scrapped|work=The Times|date=13 May 2010|access-date=17 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> However, in July 2010 the government was accused of back-tracking on this promise after the Immigration Minister [[Damian Green]] announced that the plan was to minimise, rather than end, child detention.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/09/detention-children-immigration-centres|title=Government climbdown on detention of children in immigration centres|first1=Karen|last1=McVeigh|first2=Matthew|last2=Taylor|work=The Guardian|date=9 September 2010|access-date=10 September 2010}}</ref>

However, critics of the UK's asylum policy often point out the "safe third country rule" – the [[Dublin Regulation|convention]] that asylum seekers must apply in the first free nation they reach, not go "[[asylum shopping]]" for the nation they prefer. EU courts have upheld this policy.<ref>[http://www.asylumlaw.org/asylumseeker/firstaid.htm First Aid for asylum seekers] Asylumlaw.org</ref> Research conducted by the [[Refugee Council]] suggests that most asylum seekers in the UK had their destination chosen for them by external parties or agents, rather than choosing the UK themselves.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/14/chance-choice-britain-refugees-council-report|title=Chance brings refugees to Britain not choice, says report|last=Travis|first=Alan|date=14 January 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

In February 2003, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] promised on television to reduce the number of asylum seekers by half within 7 months,<ref>[http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2738065.stm Blair's asylum gamble] BBC News 7 February 2003</ref> apparently catching unawares the members of his own government with responsibility for immigration policy.

[[Human rights]] organisations such as [[Amnesty International]] have argued that the government's new policies, particularly those concerning [[immigration detention|detention]] centres, have detrimental effects on asylum applicants<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_16178.pdf Seeking asylum is not a crime: Detention of people who have sought asylum (PDF)] Amnesty International, 20 June 2005</ref> and their children,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/aug/30/ministers-under-fire-immigrant-children|title=Ministers under fire for locking up immigrant children|last=McVeigh|first=Karen|date=31 August 2009|work=The Guardian|page=1|access-date=31 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref> and those facilities have seen a number of [[hunger strikes]] and [[suicides]].

In addition to offering asylum, the UK operates two [[refugee resettlement]] schemes in co-operation with the [[UNHCR]]: the [[Gateway Protection Programme|Gateway Resettlement Programme]]<ref name="Gateway">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/asylum/gateway/ |title=Gateway Protection Programme |publisher=UK Border Agency |access-date=18 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215012227/http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/asylum/gateway/ |archive-date=15 December 2013 }}</ref> and the [[Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Programme]].

The UK hosts one of the largest populations of Iraqi refugees outside the Gulf region.

Asylum seekers have been kept in detention after the courts ordered their release because the Home Office maintains detention is not dissimilar to emergency accommodation.  Immigrants with the right to stay in the UK are denied housing and cannot be released.  In other cases vulnerable asylum seekers are released onto the streets with nowhere to live.  In January 2018 the government repealed a law that previously allowed homeless detainees to apply for housing while in detention if they had nowhere to live when released. Charities maintain around 2,000 detainees who before this applied for support each year can no longer do so.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/asylum-seekers-held-removal-centres-home-office-emergency-housing-a8354731.html Asylum seekers unlawfully held in removal centres for months despite courts ruling they can be released, lawyers warn] ''[[The Independent]]''</ref>

On 9 August 2020, the reports suggested that the number of people who reached the United Kingdom shores in small boats, during that year, surpassed 4,000.

==Illegal immigration==
[[File:UKBorderForceCalais03-ClandestineLeavingLorry.png|thumb|UK [[Border Force]] detecting illegal Immigrants in [[Calais]]]]
{{Main|Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom}}
Illegal immigrants in the UK include those who have:
* entered the UK without authority
* entered with false documents
* overstayed their visas

Although it is difficult to know how many people reside in the UK illegally, a Home Office study released in March 2005 estimated a population of between 310,000 and 570,000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4989874.stm The thorny issue of illegal migrants] BBC News, 17 May 2006.</ref>

A recent study into irregular immigration states that "most irregular migrants have committed administrative offences rather than a serious crime".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060526075239/http://www.ippr.org/ecomm/files/irregular_migration.pdf Irregular migration in the UK: An ippr factfile] Institute for Public Policy Research, April 2006, p. 5.</ref>

[[Jack Dromey]], Deputy General of the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] treasurer, suggested in May 2006 that there could be around 500,000 illegal workers. He called for a public debate on whether an amnesty should be considered.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5000678.stm Amnesty call over illegal workers] BBC News, 20 May 2006.</ref> [[David Blunkett]] has suggested that this might be done once the [[British national identity card|identity card]] scheme is rolled out.<ref>[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200606/8ea36546-3f04-4fff-a470-a63009bdff7e.htm Blunkett: Immigration amnesty on cards] epolitix.com, 14 June 2006</ref>

[[London Citizens]], a coalition of community organisations, is running a regularisation campaign called ''Strangers into Citizens'', backed by figures including the former leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the [[Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]].<ref>Joe Boyle, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6633015.stm Migrants find a voice in the rain], BBC News, 7 May 2007. Retrieved 21 May 2007</ref> Analysis by the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] suggested that an amnesty could net the government up to  £1.038 billion per year in fiscal revenue, however the long term implications of such a measure are uncertain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=2794|title=Jacqui Smith should back amnesty for illegal workers|date=15 July 2007|publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research|access-date=5 May 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626085941/http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=2794|archive-date=26 June 2009}}</ref>

It has since been suggested that to deport all of the illegal immigrants from the UK might take 20 years and cost up to £12 billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=3483|title=Tighter immigration controls could enable an amnesty for illegal immigrants say IPPR|date=3 May 2009|publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research|access-date=5 May 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626090020/http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/?id=3483|archive-date=26 June 2009}}</ref> Former [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]]  commissioned a study into a possible amnesty for illegal immigrants, citing larger tax gains within the London area which is considered to be home to the majority of the country's population of such immigrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7743081.stm|title=Johnson ponders immigrant amnesty|date=22 November 2008|work=BBC News|access-date=24 November 2008}}</ref>

In February 2008, the government introduced new £10,000 fines for employers found to be employing illegal immigrants where there is negligence on the part of the employer, with unlimited fines or jail sentences for employers acting knowingly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3455997.ece|title=£10,000 fines for employing illegal migrant without check|author=Richard Ford|newspaper=The Times|date=29 February 2008|access-date=22 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

Women who are illegal immigrants and also domestic violence victims risk deportation and are deported if they complain about violence.  Women get brought illegally into the UK by men intending to abuse them.  Women are sometimes deterred from complaining about violence to them due to the risk of deportation, therefore perpetrators including rapists remain at large.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jeraj|first=Catrin Nye, Natalie Bloomer and Samir|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44074572|title=Victims of serious crime face arrest|date=2018-05-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-03-22|language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Martha Spurrier]] of [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] said, "It will leave people afraid to report crime, robbing them of protection under the law and creating impunity for criminals who target vulnerable people with unsettled immigration status.

==Comparison of European Union countries==
According to [[Eurostat]], 47.3 million people lived in the [[European Union]] in 2010 who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million),  Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721012211/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF|title=6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad|publisher=Eurostat|first=Katya|last=Vasileva|date=7 July 2011|journal=Statistics in Focus|issue=34/2011|archive-date=21 July 2011|access-date=7 November 2016}}</ref>
