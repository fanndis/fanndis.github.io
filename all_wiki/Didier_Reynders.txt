==Political career==
===Minister of Finance, 1999–2011===
Reynders served as Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2011; in 2002, he chaired the [[Group of Ten (economics)|G-10]] which is the meeting of the main creditor states (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States).<ref>[http://www.hec.fr/europe-symposium/index.php?id=reynders_didier HEC Europe Symposium: Didier Reynders] HEC Europe Institute, Paris.</ref>

The [[Albert II of Belgium|King]] appointed Reynders as [[informateur]], i.e. to start off the informal [[2007–2008 Belgian government formation|coalition talks for a new federal government]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/2.728/070613_informateur | title = King picks Mr Reynders as "informateur" | publisher = VRT Nieuws | date = 2007-06-13 | accessdate = 2007-06-13}}</ref>

Stalemate followed the [[2010 Belgian federal election|2010 general election]]. The King appointed a succession of people to negotiate a coalition from June 2010 onwards, but none succeeded in the task of forming a new government during the following seven months. Reynders was appointed [[Formateur#Informateur|informateur]] by the King on 2 February 2011. He reported on 16 February 2011, and his brief was extended through 1 March 2011.

===Minister of Defence, 2018–2019===
