'''University College Cork – National University of Ireland, Cork''' ('''UCC''')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nui.ie/about/history.asp |title=History of the NUI }}</ref> ({{lang-ga|Coláiste na hOllscoile Corcaigh}}) is a constituent university of the [[National University of Ireland]], and located in [[Cork (city)|Cork]].

The university was founded in 1845 as one of three [[Queen's University of Ireland|Queen’s Colleges]] located in [[Queen's University Belfast|Belfast]], Cork, and [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/en/about/UCCHistory/ |title=University College Cork – History |publisher=Ucc.ie |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref>  It became University College, Cork, under the Irish Universities Act of 1908. The Universities Act 1997 renamed the university as National University of Ireland, Cork, and a Ministerial Order of 1998 renamed the university as University College Cork – National University of Ireland, Cork,<ref>[http://www.nui.ie/about/universities.asp About NUI – Constituent Universities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003214144/http://www.nui.ie/about/universities.asp |date=October 3, 2008 }}</ref> though it continues to be almost universally known as University College Cork.

Amongst other rankings and awards, the university was named Irish University of the Year by the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' on five occasions; most recently in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ucc-wins-university-of-the-year-award-for-a-fifth-time-424784.html | publisher = Irish Examiner | title = UCC wins university of the year award for a fifth time | date = 8 October 2016 }}</ref><ref name="Sunday Times 2016">{{cite web|title=UCC named The Sunday Times University of the Year|url=https://www.ucc.ie/en/about/uccnews/fullstory-606071-en.html|website=UCC|publisher=UCC}}</ref> In 2015, UCC was also named as top performing university by the European Commission funded [[College and university rankings#U-Multirank|U-Multirank]] system, based on obtaining the highest number of "A" scores (21 out of 28 metrics) among a field of 1200 partaking universities.<ref name="umultirank">{{Cite web|url= https://www.ucc.ie/en/about/uccnews/fullstory-541046-en.html|accessdate=14 September 2015 |title =UCC News > UCC leads international rankings…|publisher=UCC.ie}}</ref> UCC also became the first university to achieve the [[ISO 50001]] standard in energy management in 2011.

==History==
[[File:UCC-Quad2018.jpg|right|thumb|The "Long Hall" and the clock tower of the UCC quadrangle]]
Queen's College, Cork, was founded by the provisions of an act which enabled [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to endow new colleges for the "Advancement of Learning in Ireland". Under the powers of this act, the three colleges of [[Queen's University Belfast|Belfast]], Cork and [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] were incorporated on 30 December 1845. The college opened in 1849 with 23 professors and 181 students; Medicine, Arts, and Law were the three founding faculties. A year later the college became part of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]].

The original site chosen for the college was considered appropriate as it was believed to have had a connection with the [[patron saint]] of Cork, [[Saint Finbarr]]. His monastery and school of learning were close by at Gill Abbey Rock and the mill attached to the monastery is thought to have stood on the bank of the south channel of the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]], which runs through the College lower grounds. This association is also reflected in the College motto "Where Finbarr Taught, Let [[Munster]] Learn" which is also the university motto.

Adjacent to Gillabbey and overlooking the valley of the river Lee, the site was selected in 1846.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ucc.ie/ga/faoicoc/nuacht/cartlannnuachta/preasraitis2005/headline-10015-ga.html | publisher = UCC | title = New Book Celebrates UCC in Words and Pictures | date = 15 December 2005 | quote = "''architect, Sir Thomas Deane, successfully urged the Board of Works in 1846 to choose the Gillabbey site [.. for..] its 'excellent and commanding' situation''" }}</ref> The Tudor Gothic quadrangle and early campus buildings were designed and built by [[Thomas Deane|Sir Thomas Deane]] (1792-1871) and [[Benjamin Woodward]] (1816-1861). Queen's College Cork officially opened its doors in November 1849, with further buildings added later, including the Medical/Windle Building in the 1860s.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/ucc-to-create-student-hub-in-15m-extension-408693.html | publisher = Irish Examiner | title = UCC to create student hub in €15m extension | quote = "''the Windle Building [..] dates back to the 1860s''" | date = 6 July 2016 }}</ref>

===National University of Ireland===
In the following century, the Irish Universities Act (1908) formed the [[National University of Ireland]], consisting of the three constituent colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the college was given the status of a [[university college]] as ''University College, Cork''. The Universities Act, 1997, made the university college a constituent university of the National University and made the constituent university a full university for all purposes except the awarding of degrees and diplomas which remains the sole remit of the National University.

==Today==

As of 2016, University College Cork (UCC) had 21,000 students. These included 15,000 in undergraduate programmes, 4,400 in postgraduate study and research, and 2,800 in adult continuing education across undergraduate, postgraduate and short courses.<ref name="Strategic_2017-22"/> The student base is supported by 2,800 academic, research and administrative staff.<ref name="quickfacts">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucc.ie/en/discover/|title=UCC Quick Facts|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> As of 2017, UCC reportedly had 150,000 alumni worldwide.<ref name="quickfacts"/>

===Campus===
Student numbers, at over 21,000 in 2016,<ref name="Strategic_2017-22"/> increased from the late 1980s, precipitating the expansion of the campus by the acquisition of adjacent buildings and lands. This expansion continued with the opening of the [[Alfred O'Rahilly]] building in the late 1990s, the Cavanagh Pharmacy building, the Brookfield Health Sciences centre, the extended ''Áras na MacLéinn'' (Devere Hall), the [[Lewis Glucksman Gallery]] in 2004, ''Experience UCC'' (Visitors' Centre) and an extension to the ''Boole Library'' – named for the first professor of mathematics at UCC, [[George Boole]], who developed the [[Boolean algebra (logic)|algebra]] that would later make computer programming possible. The University also completed the Western Gateway Building in 2009 on the site of the former Cork Greyhound track on the Western Road as well as refurbishment to the [[Tyndall]] institute buildings at the Lee Maltings Complex. In 2016, UCC acquired the Cork Savings Bank building on Lapps Quay in the centre of Cork city.<ref name="Strategic_2017-22"/> As of 2017, the university is rolling out a programme to increase the space across its campuses, with part of this development involving the creation of a 'student hub' to support academic strategy, to add 600 new student accommodation spaces, and to develop an outdoor sports facility.<ref name="Strategic_2017-22"/> 
[[File:Glucksman2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Glucksman Gallery in UCC's lower grounds]]

Also in 2006, the University re-opened the [[Crawford Observatory]], a structure built in 1880 on the grounds of the university by Sir [[Howard Grubb]]. Grubb, son of the Grubb telescope building family in Dublin, designed the observatory and built the astronomical instruments for the structure. The University paid for an extensive restoration and conservation of the building and the three main telescopes, the Equatorial, the Transit Circle and Sidereostatic telescopes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/faculties/science/pages/news67.php|archive-url=https://archive.today/20071224104605/http://www.ucc.ie/faculties/science/pages/news67.php|url-status=dead|title=Crawford Observatory|date=24 December 2007|archive-date=24 December 2007|accessdate=19 February 2018}}</ref>

In November 2009, a number of UCC buildings were damaged by flooding.<ref name="flood">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1201/1224259804111.html |title=UCC welcomes 18,000 back following closure – 1 December 2009 |publisher=Irish Times |date=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> The floods also affected other parts of Cork City, with many students being evacuated from accommodation. The college authorities postponed academic activities for a week,<ref name="flood"/> and indicated that it would take until 2010 before all flood damaged property would be repaired. Particularly impacted was the newly opened Western Gateway Building, with the main lecture theatre requiring a total refit just months after opening for classes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/en/media/mandc/Revised-Report-on-Major-Flood-Damage.pdf |publisher= UCC.ie | title= Revised Report on Major Flood Damage |format=PDF |date= November 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160415031653/http://www.ucc.ie/en/media/mandc/Revised-Report-on-Major-Flood-Damage.pdf | archive-date = 15 April 2016 }}</ref>

In 2018, UCC's campus became home to the first "plastic free" café in Ireland, with the opening of the Bio Green Café in the  Biosciences building.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.ie/life/food-drink/irelands-first-plastic-free-caf-opens-today-37305145.html | publisher = Independent News & Media | website = independent.ie | title = Ireland’s first plastic free café opens today | date = 11 September 2018 | accessdate = 19 April 2019 }}</ref>

==Academic units==
===College of Medicine and Health===
Medicine, Arts, and Law were the three founding faculties when Queen's College Cork opened its doors to students in 1849. The medical buildings were built in stages between 1860 and 1880, and the faculty quickly gained a reputation for the quality of its graduates. The first two women to graduate in medicine in Ireland did so in 1898 (this was notable as it was more than 20 years before women were permitted to sit for medicine at the [[University of Oxford]]).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/en/CollegesandDepartments/MedicineandHealth/aboutus/history/ |title=UCC School of Medicine History |publisher=Ucc.ie |accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> UCC School of Medicine is part of the College of Medicine and Health, and is based at the Brookfield Health Sciences Centre on the main UCC campus and is affiliated with the 1000-bed [[Cork University Hospital|University College Cork Teaching Hospital]], which is the largest medical centre in Ireland.
