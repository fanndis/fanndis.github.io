'''''Revival''''' (stylized as '''''<u>REVIVΛL</u>''''') is the ninth studio album by American rapper [[Eminem]]. The album was released on December 15, 2017, through [[Aftermath Entertainment]], [[Shady Records]] and [[Interscope Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/8053825/eminem-finally-reveals-revival-album-release-date|title=Eminem Finally Reveals 'Revival' Album Release Date|last=|first=|date=November 28, 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201122004/https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/8053825/eminem-finally-reveals-revival-album-release-date|archive-date=December 1, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref> Production for the album took place during 2016 to 2017 at various recording studios. In addition to Eminem himself, music production was handled by various record producers, including [[Rick Rubin]], [[Fredwreck]], [[Skylar Grey]], [[Alex da Kid]], and executive producer [[Dr. Dre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2017/07/10/dr-dre-working-on-eminem-new-album/|title=Dr. Dre Is Working On Eminem's New Album|last=|first=|date=July 10, 2017|work=Rap-Up|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201122211/http://www.rap-up.com/2017/07/10/dr-dre-working-on-eminem-new-album/|archive-date=December 1, 2017|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref> ''Revival'' features [[guest appearance]]s from artists [[Beyoncé]], [[Phresher]], [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[X Ambassadors]], [[Skylar Grey]], [[Kehlani]], and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]].

Eminem first revealed that he was working on an album following the release of "[[Campaign Speech]]" in October 2016. A year later, he performed a [[viral video|viral]] freestyle at the 2017 [[BET Hip Hop Awards]], criticizing President [[Donald Trump]]. The album has many lines critiquing Trump's presidential campaign and election. 

The album's lead single, "[[Walk on Water (Eminem song)|Walk on Water]]", featuring [[Beyoncé]], was released on November 10, 2017. "[[Untouchable (Eminem song)|Untouchable]]" was released as a promotional single a week prior to the album's release. ''Revival'' was leaked online on December 13, 2017, two days before the album's release date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/eminems-revival-leak-internet-has-mixed-reactions-news.40844.html|title=Eminem's "Revival" Leak: Internet Has Mixed Reactions|publisher=Hot New Hip Hop}}</ref> The album issued several more singles, including "[[River (Eminem song)|River]]", featuring [[Ed Sheeran]], "[[Nowhere Fast (Eminem song)|Nowhere Fast]]", featuring [[Kehlani]], and "Remind Me".<ref name="Radiodate" />
A music video for "[[Framed (Eminem song)|Framed]]" was also released on April 3, 2018.

''Revival'' polarized critics, with critics being divided over its rock-influenced production on several songs and the heavy use of [[Pop music|pop]] artists for guest appearances. The album debuted at number one in Australia, Canada, Finland, the UK, and the US. In addition, it was the [[List of UK Albums Chart Christmas number ones|UK Christmas number one album of 2017]] and has been certified [[BPI certification|platinum]] in the UK.<ref name="OCC" />
It was followed by ''[[Kamikaze (Eminem album)|Kamikaze]]'', Eminem's tenth studio album, which was considered to be a reaction to the criticism of ''Revival''.

Upon release, ''Revival'', overall, received polarized reviews from music critics as many were divided over its perceived lack of focus, lyrics, heavy sampling of rock music in the production, and the abundance of [[Pop music|pop]] artists for guest appearances.<ref>{{cite web|first=Fabian|last=Gersler|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/eminem-revival-review-critics/|title=Some Critics Are Calling Eminem's 'Revival' One of His Worst Albums Yet |website=[[Highsnobiety]]|date=December 18, 2017|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 50, based on 24 reviews, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.<ref name="Metacritic"/> 

Don Needham of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the album's production and focus, stating that "If Eminem thinks his verbal box of tricks can overcome the weakness of any backing track, his recent albums have demonstrated otherwise."<ref name="TheGuardian" /> In a positive review, Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' complimented the album's lyrical themes: "But ultimately, it's all about Eminem himself, and nowhere more dynamically than in the berserk self-assessment "Offended", where he asserts, amongst other things, that if the time he spent writing were taken into account, he'd be a minimum-wage slave – a faintly ludicrous claim, but immediately backed up by a bravura extended burst of rapid-rap babble that both explains and exemplifies his skills, and leaves one wondering not just how long it took to write, but how on earth he manages to pronounce such a polysyllabic torrent so perfectly."<ref name="Independentreview" /> [[Neil McCormick]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' stated that ''Revival'' "represents Eminem on top form, which is to say unstoppable, unbeatable yet often indefensible."<ref name="Telegraph" />

''[[The Irish Times]]'' concluded that ''Revival'' is "mildly more admirable than previous outings but no more enjoyable. A chance to bust out of the slump has passed Eminem by. It just might never happen for him."<ref name="IrishTimes">{{cite news|first=Dean|last=Van Nguyen|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/eminem-revival-review-gruelling-relentless-and-sterile-1.3328653|title=Eminem: Revival review – gruelling, relentless and sterile|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=December 15, 2017|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}</ref> In a mixed review, [[Jon Caramanica]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' remarked that while the album is "probably the best of his recent albums", he criticized Eminem's apparent lack of awareness to the evolution of hip hop's sound in general, arguing that he is too "beholden to his own aesthetic."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/arts/music/eminem-revival-review.html|title=Hip-Hop Changes.

Comparing ''Revival'' to Eminem's previous bodies of work, Matthew Ismael Ruiz of ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' stated that "Musically, ''Revival'' is no different, chock full of piano ballads and pop-star features that echo the most cynically commercial corners of his catalog. The shock value comes not from the album's overwhelmingly bland hooks or cringe-worthy humor (of which there is plenty), but from the moments where his growth as a human is most apparent", concluding that "''Revival'' is another late-career album that does little for his legacy."<ref name="Pitchfork"/> Writing for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', [[Robert Christgau]] found the album "much cleverer than lemmings claim, bluntly and intelligently political too, but so received in its cartoon misogyny and pop grandeur you know he felt irrelevance bearing down even before [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] killed this album on the vine". He singled out "Untouchable", "Chloraseptic", and "Like Home" as highlights.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=January 19, 2018|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/43qp9w/robert-christgau-joey-badass-timely-consciousness|title=Robert Christgau on Joey Bada$$'s Timely Consciousness|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|publisher=[[Vice Media]]|location=New York City|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref>

Trent Clark from ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said than "Eminem's dedication to wrecking mics like [[Robert Mueller]] can never be questioned but the production choices still remain an enigma. When he's not bathing in lamely visible rock samples like [[Joan Jett and the Blackhearts]]' "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]" or [[The Cranberries]]' "[[Zombie (The Cranberries song)|Zombie]]" (on "Remind Me" or "In Your Head" respectively), he's mostly square pegging his intensified lyrics on mechanical slabs of assembly line pop hybrids." He singled out "Framed" and "Castle" as highlights: "it's largely the retreads of past glory where he hits his stride the hardest. On the hypnotically-produced "Framed," Marshall dons the hockey mask for old times sake and pulls up off homicidal fantasies that for better or worse, feature the album's most in-pocket rhyme moment. And when he plunges into his drug-altered psyche to speak on his greatest love — his daughter [[Hailie Mathers|Haile Jade]] — the ever-reliable [[DJ Khalil]] steps up to the plate on "Castle" with a darkened soundbed of macabre guitars and deathly drum marches that feature the album's most vintage Eminem moment."<ref>https://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.3049/title.review-eminems-revival-a-sober-middling-effort-from-a-weathered-legend#</ref> Mitch Findlay from ''HotNewHipHop'' wrote a similar critics and said: "Revival is, by far, Eminem's most pop-friendly album to date. While previous albums merely flirted with the sound, Revival has bought a ring and proposed to it. Therefore, if you're somebody who finds no pleasure in the production of "pop-rap," you'll find no solace here." He singled out "Framed," "Castle" and "Arose" as highlights, calling the latter two are "among Revival's strongest tracks. Conceptually and lyrically, the closing pair find Eminem in excellent form, and longtime fans will no doubt cite these two as album highlights."<ref>{{cite web|first=Mitch|last=Findley|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/eminem-revival-review-news.41112.html|title=Eminem "Revival" Review|website=HotNewHipHop|date=December 20, 2017|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}</ref>

About the album reaction, Eminem said: "I think there's things to be taken away from this album and the reaction to it. Were there too many songs? Were there too many features? There were certain songs like "Tragic Endings" and "Need Me" where I felt like lyrically they would give the listener a second to breathe. I spend a lot of time writing shit that I think nobody ever gets."<ref>{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Rys|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/8095496/eminem-paul-rosenberg-interview-billboard-cover-story-2018|title=Eminem and New Def Jam CEO Paul Rosenberg on Early 'Broke Days,' Courting Controversy and Hip-Hop's Future|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=October 23, 2018}}</ref> Later he said: "When the ''Revival'' tracklist came down the pipe, it was like overwhelmingly, 'This shit is going to be trash.' Nobody really wanted to be wrong about it. I'm not saying everybody, but a lot of people had already formed their opinion." He also stated that he is proud of the album, saying: "I'm good with ''Revival''. Fuck it.
