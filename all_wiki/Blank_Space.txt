"'''Blank Space'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fifth studio album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]''. The song was released to US radio stations as the second single from ''1989'' on November 10, 2014, by [[Republic Records]] in partnership with Swift's label at the time, [[Big Machine Records|Big Machine]]. Swift co-wrote "Blank Space" with its producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. For the lyrics, she conceived the song as a satirical self-referential nod to her reputation as a flirtatious woman with a series of romantic attachments, which blemished her once-wholesome [[girl next door]] image. Musically, it is an [[electropop]] song with minimal [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced beats.

"Blank Space" spent seven weeks atop the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified [[RIAA certifications#Singles|eight times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and has sold 4.6&nbsp;million copies in the US as of July 2019. It also topped charts in Australia, Canada, Iceland, Scotland, and South Africa. The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) reported "Blank Space" as one of the best-selling singles of 2015, with 9.2&nbsp;million track-equivalent units. Contemporary critics praised the song's production and Swift's songwriting; some picked it as ''1989''{{'s}} highlight. The song earned three nominations at the [[58th Grammy Awards]], including two [[List of Grammy Award categories#General Field|general categories]]—[[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. It featured on decade-end lists by such publications as ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Slant Magazine]]''.

[[Joseph Kahn]] directed the music video for "Blank Space", which depicts Swift as a jealous woman who acts erratically upon suspecting her boyfriend's infidelity. Photography took place mostly at [[Oheka Castle]], with a few additional scenes shot at [[Woolworth Estate]]. The video won [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]] at the [[2015 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Swift included "Blank Space" on the set lists for two of her concert tours: [[the 1989 World Tour]] (2015) and [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018). The song has been adapted into [[cover version]]s of different genres by several [[rock music|rock]] musicians including [[I Prevail]] and [[Ryan Adams]].
