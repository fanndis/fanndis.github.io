'''''Artpop''''' (stylized in [[all caps]]) is the third studio album recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as "a celebration and a poetic musical journey" and an exploration of the "reverse [[Andy Warhol|Warholian]]" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional "lack of maturity and responsibility" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Musically, ''Artpop'' is an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[synth-pop]] album, with influences from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[techno]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], and [[dubstep]], among other genres. The themes of the album revolve around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. In 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]'', Kelly's featured song, "[[Do What U Want]]", was removed from all streaming and online versions and new vinyl and CD pressings of the album.

The release of ''Artpop'' was prefaced by a two-day album release party dubbed [[ArtRave]]. The album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], although it was included in several year-end lists by critics and publications. It debuted at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide. The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014. Despite this, the album was considered by some as a commercial failure compared to Gaga's previous albums.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tampabay.com/arts-entertainment/music/2019/11/13/why-lady-gaga-should-not-cancel-artpop/|title=Why Lady Gaga should not cancel ARTPOP|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=November 13, 2019|accessdate=April 22, 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200421224140/https://www.tampabay.com/arts-entertainment/music/2019/11/13/why-lady-gaga-should-not-cancel-artpop/|archivedate=April 21, 2020|first=Stephaine|last=Hayes|quote=The album was a flop by Gaga standards...}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-dont-remember-artpop-2641309560.html?rebelltitem=15#rebelltitem15|title=Little Monsters Cancel Lady Gaga After She Disses 'ARTPOP'|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|date=November 11, 2019|accessdate=April 22, 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200421224403/https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-dont-remember-artpop-2641309560.html?rebelltitem=15%23rebelltitem15#rebelltitem15|archivedate=April 21, 2020|first=Jael|last=Goldfine|quote=ARTPOP arrived in 2013 as an overblown, musically confused commercial flop, doing only one fourth of Born This Way's sales.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2020/06/on-chromatica-lady-gaga-struggles-along-with-us-to-find-what-normal-is/ |title=On Chromatica, Lady Gaga Struggles Along With Us to Find What Normal Is |website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |last=Weiss |first=Dan |date=June 3, 2020 |accessdate=June 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200603200400/https://www.spin.com/2020/06/on-chromatica-lady-gaga-struggles-along-with-us-to-find-what-normal-is/ |archive-date=June 3, 2020 |url-status=live |quote=Artpop didn’t meet commercial expectations (despite reaching no. 1 and selling more than 2 million copies) }}</ref>

"[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]" was released as the [[lead single]] from ''Artpop'' on August 12, 2013, and was a critical and commercial success, charting within the top ten in more than 20 countries worldwide, peaking at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the United States. The second single, "Do What U Want", was made available on October 21, reaching number 13 in the US. It was followed by promotional singles "[[Venus (Lady Gaga song)|Venus]]" and "[[Dope (Lady Gaga song)|Dope]]" shortly before the album's release. "[[G.U.Y.]]" was the third and last single released from the album. Gaga promoted ''Artpop'' with several television appearances and performances, including her second [[Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular|Thanksgiving Day special]]. After a short [[Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom|residency at Roseland Ballroom]], she also embarked on her fourth headlining concert tour, [[ArtRave: The Artpop Ball]].

Gaga recruited [[Jeff Koons]] into the project in early 2013, with the two having previously met at a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga provided a live performance. According to Koons, she "just kind of grabbed ahold of me and gave me a big hug around my waist " and replied, "You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work."<ref name="Koonsmtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means|first=Brenna|last=Ehrlich|publisher=MTV News|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=November 9, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Following her hip surgery in February 2013, the singer was forced into a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with her creative team, the Haus of Gaga in addition to sharing "creative gifts".<ref name=wwd/> This stage allowed her to review and enhance her creative direction, which she admitted to be a meticulous "gazing process". "I have to gaze into the work for long periods of time for it to be good," adding that upon analyzing her ideas, she received "that wonderful feeling" which told her "that's the one".<ref name="wwd">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/lady-gaga-im-every-icon-7068388?module=hp-eye|title=Lady Gaga: 'I'm Every Icon'|first=Jessica|last=Iredale|date=July 28, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013|work=[[Women's Wear Daily]]|publisher=Paul Jowdy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023110353/http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/lady-gaga-im-every-icon-7068388?module=hp-eye|archivedate=October 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Artwork===
On October 7, 2013, Gaga unveiled the album cover for ''Artpop'' on Clear Channel billboards around the world. Created by Jeff Koons, the image features a nude sculpture of Gaga<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1715169/lady-gaga-artpop-cover.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Unveils ARTPOP Cover: See It Here! - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=October 7, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010051155/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1715169/lady-gaga-artpop-cover.jhtml|archivedate=October 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> with a blue gazing ball in front of her. The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for "Applause" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:

[[File:Jeff Koons Shankbone 2009 Vanity Fair.jpg|upright|thumb|American artist [[Jeff Koons]] designed the cover artwork for ''Artpop''.]]
{{blockquote|"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything — and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' — and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is Botticelli's ''The Birth of Venus'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] — of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Brown however praised the album as "great for dancing".<ref name=telegraph/> [[Alexis Petridis]] from ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested there was "some decent pop" on ''Artpop'' but thought the art was "rather harder to discern".<ref name="Guardianreview">{{cite web|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|authorlink=Alexis Petridis|title=Lady Gaga: Artpop – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/07/lady-gaga-artpop-review|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=November 7, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412133242/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/07/lady-gaga-artpop-review|archivedate=April 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]''{{'s}} Andy Gill commented, "It's hard not to feel underwhelmed by ''Artpop''",<ref name=IndependentReview/> while Caryn Ganz from ''Rolling Stone'' called it "a bizarre album of squelchy disco" and "sexual but not sexy".<ref name=RollingStone/>

Some journalists felt that the more mixed response from critics in comparison to Gaga's previous work was unfair and stemmed from a focus on the singer herself and not purely on the album's content. Nick Messitte of ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' criticized music critics, denouncing their reviews as being "incoherent" and focusing on the "artist over the art itself," accusing them of "bend[ing] over backwards to mention everything else before the music".
