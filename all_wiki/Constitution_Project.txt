The '''Constitution Project''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[think tank]] in the [[United States]] whose goal is to build [[bipartisan]] consensus on significant [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] and legal questions. Its founder and president is Virginia Sloan. The Constitution Project’s work is divided between two programs: the Rule of Law Program and the Criminal Justice Program. Each program houses bipartisan committees focused on specific constitutional issues.<ref>{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514202048/http://www.constitutionproject.org/about/index.cfm | archive-date=14 May 2008 | url=http://www.constitutionproject.org/about/index.cfm | title=Our Work | last= | first= | date= | website=The Constitution Project | accessdate=27 April 2018 }}</ref>
