==History==

===Early history===
Valentino was founded in 1960 when Garavani opened a fashion house on [[Via Condotti]] in [[Rome, Italy]] with the backing of his father and his father's associate Giancarlo Giammetti.<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/08/valentino200408</ref>

===Rise to popularity===
Valentino's international debut took place in 1962 in Florence, the [[Italian fashion]] capital of the time.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BeGCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT219 |page=219 |title=492 Great Things About Being Italian |author=Boze Hadleigh}}</ref> Valentino has also specially designed wedding dresses for [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Sophie Hunter]] and [[Princess Madeleine of Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowles|first1=Hamish|title=Sophie Hunter Valentino Couture Wedding Dress|url=http://sophiehunter.net/post/114487894930/sophie-hunter-for-american-vogue-april-2015|website=Sophie Hunter Central}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity Brides Who Wore Valentino on their Big Day|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2013060512914/celebrity-brides-valentino-wedding-dresses/|website=Hello Magazine}}</ref>

===From HDP group to Marzotto group===
In 1998, Garavani and Giammetti sold the company for approximately $300&nbsp;million to [[HdP]], an Italian conglomerate controlled, in part, by the late [[Gianni Agnelli]], the head of [[Fiat]]. In 2002, Valentino S.p.A., with revenues of more than $180&nbsp;million, was sold by HdP to [[Marzotto]] Apparel, a Milan-based textile giant, for $210&nbsp;million. It was rumored that HDP was displeased with Garavani's and Giammetti's personal expenses, a claim at which Giammetti has bristled.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2004/08/valentino200408?currentPage=all "So Very Valentino"], by Matt Tyrnauer, ''Vanity Fair'', August 2004.</ref>

===Purchase by Qatar===
In 2012, [[Qatar]] acquired Valentino for 700 million euros through an investment vehicle called Mayhoola for Investments S.P.C.<ref>{{cite news |title=Qatari royals buy Italian fashion icon Valentino |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-valentino-qatar-idUSBRE86B0TH20120712 |accessdate=28 July 2019 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=12 July 2012 |first1=Lisa|last1=Jucca |first2=Simon|last2=Meads |first3=Nair|last3=Dinesh |first4=Antonella|last4=Ciancio |first5=Nina|last5=Sovich |editor-first1=Sophie|editor-last1=Walker }}</ref>

===Materials===
In 2020, the fashion house announced that it would no longer use alpaca wool and severed ties with Mallkini, the world's largest privately owned alpaca farm in Peru. The move followed revelations of animal abuse within the alpaca industry.<ref>Sarah Maisey,"[https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/fashion/valentino-and-prada-to-halt-use-of-alpaca-wool-and-kangaroo-leather-1.1064620 Valentino and Prada to halt use of alpaca wool and kangaroo leather]," ''The National'' 17 August 2020.</ref>
