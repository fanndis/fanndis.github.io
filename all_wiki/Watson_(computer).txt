==Description==
[[File:DeepQA.svg|350px|thumb|The high-level architecture of IBM's DeepQA used in Watson<ref name="AIMagazine"/>]]
Watson was created as a [[question answering]] (QA) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced [[natural language processing]], [[information retrieval]], [[knowledge representation]], [[automated reasoning]], and [[machine learning]] technologies to the field of [[open domain question answering]].<ref name=ibm/>

<blockquote>The key difference between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns a list of documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise answer to the question.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://craigrhinehart.com/2011/01/17/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-technology-behind-watson/ |title=10 Things You Need to Know About the Technology Behind Watson |date=January 17, 2011 |first=Craig |last=Rhinehart |work=Entrepreneurial and Intrapreneurial Insights |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

When created, IBM stated that, "more than 100 different techniques are used to analyze natural language, identify sources, find and generate hypotheses, find and score evidence, and merge and rank hypotheses."<ref>{{cite web |title=Watson, A System Designed for Answers: The Future of Workload Optimized Systems Design |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=POW03061USEN |work=IBM Systems and Technology |date=February 2011 |page=3 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref>

In recent years, the Watson capabilities have been extended and the way in which Watson works has been changed to take advantage of new deployment models (Watson on IBM Cloud) and evolved machine learning capabilities and optimised hardware available to developers and researchers. It is no longer purely a question answering (QA) computing system designed from Q&A pairs but can now 'see', 'hear', 'read', 'talk', 'taste', 'interpret', 'learn' and 'recommend'.

===Software===
Watson uses IBM's DeepQA software and the Apache [[UIMA]] (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) framework implementation. The system was written in various languages, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], and [[Prolog]], and runs on the [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] 11 operating system using the Apache [[Hadoop]] framework to provide distributed computing.<ref name="contentpages">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/219893/ibm_watson_vanquishes_human_jeopardy_foes.html|title=IBM Watson Vanquishes Human Jeopardy Foes|last=Jackson|first=Joab|date=February 17, 2011|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=February 17, 2011|agency=IDG News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/02/17/ibm-researcher-explains-what-watson-gets-right-and-wrong/ |title=IBM researcher explains what Watson gets right and wrong |work=VentureBeat |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Novell |authorlink=Novell |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421061200/http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20110202-906855.html |url=https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20110202-906855.html |archivedate=April 21, 2011 |title=Watson Supercomputer to Compete on 'Jeopardy!' – Powered by SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on IBM POWER7 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 2, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

===Hardware===
The system is workload-optimized, integrating [[massively parallel]] [[POWER7]] processors and built on IBM's ''DeepQA'' technology,<ref name="Smartest Machine on Earth">{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umbc.edu/2011/02/is-watson-the-smartest-machine-on-earth/ |title=Is Watson the smartest machine on earth? |work=Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Maryland Baltimore County |date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}</ref> which it uses to generate hypotheses, gather massive evidence, and analyze data.<ref name=ibm/> Watson employs a cluster of ninety IBM Power 750 servers, each of which uses a 3.5&nbsp;GHz POWER7 eight-core processor, with four threads per core. In total, the system has 2,880 POWER7 processor threads and 16 [[terabyte]]s of RAM.<ref name="Smartest Machine on Earth"/>

According to [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]], Watson can process 500 gigabytes, the equivalent of a million books, per second.<ref name=rennie>{{cite web |last=Rennie |first=John |url=http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/02/14/how-ibm%E2%80%99s-watson-computer-will-excel-at-jeopardy/ |title=How IBM's Watson Computer Excels at Jeopardy! |work=PLoS blogs |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> IBM's [[IBM Master Inventor|master inventor]] and senior consultant, Tony Pearson, estimated Watson's hardware cost at about three million dollars.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lucas |first=Mearian |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9210381/Can_anyone_afford_an_IBM_Watson_supercomputer_Yes_?taxonomyId=67&pageNumber=2 |title=Can anyone afford an IBM Watson supercomputer?

===Data===
The sources of information for Watson include [[encyclopedia]]s, [[dictionary|dictionaries]], [[thesaurus|thesauri]], [[newswire]] articles and [[literary work]]s. Watson also used databases, [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]] including  [[DBPedia]], [[WordNet]] and [[YAGO (database)|Yago]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The AI Behind Watson – The Technical Article |first=David |last=Ferrucci |display-authors=etal |url=http://www.aaai.org/Magazine/Watson/watson.php |journal=AI Magazine |issue=Fall 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref>  The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents, including dictionaries, encyclopedias and other reference material that it could use to build its knowledge.<ref name="nytmag">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Computer-t.html|title=Smarter Than You Think: What Is I.B.M.'s Watson?|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=June 16, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|accessdate=February 18, 2011|authorlink=Clive Thompson (journalist)}}</ref>

==Operation==

{{rquote|right|The computer's techniques for unravelling ''Jeopardy!'' clues sounded just like mine. That machine zeroes in on keywords in a clue then combs its memory (in Watson's case, a 15-terabyte databank of human knowledge) for clusters of associations with those words. It rigorously checks the top hits against all the contextual information it can muster: the category name; the kind of answer being sought; the time, place, and gender hinted at in the clue; and so on. And when it feels "sure" enough, it decides to buzz. This is all an instant, intuitive process for a human ''Jeopardy!'' player, but I felt convinced that under the hood my brain was doing more or less the same thing.|Ken Jennings<ref name="threads"/>}}

Watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases.<ref name=nytmag/> Watson's main innovation was not in the creation of a new [[algorithm]] for this operation but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven [[Computational semantics|language analysis]] algorithms simultaneously.<ref name=nytmag/><ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414214425/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/will-watson-win-jeopardy.html |archivedate=April 14, 2011 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/will-watson-win-jeopardy.html |work=Nova ScienceNOW |title=Will Watson Win On Jeopardy!? |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> The more algorithms that find the same answer independently, the more likely Watson is to be correct. Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions, it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not.<ref name=nytmag/>

===Comparison with human players===
[[File:Watson Jeopardy.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Jennings]], Watson, and [[Brad Rutter]] in their ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' exhibition match.]]

Watson's basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human ''Jeopardy!'' players.<ref name=cnet /> Watson has deficiencies in [[natural language understanding|understanding]] the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues.<ref name=nytmag /> Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response.<ref name=nytmag /> Watson has consistently better [[reaction time]] on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.<ref name=nytmag /><ref name=jenning />

In a sequence of 20 mock games of ''Jeopardy'', human participants were able to use the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding.<ref name=nytmag/> During that time, Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal.<ref name=nytmag/> Part of the system used to win the ''Jeopardy!'' contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the "ready" signal and then examined whether Watson's confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer. Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times, Watson's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated (instead of reacted to) the ready signal.<ref name=david>{{cite web |url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2011/01/how-watson-sees-hears-and-speaks-to-play-jeopardy/ |title=How Watson "sees," "hears," and "speaks" to play Jeopardy! |last=Gondek |first=David |date=January 10, 2011 |work=IBM Research News |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref> After signaling, Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in ''Jeopardy!''{{'s}} question format.<ref name=nytmag/> Watson's voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] program in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |last=Avery |first=Lise |date=February 14, 2011 |title=Interview with Actor Jeff Woodman, Voice of IBM's Watson Computer |url=http://www.anythinggoesradio.com/Interviews/JeffWoodman_02_14_11.MP3 |work=Anything Goes!! |format=MP3 |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref>

The ''Jeopardy!'' staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz,<ref name=david /> which was critical in many rounds.<ref name=jenning /> The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to [[perception|perceive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/biae.clemson.edu/bpc/bp/Lab/110/reaction.htm |title=A Literature Review on Reaction Time |first=Robert J. |last=Kosinski |work=Clemson University |year=2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref>{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=174}} Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=178}} The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light,<ref name=strachan /> but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time.<ref name=jenning /> Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=174}}<ref name=strachan />

==History==

===Development===
Since [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]]'s victory over [[Garry Kasparov]] in chess in 1997, IBM had been on the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the restaurant they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: [[Ken Jennings]], who was then in the middle of his successful 74-game run on ''Jeopardy!''. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch ''Jeopardy!''. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive [[Paul Horn (computer scientist)|Paul Horn]] supported Lickel, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing ''Jeopardy!'' with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|pp=6–8}} In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|p=30}}<ref>{{Cite conference |last1=Radev |first1=Dragomir R. |last2=Prager |first2=John |last3=Samn |first3=Valerie |title=Ranking potential answers to natural language questions |booktitle=Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing |year=2000 |url=http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/anlp00.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite conference |last1=Prager |first1=John |last2=Brown |first2=Eric |last3=Coden |first3=Annie |last4=Radev |first4=Dragomir R. |title=Question-answering by predictive annotation |booktitle=Proceedings, 23rd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval |date=July 2000 |url=http://clair.si.umich.edu/~radev/papers/sigir00.pdf}}</ref> To compete successfully on ''Jeopardy!'', Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.<ref name=nytmag/>

In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, the senior manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past ''Jeopardy!'' programs. While the best real-life competitors buzzed in half the time and responded correctly to as many as 95% of clues, Watson's first pass could get only about 15% correct. During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems.<ref name=nytmag/> [[John E.

A practice match was recorded on January 13, 2011, and the official matches were recorded on January 14, 2011. All participants maintained secrecy about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February.{{sfnp|Baker|2011|pp=232–258}}

====Practice match====
In a practice match before the press on January 13, 2011, Watson won a 15-question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a score of $4,400 to Jennings's $3,400 and Rutter's $1,200, though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final $1,000 question. None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue.<ref name="PracticeMatch">{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/ibms-watson-wins-jeopardy-practice-round-can-humans-hang/43601 |title=IBM's Watson wins Jeopardy practice round: Can humans hang? |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |last=Dignan |first=Larry |date=January 13, 2011 |work=[[ZDnet]]}}</ref>

====First match====
The first round was broadcast February 14, 2011, and the second round, on February 15, 2011. The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter.<ref name="1920sJeopardy Challenge">{{Cite episode |title=The IBM Challenge Day 1 |series=Jeopardy |serieslink=Jeopardy! |airdate=February 14, 2011 |season=27 |number=23}}</ref> Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible.<ref name="Strategy">{{cite web |url=http://ibmresearchnews.blogspot.com/2011/02/knowing-what-it-knows-selected-nuances.html |title=Knowing what it knows: selected nuances of Watson's strategy |last=Lenchner |first=Jon |publisher=[[IBM]] |work=IBM Research News |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> Watson's guess at the Daily Double location was correct. At the end of the first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.<ref name="1920sJeopardy Challenge" />

Watson's performance was characterized by some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings. (Jennings said "What are the '20s?" in reference to the 1920s. Then Watson said "What is 1920s?") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit for a response of "What is a leg?" after Jennings incorrectly responded "What is: he only had one hand?" to a clue about [[George Eyser]] (the correct response was, "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2011/02/ibms-watson-tied-for-1st-in-jeopardy-almost-sneaks-wrong-answer-by-trebek.ars |title=Jeopardy: IBM's Watson almost sneaks wrong answer by Trebek |last=Johnston |first=Casey |work=Ars Technica |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246.<ref name="Computer crushes the competition on 'Jeopardy!'"/> Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex [[Regression analysis|regression model]] called the Game State Evaluator.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tesauro |first=Gerald |url=http://ibmresearchnews.blogspot.com/2011/02/watsons-wagering-strategies.html |title=Watson's wagering strategies |publisher=[[IBM]] |work=IBM Research News |date=February 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>

Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively. Watson wagered only $947 on the question.

The game ended with Jennings with $4,800, Rutter with $10,400, and Watson with $35,734.<ref name="Computer crushes the competition on 'Jeopardy!'"/>

====Match against members of the United States Congress====
On February 28, 2011, Watson played an untelevised exhibition match of ''Jeopardy!'' against members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. In the first round, [[Rush D.
