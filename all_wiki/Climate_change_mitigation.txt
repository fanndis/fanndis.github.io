Currently human activities are adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it.<ref name="meehl stabilizing ghg concentrations"/> 
According to a 2011 US study, stabilizing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations would require anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to be reduced by 80% relative to the peak emissions level.<ref name="us nrc co2 stabilization">[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&page=21 2.

The IPCC works with the concept of a fixed carbon [[emissions budget]]. If emissions remain on the current level of 42 Gt{{CO2}}, the carbon budget for 1.5°C could be exhausted in 2028.<ref>{{Harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|p=96}}</ref>

After leaving room for emissions for food production for 9 billion people and to keep the global temperature rise below 2&nbsp;°C, emissions from energy production and transport will have to peak almost immediately in the developed world and decline at about 10% each year until zero emissions are reached around 2030.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Beyond 'dangerous' climate change: emission scenarios for a new world|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|first1=Kevin|last1=Anderson|first2=Alice|last2=Bows|date=13 January 2011|volume=369|issue=1934|pages=20–44|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0290|pmid=21115511|bibcode=2011RSPTA.369...20A|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A new paradigm for climate change|journal=Nature Climate Change|first1=Kevin|last1=Anderson|first2=Alice|last2=Bows|s2cid=84963926|volume=2|issue=9|pages=639–40|doi=10.1038/nclimate1646|year=2012|bibcode=2012NatCC...2..639A}}</ref><ref>Anderson K.

[[Short-lived climate pollutants|Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)]] emissions like [[methane]] may be reduced by controlling fugitive emissions from oil and gas production and controlling emissions from coal mining. [[Black carbon]] emissions may be mitigated by upgrading coke ovens, installing particulate filters on diesel-based engines and minimizing open burning of biomass. Continued phase down of manufacture and use of [[Hydrofluorocarbon|hydroflourocarbons (HFCs)]] under the [[Montreal Protocol]] will help reduce HFC emissions and concurrently improve the energy efficiency of appliances that use HFCs like air conditioners, freezers and refrigerators.

Other frequently discussed efficiency means include public transport, increasing [[fuel economy in automobiles]] (which includes the use of [[hybrid vehicle|electric hybrids]]), charging [[plug-in hybrid]]s and [[electric car]]s by [[low-carbon power|low-carbon electricity]], making [[individual and political action on climate change|individual changes]],<ref>{{citation

The global [[primary energy]] demand was 161,320 TWh in 2018.<ref name="IEA GECO">{{harvnb|Global Energy & CO2 Status Report|2019}}</ref> This refers to electricity, transport and heating including all losses. 
The primary energy demand in a low-carbon economy is difficult to determine. In transport and electricity production, fossil fuel usage has a low efficiency of less than 50%. Motors of vehicles produce a lot of heat which is wasted. Electrification of all sectors and switching to renewable energy can lower the primary energy demand significantly. On the other hand, storage requirements, [[Energy_density#Tables_of_energy_content|energy density issues of batteries]] and reconversion to electricity lower the efficiency of renewable energy.

In 2018, biomass and waste was listed with a share of 10% of primary energy, hydro power with 3%. Wind, solar energy and other renewables were at 2%.<ref name="IEA GECO"/>

===Low-carbon energy sources===
{{See also|Low-carbon economy|Renewable energy|Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy debate|Emission intensity#Energy sources emission intensity per unit of energy generated}}

Wind and sun can be sources for large amounts of low-carbon energy at competitive production costs. Solar PV module prices fell by around 80% in the 2010s, and wind turbine prices by 30–40%.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.irena.org/costs |title = Costs (of renewable energy)|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> But even in combination, generation of [[variable renewable energy]] fluctuates a lot. This can be tackled by extending [[super grid|grids]] over large areas with a sufficient capacity or by using [[energy storage]].
According to the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA), the deployment of [[renewable energy]] would have to be accelerated six-fold though to stay under the 2 °C target.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Energy Transformation: A Roadmap to 2050 (2019 edition)|url=https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2019/Apr/IRENA_Global_Energy_Transformation_2019.pdf|publisher=IRENA|accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref>

*A different technology is [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a receiver. With CSP, the energy can be saved up for a few hours. Prices in Chile are expected to fall below 0.05 US$/KWh in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Thermal could fall to 45 Euros in 2020|url=http://helioscsp.com/the-solar-thermal-could-fall-to-45-euros-mwh-in-2020-for-some-concentrated-solar-power-projects|publisher=HeliosCSP|accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref>
*[[Solar water heating]] makes an important and growing contribution in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70 percent of the global total (180 GWth). Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households.

Burning plant-derived [[biomass]] releases {{CO2}}, but it has still been classified as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks because photosynthesis cycles the {{CO2}} back into new crops. How a fuel is produced, transported and processed has a significant impact on lifecycle emissions.  Transporting fuels over long distances and excessive use of nitrogen fertilisers can reduce the emissions savings made by the same fuel compared to natural gas by between 15 and 50 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biomass - Carbon sink or carbon sinner|url=https://fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/Biomass__carbon_sink_or_carbon_sinner_summary_report.pdf|publisher=UK environment agency|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Renewable [[biofuel]]s are starting to be used in aviation.

===Energy storage===
{{Main|Energy storage}}
{{See also|Hydrogen economy}}
Wind energy and photovoltaics can deliver large amounts of electric energy but not at any time and place. One approach is the conversation into storable forms of energy. This generally leads to losses in efficiency. A study by [[Imperial College London]] calculated the lowest levelised cost of different systems for mid-term and seasonal storage. In 2020, [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]] (PHES), [[Compressed-air energy storage|compressed air]] (CAES) and [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-on batteries]] are most cost effective depending on charging rhythm. For 2040, a more significant role for Li-on and hydrogen is projected.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|Melchior|Hawkes|Staffell|2019}}</ref>

===Super grids===
{{Main|Super grid}}
Long-distance power lines help to minimize storage requirements. A continental transmission network can smoothen local variations of wind energy. With a global grid, even photovoltaics could be available all day and night.

===Smart grid and load management===
{{Main|Smart grid|Load management}}
Instead of expanding grids and storage for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Identifying and shifting electrical loads can reduce power bills by taking advantage of lower off-peak rates and flatten demand peaks. Traditionally, the energy system has treated consumer demand as fixed and used centralised supply options to manage variable demand. Now, better data systems and emerging onsite storageand generation technologies can combine with advanced, automated demand control software to pro-actively manage demand and respond to energy market prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy and Load Management|url=https://arena.gov.au/assets/2018/10/REALM-Industry-Report_public_FINAL.pdf|publisher=UTS University of Technology Sydney|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>

[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.

[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.

[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.

===Decarbonization of transport===
[[File:Societe de transport de Montreal bus 36-902 - 08.jpg|thumb|[[Electric bus]] in [[Montreal]]]]

Although [[aviation biofuel]] is used somewhat, {{as of|2019||lc=y}} decarbonisation of aviation by 2050 is claimed to be "really difficult".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/aviation-network-decarbonisation-issues|title=The aviation network - Decarbonisation issues|website=www.eurocontrol.int|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

===Decarbonization of heating===
{{See also|Electric heating}}
The buildings sector accounts for 23% of global energy-related CO2 emissions<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Ch2|2018|p=141}}</ref> About half of the energy is used for space and water heating.<ref>{{harvnb|IEA ETP Buildings|2017}}</ref> A combination of electric heat pumps and building insolation can reduce the primary energy demand significantly. Generally, electrification of heating would only reduce GHG emissions if the electric power comes from low-carbon sources. A fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]] to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid. 

====Heat pump====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]
A modern heat pump typically produces around three times more thermal energy than electrical energy consumed, giving an effective efficiency of 300%, depending on the [[coefficient of performance]]. It uses an electrically driven compressor to operate a [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycle]] that extracts heat energy from outdoor air and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed for [[air conditioner|air conditioning]].
In areas with average winter temperatures well below freezing, ground source heat pumps are more efficient than air-source heat pumps. The high purchase price of a heat pump compared to resistance heaters may be offset when air conditioning is also needed. 

With a market share of 30% and clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global {{CO2}} emissions by 8% annually.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Staffell Iain|display-authors=et al |year= 2012 |title= A review of domestic heat pumps |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 5 |issue= 11 |pages= 9291–9306 |doi= 10.1039/c2ee22653g}}</ref> Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the [[primary energy]] demand and 90% of {{CO2}} emissions of natural gas boilers in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Carvalho |display-authors=et al |year= 2015 |title= Ground source heat pump carbon emissions and primary energy reduction potential for heating in buildings in Europe—results of a case study in Portugal |url= |journal= [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 755–768 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.034}}</ref> Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sternberg André, Bardow André |year= 2015 |title= Power-to-What? – Environmental assessment of energy storage systems |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |pages= 389–400 |doi= 10.1039/c4ee03051f}}</ref>

====Electric resistant heating====
[[radiant heating|Radiant heaters]] in households are cheap and widespread but less efficient than heat pumps. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common. Large scale hot water tanks can be used for demand-side management and store variable renewable energy over hours or days.

==Energy conservation==
Reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>

===Energy efficiency===
{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}
Energy efficiency means using the least amount of energy to perform a task or the ability of a piece of equipment to use the least amount of energy to perform a task. To conserve energy or reduce electricity costs, individual consumers or businesses may deliberately purchase energy efficient products that use refrigerants with low global warming potential (GWP) or products that are ENERGY STAR certified.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ENERGY STAR|url=https://www.energystar.gov/|access-date=2020-12-02|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en}}</ref> In general, the more the number of ENERGY STARS, the more efficient the product is. A procurement toolkit<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=29 September 2020|title=Procurement Recommendations for Climate Friendly Refrigerants|url=https://www.sustainablepurchasing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020.09.29_Climate_Friendly_Refrigerants_Action_Team_FINAL.pdf|journal=|publisher=Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council, IGSD|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> to assist individuals and businesses buy energy efficient products that use low GWP refrigerants was developed by the Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council<ref>{{Cite web|title=SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING LEADERSHIP COUNCIL|url=https://www.sustainablepurchasing.org/|access-date=2020-12-02|website=SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING LEADERSHIP COUNCIL|language=en-US}}</ref> and is available for use. Products with refrigerants include household refrigerators and freezers, commercial stand-alone refrigerators and freezers, lab-grade refrigerators and freezers, commercial ice makers, vending machines, water dispensers, water coolers, room air conditioners and vehicles. Efficiency covers a wide range of means from [[building insulation]] to [[public transport]]. The [[cogeneration]] of electric energy and [[district heat]] also improves efficiency. 

===Lifestyle and behavior===

The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name="edenhofer-etal-2014">{{cite book

Examples would be heating a room less or driving less. In general, higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact. The sources of emissions have also been shown to be highly unevenly distributed, with 45% of emissions coming from the lifestyles of just 10% of the global population.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Chancel|first1=Lucas|last2=Piketty|first2=Thomas|date=2015-12-01|title=Carbon and inequality: From Kyoto to Paris|url=https://voxeu.org/article/carbon-and-inequality-kyoto-paris|access-date=2020-09-14|website=VoxEU.org}}</ref> Several scientific studies have shown that when relatively rich people wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are a few key actions they can take such as living [[car-free movement|car-free]] (2.4 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>), avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes) and eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes).<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017>{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W|doi-access= free }}</ref>

These appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for "greening" one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the "low-impact" category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, school textbooks, etc.<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/><ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05>{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

Scientists also argue that piecemeal behavioural changes like re-using plastic bags are not a proportionate response to climate change. Though being beneficial, these debates would drive public focus away from the requirement for an energy system change of unprecedented scale to decarbonise rapidly.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Corner |first1=Adam |title='Every little helps' is a dangerous mantra for climate change |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/plastic-bags-climate-change-every-little-helps |accessdate=31 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=13 December 2013}}</ref>

====Dietary change====
{{See also|Low-carbon diet}}

Overall, food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based GHG emissions with nearly 20% of the global carbon footprint, followed by housing, mobility, services, manufactured products, and construction. Food and services are more significant in poor countries, while mobility and manufactured goods are more significant in rich countries.<ref name="fleurbaey-etal-2014">{{cite book

A [[carbon sink]] is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing [[forest]]. [[Carbon dioxide removal]] on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are [[carbon capture and storage|direct air capture]], [[enhanced weathering]] technologies such as storing it in [[geologic sequestration of CO2|geologic formations]] underground and [[biochar]]. These processes are sometimes considered variations of sinks or mitigation,<ref>{{cite web

===Carbon dioxide removal===
{{Main|Carbon dioxide removal|Greenhouse gas remediation|Carbon sequestration}}

[[Carbon dioxide removal]] has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing. A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.<ref name=RoyalSociety>The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 "Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty"]. Retrieved 2009-09-12.</ref>

It is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for [[carbon capture and storage|geological storage]] of carbon may make [[carbon dioxide air capture]] viable commercially. It is, however, generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to [[carbon capture and storage]] from major sources&nbsp;— in particular, fossil fuel powered power stations, refineries, etc. As in the case of the US [[Kemper Project]] with carbon capture, costs of energy produced will grow significantly. CO<sub>2</sub> can also be used in commercial [[greenhouse]]s, giving an opportunity to kick-start the technology.

Effective [[urban planning]] to reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] aims to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.

At the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.

Approaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through "medium-density", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book "Sustainability and Cities" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->

Smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.

====Building design====

New buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, high-efficiency appliances (particularly [[water heating|hot water heaters]] and [[furnaces]]), [[insulated glazing|double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows]], external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources such as [[geothermal heat pump|shallow geothermal]] and [[passive solar]] energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. In addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat, it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured, more reflective materials in the development of urban areas (e.g. by painting roofs white) and planting trees.<ref>{{cite web

===Societal controls===
{{Main|Personal carbon credits}}

Another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable "[[personal carbon credits]]". The idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their 'carbon footprint' by the way they live. Each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel, buy food, and go about their business. It has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems; pollution and poverty, old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often, so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth.{{citation needed|reason=previous source deadlink|date=April 2009}}

====Population====
Various organizations{{cn|date=November 2019}} promote [[human population planning]] as a means for mitigating global warming.<ref>[http://www.populationconnection.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_us Population Connection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111052139/http://www.populationconnection.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_us |date=2015-01-11 }} Statement of Policy</ref> Proposed measures include improving access to [[family planning]] and [[reproductive health]] care and information, reducing [[natalistic politics]], public education about the consequences of continued population growth, and improving access of women to education and economic opportunities.

==Costs and benefits==
{{Main|Economics of climate change mitigation}}

Globally the benefits of keeping warming under 2&nbsp;°C exceed the costs.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampedro|Smith|Arto|González-Eguino|2020}}.</ref> However some consider [[cost–benefit analysis]] unsuitable for analysing climate change mitigation as a whole, but still useful for analysing the difference between a 1.5 °C target and 2 °C.<ref name=":0" />.The [[OECD]] has been applying economic models and qualitative assessments to inform on climate change benefits and tradeoffs.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Economics of climate change mitigation|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/cc/economicsofclimatechangemitigation.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

===Costs===
One way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes. Policy makers can compare the [[marginal abatement costs]] of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time. The marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country, by sector, and over time.<ref name="stern" /> Mitigation costs will vary according to how and when emissions are cut: early, well-planned action will minimise the costs.<ref name="stern" />

Many economists estimate the cost of climate change mitigation at between 1% and 2% of [[gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/blog/can-cost-benefit-analysis-grasp-the-climate-change-nettle-and-can-we-justify-ambitious-targets/|title=Can cost benefit analysis grasp the climate change nettle? And can we…|website=Oxford Martin School|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref> In 2019, scientists from [[Australia]], and [[Germany]]  presented the "One Earth Climate Model" showing how temperature increase can be limited to 1.5 °C for 1.7 trillion dollars a year.<ref>{{cite web |title=One Earth Climate Model |url=https://oneearth.uts.edu.au/ |website=One Earth Climate Model |publisher=University of Technology, Climate and Energy College, German Aerospace Center |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chow |first1=Lorraine |title=DiCaprio-Funded Study: Staying Below 1.5ºC is Totally Possible |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/dicaprio-climate-change-2626634576.html |accessdate=22 January 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=21 January 2019}}</ref>
According to this study, a global investment of approximately $1.7 trillion per year would be needed to [[Paris Agreement|keep global warming below 1.5°C]]. The method used by the One Earth Climate Model does not resort to dangerous geo-engineering methods. Whereas this is a large sum, it is still far less than the [[energy subsidies|subsidies]] governments currently provided to the ailing fossil fuel industry, estimated at more than $5 trillion per year by the International Monetary Fund.<ref>[https://www.oneearth.org/the-one-earth-climate-model/ One Earth Climate Model]</ref><ref>[https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783030058425 Achieving the Paris Climate Agreement goals]</ref>

===Benefits===
By addressing climate change, we can avoid the costs associated with the [[effects of climate change]].
According to the [[Stern Review]], inaction can be as high as the equivalent of losing at least 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year, now and forever (up to 20% of the GDP or more when including a wider range of risks and impacts), whereas mitigating climate change will only cost about [[Stern_Review#Stern's_later_comments|2% of the GDP]].
Also, delaying to take significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may not be a good idea, when seen from a financial perspective.<ref>[https://theconversation.com/inaction-on-climate-change-risks-leaving-future-generations-530-trillion-in-debt-81134 Inaction on climate change risks leaving future generations $530 trillion in debt]</ref><ref>[https://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/8/577/2017/ Young people's burden: requirement of negative CO2 emissions]</ref>

The research organization Project Drawdown identified global climate solutions and ranked them according to their benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank|title=Summary of Solutions by Overall Rank|date=2017-04-05|website=Drawdown|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> Early deaths due to fossil fuel [[air pollution]] with a temperature rise to 2&nbsp;°C cost more globally than mitigation would: and in India cost 4 to 5 times more.<ref>{{harvnb|Sampedro|Smith|Arto|González-Eguino|2020}}.</ref>

===Sharing===
One of the aspects of mitigation is how to share the costs and benefits of mitigation policies. In terms of the politics of mitigation, the UNFCCC's ultimate objective is to stabilize concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere at a level that would [[Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change|prevent "dangerous" climate change]] (Rogner ''et al.'', 2007).<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>  Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as [[cooking]]. For richer people, emissions tend to be associated with things such as eating [[beef]], [[car]]s, [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flying]], and [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|home heating]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/behaviour-change-public-engagement-and-net-zero-imperial-college-london/|title=Behaviour change, public engagement and Net Zero (Imperial College London)|website=Committee on Climate Change|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.

====Distributing emissions abatement costs====
There have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;103–105):<ref name=banuri/>
*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.
*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.
*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the "polluter-pays principle", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:
**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book
|year=1996
|author=Goldemberg, J.
|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment. In: Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (J.P. Bruce ''et al''. Eds.)

|doi=10.2277/0521568544
|display-authors=etal
|url-access=registration
}}</ref>
**''Comparable burdens and ability to pay'': with this approach, countries would reduce emissions based on comparable burdens and their ability to take on the costs of reduction. Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].
**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.

====Specific proposals====
*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.
*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106–107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.
*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.

[[File:Mitigation pathways.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|alt=Refer to caption and image description|The graph shows multiple pathways to limit climate change to 1.5&nbsp;°C or 2&nbsp;°C. All pathways include negative emission technologies such as afforestation and [[bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]].]]
The main current international agreement on combating climate change is the [[Paris agreement]]. The Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels; and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that it undertakes to mitigate global warming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/bigpicture/|title=UNFCCC eHandbook: Summary of the Paris Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=unfccc.int|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Climate change mitigation measures can be written down in national environmental policy documents like the [[Intended nationally determined contributions|nationally determined contributions (NDC)]].

The Paris agreement succeeds the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] which expires in 2020, and is an [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|Countries that ratified the Kyoto protocol]] committed to reduce their emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in [[emissions trading]] if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases.

Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0&nbsp;°C of global warming above
pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8&nbsp;°C to 1.2&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{harvnb|IPCC SR15 Summary for Policymakers|2018|p=4}}</ref>

====Investment====
{{See also|Fossil fuel divestment}}

Another indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy, and pursue sustainability and environmental protection, is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means, something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=Journal of World Energy Law and Business|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}</ref>

Although state policies tackling climate change are seen as a threat to investors, so is global warming itself. As well as a policy risk, [[Ernst & Young|Ernst and Young]] identify physical, secondary, liability, transitional and reputation-based risks.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-climate-change-and-investment/$FILE/EY-climate-change-and-investment.pdf|title=Climate Change: The Investment Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=Ernst and Young|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref> Therefore, it is increasingly seen to be in the interest of investors to accept climate change as a real threat which they must proactively and independently address.

====Carbon emissions trading====
{{Main|Carbon emissions trading}}

With the creation of a [[market (economics)|market]] for [[carbon emissions trading|trading carbon dioxide emissions]] within the Kyoto Protocol, it is likely that London financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business; the [[NYSE|New York]] and [[Chicago Stock Exchange|Chicago]] stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the US maintains its rejection of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1509761,00.html How high-pressure politics threatens action on climate] The Observer June 2005</ref>

In the north-east United States, a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceprogress.org/2013/02/success-of-northeast-cap-and-trade-system-shows-market-based-climate-policy-is-well-within-reach/|title=Success of Northeast Cap-and-Trade System Shows Market-Based Climate Policy Is Well Within Reach|access-date=2014-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108034730/https://scienceprogress.org/2013/02/success-of-northeast-cap-and-trade-system-shows-market-based-climate-policy-is-well-within-reach/|archive-date=2019-01-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS)<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS)] from ''ec.europa.eu''</ref> is the largest multi-national, greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. It commenced operation on 1 January 2005, and all 28 member states of the [[European Union]] participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35&nbsp;billion Euros (US$43&nbsp;billion) per year.<ref>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp The $20,000,000,000,000 question] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050615002442/http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-climate_change_debate/2570.jsp |date=2005-06-15 }} ''Robins, Nick'' for Opendemocracy</ref> The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] was the first (voluntary) emissions market, and is soon to be followed by Asia's first market ([[Asia Carbon Exchange]]).

Twenty three [[multinational corporation]]s have come together in the [[G8 Climate Change Roundtable]], a business group formed at the January 2005 [[World Economic Forum]]. The group includes [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Toyota]], [[British Airways]], and [[BP]]. On 9 June 2005 the Group published a statement<ref>[http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |date=May 8, 2013}} Convened by the World Economic Forum June 2005</ref> stating that there was a need to act on climate change and claiming that market-based solutions can help. It called on governments to establish "clear, transparent, and consistent price signals" through "creation of a long-term policy framework" that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases.

The [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine North-eastern and Mid-Atlantic [[United States|American]] states; [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]]. The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.

===Implementation===

[[File:Per Capita CO2 by Region.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Per person, the United States generates carbon dioxide at a far faster rate than other primary regions.<ref name="Friedlingstein 2019"/>]]
Implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name="Evans">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>

====Funding====
{{main|Climate Finance}}
Funding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name="Evans"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H. T, Eberhard. A. A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800–810</ref>

====Research====
It has been estimated that only 0.12% of all funding for climate-related research is spent on the social science of climate change mitigation.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last1=Overland|first1=Indra|last2=Sovacool|first2=Benjamin K.|date=2020-04-01|title=The misallocation of climate research funding|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629619309119|journal=Energy Research & Social Science|language=en|volume=62|pages=101349|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2019.101349|issn=2214-6296|doi-access=free}}</ref> Vastly more funding is spent on natural science studies of climate change and considerable sums are also spent on studies of impact of and adaptation to climate change.<ref name=":02" /> It has been argued that this is a misallocation of resources, as the most urgent puzzle at the current juncture is to work out how to change human behavior to mitigate climate change, whereas the natural science of climate change is already well established and there will be decades and centuries to handle adaptation.<ref name=":02" />

====Problems====
There are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.<ref name="Evans"/> It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name="IHDP">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

====Occurrence====
Despite a perceived lack of occurrence,{{clarify|date=October 2019}} evidence of implementation is emerging internationally. Some examples of this are the initiation of NAPA's and of joint implementation. Many developing nations have made National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs.<ref name="EMJ">Preston. B. L, Westaway. R. M, Yuen. E.

==== China ====
{{main|Greenhouse gas emissions by China}}
As to 2019, China implements more than 100 policies to fight climate change. China said in the [[Paris Agreement]] that its emission will begin to fall by 2030, but it will possibly occur by 2026. This can position China as a leader on the issue because it is the biggest emitter of [[GHG emission]]s, so if it really reduces them, the significance will be large.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims Gallagher |first1=Kelly |last2=Zhang |first2=Fang |title=China is positioned to lead on climate change as the US rolls back its policies |url=https://theconversation.com/china-is-positioned-to-lead-on-climate-change-as-the-us-rolls-back-its-policies-114897 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=13 September 2019}}</ref>

==== New Zealand ====
{{further|Climate change in New Zealand}}
New Zealand made significant pledges on climate change mitigation in the year 2019: reduce emissions to zero by 2050, plant 1 billion trees by 2028, and encouraging farmers to reduce emissions by 2025 or face higher taxes Already in 2019 New Zealand banned new offshore oil and gas drilling and decided the climate change issues will be examined before every important decision.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ainge Roy |first1=Eleanor |title=Climate change to steer all New Zealand government decisions from now on |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/04/climate-change-to-steer-all-new-zealand-government-decisions-from-now-on |accessdate=4 December 2019 |agency=The Guardian |publisher=The Dunedin |date=4 December 2019}}</ref>

In early December 2020, [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] declared a climate change emergency and pledged that the New Zealand Government would be carbon neutral by 2025.

==== Nigeria ====
To mitigate the adverse effect of climate change, not only did Nigeria sign the Paris agreement to reduce emission, in its national climate pledge, the Nigerian government has promised to “work towards” ending gas flaring by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, the government established a Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme to encourage investment in practices that reduce gas flaring. Also, the federal government has approved a new National Forest Policy which is aimed at “protecting ecosystems” while enhancing social development. Effort is also been made to stimulate the adoption of climate-smart agriculture and the planting of trees. <ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Carbon Brief Profile: Nigeria|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/the-carbon-brief-profile-nigeria|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

====Developing countries====
In order to reconcile [[economic development]] with mitigating carbon emissions, [[developing countries]] need particular support, both financial and technical. One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.

An important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>
# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];
# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;
# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and
# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.
The main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>

However, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.

In an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] "which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>

In 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and "sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>

==Non-governmental approaches==
While many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.

===Choices in personal actions and business operations===
Environmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]]. Common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage, burning less gasoline, supporting renewable [[energy sources]], buying local products to reduce transportation, turning off unused devices, and various others.

A [[geophysicist]] at [[Utrecht University]] has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation, suggesting the use of communications technologies such as [[videoconferencing]] to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights.<ref>{{cite journal

Part of the difficulty is that when [[environmental impact of aviation|aviation emissions]] are made at high altitude, the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise. Others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]] of individuals, whether traveling for business or pleasure, involving frequent and often long-distance air travel, as well as air shipment of goods.<ref name="gossling">Gössling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, Gössling IS, Upham P, [[Earthscan]] London (2009).

===Business opportunities and risks===
{{Main|Business action on climate change}}

===Investor response===
{{Main|Fossil fuel divestment}}
Climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings. [[Socially responsible investing]] funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high ESG (environmental, social, governance) standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T041-C016-S001-5-mutual-funds-for-socially-responsible-investors.html |title=5 Mutual Funds for Socially Responsible Investors |publisher=Kiplinger}}</ref> [[Proxy firm]]s can be used to draft guidelines for [[investment manager]]s that take these concerns into account.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ussif.org/files/publications/institutional_climate.pdf |title=Investing to Curb Climate Change |publisher=USSIF |page=2}}</ref>

===Legal action===
{{See also|Duty to rescue}}

In some countries, those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers. Attempts at litigation have been initiated by entire peoples such as [[Palau]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/video/video-paradise-lost/14421/|title=Video: Paradise lost? – Need to Know |publisher=PBS|quote=Palau suing the industrialized countries over global warming}}</ref> and the [[Inuit]],<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6908719/site/newsweek/ Inuit suing the US in regards to global warming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825135526/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6908719/site/newsweek/ |date=August 25, 2010}}</ref> as well as non-governmental organizations such as the Sierra Club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newson6.com/story/9138384/environmental-integrity-project-sierra-club-announce-plans-to-sue-epa-unless-it-revises-nitrogen-oxide-emissions-standard-curbs-nitrous-oxide?clienttype=printable|title=Environmental Integrity Project, Sierra Club Announce Plans to Sue EPA Unless It Revises Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Standard, Curbs Nitrous Oxide Pollution Linked to Global Warming – NewsOn6.com – Tulsa, OK – News, Weather, Video and Sports – KOTV.com -|access-date=2013-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111204839/http://www.newson6.com/story/9138384/environmental-integrity-project-sierra-club-announce-plans-to-sue-epa-unless-it-revises-nitrogen-oxide-emissions-standard-curbs-nitrous-oxide?clienttype=printable|archive-date=2016-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible,<ref>Edward Lorenz (1982): "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get"</ref> methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming.<ref>Stott, et al. (2004), "Human contribution to the European heatwave of 2003", Nature, Vol. 432, 2 December 2004</ref>

For a legal action for [[negligence]] (or similar) to succeed, "Plaintiffs ... must show that, more probably than not, their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question, as opposed to any other cause. This has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two."<ref>Grossman, Columbia J. of Env. Law, 2003</ref> Another route (though with little legal bite) is the [[World Heritage Convention]], if it can be shown that climate change is affecting [[World Heritage Site]]s like [[Mount Everest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=4950&method=full |title=Climate change 'ruining' Everest |publisher=Heatisonline.org |date=2004-11-17 |access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2004/11/041117_climate-belize.shtml Climate change 'ruining' Belize] BBC November 2004</ref>

Besides countries suing one another, there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government. Legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],<ref>[http://www.climatelaw.org/cases Climate Justice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618125305/http://www.climatelaw.org/cases |date=2019-06-18 }} Ongoing Cases</ref> and against the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] and [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]] for failing to assess environmental impacts (including global warming impacts) under [[NEPA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the Netherlands and Belgium, organisations such as the foundation [[Urgenda]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling|title=Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling|first=Arthur Neslen The|last=Hague|date=24 June 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urgenda.nl/themas/klimaat-en-energie/klimaatzaak/|title=Klimaat en Energie – Thema's – Urgenda – Samen Sneller Duurzaam}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tegenlicht.vpro.nl/afleveringen/2015-2016/de-klimaatzaak.html|title=VPRO Tegenlicht}}</ref> and the [[vzw Klimaatzaak]] in Belgium<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/binnenland/2.36678|title=Klimaatzaak}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://klimaatzaak.eu/nl/about/|title=Over ons – Klimaatzaak|access-date=2016-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818153120/http://klimaatzaak.eu/nl/about/|archive-date=2016-08-18|url-status=dead}}</ref> have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren't meeting the emission reductions they agreed to. Urgenda have already won their case against the Dutch government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

According to a 2004 study commissioned by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[ExxonMobil]], and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world's man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002. The group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action.<ref>Press release (29 January 2004).
