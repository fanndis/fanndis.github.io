"'''Countdown'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé Knowles]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyoncé Knowles album)|4]]'' (2011). The song was written by Knowles, [[The-Dream|Terius Nash]], [[Shea Taylor]], [[Ester Dean]], [[Cainon Lamb]], [[Julie Frost]], [[Michael Bivins]], [[Nathan Morris]] and [[Wanya Morris]], and produced by Beyoncé, Taylor and Lamb. The song's conception was brought about by Knowles desiring to mix musical styles of the 1990s with the 1970s. It was sent to radio on October 4, 2011 as the fifth single from ''4''.

Featuring a sample of "[[Uhh Ahh]]" by [[Boyz II Men]], "Countdown" incorporates aspects of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], [[reggae]] and [[world music]]. Lyrically, the female protagonist delivers a message of monogamy to her lover, celebrating self-worthiness as well as appreciating him. Several music critics were surprised by its maturity and compared it to Beyoncé's earlier solo work and with [[Destiny's Child]]. The song finished second in 2011's [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll and was included on the list of the year's best songs by various critics and publications including ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''. "Countdown"  peaked at number 71 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It also peaked at number 12 on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, and number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart. It has been [[RIAA certification|certified]] gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). "Countdown" peaked at number 35 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number nine on the [[UK R&B Chart]].

Adria Petty directed the accompanying music video, which was recorded whilst Knowles was pregnant in August 2011. The music video sees Beyoncé incorporate a mix of classic and modern dances, with references to pieces like that of [[Audrey Hepburn]]'s appearance in ''[[Funny Face]]''. Although well received by critics, the video faced controversy for the use of choreography from [[Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker]]'s 1983 ballet ''Rosas danst Rosas''. Beyoncé performed "Countdown" on her [[4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé]] and [[Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live]] residency shows, as a video interlude on [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] and on the set list of [[The Formation World Tour]].

I wanted to do something refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals… I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together.

He commented: "[It] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'"<ref name="tumb"/> Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some [[Snare drum|snare drum taps]] to it, and started a [[Beat (music)|beat]].<ref name="tumb"/> After that, he sent the song to his publisher, [[EMI|EMI Music]]. The latter was impressed with the instrumental and went on saying: "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!"<ref name="tumb"/>  On the request of his publisher, Lamb made "a female version of the countdown part".<ref name="tumb"/> Terius Nash wrote the [[Song structure (popular music)|verses]] and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.<ref name="tumb">{{cite web|url=http://noordinary10ve.tumblr.com/post/11495132308/leslie-moore-talks-to-multi-platinum-producer-and-famu |title=Leslie Moore Talks to Multi-Platinum Producer and FAMU Alumnus Cainon Lamb About Beyoncé's 'Countdown,' the Music Industry and FAMU |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |first=Leslie |last=Moore |date=October 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Background and development===
[[File:Beyonce in Countdown Video.png|300px|thumbnail|right|Knowles shown to be pregnant in the music video, of which the visibility changes throughout. MTV saw this as the ''joie de vivre'' of the project.<ref name="bump" />|alt=American singer Beyonce holds her baby bump, the image is duplicated three times.]]
On August 2, 2011, ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' magazine reported that the music video for "Countdown" was in preparations for filming, and that it was being directed by [[Adria Petty]], who previously directed the music video for "[[Sweet Dreams (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Sweet Dreams]]" (2009).<ref>{{cite web|last=Osei|first=Anthony|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/08/beyonc-to-shoot-video-for-countdown|title=Beyonce to Shoot Video for "Countdown"|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=August 2, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name="bill10053" /> Knowles also co-directed.<ref name="pits"/> A 38-second preview of the video was posted on [[MTV.com]] on October 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2011/10/03/beyonce-countdown-video-preview/|publisher=[[MTV|MTV Buzzworthy]]|title=Beyonce's 'Countdown' Video Preview|first=Tamar|last=Anitai|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name="mtv16718">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1671885/beyonce-countdown-video-preview.jhtml|title=Beyonce's 'Countdown' Video: Watch A Sneak Peek!|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|publisher=MTV News|date=October 3, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref> The full video premiered on October 6, 2011 at 7:56&nbsp;p.m. ET on MTV and Knowles{{'}} official website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672029/beyonce-countdown-video.jhtml|title=Beyonce's 'Countdown' Video A Bridge To The Past|publisher=MTV News|first=James|last=Montgomery|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a344284/beyonce-unveils-audrey-hepburn-inspired-countdown-video-watch-now.html|title=Beyoncé unveils Audrey Hepburn-inspired 'Countdown' video – Watch now|first=Tara|last=Fowler|date=October 7, 2011|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> An alternate version of the music video was released on the ''[[Live at Roseland: Elements of 4]]'' DVD to avoid her from getting sued after blatantly stealing another artist's work.

Concerning her collaboration with Knowles, Petty stated: "I think whenever you work with Beyoncé it's a collaboration. She has a lot of input. And then you have the time constraints that come with working with her that push you into different directions. [...] There are countless homages to pop culture of the past in this video. I think we were playing with Mod, and '60's and '80's iconic stuff that [Beyoncé] responded to and related to."<ref name="gq" /> She further said that during the filming Knowles put a lot of energy and made many decisions for the finished product.<ref name="gq" /> Talking about the development and the filming of the video, Petty said:

<blockquote>
I brought Beyoncé a number of references and we picked some out together. Most were German modern-dance references, believe it or not. But it really evolved. The references were then dispersed to her creative team (hair, makeup, wardrobe), and they interpreted them on the set in their own special way. Of course, one of the strongest wardrobe references was Audrey Hepburn in ''[[Funny Face]]'' when she does the beatnik dance scene. I think a lot grew from there. [...] The shoot was great. We had a number of brilliant dancers and musicians and a top-notch crew. Beyoncé brings in a number of her own people who are so hardworking. Our video was the fourth they had shot in five days. I love the creative team that works with Beyoncé because they can roll with anything and keep smiling. Everyone was really upbeat and excited because we all love the track and the opportunity to work with Beyoncé so much.<ref name="mtv1672">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672200/beyonce-countdown-video-shoot.jhtml|title=Beyonce's 'Countdown' Video Shoot Was 'Evolving, Spontaneous'|publisher=MTV News|date=October 7, 2011|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 5 days, Knowles filmed  various music videos from the album back-to-back. "Countdown" was the fourth one filmed. It was shot in [[New York City]] warehouses,<ref name="mtv1672"/> Petty noted that the video unexpectedly celebrated Knowles' pregnancy as there are scenes in which Knowles{{'}} [[baby bump]] are visible and not.<ref name=bump>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672290/beyonce-countdown-video-baby-bump.jhtml|first=James|last=Montgomery |title=Beyonce's 'Countdown' Baby Bump Wasn't Planned|publisher=MTV News|date=October 11, 2011|accessdate=October 12, 2011}}</ref> She added that these circumstances meant that the video was developed under "evolving circumstances that remained flexible".<ref name=bump /> According to John Mitchell of MTV News: "[The clip is] a perfect mix of classic and modern, which seems to be what Beyoncé is aiming for in this era of her career. It is a feeling reflected in the smooth, '[19]90s vibe and reliance on live instruments that sets her album ''4'' apart from her previous work as well as other artists on the charts right now."<ref name="mtv16721" />

===Fashion===
Knowles' fashion in the clip includes retro side-swept mini bangs, large lined eyes and almond-shaped pumpkin-colored nails.<ref name="style">{{cite news|url=http://style.mtv.com/2011/10/06/beyonce-countdown-music-video-look-by-look/#more-64612|title=Beyonce 'Countdown' Music Video Look By Look|publisher=[[MTV|MTV Style]]|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>
As stated by [[MTV|MTV Style]], these accessories, alongside Knowles' "syncopated dancing in vibrant monochrome, wink back to that iconic Audrey Hepburn sequence in ''Funny Face''".<ref name="style"/> Knowles{{'}} make-up was by Francesca Tolot, who explained, "The inspiration behind Beyoncé'[s] {{Sic|hide=y|brightly|-}}lined lids came from the beatnik movement of the late '[19]50s, early '[19]60s. From previous experiences with ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', I knew Beyoncé looked amazing with that type of makeup so the almond eye seemed to be the perfect fit."<ref name="style"/> For the countdown part of the video, Knowles wears black and white from head-to-toe and neon orange nails.<ref name="style"/> The first time Knowles shows her baby bump in the video, she wears a black and white dress, designed by [[Thierry Mugler]].<ref name="style"/>

Next, Knowles wears a primary color [[leotard]] [[Capezio]] collection with a black and white striped Karen Keith for [[Patricia Field]] sun hat.<ref name="style"/> During the second chorus, Knowles wears a sheer [[American Apparel]] oversized button up with high [[stiletto heels]].<ref name="style"/> She later wears more colorways of the sheer American Apparel button-up with a tied headkerchief, changing the shoes for loafers, and a [[Color theory|pastel palette]].<ref name="style"/> In a scene reminiscent of the film ''[[Flashdance the Musical|Flashdance]]'', Knowles wears an off-the-shoulder [[Forever 21]] T-shirt, showing a lilac bra strap and blunt bangs.<ref name="style"/> For the ''Dreamgirls'' flashback, she wears a jeweled Chan Luu mini dress, subtle makeup with sculpted brows and a shiny, flipped bob.<ref name="style"/> For the final scene, Knowles wears another black and white striped American Apparel outfit with a sleek tank, shorts, suspenders and white socks with pumps.<ref name="style" />

===Synopsis and analysis===
John Mitchell of MTV News wrote that, throughout the clip, Knowles is "all smiles, perhaps reflecting her joy at beginning a new phase in her life".<ref name="mtv16721" /> The visibility of Knowles' pregnancy varies throughout the video, indicating she may have filmed some of the footage for "Countdown" earlier in her pregnancy and later re-shot or re-conceptualized the clip to reflect her growing belly.<ref name="mtv16721" /> The clip has several references and looks, dating from the 1960s to the 1980s. Knowles re-enacts a series of iconic pop images in the video.<ref name="mtv16721" />

The video opens with a close shot of Knowles{{'}} face who's wearing a similar make-up to English model [[Twiggy]].<ref name="mtv16721" /> The video then shows shots of Knowles moving her arms like a clock and wearing a black T-shirt and black trousers. Scenes similar to 1957 film ''Funny Face'' follow with Knowles looking like Audrey Hepburn. Those shots are cut by a variety of brightly colored bathing suits and a black-and-white hat, set against a constantly changing background of colors which is similar to ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' photo shoots.<ref name="mtv16721" /> Knowles' baby bump is less visible in the bathing suit scenes but is featured prominently earlier in the video. The clip cuts quickly from the bathing suit sequence to shots of Knowles in an audition space similar to the 1980 film ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]''.<ref name="mtv16721" /> The sequence features choreographed moves from Knowles and her back-up dancers who snap with their fingers which is a reference to 1961 musical ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]''.<ref name="mtv16721" />

Knowles lovingly rubs her baby bump in a scene that features 10 different incarnations of herself in a loft space. According to MTV Newsroom, this is the "key scene" where Knowles puts into perspective all those aforementioned sides.<ref name="key">{{cite news|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/10/07/beyonce-countdown-the-key-scene |title=The Key Scene: Beyonce's 'Countdown' |publisher=[[MTV|MTV Newsroom]]|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> Knowles references [[Brigitte Bardot]] when the video cuts to and from shots of Knowles in a men's dress shirt with her hair styled up with a scarf.<ref name="mtv16721" /> She also briefly references her film, ''Dreamgirls'', more specifically the latter's inspiration, being [[Diana Ross]], during a few brief scenes in which Knowles wears a short, sparkly dress and bob hairstyle.<ref name="mtv16721" /> The clip then sequences from ''Fame'' to ''Flashdance'' with Knowles and her dancers in another open warehouse-like space sporting the iconic off-the-shoulder look from the 1983 drama starring [[Jennifer Beals]].<ref name="mtv16721" /> The video ends with Knowles in a chair, dancing and then flashing a smile.<ref name="mtv16721" />

===Reception===
John Mitchell of MTV News praised Knowles' dance skills and sexiness in the video despite being pregnant, and called it "a feast for the eyes" and "a perfect mix of classic and modern, which seems to be what Beyoncé is aiming for in this era of her career".<ref name="mtv16721">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672134/beyonce-countdown-video.jhtml|title=Beyonce Flaunts Baby Bump In 'Countdown' Video|publisher=MTV News|first=John|last=Mitchell|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> A writer of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' described the video as "characteristically kinetic".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/06/watch-beyonce-shows-off-b_n_999331.html|title=WATCH: Beyonce Premieres New Video For 'Countdown', Shows Off Baby Bump|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011|first=Gene|last=Demby}}</ref> Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound wrote that "the concept may be simple, but the intricate dance numbers (take that, Fred Astaire!) and split screen action make for an energetic cinematic affair with loads of modern swag and '60s-inspired sass."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/10/video-beyonce-countdown/ |title=Video: Beyoncé – 'Countdown' |magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Chris |last=Coplan |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref> Joe Marvilli of the same publication wrote that the retro horns in the song, match the 1960s "throwback visuals" as Knowles "sashes through a variety of classy outfits and energetic dance moves.

===Controversy===
[[Image:annt675.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker (''pictured''), who affirmed that Knowles had borrowed liberally from two of her pieces, later revealed that she is neither angered nor honored by the tribute.]]
In an interview with Studio Brussel, Belgian choreographer [[Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker]] accused Knowles of using concepts from two of her pieces, ''Rosas danst Rosas'' (1983) and ''Achterlund'' (1990).<ref name="nytin" /> De Keersmaeker commented, "It's a bit rude, [...] What’s rude about it its that they don’t even bother about hiding it", further adding that "this is pure [[plagiarism]]".<ref name="nytin">{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/beyonce-accused-of-plagiarism-over-video/|title=Beyoncé Accused of Plagiarism Over Video|last=McKinley Fr. |first=James C.|date=October 10, 2011 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref><ref name="yatin">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/beyonce-admits-inspired-belgian-dance-moves-222908388.html|title=Beyonce admits inspired by Belgian dance moves |date=October 11, 2011 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

In response to De Keersmaeker's comments, Knowles issued the following statement: "Clearly, the ballet ''Rosas danst Rosas'' was one of many references for my video 'Countdown'. It was one of the inspirations used to bring the feel and look of the song to life. I was also paying tribute to the film, ''Funny Face'' with the legendary Audrey Hepburn [...] My biggest inspirations were the [19]60s, the [19]70s, Brigitte Bardot, Andy Warhol, Twiggy and Diana Ross. I've always been fascinated by the way contemporary art uses different elements and references to produce something unique."<ref name="nytin"/> Following Knowles' statement, De Keersmaeker wrote in a statement to ''The Performance Club'' that she was neither angry or honored about its usage, questioning why had it had taken so long for her work to reach popular culture.<ref name="holly">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beyonce-countdown-video-choreographer-reacts-246276 |title=Beyonce's 'Countdown' Video: Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker Reacts to Plagiarism Allegations (Video) |last=Sophie |first=Sophie |date=October 10, 2011 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> She also noticed a coincidence in that they were both pregnant during the filming of both videos, and wished Knowles the same joy her daughter had brought her.<ref name="holly" />

==Covers and usage in media==
Norwegian singer [[Sondre Lerche]] covered "Countdown" in December 2011 as a "Christmas gift" and his favorite song of the year.<ref name="lerche" /><ref name="cossondre" /> He further stated, "I took the liberty of making some gender-oriented changes to the lyrics to better accommodate my macho-persona... That being said, the trick is to get passed the novelty-factor and just sing a beautiful song at the best of your abilities. Obviously, a significant part of this song's appeal and ecstatic energy comes from the dizzying vocal performance and the mind-blowingly cool production work — elements and talents useless to even attempt replicating (especially not in my father in-law's basement). But as long as there's a song underneath, there's a way."<ref name="cossondre" /> His cover of the song contains his vocals and mild [[acoustic guitar]] strumming, which according to Andrew Martin of ''Prefix Magazine'' gives "an approach that puts the focus on the track's stellar songwriting".<ref name="lerche">{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/media/sondre-lerche/countdown-beyonce-cover/59998/|title=Sondre Lerche: "Countdown" (Beyonce Cover)|work=Prefix Magazine|first=Andrew|last=Martin|date=December 21, 2011|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref> According to Mallika Rao of ''The Huffington Post'', "Sondre Lerche made us a gift... and probably because he's a talented, popular, professional musician, it's really good".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/24/sondre-lerche-covers-countdown_n_1168863.html|title=Sondre Lerche Covers 'Countdown' By Beyonce: 'It's Officially A Tradition' (VIDEO)|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Mallika|last=Rao|date=December 24, 2011|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref> Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the cover, saying: "The end result is a simple track, without pomp or circumstance or the crazy marching band, where Lerche is able to replicate not the high-energy feel, but the song's simple message of love and dedication.
