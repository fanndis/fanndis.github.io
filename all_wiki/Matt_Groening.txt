'''Matthew Abram Groening''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-ca-groening.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|r|eɪ|n|ɪ|ŋ}} {{respell|GRAY|ning}}; born February 15, 1954)<ref name=brita>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/question-676887/49/Matt-Groening-born |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207103601/http://www.britannica.com/eb/question-676887/49/Matt-Groening-born |title=When and where was Matt Groening born? |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |archive-date=February 7, 2008 |access-date=July 17, 2013}}</ref> is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, and animator. He is the creator of the comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' (1977–2012) and the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (1989–present), ''[[Futurama]]'' (1999–2003, 2008–2013), and ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'' (2018–present). ''The Simpsons'' is the longest-running U.S. primetime-television series in history and the longest-running U.S. animated series and sitcom.

Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of ''Life in Hell'' to the avant-garde [[Wet (magazine)|''Wet'' magazine]] in 1978. At its peak, the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers. ''Life in Hell'' caught the attention of [[James L. Brooks]]. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] variety show ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his ''Life in Hell'' characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, the [[Simpson family]], and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] was an [[anagram]] of the word ''[[Spoiled child|brat]]''. The shorts would be spun off into their own series ''The Simpsons'', which has since aired [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{Template parameter value|The Simpsons|Infobox television||num_episodes|}} episodes]]. In 1997, Groening and former ''Simpsons'' writer [[David X. Cohen]] developed ''Futurama'', an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999, running for four years on Fox, then picked up by [[Comedy Central]] for additional seasons. In 2016, Groening developed a new series for [[Netflix]] titled ''[[Disenchantment (TV series)|Disenchantment]]'', which premiered in August 2018.

Groening has won thirteen [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven for ''The Simpsons'' and two for ''Futurama'' as well as a [[British Comedy Awards|British Comedy Award]] for "outstanding contribution to comedy" in 2004. In 2002, he won the [[National Cartoonist Society]] [[Reuben Award]] for his work on ''Life in Hell''. He received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on February 14, 2012.

Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of the self-published comic book ''Life in Hell'', which was loosely inspired by the chapter "How to Go to Hell" in [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann's]] book ''Critique of Religion and Philosophy''.<ref name="mygeneration">{{cite web |title=Matt Groening |date=May–June 2001 |last=McKenna |first=Kristine |work=My Generation |url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening01a.html |access-date=February 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010430043724/http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/groening01a.html |archive-date=April 30, 2001}}</ref> Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a [[record store]] in which he worked.

Groening had gained employment at the ''[[Los Angeles Reader]]'', a newly formed [[alternative newspaper]], delivering papers,{{sfnp|Groth|1991}} typesetting, editing and answering phones.{{sfnp|Von Busack|2000}} He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper.{{sfnp|Groth|1991}} ''Life in Hell'' made its official debut as a comic strip in the ''Reader'' on April 25, 1980.{{sfnp|Morgenstern|1990}}<ref name="aan">{{cite web |url=http://www.aan.org/gyrobase/Aan/viewCompany?oid=1157 |title=Acme Features Syndicate |access-date=August 30, 2007 |work=Association of Alternative Newsweeklies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902011029/http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/acme-features-syndicate/Company?oid=1157 |archive-date=September 2, 2010}}</ref> Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, "Sound Mix," in 1982.

''Life in Hell'' became popular almost immediately.{{sfnp|Ortved|2007 |p=71}} In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the ''Reader'', offered to publish "Love is Hell", a series of relationship-themed ''Life in Hell'' strips, in book form.{{sfnp|Groening|1994}} Released a month later, the book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings.

The Simpsons shorts first appeared in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' on April 19, 1987.{{sfnp|Groening|1997|p=14}} Another family member, [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa Simpson]], was introduced in the later shorts. Years later, during the early seasons of ''The Simpsons'', when it came time to give Grampa a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, they chose "Abraham", unaware that it was the name of Groening's grandfather.<ref name="oldmoney">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Old Money" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

====Half-hour====
Although ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' was not a big hit,{{sfnp|Ortved|2007 |p=72}} the popularity of the shorts led to a half-hour spin-off in 1989. A team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now the [[Klasky Csupo]] animation house. James L. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |title=3rd Degree: Harry Shearer |access-date=September 1, 2006 |author=Kuipers, Dean |date=April 15, 2004 |publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archive-date=March 8, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.<ref name="toonterrific">{{cite magazine |first=Ken |last=Tucker |title=Toon Terrific |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 12, 1993 |page=48(3)}}</ref> The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", a [[Christmas special]].<ref name=officialsite2>[http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0101.htm "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730163543/http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0101.htm |date=July 30, 2008 }} ''The Simpsons.com''.

The series quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, to the surprise of many. Groening said: "Nobody thought ''The Simpsons'' was going to be a big hit. It sneaked up on everybody."{{sfnp|Lloyd|1999}} ''The Simpsons'' was co-developed by Groening, Brooks, and [[Sam Simon]], a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along{{sfnp|Ortved|2007 |p=72}} and were often in conflict over the show;{{sfnp|Morgenstern|1990}} Groening once described their relationship as "very contentious."{{sfnp|Scott|2001}} Simon eventually left the show in 1993 over creative differences.<ref name="ew">{{cite web |title=Conan on being left out of "Simpsons Movie" |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20046980,00.html |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=July 18, 2007 |access-date=September 4, 2007}}</ref>

Like the main family members, several characters from the show have names that were inspired by people, locations or films.

Although Groening has pitched a number of spin-offs from ''The Simpsons'', those attempts have been unsuccessful. In 1994, Groening and other ''Simpsons'' producers pitched a live-action spin-off about [[Krusty the Clown]] (with [[Dan Castellaneta]] playing the lead role), but were unsuccessful in getting it off the ground.<ref name=avclub/><ref name="npr">From a radio interview with Groening that aired on the [https://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&prgDate=22-Apr-98 April 22, 1998 edition] of ''[[Fresh Air]]'' on [[National Public Radio|NPR]].

In 1995, Groening got into a major disagreement with Brooks and other ''Simpsons'' producers over "[[A Star Is Burns]]", a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] episode with ''[[The Critic]]'', an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former ''Simpsons'' crew members. Groening claimed that he feared viewers would "see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise ''The Critic'' at the expense of ''The Simpsons''," and was concerned about the possible implication that he had created or produced ''The Critic''.{{sfnp|Paul|1995}} He requested his name be taken off the episode.<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|title=Matt Groening's Reaction to The Critic's First Appearance on The Simpsons |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.critic.nohomers.net/Special_Extras_Matt_Groening_Reaction.html |last=Brennan |first=Judy |date=March 3, 1995 |access-date=September 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070831075427/http://critic.nohomers.net/Special_Extras_Matt_Groening_Reaction.html |archive-date=August 31, 2007}}</ref>

After spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with ''Simpsons'' writer/producer [[David X. Cohen]] (known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed ''Futurama'', an animated series about life in the year 3000.<ref name="motherjones"/><ref name="theface">{{cite journal|last=Needham |first=Alex |url=http://www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html |title=Nice Planet...We'll Take It! |journal=The Face |issue=33 |date=October 1999 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000824051707/http://www.frcr.com/library/the_face1.html |archive-date=August 24, 2000}}</ref> By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and [[plot (narrative)|storylines]]; Groening claimed they had gone "overboard" in their discussions.<ref name="theface"/> Groening described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life."<ref name="motherjones"/> The show premiered on March 28, 1999. Groening's writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode, "[[Space Pilot 3000]]" (co-written with Cohen), "[[Rebirth (Futurama)|Rebirth]]" (story) and "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela]]" (story).

After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to ''[[Family Guy]]'', however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on [[Adult Swim]] brought ''Futurama'' back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air ''Futurama'' reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four [[straight-to-DVD]] films – ''[[Futurama: Bender's Big Score|Bender's Big Score]]'' (2007), ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'' (2008), ''[[Futurama: Bender's Game|Bender's Game]]'' (2008) and ''[[Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder|Into the Wild Green Yonder]]'' (2009) – would be produced.<ref name="Katz">{{cite interview |last=Katz |first=Claudia |subject-link=Claudia Katz |interviewer=Evan Jacobs |title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Claudia Katz on Futurama the Movie: Bender's Big Score |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEyTuBCyy6XECD |date=November 16, 2007 |access-date=June 9, 2009}}</ref><ref name="avclub"/>

Since no new ''Futurama'' projects were in production, the movie ''Into the Wild Green Yonder'' was designed to stand as the ''Futurama'' series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the ''Futurama'' franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film.<ref name="Wired1">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/11/futuramas-anima/ |title=''Futurama'' Animators Roll 20-Sided Die With ''Bender's Game'' |author=Wortham, Jenna |date=November 4, 2008 |website=Wired.com |access-date=February 28, 2009}}</ref> In an interview with CNN, Groening said that "we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don't know...
