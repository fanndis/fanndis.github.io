'''Oprah's Book Club''' is a [[streaming television]] talk show produced for [[Apple TV+]] and hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]].

==Development and announcement==
On June 15, 2018, Apple announced a multiyear partnership with Winfrey, saying she would work on projects to be "released as part of a lineup of original content from Apple.".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/apple-announces-multi-year-partnership-with-oprah-winfrey/|title=Apple announces multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/arts/television/apple-oprah-winfrey.html|title=Apple and Oprah Winfrey Sign a Content Deal|last=Deb|first=Sopan|date=2018-06-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

On March 25, 2019 Apple hosted keynote event at its California campus to announce the new [[Apple TV+]] subscription service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/highlights-from-apples-keynote-event/|title=Highlights from Apple’s keynote event|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> Winfrey appeared onstage to conclude the event, announcing that she would be producing two documentary series, as well launching a "book club" in partnership with Apple. During her announcement, Winfrey indicated the book club project may include a [[simulcast]] element at Apple's retail locations "where Apple Stores stream a conversation with the author and me live across all devices, across all borders".<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2019/|title=Apple Special Event: March 25, 2019|date=|last=|first=|type=Live recording|language=English|publisher=Apple, Inc.|minutes=104}}</ref>

On September 23, 2019 in a press release, Apple announced the series would be titled ''Oprah's Book Club'', would stream exclusively on Apple TV+, and would premiere with the streaming service's launch on November 1, 2019.<ref name="obcapplepr">{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/oprahs-book-club-starts-a-new-chapter-with-apple/|title=Oprah’s Book Club starts a new chapter with Apple|website=Apple Newsroom|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

==Premise==
The series is a standalone [[Spinoff (television)|spinoff]] of the popular [[Oprah's Book Club]] segment of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', begun in 1996 and marks its first return to the television medium since the 2011 conclusion of Winfrey's television show. It is also a successor to ''[[Oprah's Book Club 2.0]]'', a non-televised and irregularly-released online iteration of the reading series launched in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90407843/oprahs-book-club-is-coming-to-apple-tv-starting-with-ta-nehisi-coates-the-water-dancer|title=Oprah's Book Club is coming to Apple TV+, kicking off with Ta-Nehisi Coates's 'The Water Dancer'|last=Ifeanyi|first=K. C.|date=2019-09-23|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>

Episodes are released every two months, with each episode focused on a single book and featuring an interview between Winfrey and the book's author. Episodes are filmed at various locations.<ref name="obcapplepr" /> Each episode's book pick is announced at the end of the previous episode, as well as a [https://apple.co/OprahsBookClub dedicated section] on [[Apple Books]] and [http://www.oprah.com/app/books.html on Oprah's website].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/oprah-book-club-apple-tv-plus-ta-nehisi-coates-1203345598/|title=Oprah Sets First Book-Club Pick for New Apple TV Plus Series|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2019-09-23|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> Episodes are typically filmed in front of a live audience and feature an interview between Winfrey and the selected book's author.

==Merchandising and tie-ins==
Along with the announcement of the show, Apple announced that Oprah's Book Club would integrate with [[Apple Books]] by allowing users of the e-reading application to be alerted of new picks, and that Apple would make an unspecified contribution to the [[American Library Association]] for each Oprah Book Club selection sold via Apple Books.<ref name="obcapplepr" />

As with the two previous iterations of the Club, the selection of a book by Winfrey typically results in the publication of an "Oprah edition", often with a branded "Oprah's Book Club" seal on the book's cover.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Winfrey's September 2019 pick of ''[[The Water Dancer]]'' by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] marked the first time in the Oprah Book Club's three iterations a book had been selected as a pick ''prior'' to its publication (in this case, one day prior).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Thus, all published editions of ''The Water Dancer'' currently in circulation feature an "Oprah's Book Club 2019" seal.
