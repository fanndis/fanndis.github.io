Apple was founded by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]], and [[Ronald Wayne]] in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,<ref name="wozemployee">{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> while Jobs and others resigned to found [[NeXT]].<ref name="rice19850415" />

As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled company—reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing [[Think different]] campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] in 1998, opening the retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm, but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.

Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $274.5&nbsp;billion for the 2020 [[fiscal year]]. Apple is the [[list of the largest information technology companies|world's largest technology company]] by revenue and one of the [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|world's most valuable companies]].

[[File:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|The [[Macintosh Portable]], released in 1989, is Apple's first battery-powered portable Macintosh personal computer.]]
After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1,000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gassée's mantra of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].<ref name=insidestoryCarlton>{{Cite book |last= Carlton |first= Jim |year= 1997 |title= Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders |location= New York |publisher= [[Random House]] |isbn= 978-0-8129-2851-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/appleinsidestory00carl}}</ref>{{Rp|79–80}} Selling Macintosh at such high profit margins was only possible because of its dominant position in the desktop publishing market.<ref>{{Cite book |ref={{SfnRef|Swaine|2014}}|first=Michael |last=Swaine |year=2014 |title=Fire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer |publisher=Pragmatic Bookshelf |isbn=9781680503524}} pp. 359–363</ref>

This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 is the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.<ref name=insidestoryCarlton />{{Rp|117–129}} During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing [[Michael Spindler]] as the [[chief operating officer]].{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=184–185}} Gassée left the company later that year.{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=160}} In October 1990, Apple introduced three lower-cost models, the [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC]], and [[Macintosh IIsi]],{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=128}} all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.

In 1991, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]], replacing the "luggable" [[Macintosh Portable]] with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the [[Classic Mac OS]]. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.<ref name="lemsculley">{{Cite web |first=Thomas |last=Hormby |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-years-apple.html |title=Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years |website=[[Low End Mac]] |date=February 22, 2006 |access-date=March 2, 2007}}</ref> For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process.

The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to the cannibalization of their higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], the mid-range [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, and the consumer-marketed [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]] series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.<ref name="vawperforma">{{Cite web |title=Macintosh Performa |url= http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130419164519/http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |publisher=Vectronics Apple World |access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref>

Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including [[Apple QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Apple Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], the [[eWorld]] online service, and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]].

By the late 1980s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to System 6, such as [[A/UX]] and [[Taligent#Pink|Pink]]. The System 6 platform itself was outdated because it was not originally built for multitasking. By the 1990s, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. System 6 and 7 would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on modern hardware.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall |access-date=August 14, 2008 |work=Roughly Drafted |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1994, Apple, [[IBM]], and [[Motorola]] formed the [[AIM alliance]] with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft's monopoly. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&model=6100&performa=off&sort=date&order=ASC&range= |title=Power Macintosh 6100 |access-date=August 12, 2008}}</ref>

After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the [[iPad]] on January 27, 2010.

This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-ipad/apple-ipad-reaches-1-million-sales-faster-than-iphone-idUSTRE64002T20100503 |title= Apple iPad reaches 1 million sales faster than iPhone |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date= September 10, 2018 |language= en-US}}</ref> In May of the same year, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm |title= Apple passes Microsoft to be biggest tech company |date= May 27, 2010 |access-date= May 29, 2010 |work=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529063247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm |archivedate= May 29, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Apple TV ===
{{Main|Apple TV}}
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]] (Jobs accidentally referred to the device as "iTV", its codename, while on stage), a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions.<ref>{{Cite press release |url= https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher= Apple Inc. |date= September 12, 2006 |access-date= October 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515000953/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |archivedate= May 15, 2011}}</ref> The device, running a variant of Mac OS X, links up to a user's TV and syncs over the wireless or wired network with one computer's iTunes library and can stream content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and played video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].<ref name="living Room" /> On May 30, 2007, a 160&nbsp;GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40&nbsp;GB model.<ref>{{Cite press release |url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/05/30YouTube-Coming-to-Apple-TV/ |title= YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher= Apple Inc. |date= May 30, 2007 |access-date= October 7, 2011}}</ref> A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.<ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/01/15Apple-Introduces-New-Apple-TV-Software-Lowers-Price-to-229/ |title= Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software & Lowers Price to $229 |publisher= Apple Inc. |date= January 15, 2008 |access-date= October 7, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40&nbsp;GB Apple TV but continued to produce and sell the 160&nbsp;GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV running on an iOS variant and discontinued the older model, which ran on a Mac OS X variant. The new device is one-fourth the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8&nbsp;GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] downloaded media. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the [[iPhone 4]] at 256&nbsp;MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].<ref>{{Cite web |first= Ross |last= Miller |title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts |url= https://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date= September 29, 2010 |access-date= March 23, 2017}}</ref>

It has HDMI out as the only video output source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]], and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

At the September 9, 2015, event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a subsequent variant of iOS called [[tvOS]], and contains 32&nbsp;GB or 64&nbsp;GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new [[Siri Remote]] with a glass [[touchpad]], [[gyroscope]], and [[microphone]].

On December 12, 2016, Apple released a new iOS and tvOS [[media player (software)|media player]] app called [[Apple TV (software)|TV]] to replace the existing "Videos" iOS application.

At the September 12, 2017, event, Apple released a new [[4K resolution|4K]] Apple TV with the same form factor as the 4th Generation model. The 4K model is powered by the [[Apple A10X|A10X]] SoC designed in-house that also powers their second-generation iPad Pro. The 4K model also has support for [[high dynamic range]].

On March 25, 2019, Apple announced [[Apple TV+]], their upcoming [[over-the-top media services|over-the-top]] subscription [[video on-demand]] [[web television]] service, will arrive Fall 2019.

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a [[fruitarian]] diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html |access-date=October 21, 2011 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=October 20, 2011}}</ref>

Apple's first logo, designed by [[Ron Wayne]], depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://archive.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597 |title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion |date=September 26, 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=ZLOK|title=¥ves ฿ennaïm 🌿 (@ZLOK) on Twitter|website=twitter.com}}</ref> The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.<ref name="creativebits_interview">{{Cite web |url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo |title=Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo |first=Ivan |last=Raszl}}</ref> The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.<ref name="creativebits_interview" /> This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to [[Alan Turing#Death|his method of suicide]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |access-date=September 14, 2009 |date=January 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |archivedate=October 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff |date=March 14, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005}}</ref> Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.<ref name="creativebits_interview" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Leavitt |first=David |title=The Man Who Knew Too Much; Alan Turing and the invention of the computer |year=2007 |page=280 |location=Phoenix |isbn=978-0-7538-2200-5}}</ref>

===Brand Semiotics===
[[Semiotics]] is the study of how meaning is derived from [[symbols]] and [[sign]]s and provides major insight for understanding [[brand management]] and [[brand loyalty]]. [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure’s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are “as inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper".<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure’s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}}</ref> Peirce’s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign).<ref name=Chandler/>

The symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] “recalls, internalizes, and relates” to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer’s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=2015 |issue=205 |pages=115–148 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005|s2cid=53117665 }}</ref>

The first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. Analysis of the [[semiotics]] with Saussure's model yields the signified, or sign, of the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought.<ref name=SlideShare>{{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc. Logo|url=https://www.slideshare.net/RohitRohan/semiotics-analysis-of-the-apple-inc-logo.https://wingblogcom.wordpress.com/2017/01/10/semiotics-of-apples-brand-logos/|website=LinkedIn SlideShare|publisher=Linkedin|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>

It was quickly realized that the original logo was too complicated and intellectual for the needed purpose. The company’s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo has double meaning and differs from the many serious corporate logos in existence at the time.{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}}

Apple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure’s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a challenger in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden.<ref name=Cowin>{{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=etd|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref> The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge, thus symbolizing Apple as a rebellious young company ready to challenge the world<ref name=SlideShare/> and the promise of knowledge that an entire culture of Apple users may gain from the product.<ref name=Cowin/>

The [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technological viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that the its [[computer monitor]] could be produce color images.<ref name=SlideShare/> [[Steve Jobs]] argued that color was crucial for "humanizing the company" at that time.<ref name=Cowin/>

The only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]]. This is the first Mac to not have the iconic rainbow-colored apple since its creation 20 years prior.<ref name=Biricik>{{cite document|last1=Biricik|first1=Asli|title=The role of logo design in creating brand emotion: A semiotic comparison of the Apple and IBM logos|citeseerx=10.1.1.427.5285}}</ref> The new look represents a new era of Apple Inc.

Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history.

{{Quote | style=font-size:100% |There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.

Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the [[American Dream]]. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.}}

Apple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of [[corporate culture]]. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (advertisement)|"1984"]] television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Deutschman |first=Alan |title=The once and future Steve Jobs |url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |website=[[Salon.com]] |access-date=November 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/ |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.<ref name="Fortune1">{{Cite news |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup |title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup |last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=August 25, 2011 |access-date=November 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113121932/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |archive-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than projects with it.<ref name="cultofmacwork">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple |title=What It's Like To Work At Apple |website=[[Cult of Mac]] |first=John |last=Brownlee |date=July 7, 2010}}</ref>

To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple [[Fellow#Industry and corporate fellows|Fellows]] program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company.

At Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having "best-in-class" employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]]—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores.

In 2015, Apple had 110,000&nbsp;full-time employees. This increased to 116,000&nbsp;full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline.

==== Lack of innovation ====
An editorial article in ''[[The Verge]]'' in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has "matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design" and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating "Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the "excitement of revolution", but argues that people want "the comfort that comes with harmony". Furthermore, he writes that "a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] did not have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Thomas |last=Ricker |title=First Click: Apple's greatest innovation is its ecosystem |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem |website=[[The Verge]] |date=September 7, 2016 |access-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref>

''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in June 2017 that Apple's increased reliance on [[Siri]], its [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual personal assistant]], has raised questions about how much Apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality. Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. "Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions. While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]] had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Tripp|last=Mickle|title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'—How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095|url-access=subscription|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=June 7, 2017|access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Tim|last=Hardwick|title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy/|website=[[MacRumors]]|date=June 8, 2017|access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref>

Not to say that things didn't go wrong under his watch, but product announcements and launches felt a lot tighter for sure, as did the overall quality of what Apple was releasing." He did, however, also acknowledge that such failures "may indeed have happened" with Jobs in charge, though returning to the previous praise for his demands of quality, stating "it's almost guaranteed that given his personality that heads would have rolled, which limits future failures".<ref name="zdnet rotten" />

=== Manufacturing ===
The company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: "Nobody wants to buy sour milk".<ref name="supply" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |access-date=December 24, 2011|date=November 9, 2011}}</ref>

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |access-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as [[USB]], [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[NVM Express|NVMe]], [[PCI Express|PCIe]] and others in its products. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]] and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404152533/http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |archivedate=April 4, 2014}}</ref>

Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO [[Tim Cook]] said that he "[loves] India", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |title=Apple's Feeling Europe's Economic Crisis: 'Essentially Flat' Sales And A 'Slowdown' In Business, Says Cook |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/apples-feeling-europes-economic-crisis-essentially-flat-revenues/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 24, 2012 |access-date=May 24, 2017}}</ref> India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as "really adds cost to getting product to market".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'I love India, but...' |url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-i-love-india-but-247307 |website=Gadgets360 |publisher=[[NDTV]] |date=July 25, 2012 |access-date=May 24, 2017}}</ref> In October 2013, Indian Apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and [[store-within-a-store]] concepts, in an effort to expand further into the market.

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees.

According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in "primitive, dark and filthy dorms" where they sleep "on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room."

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the "[[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]]," which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Duhigg |first1=Charles |last2=Kocieniewski |first2=David |title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 29, 2012 |date=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,<ref>{{Cite news |last= Watson |first= Roland |title= Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax' |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date= October 30, 2012}}</ref> which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.<ref>{{Cite news |last= Ebrahimi |first= Helia |title= Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]  |date= November 2, 2012 |location= London}}</ref>

In 2015, [[Reuters]] reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4&nbsp;billion which were untaxed by the [[IRS]] of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by the [[Internal Revenue Code|IRC]], corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit its [[shareholder]]s it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Drawbaugh |first1=Kevin |last2=Temple-West |first2=Patrick |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-usa-tax-offshore-idUSBREA3729V20140409 |title=Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trillion: study |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=February 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/ |title=Apple Earnings Call |publisher=Apple Inc. |access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref>

On July 12, 2016 the [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office of Ireland]] announced that 2015 Irish [[GDP]] had grown by 26.3%, and 2015 Irish [[GNP]] had grown by 18.7%.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/nie/nationalincomeandexpenditureannualresults2015/ |title= National Income and Expenditure Annual Results 2015 |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics]] |date= July 12, 2016}}</ref> The figures attracted international scorn, and were labelled by Nobel-prize winning economist, [[Paul Krugman]], as [[leprechaun economics]]. It was not until 2018 that Irish economists could definitively prove that the 2015 growth was due to Apple restructuring its controversial [[double Irish]] subsidiaries (Apple Sales International), which Apple converted into a new Irish [[corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Multinational tax schemes|capital allowances for intangible assets]] tax scheme (expires in January 2020). The affair required the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] to create a new measure of Irish economic growth, [[modified gross national income|Modified GNI*]] to replace Irish GDP, given the distortion of Apple's tax schemes. Irish GDP is 143% of Irish Modified GNI*.

On August 30, 2016, after [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|a two-year investigation]], the EU Competition Commissioner concluded Apple received "illegal State aid" from Ireland.
