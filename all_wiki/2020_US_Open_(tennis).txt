The '''2020 US Open''' was the 140th edition of [[tennis]]'s [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and the second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] event of the year. It was held on outdoor [[hard court]]s at the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]] in [[Queens, New York]]. 

[[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Bianca Andreescu]] were the men's and women's singles defending champions; however, both decided not to compete. Nadal withdrew from the tournament citing safety concerns regarding the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] as well as the switchover to the European clay court season immediately afterward, while Andreescu stated that the pandemic had compromised her ability to prepare and compete at her highest level.

[[Dominic Thiem]] won the men's singles title, defeating first time Grand Slam finalist [[Alexander Zverev]] in a five-set match to capture his first Grand Slam title. [[Naomi Osaka]] won the women's singles title, defeating [[Victoria Azarenka]] in three sets, capturing her second US Open title and third Grand Slam title overall.

The 2020 US Open was the 140th edition of the tournament and took place at the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]] in [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park]] of [[Queens]] in New York City, [[New York (state)|New York]], United States. The tournament will be held on 17 [[Laykold]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2020-03-23/2020-03-23_2020-03-23_sport_groups_laykold_selected_as_new_us_open_court_surface.html|title=Sport Group's Laykold selected as new US Open court surface|website=www.usopen.org}}</ref> hard courts.

The tournament was an event run by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) and is part of the [[2020 ATP Tour]] and the [[2020 WTA Tour]] calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted only of the men's and women's singles and doubles draws, and both doubles draws were cut to 32 pairs instead of the standard 64. Singles players remain in standard 128-person format in each category. Under the decision of the [[Government of New York (state)|New York state government]], qualifying matches, mixed doubles and junior matches would not be played. It was initially announced that the wheelchair tournaments would not be held normally in every quadrennial year due to conflicting with the [[Summer Paralympic Games]] (as [[2020 Summer Paralympics|this year's Paralympics]] postponed to 2021); however this was reversed when it would be played rather than not held this year as received criticism from players such as [[Dylan Alcott]].<ref name="USOpen2020"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-18/disgusting-discrimination-dylan-alcott-us-open-wheelchair-tennis/12367782|title=Dylan Alcott accuses US Open organisers of discrimination after wheelchair tennis is dropped for the 2020 event|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=June 18, 2020|accessdate=June 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-25/us-open-u-turn-on-wheelchair-tennis-after-dylan-alcott-blast/12390502|title=Wheelchair tennis back on at US Open after initial decision criticised by players including Dylan Alcott|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>

[[Grandstand (US Open)|Grandstand]] was not used as it was the main stadium of this year's [[2020 Western & Southern Open|Western & Southern Open]], also held in New York City instead of its usual [[Cincinnati]] venue.<ref>{{cite web |title=Western & Southern Open takes over New York City |url=http://baseline.tennis.com/article/90091/cincinnati-tennis-new-york-city-novak-djokovic |website=Baseline |accessdate=15 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

==Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic==
{{see also|Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports}}
This event is normally the fourth and final [[Grand Slam (tennis)|major tournament]] of the year (scheduled for the last Monday of August to second Sunday of September) and the peak of the North American hard court season. Due to concerns relating to the ongoing pandemic, during June 2020, it was announced that this event would take place [[Behind closed doors (sport)|without spectators]] (for the first time in the tournament's history, and the first time in all the Grand Slam tournaments' 143-year history) after being approved by [[Andrew Cuomo]], the [[Governor of New York|Governor of New York state]], in which the venue is located. The players entering the United States would not need to get quarantined, but had to get [[COVID-19 testing|tested for the virus]] before leaving for New York City and had to continue testing throughout the tournament. If players tested positive for the virus, they would be forced to leave the tournament. In accordance with [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] regulations, players and personnel had to wear a face mask upon entering the grounds except while practicing, training, and working out.<ref name="USOpen2020">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/53070667 |title=US Open to be held behind closed doors after New York governor gives go-ahead |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=June 16, 2020 |accessdate=June 16, 2020}}</ref>

The third-round match between [[Alexander Zverev]] and [[Adrian Mannarino]] at [[Louis Armstrong Stadium]] was delayed for three hours due to a "collaborative dialogue with health officials".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/04/cameron-norrie-us-open-alenjandro-davidovich-fokina |title=Mannarino mystery after Evans follows Norrie out of US Open |last=Mitchell |first=Kevin}}</ref> Mannarino was one of ten players in contact with [[Benoît Paire]] (who withdrew from the tournament after testing positive for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]]) that were placed under USTA's additional protocols for coronavirus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.crackedracquets.com/2020-us-open-covid-protocol/ |title=Internal Documents Reveal New US Open COVID-19 Protocols |last=Gruskin |first=Alex}}</ref> The number one women's doubles team of [[Timea Babos]] and [[Kristina Mladenovic]] was forced to withdraw from their second round match after the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] overruled the [[New York City]] government on whether players in contact with [[Benoît Paire]], but not positive for COVID-19, would be allowed to compete.

Schröder's rather dominant two-set upset of Lapthorne gave him second place and the other berth in the final; Lapthorne finished the round robin with one win and Wagner finished with none.<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Open 2020 {{endash}} Wheelchair Quad Singles Draw |url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/draws/2020_US_draw.pdf |website=usopen.org |accessdate=15 September 2020}}</ref>

The final was contested by top-seeded Alcott and Schröder. The first set was evenly played by both competitors, but was won by Schröder in a tiebreak. Alcott recovered with a second-set [[Bagel (tennis)|bagel]] to force the game into a third set, which was won by Schröder in upset fashion, 6–4, for his first US Open title.<ref>{{cite web |title=US Open 2020: Dylan Alcott has lost the US Open Quad Singles final in a dramatic final set to Sam Schroder |url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/tennis/news/dylan-alcott-us-open-2020-quad-singles-final-sam-schroder/tvn30vjdzor21125le2shiwuv |website=www.sportingnews.com |accessdate=15 September 2020 |language=en-au}}</ref> Schröder's win was especially unlikely considering that Alcott was seeking his eleventh Grand Slam title while Schröder was appearing in a Grand Slam event for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |title=US Open: Sam Schroder reflects on dream debut in New York |url=https://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12110/12072317/us-open-sam-schroder-reflects-on-dream-debut-in-new-york |website=Sky Sports |accessdate=15 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

The wheelchair men's doubles tournament was contested by the same eight players who contested the [[#Wheelchair Men's Singles|singles]] event. The top seed was given to the pair of [[Alfie Hewett]] and [[Gordon Reid (tennis)|Gordon Reid]], with the second seed given to [[Stéphane Houdet]] and [[Nicolas Peifer]].

As with the men's tournament, the wheelchair women's doubles event was contested by the same group of eight players that played in the [[#Wheelchair Women's Singles|singles]] event. The semifinal round proved not to be a challenge for either of the two seeded pairs, as the top-seeded duo of [[Marjolein Buis]] and [[Diede de Groot]] defeated Angélica Bernal and Dana Mathewson <ref>{{cite web |title=IBM SlamTracker: Buis/de Groot vs. Bernal/Mathewson |url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/stats/34102.html |website=usopen.org |accessdate=15 September 2020}}</ref> and he second-seeded pair of [[Yui Kamiji]] and [[Jordanne Whiley]] defeated Momoko Ohtani and [[Lucy Shuker]], both in straight sets. In the final, Kamiji and Whiley were able to outlast Buis and de Groot, winning both sets by a score of 6–3, and earning their eleventh Grand Slam title together.<ref>{{cite web |title=GB's Whiley wins US Open doubles title |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/disability-sport/54141879 |website=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 September 2020}}</ref>

The wheelchair quad doubles event was the smallest at the tournament, with only four players (the same four that contested the [[#Wheelchair Quad Singles|singles]] event) competing. As a result, there was only one match played to determine the champion. In the first set, underdogs [[Sam Schröder]] and [[David Wagner (tennis)|David Wagner]] jumped out to an early lead by winning the first set 6–3, but [[Dylan Alcott]] and [[Andy Lapthorne]] battled back to force a third with a 6–4 second-set victory. The third set was not played traditionally, but rather as just a tiebreak, which was won 10–8 by Alcott and Lapthorne to secure them the wheelchair quad doubles title.<ref>{{cite web |title=US Open 2020: Dylan Alcott wins Quad Doubles final, books place in Singles final |url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/tennis/news/tennis-us-open-dylan-alcott-wins-us-open-quad-doubles-title-books-place-in-singles-final/z2w2i8a68jv717p6cz2f6i6lg |website=www.sportingnews.com |accessdate=15 September 2020 |language=en-au}}</ref>
