The '''Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index''', also called the '''FTSE 100 Index''', '''FTSE 100''', '''FTSE''', or, informally, the '''"Footsie"''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊ|t|s|i}}, is a [[Stock market index|share index]] of the 100&nbsp;[[company|companies]] by capital value, listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] with the highest [[market capitalisation]]. It is seen as a gauge of prosperity for businesses regulated by [[UK company law]]. The index is maintained by the [[FTSE Group]], a subsidiary of the [[London Stock Exchange Group]].

==Overview==
The index is maintained by the FTSE Group, a now wholly owned subsidiary of the [[London Stock Exchange]] which originated as a joint venture between the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and the London Stock Exchange. It is calculated in [[Real-time computing|real time]] and published every second when the market is open.

The FTSE 100 broadly consists of the largest 100 qualifying UK companies by full market value.<ref>[http://www.ftse.com/Indices/UK_Indices/Downloads/uk_indexrules.pdf Ground Rules for the Management of The UK Series of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices (section 5)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108071657/http://www.ftse.com/Indices/UK_Indices/Downloads/uk_indexrules.pdf |date=8 January 2013 }}</ref> The total market value of a company is calculated by multiplying the share price of the company by the total number of shares they have issued.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayinvestor.co.uk/what-is-the-ftse-100-and-why-does-it-go-up-and-down/|title=What is the FTSE 100 and why does it go up or down?|last=everydayinvestor|date=2019-04-19|website=everyday investor|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref> Many of these are internationally focused companies, however, so the index's movements are a fairly weak indicator of how the UK economy is faring and are significantly affected by the [[exchange rate]]s of the Pound.<ref>{{Cite news |last1 = Atkins |first1 = Ralph |last2 = Elder |first2 = Bryce |date = 3 September 2014 |title = FTSE 100 hits new record high on sterling weakness |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/r-ftse-100-hits-new-record-high-on-sterling-weakness-2017-1?IR=T |work = businessinsider.co.uk |accessdate = 29 March 2017 }}</ref> A better indication of the UK economy is the [[FTSE 250 Index]], as it contains a smaller proportion of international companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/share-tips/richard-hunter-weekly-comment/which-indices-best-represent-the-economy |title=Which indices best represent the economy? |work=Hargreaves Lansdown |accessdate=9 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602082259/http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/share-tips/richard-hunter-weekly-comment/which-indices-best-represent-the-economy |archivedate=2 June 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Even though the [[FTSE All-Share Index]] is more comprehensive, the FTSE&nbsp;100 is by far the most widely used UK stock market indicator. Other related indices are the FTSE 250 Index (which includes the next largest 250 companies after the FTSE&nbsp;100), the [[FTSE&nbsp;350 Index]] (which is the aggregation of the FTSE&nbsp;100 and 250), [[FTSE&nbsp;SmallCap Index]] and the [[FTSE Fledgling Index]]. The FTSE All-Share aggregates the FTSE&nbsp;100, FTSE&nbsp;250 and FTSE&nbsp;SmallCap.

To be included in the index, a company must meet a number of requirements set out by the [[FTSE Group]], including having a full listing on the London Stock Exchange with a Sterling or Euro denominated price on the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service, and meeting certain tests on nationality, [[public float|free float]], and [[Market liquidity|liquidity]].

Continuous trading on the London Stock Exchange starts at 08:00 and ends at 16:30 (when the closing auction starts), and closing values are taken at 16:35.

===Weighting===
In the FTSE indices, share prices are weighted by free-float capitalisation, so that the larger companies, with more of their stock "floating", make more of a difference to the index than smaller companies. The basic formula for these indices is:

<math>
\text{Index level}=\frac{\sum_i \text{Price of stock}_i\times\text{Number of shares}_i \times\text{Free float adjustment factor}_i}{\text{Index divisor}}
</math>

The free float adjustment factor represents the percentage of all issued shares that are readily available for trading, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%. The free-float capitalisation of a company is its [[market capitalisation]] multiplied by its free float adjustment factor. It therefore does not include restricted stocks, such as those held by company insiders.

==Record values==
The index reached the following record values:

==FT 30==
{{main|FT 30}}
The oldest continuous index in the UK is the FT&nbsp;30, also known as the Financial Times Index or the FT Ordinary Index&nbsp;(FTOI).<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] - [http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/encyclopedia/article_show/Financial_Times_Index_/m0006128.html Financial Times Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205061245/http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/encyclopedia/article_show/Financial_Times_Index_/m0006128.html |date=5 February 2009 }}. Retrieved 8 August 2008</ref> It was established in 1935 and nowadays is largely obsolete due to its redundancy. It is similar to the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], and companies listed are from the industrial and commercial sectors. Financial sector companies and government stocks are excluded.

Of the original constituents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/78c12166-0773-11db-9067-0000779e2340.html|title=FT30 - the UK's oldest surviving stock market index - FT.com|work=ft.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref> three are currently in the FTSE&nbsp;100: Tate & Lyle, Imperial Tobacco and Rolls-Royce, although Rolls-Royce has not been continuously listed and Imperial Tobacco was a subsidiary of [[Hanson plc|Hanson]] for a number of years, and is now renamed as Imperial Brands. Only one of the original FT 30 companies are still in that index:<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/28e9d8dc-0781-11db-9067-0000779e2340.html Remaining companies in the FT30]</ref> Tate & Lyle (membership is not strictly based on market capitalisation, so this does not mean they are necessarily among the top thirty companies in the FTSE&nbsp;100). The best performer from the original lineup has been Imperial Tobacco.<ref>Eckett, Stephen (ed.)
