'''Earl of Snowdon''' is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1961, together with the [[subsidiary title]] of '''Viscount Linley''', of [[Nymans]] in the [[County of Sussex]], by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] for her then brother-in-law, [[Antony Armstrong-Jones]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=42481 |date=6 October 1961 |page=7199 }}</ref> who married [[Princess Margaret]] in 1960. 

==Titles==
===Choice of names===
''[[Snowdon]]'', chosen for the [[earldom]], had previously been used for a peerage title with royal associations. The title of [[Baron Snowdon]] had been conferred in 1726 along with the [[Dukedom of Edinburgh]] on [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Frederick Louis]], grandson of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and future [[Prince of Wales]]. It merged in [[the Crown]] in 1760, when its holder acceded as [[George III]].

''Linley'', chosen for the viscountcy, comes from the 1st Earl of Snowdon's maternal great-grandfather, the English cartoonist and illustrator [[Edward Linley Sambourne]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Michaels|first1=Ashley|title=Sobrinos Reales: The Earl of Snowdon and Lady Sarah Chatto|date=14 November 2017|location=ASIN B077H1HWCB|edition=1}}</ref>

''[[Nymans]]'', chosen as [[territorial designation]] of the viscountcy, relates to an English garden near [[Handcross]] in [[West Sussex]], where [[Anne Parsons, Countess of Rosse|Anne Armstrong-Jones, ''née'' Messel]], mother of the 1st Earl of Snowdon, had grown up.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Michaels|first1=Ashley|title=Sobrinos Reales: The Earl of Snowdon and Lady Sarah Chatto|date=14 November 2017|location=ASIN B077H1HWCB|edition=1}}</ref>

===Life peerage===
In November 1999, the 1st Earl of Snowdon received a [[life peerage]] as '''Baron Armstrong-Jones''',<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55672 |date=19 November 1999 |page=12349}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55676 |date=23 November 1999 |page=12465}}</ref> under a device designed to allow first-generation hereditary peers to retain their seats in the [[House of Lords]], after the passing of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]].
