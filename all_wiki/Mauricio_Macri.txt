'''Mauricio Macri''' ({{IPA-es|mawˈɾisjo ˈmakɾi}}; born 8 February 1959)<ref>{{cite web |title=Biografía del Presidente Mauricio Macri |url=https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/biografia |website=Casa Rosada |language=es-es |access-date=20 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720135843/https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/el-presidente/biografia |archive-date=20 July 2018   }}</ref> is an Argentine businessman and politician who served as the 52nd [[President of Argentina]] from 2015 to 2019.<ref>https://www.casarosada.gob.ar/nuestro-pais/galeria-de-presidentes</ref> He has been the leader of the [[Republican Proposal]] (PRO) party since its founding in 2005. He previously served as 5th [[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|Chief of Government of Buenos Aires]] from 2007 to 2015, and was a member of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] representing [[Buenos Aires]] from 2005 to 2007. Ideologically, he identifies as a moderate and [[Centrism|centrist]] conservative on the Argentine [[Politics of Argentina|centre-right]]. 

Born [[Tandil|Tandil, Argentina]], Macri trained as a [[civil engineer]] at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]] and attended [[Columbia University]] for business school. After embarking on a business career, he was kidnapped in 1991 which, after being released, prompted him to enter politics. He served as president of football club [[Boca Juniors]] from 1994 to 2007, reestablishing its profitability which raised his public profile. In 2003 he launched the [[List of political parties in Argentina#Current parties|Commitment for Change]] (CPC) party, eventually developing it into the modern PRO party. Following an unsuccessful bid for [[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|mayor of Buenos Aires]] that year Macri won election [[2007 Argentine general election|in 2007]] as the city's chief of government and won re-election [[2011 Argentine general election|in 2011]]. Four years later he was elected president of Argentina in the narrow [[2015 Argentine general election|2015 general election]] – the first presidential [[Two-round system|runoff]] [[Ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] in Argentinian history.

The [[Presidency of Mauricio Macri|presidency of Macri]] focused on reforming the national economy and improving [[Foreign relations of Argentina|diplomatic relations]]. He aligned the country with [[Gradualism#Politics and society|gradualist]] [[neoliberalism]] and re-opened Argentina to international markets by lifting [[Foreign exchange controls|currency controls]], [[Argentine debt restructuring|restructuring sovereign debt]], and pressing [[Presidency of Mauricio Macri#Economic policy|free-market solutions]]. Domestically he pursued moderate [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] policies, liberalized the energy sector, and combatted public corruption. His legislative pursuits varied in efficacy and received mixed reception from Argentines and globally. Macri navigated the [[2018 Argentine monetary crisis|2018 monetary crisis]] by securing [[Argentina and the International Monetary Fund#2018 Stand-By Arrangement|outside funding]] from the [[International Monetary Fund]] reversing initial fiscal restraint. Macri became the first incumbent president to lose reelection to a second term during the [[2019 Argentine general election|2019 general elections]]. His presidency has been criticized for failing to materially reform the economy<ref>{{Cite web|last=Luciana|first=Zorzoli|date=14 May 2019|title=The Consequences of Mr Macri|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/austerity-argentina-mauricio-macri-cambiemos|access-date=6 June 2020|website=jacobinmag.com|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Gedan|first=Benjamin N.|date=24 October 2019|title=Mauricio Macri Was Bound for Disaster|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/24/macri-fernandez-kirchner-argentina-president-elections-economy-imf-debt/|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US}}</ref> while receiving praise for leaving a [[Corruption in Argentina#Public perceptions|legacy of anti-corruption]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=The Editorial Board|date=9 December 2019|title=Argentina must preserve anti-corruption legacy|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c3bc296a-1829-11ea-8d73-6303645ac406|access-date=6 June 2020|website=Financial Times}}</ref> and increasing Argentina's [[Argentine debt restructuring#Presidency of Mauricio Macri and default end (2015-2016)|sovereign marketability]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wallencraft|first=Jeff|date=31 October 2019|title=Mauricio Macri {{!}} Biography|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mauricio-Macri|access-date=6 June 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Mauricio Macri’s long odds|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/03/07/mauricio-macris-long-odds|access-date=2020-06-11|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

== Overview ==
Born in Tandil, [[Buenos Aires Province]], Macri is the son of [[Franco Macri]], a prominent [[Italian people|Italian]] businessman in the industrial and construction sectors, and was raised in an [[upper class]] home. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in civil engineering from the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina]] and studied at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia Business School|business school]] in [[New York City]], United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=Qué estudiaron y a qué universidades fueron los candidatos a Presidente|url=http://www.girabsas.com/nota/13864/|accessdate=7 October 2015|work=Girabsas|date=7 October 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012013732/http://www.girabsas.com/nota/13864/|archive-date=12 October 2015}}</ref> Macri became president of [[Boca Juniors]], one of Argentina's two most popular football clubs, in 1995. In 2005, he created the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[Republican Proposal]] party (Propuesta Republicana, also known as PRO).<ref>{{cite news|title=Los momentos de Mauricio Macri en Boca que marcaron su perfil político|url=http://www.infobae.com/2015/11/23/1771739-los-momentos-mauricio-macri-boca-que-marcaron-su-perfil-politico|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Girabsas|date=23 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124150833/http://www.infobae.com/2015/11/23/1771739-los-momentos-mauricio-macri-boca-que-marcaron-su-perfil-politico|archive-date=24 November 2015}}</ref>

Although Macri was a potential presidential candidate in the [[2011 Argentine general election|2011 general elections]], he ran instead for re-election as mayor. He received about 47&nbsp;percent of the vote in the mayoral election, which led to a [[Two-round system|runoff]] election on 31 July 2011 against [[Daniel Filmus]] in which Macri was re-elected for a second consecutive term.<ref>{{Cite web|title=El jefe de gobierno fue reelecto por amplio margen|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1393853-macri-y-filmus-se-enfrentan-una-eleccion-con-alto-impacto-a-nivel-nacional|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124204217/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1393853-macri-y-filmus-se-enfrentan-una-eleccion-con-alto-impacto-a-nivel-nacional|archive-date=24 November 2015|accessdate=24 November 2015|website=www.lanacion.com.ar}}</ref> On 22 November 2015, after a tie in the first round of the [[2015 Argentine general election|presidential elections on 25&nbsp;October]], he received 51.34&nbsp;percent of the vote to defeat [[Front for Victory]] candidate [[Daniel Scioli]]<ref>{{cite news|date=10 December 2015|title=Balotaje: terminó el escrutinio definitivo y Macri ganó por una menor ventaja|work=minutouno|url=http://www.minutouno.com/notas/1456464-balotaje-termino-el-escrutinio-definitivo-y-macri-gano-una-menor-ventaja|accessdate=10 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203060139/http://www.minutouno.com/notas/1456464-balotaje-termino-el-escrutinio-definitivo-y-macri-gano-una-menor-ventaja|archive-date=3 December 2015}}</ref> and was inaugurated on 10 December 2015 in the Argentine Congress<!--, a ceremony that was not attended by his predecessor Kirchner-->.

Macri ended the sovereign default and removed currency controls, but inflation remained high and the [[2018 Argentine monetary crisis]] led to a loan from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), its largest ever awarded.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/argentina-imf-biggest-loan "Argentina gets biggest loan in IMF's history at $57bn", ''The Guardian'', 26 September 2018.]</ref> By April 2019, inflation had reached 55%. Prices for public utilities, fixed since 2002 despite the high inflation, were gradually restored to market figures.

In the international arena, the country left the [[pink tide]] and was a vocal critic of Venezuelan president [[Nicolás Maduro]] during the [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis]]. The party won the most districts during the [[2017 Argentine legislative election|2017 midterm elections]], and Macri announced that he would run for a second term in 2019. He secured his party's nomination in the [[2019 Argentine general election|2019 Presidential election]] in August 2019 despite a poor performance in the primary.<ref name="nytimesnomination" /><ref name="nprnomination" />

In 2016, Macri was named one of the [[Time 100|world's 100 most influential people]] and the most powerful president in [[Latin America]] by US news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref name="time">{{cite web|url=http://time.com/collection/2016-time-100/|publisher=time.com|title=List of individuals included in the ''TIME'' 100 in 2016|accessdate=26 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129133525/http://time.com/collection/2016-time-100/|archive-date=29 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title="Time" incluyó a Macri entre las 100 personas más influyentes del mundo|url=http://tn.com.ar/politica/time-incluyo-macri-entre-las-100-personas-mas-influyentes-del-mundo_667489|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=Todo Noticias|date=21 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423135543/http://tn.com.ar/politica/time-incluyo-macri-entre-las-100-personas-mas-influyentes-del-mundo_667489|archive-date=23 April 2016}}</ref>

==Boca Juniors==
[[File:Palermo, personalidad destacada del deporte.jpg|thumb|Mauricio Macri and [[Martín Palermo]], football player of [[Boca Juniors]].]]
Macri intended to run for chairman of sports club [[Boca Juniors]] in 1991, but his father convinced him to keep working at Sevel. He tried to buy the [[Deportivo Español]] team, but could not get support from the team's board of directors. Macri supported Boca Juniors, paying coach [[César Luis Menotti]]'s salary and buying players for the team (including [[forward (association football)|forward]] [[Walter Perazzo]]). Franco, skeptical about his son's prospects for success, later allowed him to run Boca Juniors. He instructed aide [[Orlando Salvestrini]] to work with Mauricio for two reasons: to help him and to monitor his activities. Mauricio met with former Boca Juniors chairmen [[Antonio Alegre]] and [[Carlos Heller]], and tried to convince them to work with him; both rebuffed him. Macri later sought the support of other groups in Boca Juniors, eventually winning the team's internal elections in 1995 with 7,058 votes.<ref>''Todo Macri'', pp. 29-33</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.clarin.com/deportes/dia-goles-primera-victoria-macri_0_SyMg_YktDQx.html|title= El día de los 10 goles y la primera victoria de Macri|trans-title= The day of the 10 goals and the first victory of Macri|language= es|author= Guillermo Dos Santos Coelho|date= 3 December 2015|newspaper= Clarín|accessdate= 8 November 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181108224629/https://www.clarin.com/deportes/dia-goles-primera-victoria-macri_0_SyMg_YktDQx.html|archive-date= 8 November 2018|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

His first years were unsuccessful; the team's performance was poor, players frequently complained about salaries and bonuses, and Macri changed coaches three times. The only initial improvement was a partial reconstruction of the stadium. He arranged for the Boca Juniors institution to operate on the [[stock exchange]], selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] of active football players owned by the club.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.clarin.com/economia/boca-juniors-bolsa_0_H1agH5l-0tl.html|title= Boca Juniors ya está en la Bolsa|trans-title= Boca Juniors is at the stock exchange|language= es|date= 23 September 1997|newspaper= Clarín|accessdate=22 May 2019}}</ref> Macri's first coach was [[Carlos Salvador Bilardo]], who brought 14 new players to the team and finished the [[1996–97 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Apertura|1996 Apertura league]] in 10th place.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ole.com.ar/boca-juniors/futbol/Boca-trajo-jugadores-salio-mitad_0_1303669672.html|title= En el 96 Boca trajo 15 jugadores y salió en la mitad|trans-title= In the '96 Boca brought 15 players and ended in the middle|language= es|author= "En el 96 Boca trajo 15 jugadores y salió en la mitad"|date= 14 February 2015|publisher= Olé|accessdate= 27 February 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151203133911/http://www.ole.com.ar/boca-juniors/futbol/Boca-trajo-jugadores-salio-mitad_0_1303669672.html|archive-date= 3 December 2015|df= dmy-all}}</ref> His second coach, [[Héctor Veira]], also performed poorly.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/111397-el-mejor-arranque-de-boca|title= El mejor arranque de Boca|trans-title= The best start of Boca|language= es|first= Christian|last= Leblebidjian|date= 22 September 1998|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 27 February 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306142257/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/111397-el-mejor-arranque-de-boca|archive-date= 6 March 2016|df= dmy-all}}</ref> New coach [[Carlos Bianchi]] helped [[Juan Román Riquelme]] improve his performance, and had [[Martín Palermo]] and [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]] as effective forwards.

==Early political career==

During 2006, Macri worked both on his political activities as deputy and with his presidency of Boca Juniors. Before the [[2007 Argentine general election|2007 general elections]], he negotiated with the likely presidential candidate [[Jorge Sobisch]], the [[governor of Neuquén Province]], to create a national right-wing political coalition.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/687829-alianza-de-macri-y-sobisch-para-2007|title= Alianza de Macri y Sobisch para 2007|trans-title= Alliance of Macri and Sobisch for 2007|language= es|author= Oliver Galak|date= 16 March 2005|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref> This conflicted with Macri's alliance with Ricardo López Murphy, who also intended to run for president and had denounced Sobisch for corruption.

In February 2007, Macri announced that he would run again for mayor of Buenos Aires, heading the PRO slate with [[Gabriela Michetti]]. In the 2 June 2007 first round, he received 45.6&nbsp;percent of the vote and defeated government-backed [[Daniel Filmus]] (who received 23.8&nbsp;percent of the vote); incumbent Jorge Telerman finished third. In the 24 June runoff election, Macri defeated Filmus with 60.96&nbsp;percent of the vote.<ref>BBC News, 25 June 2007.

For the [[2009 Argentine legislative election|2009 midterm elections]], he allied with [[Francisco de Narváez]] and [[Felipe Solá]]. The alliance was successful; De Narvaez defeated former president [[Néstor Kirchner]] in Buenos Aires Province and [[Gabriela Michetti]] won the city election. With this defeat, the Kirchners lost their majority in both chambers of the Congress. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, whose public image was good after the [[death and state funeral of Néstor Kirchner]] in late 2010, ran for re-election. Macri, who was considered a likely candidate for the opposition, ran for re-election as mayor instead. He won the first round on 10 July 2011 with 47.08&nbsp;percent of the vote against Filmus's 27.78&nbsp;percent, and then the 31 July runoff against Filmus with 64.25&nbsp;percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1393937-macri-establecio-un-nuevo-record-en-la-ciudad%7CMacri|title= Macri estableció un nuevo récord en la ciudad|trans-title= Macri set a new high score in the city|language= es|date= 1 August 2011|publisher= La Naciòn|accessdate= 7 January 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170109030918/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1393937-macri-establecio-un-nuevo-record-en-la-ciudad%7CMacri|archive-date= 9 January 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Macri's administration worked on public transport in an attempt to reduce auto traffic in Buenos Aires. One project was the [[Metrobus (Buenos Aires)|Metrobus]], a [[bus rapid transit]] system added to the city's main streets.

The [[Buenos Aires Underground]], initially maintained by the national government, was the subject of a year-long dispute between him and the [[Presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Fernández de Kirchner government]]. The national government sought to transfer it to the city, which Macri supported, but the budget and length of the transition period were contested.

Buenos Aires, initially a [[federal district]] with limited autonomy, had become an [[autonomous city]] with the [[1994 amendment of the Constitution of Argentina]]. The [[Argentine Federal Police]], under national-government jurisdiction, still worked in the city and disputes over a potential transfer to a local force were unresolved when Macri was elected. He unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a transfer with President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]. As an alternative, in 2008 Macri proposed a bill for the creation of the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police]] to work with federal police in the city. The bill, supported by the PRO and the Kirchnerite blocs, was rejected by [[Civic Coalition (Argentina)|Civic Coalition]] blocs and those aligned with <!--Aníbal-->Ibarra. [[Elisa Carrió]], leader of the Civic Coalition, thought that Macri had abandoned the transfer request, and Ibarra said that the forces' duties would overlap.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/crearon-policia-metropolitana-calle-fines-2009_0_SyEG5qiApFx.html|title= Crearon la Policía Metropolitana y estaría en la calle a fines de 2009|trans-title= The new metropolitan police was created, and it will be in the streets by the ending of 2009|language= es|first= Daniel|last= Gutman|date= 29 October 2008|newspaper= Clarín|accessdate= 25 January 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171018051605/https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/crearon-policia-metropolitana-calle-fines-2009_0_SyEG5qiApFx.html|archive-date= 18 October 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The Metropolitan Police began with nearly 1,000 officers; the Federal Police had 17,000 officers working in the city.

[[Jorge Alberto Palacios]] was the first chief of the Metropolitan Police. A member of the police unit which rescued Macri from his kidnappers, Palacios was fired by then-President [[Néstor Kirchner]] for his alleged involvement in the [[murder of Axel Blumberg]] (for which he was acquitted). His appointment was controversial; Palacios had been investigated for concealing evidence of the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jta.org/2009/07/08/news-opinion/world/new-top-cop-in-buenos-aires-in-amia-probe|title= New top cop in Buenos Aires in AMIA probe|first= Florencia|last= Arbiser|date= 8 July 2009|publisher= Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate= 25 January 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202062321/http://www.jta.org/2009/07/08/news-opinion/world/new-top-cop-in-buenos-aires-in-amia-probe|archive-date= 2 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> and he resigned a short time later.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3767660,00.html|title= Investigator of Argentinean Jewish center attack resigns|publisher= Ynet|accessdate= 25 January 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202093610/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3767660,00.html|archive-date= 2 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The transfer of police protection to the city was completed during the Larreta administration.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/222564/larreta-to-announce-new-city-police|title= Larreta to announce new City police|date= 5 October 2016|publisher= Buenos Aires Herald|accessdate= 18 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170224215615/http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/222564/larreta-to-announce-new-city-police|archive-date= 24 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Same-sex marriage===
[[File:Mauricio Macri asistió a la misa anual por la educación (7091688691).jpg|thumb|alt=Macri shaking hands with Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis)|Macri and Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio (now [[Pope Francis]])]]
A gay couple, José María Di Bello and Alex Freyre, started a judicial case so that they could get married in Buenos Aires. They challenged articles 172 and 188 of the civil code, which restrict marriage to people of different genders, as unconstitutional. Judge Gabriela Seijas agreed, and the couple married in 2009. It was the first [[same-sex marriage in Argentina]]. Macri did not appeal the ruling, saying that same-sex marriage was becoming universally accepted and individuals had a right to happiness. He compared the controversy with the sanctioning of [[divorce]] during the 1980s after the restoration of democracy in Argentina; highly controversial at first, it was eventually accepted.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/macri-dio-fuerte-respaldo-matrimonio-homosexuales_0_HJNgYfdC6Kx.html|title= Macri dio un fuerte respaldo al matrimonio entre homosexuales|trans-title= Macri gave a strong support to same-sex marriage|language= es|first= Mariana|last= Iglesias|date= 14 November 2009|newspaper= Clarín|accessdate= 18 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171018053154/https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/macri-dio-fuerte-respaldo-matrimonio-homosexuales_0_HJNgYfdC6Kx.html|archive-date= 18 October 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> A [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|federal law]] permitting same-sex marriage was passed the following year.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/americas/16argentina.html|title= Argentina Approves Gay Marriage, in a First for Region|first= Alexei|last= Barrionuevo|date= 15 July 2010|newspaper= The New York Times|accessdate= 18 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120617095922/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/americas/16argentina.html?_r=1|archive-date= 17 June 2012|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Macri's refusal to appeal the sentence affected his relationship with [[archbishop of Buenos Aires|Archbishop]] Jorge Bergoglio (who later became [[Pope Francis]]). Bergoglio opposed same-sex marriage, and expected Macri to appeal the ruling. According to the archbishop, a lower-court judge should not establish the constitutionality of a law and Macri should have appealed the ruling in a higher court. Bergoglio was also annoyed by what he considered a lack of communication between himself and Macri.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1203956-tensa-reunion-entre-bergoglio-y-macri-por-el-matrimonio-gay|title= Tensa reunión entre Bergoglio y Macri por el matrimonio gay|trans-title= Tense meeting between Bergoglio and Macri over same-sex marriage|language= es|first= Ángeles|last= Castro|date= 25 November 2009|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 18 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171018053433/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1203956-tensa-reunion-entre-bergoglio-y-macri-por-el-matrimonio-gay|archive-date= 18 October 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Macri ran for president of Argentina in [[2015 Argentine general election|2015]]. With President Cristina Kirchner unable to run, early opinion polls indicated a close three-way race between Macri, [[Kirchnerism|Kirchnerite]] governor [[Daniel Scioli]] and [[Tigre, Buenos Aires|Tigre]] mayor [[Sergio Massa]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/85201/|title= Las últimas encuestas confirman que sigue el triple empate entre Massa y Macri y Scioli|trans-title= The last polls confirm the triple draw between Massa, Macri and Scioli|language= es|date= 22 November 2014|publisher= La Política Online|accessdate= 1 September 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150807202333/http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/85201/|archive-date= 7 August 2015|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Other minor parties, such as the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR), the [[Civic Coalition (Argentina)|Civic Coalition]] (CC) and some socialist parties, made a political coalition, the [[Broad Front UNEN]]. This coalition disbanded before the elections, and the UCR and CC made a coalition with the PRO, named [[Cambiemos]] ({{lang-en|Let's change}}). Macri supported [[Horacio Rodríguez Larreta]] against Gabriela Michetti in the PRO primary elections for mayor of Buenos Aires. Larreta won the primary and general elections, and Michetti was selected as Macri's vice-presidential candidate. [[María Eugenia Vidal]], Macri's deputy mayor, ran on the Cambiemos ticket for [[governor of Buenos Aires Province]], a populous province which was strategic to the elections. Macri and Massa negotiated a coalition against Kirchnerism, which would have seen Massa withdraw from the presidential race to run for governor of Buenos Aires on the Cambiemos ticket. Macri declined this proposal, kept Vidal as the party's candidate for governor, and Massa ran for president with his own party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1847774-macri-el-gladiador-del-cambio-que-suena-con-vencer-al-kirchnerismo|title=Macri: el gladiador del cambio que sueña con vencer al kirchnerismo|trans-title=Macri: the gladiator of change who dreams of defeating kirchnerism|language=es|first=Jaime|last=Rosemberg|date=22 November 2015|work=La Nación|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122215552/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1847774-macri-el-gladiador-del-cambio-que-suena-con-vencer-al-kirchnerismo|archive-date=22 November 2015}}</ref>

Massa finished third with 21&nbsp;percent of the vote, and the other two candidates contended for his voters. Scioli and Macri were polarized about the presidency of Cristina Kirchner; Scioli wanted to keep most Kirchnerite policies, and Macri wanted to change them.

Macri began his presidency with economic difficulties carried over from previous governments. The [[Central Bank of Argentina]]'s [[bank reserves|reserves]] were depleted; inflation was over 30&nbsp;percent, although the widely discredited [[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina]] (INDEC) provided a lower figure. The country had the highest tax rates in its history, but the [[government budget balance]] had an eight-percent deficit. There had been a [[sovereign default]] since 2001, and a conflict existed with [[hedge fund]]s; tight [[Argentine currency controls (2011–15)|currency controls]] had been in place since 2011. Since Argentina is a [[developing country]], a global drop in commodity prices reduced trade revenue.<ref name="hopes">{{cite news|url= https://www.ft.com/content/e4476904-beb6-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2|title= Macri raises hopes for Argentina's economic renewal|author= Benedict Mander and Daniel Politi|date= 20 January 2016|newspaper= Financial Times|accessdate= 18 February 2017|url-access= subscription|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170223044337/https://www.ft.com/content/e4476904-beb6-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2|archive-date= 23 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Prices for [[Public utility|public utilities]], such as electricity, gas and water, were fixed in 2002 by president [[Eduardo Duhalde]] during the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression]]. The Kirchners kept them fixed, and the state [[Subsidy|subsidized]] them to compensate for inflation, which rose by nearly 700&nbsp;percent during their government.<ref name="confrontational" /> Investment in the utility sectors decreased, and generation and distribution networks deteriorated.

In 2016, Minister [[Juan José Aranguren]] arranged the removal of state subsidies for electricity, gas and water, which caused a huge increase in prices for those utilities. The increases were met with protests in several cities.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://en.mercopress.com/2016/08/15/argentina-s-economy-a-battle-over-utility-bills-is-president-macri-s-first-big-crisis|title= Argentina's economy: a battle over utility bills is president Macri's first big crisis|date= 15 August 2016|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate= 18 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170224052547/http://en.mercopress.com/2016/08/15/argentina-s-economy-a-battle-over-utility-bills-is-president-macri-s-first-big-crisis|archive-date= 24 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Because mandatory public hearings had not been held on the price increases, these were annulled by the courts.

Seeking to increase energy production, Macri signed an investment deal for the [[Vaca Muerta]] shale deposit in [[Patagonia]]. Roughly the size of [[Belgium]], Vaca Muerta has the second-largest reserve of shale gas in the world. To finalise the deal, the unions negotiated flexibility in labour costs, which had been the main drawback to industrial development in the area. The [[Neuquén Province]] government pledged to improve roads and general infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.ft.com/content/031d1674-d74f-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title= Argentina strikes $15bn a year shale investment deal|first= Benedict|last= Mander|date= 10 January 2017|newspaper= Financial Times|accessdate= 18 February 2017|url-access= subscription|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170219081446/https://www.ft.com/content/031d1674-d74f-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|archive-date= 19 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Human rights===
Human rights organizations had aligned themselves with the governments of both Néstor and Cristina Kirchner, even in topics unrelated to human rights, and often worked as their spokesmen. They continued this role after 2015, when Macri defeated the Kirchnerite candidate in the presidential elections,<ref>Novaro, pp. 16-19</ref> which undermined the legitimacy of the organizations in Argentine society.<ref>Novaro, p. 21</ref> Macri maintained a distant relation with those organizations, and did not seek their support, but did not openly confront them. They kept their funding and the institutions under their control, and the trials of military personnel for crimes in the [[Dirty War]] (1974–1983) continued. Nevertheless, the organizations continued their opposition to Macri.<ref>Novaro, p. 26</ref> His cabinet was divided on an approach to take: whether to directly confront the organizations and remove their state financing, or to take an active role in their activities and replace their leaders with less politically motivated figures.<ref>Novaro, pp. 30-31</ref> The general policy, however, was to ignore the disputes and focus the activities of the government towards more pressing matters, such as the economy.<ref>Novaro, p. 29</ref>

The government modified the public holiday for the [[Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice]], which makes reference to the [[1976 Argentine coup d'état]], to allow it to be celebrated on a movable date. This ruling was met with huge criticism.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/sigue-polemica-feriado-24-marzo_0_H1XQcAEPe.html|title= Sigue la polémica por el feriado del 24 de marzo|trans-title= The controversy over the 24 March holiday continues|language= es|date= 24 January 2017|newspaper= Clarín|accessdate= 5 December 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181206002120/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/sigue-polemica-feriado-24-marzo_0_H1XQcAEPe.html|archive-date= 6 December 2018|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The ruling was reverted some days later, and the holiday was kept at the fixed date of 24 March.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/1980739-el-gobierno-confirmo-por-decreto-el-24-de-marzo-como-feriado-inamovible|title= El gobierno confirmó por decreto el 24 de marzo como feriado inamovible|trans-title= The government confirmed by decree 24 March as an inmovable date|language= es|date= 1 February 2017|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 5 December 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170519202120/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1980739-el-gobierno-confirmo-por-decreto-el-24-de-marzo-como-feriado-inamovible|archive-date= 19 May 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Social issues===
The [[Ni una menos|#NiUnaMenos]] movement, which advanced a feminist agenda in Argentina since 2015, stayed strong during the Macri presidency. Macri said during the [[2018 opening of regular sessions of the National Congress of Argentina|2018 opening of the National Congress]] that, although he was [[anti-abortion]], he wanted the Congress to have an [[abortion debate]] and discuss a bill for a new [[abortion law]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2113185-mauricio-macri-congreso-discurso-apertura-sesiones-legislativas-2018|title= Mauricio Macri en el Congreso: reviví el minuto a minuto de la Asamblea Legislativa|trans-title= Mauricio Macri in the Congress, relive the minute by minute of the Legislative assembly|language= es|date= 1 March 2018|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 28 February 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180618075513/https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2113185-mauricio-macri-congreso-discurso-apertura-sesiones-legislativas-2018|archive-date= 18 June 2018|df= dmy-all}}</ref> As of 2018, abortion was only legally allowed for rapes and cases that may threaten the mother's health. The feminist movement organized several demonstrations in the following months, in support of the [[voluntary termination of pregnancy]] abortion bill that was proposed in Congress. The proposal, however, became highly polarizing. The country has a strong conservative catholic population, particularly in the less-populated provinces, who rejected the bill. <!--The two sides campaigned with green and blue handkerchiefs, respectively.--> This polarization was unrelated to the political polarization of the country, and the legislators of both Cambiemos and the [[Justicialist Party]] (PJ) were divided on the vote.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-abortion/argentina-lower-house-passes-legal-abortion-bill-in-tight-vote-idUSKBN1JA1ZT|title= Argentina lower house passes legal abortion bill in tight vote|date= 14 June 2018|work= Reuters|accessdate= 10 July 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190412185812/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-abortion/argentina-lower-house-passes-legal-abortion-bill-in-tight-vote-idUSKBN1JA1ZT|archive-date= 12 April 2019|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The bill was approved by the chamber of deputies in June, but opposition became more organized after its approval<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/world/americas/argentina-abortion-explainer.html|title= What to Know About Argentina's Vote on Abortion|author= Megan Specia|date= 8 August 2018|newspaper= The New York Times|accessdate= 12 April 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190318072749/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/world/americas/argentina-abortion-explainer.html|archive-date= 18 March 2019|df= dmy-all}}</ref> and the Senate rejected the bill, by 38 to 31&nbsp;votes.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/argentina-senate-rejects-bill-legalise-abortion|title= Argentina senate rejects bill to legalise abortion|author= Uki Goñi|date= 9 August 2018|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 23 April 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190426061822/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/argentina-senate-rejects-bill-legalise-abortion|archive-date= 26 April 2019|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Macri also shifted Argentina's relations with the United States. During a visit in 2016, president [[Barack Obama]] praised him: "I'm impressed because he has moved rapidly on so many of the reforms that he promised, to create more sustainable and inclusive economic growth, to reconnect Argentina with the global economy and the world community". Obama announced that the US would declassify its military and intelligence records of the 1970s [[Dirty War]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-argentina-idUSKCN0WP0B3|title= Obama praises Argentina's 'man in a hurry' Macri for reforms|author= Jeff Mason and Richard Lough|date= 24 March 2016|work= Reuters|accessdate= 16 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170210233923/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-argentina-idUSKCN0WP0B3|archive-date= 10 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Foreign Minister [[Susana Malcorra]] supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 US presidential election]], which was won by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump]].

Macri maintained the Argentine claim in the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]]. However, he took a less-confrontational stance towards the United Kingdom and allowed more flights between Argentina and the islands. Relations between Argentina and the UK improved greatly, but both Argentine and the United Kingdom maintain their respective claim on the islands.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/argentine-president-mentions-falklands-in-brief-chat-with-theres/|title= Argentine president mentions Falklands in brief chat with Theresa May|date= 21 September 2016|newspaper= The Telegraph|accessdate= 16 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/21/argentine-president-mentions-falklands-in-brief-chat-with-theres/|archive-date= 17 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

Macri changed Argentina's position on [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|conflicts in the Middle East]]. During Macri's first week in office, he voided the [[memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran]], which would have established a joint investigation of the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]], a terrorist attack on a Jewish organization for which Argentina had blamed [[Hezbollah]] and Iran. The memorandum had been ruled unconstitutional by the judiciary, a ruling which was appealed during Kirchner's presidency.

===Midterm elections===
[[File:Macrivotom1.jpg|thumb|Mauricio Macri during the electoral campaign of 2017]]
{{main|2017 Argentine legislative election}}
The [[2017 Argentine legislative election]] renewed a third of the seats in the Senate and half in the chamber of deputies.<ref name="midterm">{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41719074|title= Argentina election: Macri wins crucial mid-term vote|date= 23 October 2017|publisher= BBC|accessdate= 27 March 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190329191233/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41719074|archive-date= 29 March 2019|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The election was considered a referendum on the presidency of Macri up to that point. Kirchner, leader of the opposition, ran for senator for the populous Buenos Aires province. She left the PJ to avoid the primary elections and created a new party, [[Citizen's Unity]]. [[Esteban Bullrich]], minister of education, was the candidate of Cambiemos in the district. Kirchner and Bullrich had a close tie in the primary election, and Kirchner prevailed by just 0.21&nbsp;percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/cristina-kirchner-gano-en-las-paso-de-la-provincia-de-buenos-aires-por-021-por-ciento-nid2057743|title= Cristina Kirchner ganó por 0,21% en las PASO de la provincia de Buenos Aires|trans-title= Cristina Kirchner won by 0.21&nbsp;percent in the Buenos Aires province PASO|language= es|author= María José Lucesole|date= 29 August 2017|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate=27 March 2019}}</ref>

The electoral campaign, however, was largely ignored, as the media was focused on the ongoing controversy over the disappearance of Santiago Maldonado ([[Mauricio Macri#Death of Santiago Maldonado|see below]]). Kirchner used the case in her political campaign, stating that Maldonado was the victim of a [[forced disappearance]], similar to those of the Dirty War.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41066685|title= Where is Santiago Maldonado?

Macri's professional experience began at SIDECO Americana, a construction company which was part of his father's Socma Group (Sociedad Macri) [[holding company]], where he worked for three years as a junior analyst and became a senior analyst. In 1984, he worked in the credit department of [[Citibank]] Argentina in Buenos Aires. Macri joined Socma Group the same year, and became its general manager in 1985. In 1992, he became vice president of [[Sevel Argentina]] (then manufacturing [[Fiat]] and [[Peugeot]] automobiles under licence in Argentina as part of Socma), and became president two years later.<ref name="CV"/>

In 1991, Macri was kidnapped for 12 days by officers of the [[Policía Federal Argentina|Argentine Federal Police]]. Kept in a small room with a [[chemical toilet]] and a hole in the roof to receive food, he was freed when his family reportedly paid a multimillion-dollar ransom.<ref>

His first wife was Ivonne Bordeu, daughter of race-car driver [[Juan Manuel Bordeu]]. They had three sons: Agustina, Jimena and Francisco. After they divorced, Macri married model Isabel Menditeguy in 1994; Franco requested a [[prenuptial agreement]]. Although the marriage reached a crisis when Macri became chairman of Boca Juniors, they did not divorce until 2005. He began a romance with María Laura Groba which did not lead to marriage.

===<span id="Spy scandal"></span>Wiretapping case===
Sergio Burstein was the leader of a group of people whose relatives died in the AMIA bombing. Macri was charged in a 2010 [[Buenos Aires wiretapping case|wiretapping case]], suspected of spying on Burstein and his brother-in-law Néstor Daniel Leonardo. Macri denied the charges. Judge Norberto Oyarbide indicted him, and Federal Chamber members Eduardo Farah, [[Eduardo Freiler]] and Jorge Ballestero confirmed the indictment. It was suspected at the time that Macri had organized a clandestine spy network with the aid of [[Jorge Alberto Palacios]] and Ciro James. The case was transferred to judge [[Sebastián Casanello]], who ordered further investigation. It was learned that Macri had little knowledge about Palacios' daily activities and his minister, Mariano Narodowski, had appointed James. Franco Macri, the president's father, admitted to hiring private agencies to spy on Daniel Leonardo.<ref name="camara">{{cite news|url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1909053-la-camara-confirmo-el-cierre-de-la-causa-contra-macri-por-las-escuchas|title= La Cámara confirmó el cierre de la causa contra Macri por las escuchas|trans-title= The chamber confirmed the closure of the case against Macri about wiretapping|language= es|author= Paz Rodríguez Niell|date= 15 June 2016|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 7 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170208040655/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1909053-la-camara-confirmo-el-cierre-de-la-causa-contra-macri-por-las-escuchas|archive-date= 8 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2016, the [[Panama Papers]] were leaked, comprising 11.5&nbsp;million documents detailing offshore entities owned by people from many countries. Macri was listed as a director of Fleg Trading from 1998 to 2009. He did not declare his involvement in 2007, when he became mayor, or in 2015, when he became president. Prosecutor Federico Delgado asked the judiciary to determine if Macri "maliciously failed to complete his tax declaration". Macri argued that he did not report his involvement because he was not a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] and did not receive money from it.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/argentina-president-maurio-macri-fights-back-after-panama-papers-reveal-offshore-links|title= Argentina's president Mauricio Macri fights back after Panama Papers reveal offshore links|first= Jonathan|last= Watts|date= 8 April 2016|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate= 9 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075827/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/argentina-president-maurio-macri-fights-back-after-panama-papers-reveal-offshore-links|archive-date= 11 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The company was established by his father to run a failed Brazilian business.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-argentina-idUSKCN0X1202|title= Argentina's Macri denies wrongdoing at 'Panama Papers' offshore firm|first= Sarah|last= Marsh|date= 4 April 2016|work= Reuters|accessdate= 9 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170226132535/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-argentina-idUSKCN0X1202|archive-date= 26 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Macri owns other foreign accounts with properly-disclosed transactions,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/04/secret-panamapapers-files-who-did-what/82599656/|title= Panama Papers: Who's accused of what|first= Kim|last= Hjelmgaard|date= 4 April 2016|newspaper= USA Today|accessdate= 9 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170210074328/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/04/04/secret-panamapapers-files-who-did-what/82599656/|archive-date= 10 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> and said that he would file a judicial "declaration of certainty" to affirm his statements.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35991155|title= Panama Papers: Argentina President Macri to go before judge|date= 8 April 2016|publisher= BBC|accessdate= 9 February 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170211104847/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35991155|archive-date= 11 February 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> A similar company, Kagemusha, was discovered several months later.

On 20 September 2017, civil judge Andrés Fraga determined that, in Fleg Trading Ltd,<!-- of the Bahamas,--> Mauricio Macri accepted the position of director for the sole and only effect of designating a replacement and resigning, and that in Kagemusha he did not even tacitly accept the position of director for which he was appointed by Franco Macri.

The [[Benetton Group]] has territories at the [[Chubut Province]], and the [[Mapuche]] indigenous people claim that those territories belonged to them. Facundo Jones Huala, from the [[Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche]] group,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2050635-cristina-kirchner-pidio-la-aparicion-con-vida-de-santiago-maldonado-y-responsabilizo-a-gendarmeria|title= Cristina Kirchner pidió la aparición con vida de Santiago Maldonado y responsabilizó a Gendarmería|trans-title= Cristina Kirchner asked for Santiago Maldonado to be returned alive and blamed the gendarmerie|language= es|date= 6 August 2018|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 30 October 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190213071216/https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2050635-cristina-kirchner-pidio-la-aparicion-con-vida-de-santiago-maldonado-y-responsabilizo-a-gendarmeria|archive-date= 13 February 2019|df= dmy-all}}</ref> was jailed because of violent protests, and a group of eight people organized a [[picketing]] protest at the [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|National Route 40]], advocating for his liberation. The road was completely blocked by stones, trees and fire. Judge Guido Otranto instructed the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]] (GNA) to clear the blockade and disperse the protesters. The protesters reacted violently, then escaped from the GNA. Some of them swam across the nearby [[Chubut River]] and others hid in the adjacent forest.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.clarin.com/politica/otranto-sigue-frente-causa-desalojo_0_rksganrjZ.html|title= A pesar de la recusación, Otranto sigue al frente de la causa por el desalojo de la ruta 40|trans-title= Despite the recusal, Otranto is still in charge of the case over the liberation of the Route 40|language= es|author= Claudio Andrade|date= 24 September 2017|newspaper= Clarín|accessdate= 20 September 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181215123525/https://www.clarin.com/politica/otranto-sigue-frente-causa-desalojo_0_rksganrjZ.html|archive-date= 15 December 2018|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

One of those protesters was Santiago Maldonado, and his whereabouts were unknown after the incident. Kirchnerist and human-rights organizations considered that Maldonado was a victim of a [[forced disappearance]], and posited that he could be the first victim of a wider plan of political repression.<ref>Novaro, p. 16</ref> Other theories were proposed during the investigation: that he escaped to Chile, that he was hiding, or that he had been murdered some days before in an unrelated crime and was never in the protest at all (the protesters wore hoods). It was also proposed that he could have drowned, but the Mapuches held control of the area and impeded access by the GNA. When the GNA did enter the area, the corpse was found in the river.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/caso-santiago-maldonado-cuerpo-identificacion-nid2073249|title= Sergio Maldonado: "Estamos convencidos de que es Santiago"|trans-title= Sergio Maldonado: "We are sure it's Santiago"|language= es|date= 20 October 2017|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate= 27 March 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190327195124/https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/caso-santiago-maldonado-cuerpo-identificacion-nid2073249|archive-date= 27 March 2019|df= dmy-all}}</ref> An autopsy confirmed his identity, that the body had no signs of blows or injuries, and that he died by asphyxia and hypothermia.
