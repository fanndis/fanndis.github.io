The '''DC Extended Universe''' ('''DCEU''') is an American [[multimedia franchise]] and [[shared universe]] centering on a series of [[superhero film]]s, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011, and in that time, Warner Bros has distributed eight films, with several others in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.

The films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]], [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], and [[Zachary Levi]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has loosely connected story-lines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020; ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' in 2021; ''The Flash'' and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022; ''Shazam! Fury of the Gods'' in 2023; and ''Black Adam'' on an undecided date. Additionally, the DCEU will expand to [[streaming television]] on [[HBO Max]] with ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'', a miniseries-format [[director's cut]] of ''Justice League'', in 2021, and ''Peacemaker'' on an unannounced date.

== Etymology ==
Upon announcement of the film series, the universe was commonly called the "DC Cinematic Universe" by fans and the media, in keeping with the naming convention of the already established [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name="DCMarvelForbes" /><ref name="DCCUYahoo" /><ref name="DCCU-EW" /> Keith Staskiewicz, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', jokingly coined the term "DC Extended Universe™" in an article about ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' on July 1, 2015.<ref name="DCEU-EW" /><ref name="DCEU-SR" /> This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years.<ref name="TheyAreLegend" /><ref name="BvSEmpireCover" /> According to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term was not used internally and they did not consider it official.<ref name="DCEU-SR" /> In 2016, as part of ''DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League'', both Geoff Johns and [[Kevin Smith]] referred to the franchise's name as being the "Justice League Universe".<ref name="JLU-SR" /> During the [[DC Films]] panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018, a video banner displayed the words "Welcome to the Worlds of DC", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the "Worlds of DC".<ref name="WoDC-SR" /><ref name="WoDCForbes" /> However, in March 2020, [[Jim Lee]] called the franchise, the DC Extended Universe at [[C2E2]].<ref name="LeeDCEU" /> The franchise was officially titled DC Extended Universe when the WarnerMedia streaming service [[HBO Max]] launched the following May.<ref name="HBOMaxDCEU" />

== Development ==
In 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001–2002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name="BvSNewsweek" /> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J. J. Abrams]] submitted another draft for ''Superman: Flyby''.<ref name="DevelopmentHell" /><ref name="BalePetersenMTV" /> In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and [[Kieran Mulroney]] to write a script for a ''[[Justice League]]'' film.<ref name="JusticeVariety2007" /> [[Christian Bale]], who starred as Batman in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), was not approached to reprise the role,<ref name="BaleJusticeLeague" /> nor was [[Brandon Routh]], who starred as Superman in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006).<ref name="RouthJusticeLeague" /> [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was hired to direct the film,<ref name="MillerVariety" /> reportedly titled ''Justice League Mortal'',<ref name="JLMortalVariety" /> with [[Armie Hammer]] cast as Batman, [[D. J. Cotrona]] as Superman, [[Adam Brody]] as Flash, [[Santiago Cabrera]] as Aquaman, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Green Lantern, [[Megan Gale]] as Wonder Woman, [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jay Baruchel]] as [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref name="GaleWonderWoman" /> The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure [[tax breaks]] for filming in Australia, as well as the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] preventing progress on the script.<ref name="JusticeLeagueCancelled" />

In 2013, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' franchise]], ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films.<ref name="ManOfSteelEW" /> The film contained references to other characters in the [[DC Universe]], so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe.<ref name="MoSBleedingCool" /><ref name="ManofSteelSR" /> Days before ''Man of Steel''{{'}}s release in June, it was reported that director [[Zack Snyder]] and screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.<ref name="GoyerMoSSequel" /> In July, at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, establishing the shared universe.<ref name="LATimesCC2013" /><ref name="EWCC2013" /> In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.<ref name="2014Slate" /> 

[[File:Geoff Johns by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Geoff Johns has served in various positions in DC Films and the DCEU.]]
While the rival [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) includes television productions, DC's crossover series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, known as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name="Arrowverse" /> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, "We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach."<ref name="GoeffJonesBuzzFeed" /> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, "We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on."<ref name="SilvermanTHR" />

In May 2016, following criticism of ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', Warner Bros. established a [[DC Films]] division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads,<ref name="GeoffJohnsVulture" /> which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise.<ref name="Shakeup" /><ref name="WarnerBrosResponse" /> DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] and Berg reported to Silverman.<ref name="Shakeup" /> [[Charles Roven]] was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's ''Batman Begins'', to an administrative executive producer role.<ref name="RovenFallout" /> In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and [[Toby Emmerich]] was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place.<ref name="EmmerichCCO" /> By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich.<ref name="GreenLanternWriters" /> Following the financial and critical success of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters.<ref name="GeoffJohnsTheWrap" /> As a result of [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']]'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with [[Roy Lee]].<ref name="Shakeup2" /><ref name="HamadaVariety" /> DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them."<ref name="RethinkVulture" />

In January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.<ref name="HamadaVariety" /> The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.<ref name="ChantalNongVP" /> The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.<ref name="HamadaVariety" /> However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018. He created a production company, Mad Ghost Productions, to have a greater hands-on role in various DC media as a writer and producer.<ref name="GeoffJohnsExit" /> After the financial success of ''Aquaman'', Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] said the upcoming slate of DC films would be focused on individual character stories instead of interconnectivity.<ref name="TsujiharaLATimes" />

==== Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) ====
{{Main|Zack Snyder's Justice League}} {{further|#Zack Snyder's Justice League}}
The divisive reaction towards the final highlighted cut of ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'', with Zack Snyder leaving directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Joss Whedon, has led to an argument comparing the situation to the one experienced by the film ''[[Superman II]]''. Both ''Justice League'' and ''Superman II'' feature a director that was replaced, for different reasons, before completion of a film, which led to a second director coming in and making substantial changes to the tone of each film. Although the reasoning behind each director's departure differs, [[Richard Donner]] was able to complete his [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|''Superman II'' cut]] in 2005.<ref name="SnyderCutDonner" /> In the belief that Snyder had shot enough material for a finished film, a campaign for a "Snyder Cut" was started to allow Snyder to receive a similar treatment to Donner. Arguments are made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films than the actual theatrical cut, which Snyder has refused to see. Warner Bros. initially remained silent regarding any intention of making a "Snyder Cut".<ref name="SnyderCutMovement" />

In March 2019, Snyder confirmed his original cut does exist, and stated that it is up to Warner Bros. to release it.<ref name="SnyderCutSR" /> Despite this, in November, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Warner Bros. was unlikely to release Snyder's version of ''Justice League'' in theaters or on [[HBO Max]], calling it a "pipe dream".<ref name="SnyderCutVariety" /> In December, however, Snyder posted a photo in his [[Vero (app)|Vero]] account, which showed boxes with tapes labeled "Z.S. J.L Director's cut", and with the caption "Is it real? Does it exist? Of course it does."<ref name="SnyderCutSC" /> On May 20, 2020, Snyder officially announced that [[HBO Max]] will be releasing his cut of ''Justice League'' on their service in 2021.<ref name="HBOMaxZSJL" />

{{See|List of DC Multiverse worlds}}
In October 2014, Johns explained that DC's approach to their films and television series would be different to [[Marvel Studios]]' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|cinematic universe]], stating that their film universe and TV universes would be kept separate within a [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] to allow "everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world."<ref name="TVMultiverse" /> [[Geoff Johns]] and Jon Berg were appointed by the studio to co-run the [[DC Films]] division and oversee creative decisions, production and [[story arc]]s in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the films. Johns left his position in June 2018 to start his own studio where he will take on a greater hands-on role with film media as a producer and screenwriter. However, he remained with the studio as a co-chairman. Berg was replaced by [[Walter Hamada]] as the president of DC Films in January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/warner-bros-taps-walter-hamada-to-oversee-dc-films-production-exclusive-1202652878/amp/|title=Warner Bros.

=== Arrowverse ===
The DC Extended Universe was retroactively established to have connections to [[The CW]]'s [[Arrowverse]] [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#Arrowverse|continuity]] via the concept of a [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]], during [[Arrow (season 8)#ep168|Part 4]] of the "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]" crossover. [[Ezra Miller]] reprised their role as Barry Allen in a cameo appearance alongside [[Grant Gustin]]'s [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|version of the same character]]. During their conversation, Miller's Barry Allen gets the idea to call himself "[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]" from his alternate self and even mentions "[[Cyborg (comics)|Victor]]".<ref name="CoIE" /> However, despite their cameo, the episode does not confirm the designated Earth for the DCEU characters.<ref name="CoIE2" /><ref name="CoIE3" />

Miller's cameo opened up more possibilities for crossovers between the DC films and Arrowverse. Hamada revealed prior to "[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]", DC had been structured in a way that the television division had to clear the use of characters with the film division. Now, the company could "really lean into this idea of [the multiverse] and acknowledge the fact there can be a Flash on TV and one in the movies, and you don't have to pick one or the other, and they both exist in this multiverse."<ref name="EWMultiverse101" /> Arrowverse creator and executive producer [[Greg Berlanti]] agreed, feeling that "moving forward, there’s more opportunity to do more things like this",<ref name="THRMultiverse101" /> and was open to more film characters appearing in the Arrowverse.<ref name="EWMultiverse101" /> In September of 2020, the TV universe was rebranded as [[Arrowverse #Name|The CWverse]] following the consolidation of various alternate realities in various DC Television productions into one continuity with the "Crisis" episode.<ref name"CWverse_ScreenRant">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/arrowverse-new-name-cwverse-cw-superheros-trailer/|work=Screen Rant|title=The CW Is Attempting To Rename Arrowverse Now That Arrow Is Over|author=Gillespie, Daniel|date=September 1, 2020|accessdate=November 20, 2020}}</ref>

=== Other DC films ===
In August 2020, Hamada revealed that ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'' (2019) and ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'' (2022) existed on separate earths from the DCEU, which was centered on the Justice League formed by Wonder Woman, Flash, and Aquaman, as portrayed by Gadot, Miller, and Momoa, respectively.<ref name="TheBatmanSeparate" />

=== Timeline ===
In the DCEU, most events of the film never explicitly make their exact years known.<ref name="DCFilmsTimeline1" /> ''Man of Steel'' took place after the events of ''Wonder Woman'' and ''Wonder Woman 1984'', which are set in 1918 and 1984, respectively. The events of ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' occur 18 months after the events of ''Man of Steel'', which follows the consequences and the emergence of aliens and metahumans such as [[Superman]].<ref name="BvS18MoS" /> As the film was originally scheduled to release in 2015, it can be assumed to take place in that year, with Lex Luthor's party being dated November 1st on the invitation, placing ''Man of Steel'' in April/March 2013. The film concludes with the death of Superman, which was emphasized in the following ensemble films of ''Suicide Squad'' and ''Justice League''. ''Suicide Squad'' occurred shortly after ''Batman v Superman''. Sometime later, the events of ''Justice League'' happened which feature Superman's resurrection and the subsequent formation of the [[Justice League]]. It was followed by ''Aquaman'', which Jason Momoa confirmed took place right after ''Zack Snyder's Justice League.''<ref name="MomoaAquamanZSJL" /> ''Aquaman'' was followed  by ''Shazam!'', which occurred on the Christmas season of 2018.<ref name="DCFilmsTimeline2" /> Afterwards, the events of ''Birds of Prey'' happened in 2020,<ref name="BirdsOfPreyTimeline"/> followed by ''The Suicide Squad'', confirmed to take place in 2021.<ref name="TheSuicideSquadTimeline"/>
