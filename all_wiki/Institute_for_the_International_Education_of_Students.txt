== History ==

IES Abroad offered its first program in September 1950, when Paul Koutny, an [[Austrians|Austrian]] student living in the [[United States|U.S.]] on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholarship, brought American students to live and study in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] for a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iesabroad.org/study-abroad/about/history |title=History &#124; IES Abroad}}</ref>  Two of the students from the original program, newlyweds Clarence and Alberta Giese, returned after the program inspired to help other students study abroad. From their [[Chicago]] home, they worked with Koutny to recruit more students and send them abroad.<ref>Salts, Josh (20 Jan 2011).

William Louis Gaines, the son of a railroad worker who served in World War II and marched with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], served as president of IES from 1974 until his 1992 retirement "through some of its most challenging years".<ref>Yates, Jon, [https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-02-11-0502110193-story.html "William Louis Gaines" (obituary)], ''Chicago Tribune'', February 11, 2005.

IES Abroad developed a Model Assessment Practice <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iesabroad.org/study-abroad/advisors-faculty/ies-abroad-map |title=MAP Series &#124; IES Abroad}}</ref> in 1999 as a framework for the design, development, and evaluation of programs of study abroad.  This program formed the basis for the standards of the [[Forum on education abroad|Forum on Education Abroad]] adopted by the field.<ref>Gillespie, Joan et al., "[https://books.google.com/books?id=N4ifF9FfwcEC&pg=PA457&lpg=PA457&dq=%22ies+abroad%22&source=bl&ots=pVhUnFn7Z3&sig=MLDKhntUq0Kvv8mPcwY5qW-g8Bg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=h7AFUoiXLIjUyQHM_oCwAQ&ved=0CFsQ6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&q=%22ies%20abroad%22&f=false Holistic Student Learning and Development Abroad: The IES 3-D Program Model]," ''The Handbook of Practice and Research in Study Abroad'' at 457 (2009).</ref>  In 2010, IES Abroad was the first third-party provider to receive the [[Forum on education abroad|Forum on Education Abroad]]'s Category 2b Quality Improvement Designation, which involves independent reviewers using evaluation systems to make program improvements.
