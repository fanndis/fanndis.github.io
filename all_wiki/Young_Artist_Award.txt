=== Categories ===
The various Young Artist Awards categories have evolved extensively since the first awards were presented.  Originally beginning with only 11 competitive categories in 1979, the first categories included "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Motion Picture", "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a TV Series or Special", "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Daytime TV Series", and "Best Male and Female Juvenile Recording Artist", as well as competitive categories honoring studios and networks for "[[family friendly]]" films and television programming.<ref name="Young Artist Awards 1" />

Over time, the competitive categories have been expanded to include "Best Young Actor and Actress in an International Feature Film", "Best Young Actor and Actress in a Short Film", "Best Young Supporting Actor and Actress in Film", "Best Young Ensemble Cast", "Best Young Recurring Actor and Actress in a TV Series", and "Best Young Guest-starring Actor and Actress in a TV Series", with many of the categories being split to acknowledge young artists age 10 and under in their own separate categories.<ref name="Young Artist Awards 9">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/noms32.html |title=32nd Annual Young Artist Awards |accessdate=2011-04-06 |work=YoungArtistAwards.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808150433/http://www.youngartistawards.org/noms32.html |archive-date=2013-08-08 }}</ref>  In addition to its well-known film and television awards, the association has also recognized the achievements of youth in other fields of the performing arts over the years, including theater, dance, commercials, journalism, radio and stand-up comedy.<ref name="Young Artist Awards 3" /><ref name="Young Artist Awards 5">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms6.htm|title=6th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref><ref name="Young Artist Awards 6">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms10.htm|title=10th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716012647/http://youngartistawards.org/pastnoms10.htm|archive-date=2015-07-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Special Awards ===
While many of the acting categories have been expanded over time, some early competitive categories such as "Best Juvenile Recording Artist", "Best Family Motion Picture" and "Best Family TV Series" have been phased out over the years, with accolades for those achievements now being bestowed in the form of special "Honorary" awards.<ref name="Young Artist Awards 9" />

The foundation's most notable annual honorary awards include the "Jackie Coogan Award", often presented to film studios, producers or directors for their "Outstanding Contribution To Youth Through Entertainment", and the "Former Child Star Award", presented as the foundation's "Lifetime Achievement Award" honoring former child stars for their achievements.<ref name="Young Artist Awards 4">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms5.htm|title=5th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403132035/http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms5.htm|archive-date=2011-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Variety">{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940262?refCatId=13|title=Variety – Meyerink gets life kudos|accessdate=2011-04-04|work=Variety.com|first=Maressa|last=Brown|date=2006-03-23}}</ref>
