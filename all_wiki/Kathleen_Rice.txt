Rice graduated from [[Garden City High School (New York)|Garden City High School]]. She received a B.A. degree from the [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University]] in 1987 and a J.D. degree from the [[Touro Law Center]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Nassau County Democrats. nassaucountydems.com|url=http://nassaucountydems.com/officeholder/kathleen-rice|title=Kathleen Rice|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193237/http://nassaucountydems.com/officeholder/kathleen-rice|archive-date=October 29, 2013|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

Rice began her career as an assistant district attorney in the [[Brooklyn|Kings County]] District Attorney's Office, under District Attorney [[Charles Hynes]] in 1992. She prosecuted cases involving burglaries, robberies and sexual assaults and was the first member of her class to be promoted to the homicide bureau.<ref name="Touro">{{cite web|publisher=Touro Law Center|url=https://www.tourolaw.edu/alumni/alumniDetail.aspx?id=57|title=Alumni of the Month Program: Kathleen Rice|date=May 2008|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

==Nassau County District Attorney==
Rice was elected Nassau County District Attorney in 2005, winning by 7,500 votes to become the first female to hold the position.

Rice was the first serious opponent that Dillon had faced since his first run in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=362305|title=Our Campaigns - Nassau County District Attorney Race - Nov 08, 2005|publisher=}}</ref>

Rice was re-elected in 2009 and 2013.

;Drunken and drugged driving

In 2006, Rice, the "state's toughest DWI prosecutor,"<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nassau-county-district-attorney-rice-joins-fight-leandra-law-article-1.414538|title=Nassau County District Attorney Rice joins fight for 'Leandra's Law'|date=November 14, 2009}}</ref> declared her first major policy initiative to be an "assault on the drunk driving epidemic."

;Reform efforts

In September 2011, Rice's office arrested seven students after uncovering an [[SAT]] cheating ring on Long Island.<ref>{{cite web|work=ABC News|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/sat-cheating-ring-busted-york-students-arrested/story?id=14617306|title=SAT Cheating Ring Busted, Seven Students Arrested|date=September 27, 2011}}</ref> When this case led to the discovery of a wider-spread cheating scandal, Rice worked with the [[College Board]], who administers the test, to update security standards to halt cheating in the future. This effort sparked other test administrators, like that which gives the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], to update their standards as well.<ref>{{cite web|work=ABC News|url=https://abcnews.go.com/News/BacktoSchool/sat-security-ny-cheating-ring/story?id=16012528|title=New SAT Security Changes After N.Y.

In 2007, Rice's office, Nassau County and [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead]] police led a counter-assault on Terrace Avenue, a major drug haven and crime-ridden street in [[Long Island]]'s Hempstead Village. Through a combination of zero-tolerance enforcement for repeat and violent offenders, and social-service based jail diversion for nonviolent and first time offenders, crime has been reduced in the area.<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/18/nyregion/long-island/18terraceli.html?_r=0|title=Street Known for Drug Crime Is Getting Clean|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref>

Rice was chosen by Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] to be a member of the Moreland Commission on Utility Storm Preparation and Response, a panel tasked with investigating the failures of the [[Long Island Power Authority]] (LIPA) following Hurricane Sandy of October 2012. The panel recommended that LIPA be replaced by a private, investor-owned company and that the Public Service Commission, which has regulation authority, be given more power to penalize and fine poor-performing utility companies.

'''Questions on Rice's early prosecution cases'''

The Kings County district attorney's prosecution of Antowine Butts for double homicide imploded and ended in an acquittal in 2000, but not before Butts spent two years in a Rikers Island jail cell. After the case unraveled, Butts alleged that he was a victim of prosecutorial misconduct in a civil rights lawsuit that was settled with New York City.

Among those named in that suit: Kathleen Rice, the architect of the case against Butts.
Despite that high profile, Rice has largely escaped attention â€” including during the current campaign â€” for starting her career in an office in which prosecutors are alleged to have put some innocent people behind bars with coerced confessions, bogus witness statements, coached lineup identifications and other tactics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.newsday.com/projects/long-island/questions-rices-early-prosecution-cases/|title=Questions on Rice's early prosecution cases - Newsday|work=Newsday}}</ref>

In April 2013, Rice announced the arrest of 18 members of the "Rollin' 60's" gang, an "ultra-violent" subset of the Crips. Rice charged these defendants with crimes ranging from attempted murder of a police officer, to assault and robbery, to gun and drug sales.<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/nassau-officials-ultra-violent-gang-members-arrested-1.5096256|title=Nassau officials: 'Ultra-violent' gang members arrested|date=April 18, 2013}}</ref>

In 2010, Rice ordered the review of a 1987 case in which Arnold Friedman and his son, Jesse, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing young boys in their Great Neck, Long Island home.
