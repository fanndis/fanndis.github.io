He was returned to the House of Commons in 2015 with an increased majority of 20,761.

Smith was strongly critical of Theresa May's cabinet's behaviour after the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 election]], saying the government should have made clear that it would "inevitably" have to accept a [[Brexit|softer Brexit]].<ref name="laura"/> He accused ministers of trying to destabilise and undermine May.<ref name="laura">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47768884|title=Chief whip attacks cabinet's Brexit strategy|date=1 April 2019|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>

==Secretary of State for Northern Ireland==

Smith was made [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] when [[Boris Johnson]] assumed the role of Prime Minister. Under his tenure devolved power-sharing was restored in January 2020. Smith was sacked as Northern Ireland Secretary in Johnson's post-Brexit reshuffle. He had lasted 204 days in the role.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51487695|title=Julian Smith sacked as NI Secretary by Boris Johnson|date=13 February 2020|accessdate=13 February 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref>

The decision to dismiss Smith as Northern Ireland Secretary was criticised by a number of prominent political figures in [[Northern Ireland]], including SDLP leader [[Colum Eastwood]] who described the move as showing "dangerous indifference" by the [[Boris Johnson|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51487695|title=Julian Smith sacked as NI Secretary by Boris Johnson|website=BBC News|date=13 February 2020|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> Smith had been widely seen as instrumental in securing a cross-party deal to restore the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], after three years without a devolved government in [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cabinet-s-women-hit-hardest-in-boris-johnson-s-first-reshuffle-f3snfp6wd|title=Boris Johnson fires Julian Smith, minister who secured Stormont deal|author1=Elliott, Francis|author2=Swinford, Steven|newspaper=The Times|date=13 February 2020|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> Tributes to Smith's tenure as Northern Ireland Secretary were paid by [[First Minister of Northern Ireland|NI First Minister]] [[Arlene Foster]] and [[Taoiseach]] [[Leo Varadkar]]. Both praised him for his role in ending the political deadlock in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/julian-smith-sacked-from-northern-ireland-post-in-boris-johnsons-cabinet-reshuffle-38953001.html|title=Julian Smith sacked from Northern Ireland post in Boris Johnson's Cabinet reshuffle|date=13 February 2020|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|author=Edwards, Mark|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |author-link=Leo Varadkar |user= LeoVaradkar |number=1227917665697697793 |date=13 February 2020 |title=In 8 months as Secretary of State, Julian you helped to restore powersharing in Stormont, secured an agreement with us to avoid a hard border, plus marriage equality.

Many political commentators expressed their surprise at Smith's dismissal, given his perceived success during his time as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Some suggested that Smith's testimony to the [[Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee]] in October 2019, in which he described a potential [[no-deal Brexit]] as being "a very, very bad idea for Northern Ireland",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/uk-regions/northern-ireland/news/107480/julian-smith-breaks-ranks-boris-johnson-brand-no|title=Julian Smith breaks ranks with Boris Johnson to brand no-deal Brexit 'very bad' for Northern Ireland|date=23 October 2019|website=PoliticsHome|author=Mairs, Nicholas|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> had influenced the decision to remove him from his position.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-news-live-cabinet-reshuffle-brexit-gove-rees-mogg-latest-today-a9332876.html|title=Boris Johnson news – live: PM axes Tory minister who helped secure Stormont deal, as fresh questions raised over £15,000 Caribbean holiday|author=Forrest, Adam|date=13 February 2020|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> [[Stephen Bush]], political editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', speculated that the consequence of Johnson's removal of Smith would be the destabilisation of the new power-sharing agreement and increased difficulty in negotiating the details of the "[[Brexit and the Irish border|New Protocol]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/julian-smith-northern-ireland-secretary-sacked-cabinet-reshuffle-boris-johnson-most-important|title=Boris Johnson has already made the most important sacking of today's reshuffle|date=13 February 2020|author=Bush, Stephen|newspaper=New Statesman|accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref>

== Security ==
In October 2013 ''[[The Guardian]]'' alleged that Smith may have breached national security by posting an image on his website of himself alongside military personnel.<ref name="guard"/> Smith had previously asked questions in Parliament about whether ''The Guardian''{{'}}s handling of intelligence material leaked by [[Edward Snowden]] had breached national security. He reported the newspaper to the police.<ref name="guard">{{cite news|title=Did Conservative MP Julian Smith endanger national security?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/conservative-mp-julian-smith-national-security-nsa-leaks|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=25 October 2013}}</ref> Smith argued the newspaper should be investigated as it had "endangered" British security personnel by publishing leaked information.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Julian|title=Julian Smith MP: The Guardian's impact on national security|url=https://www.politicshome.com/foreign-and-defence/articles/opinion/julian-smith-mp-guardian%E2%80%99s-impact-national-security|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=Politics Home|date=22 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015223/https://www.politicshome.com/foreign-and-defence/articles/opinion/julian-smith-mp-guardian%E2%80%99s-impact-national-security|archivedate=15 April 2015}}</ref>

== Pairing allegations ==
On 19 July 2018, Smith was reported to be resisting calls to resign his position as [[Chief Whip|Government Chief Whip]], following allegations that he had instructed five [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]] to break "pairing" agreements in an important parliamentary vote the previous day. Only one MP, Conservative party chairman [[Brandon Lewis]], complied with the instruction. Subsequent reports indicated that Smith had given similar instructions to five MPs, but Lewis had been the only one willing to break what one commentator described later as "a centuries old ‘code of honour’". Before it became known that the affair had involved approaches by Smith to more than one MP, the Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] backed Lewis by stating that "The breaking of the pair was done in error. It wasn't good enough and will not be repeated."<ref name=JulSmithStandard19July2018>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tory-chief-whip-julian-smith-urged-to-quit-over-pairing-deal-error-a3891301.html|title=Tory chief whip Julian Smith urged to quit over pairing deal 'error'|author1=Joe Murphy|author2=Nicholas Cecil |publisher=[[Evening Standard]], London|accessdate=19 July 2018|date=19 July 2018}}</ref>
