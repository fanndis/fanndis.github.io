==Early and personal life==

==Political career==
===Early career===
Advani joined the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) in 1941 as a 14-year-old boy.<ref>'My idea of happiness is good books', interview in EYE, the Indian Express, 19–25 September 2010.</ref> He became a [[pracharak]] (full-time worker) of the Karachi branch and developed several [[shakhas]] there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-incomplete-without-sindh-advani/|title=India 'incomplete' without Sindh: Advani|date=15 January 2017|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115121812/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-incomplete-without-sindh-advani/#|archive-date=15 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> After Partition, Advani was sent as a ''pracharak'' to Matsya-Alwar in [[Rajasthan]], which had witnessed communal violence following [[partition of India|Partition]]. He worked in [[Alwar district|Alwar]], [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]], [[Kota district|Kota]], [[Bundi district|Bundi]] and [[Jhalawar district|Jhalawar]] districts until 1952.<ref name=Jaffrelot>{{cite book |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |author-link=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics |publisher=C. Hurst & Co. Publishers |year=1996 |isbn=978-1850653011 |page=237}}</ref>

===Bharatiya Jana Sangh===
Advani became a member of the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], also known simply as the Jana Sangh, a political party founded in 1951 by [[Syama Prasad Mookerjee]] in collaboration with the RSS. He was appointed as the secretary to [[S. S. Bhandari]], then General Secretary of the Jana Sangh in Rajasthan. In 1957, he was moved to Delhi to look after the Parliamentary affairs. He soon became the general secretary and, later, President of the Delhi unit of the Jana Sangh. During 1966 to 1967 he served as the leader of the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]] in the [[Delhi Metropolitan Council|Interim Delhi Metropolitan Council]]. After the 1967 elections, he was elected as the Chairman of the [[Delhi Metropolitan Council|First Delhi Metropolitan Council]] and served till 1970.<ref name="LSMB"/> He also assisted [[K. R. Malkani]] in editing the RSS weekly [[Organiser (newspaper)|''Organiser'']], and became a member of the national executive in 1966.<ref name="Jaffrelot" />

He became a member of the Rajya Sabha from Delhi for the six-year tenure from 1970.<ref name="Rajya Sabha">{{cite web |url=http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/alphabeticallist_all_terms.aspx |title=List of Rajya Sabha members Since 1952 |access-date=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109030114/http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/alphabeticallist_all_terms.aspx |archive-date=9 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After serving various positions in the Jana Sangh, he became its President in 1973 at the Kanpur session of the party working committee meeting. His first act as president of the BJS was to expel founder member and veteran leader [[Balraj Madhok]] from primary membership of the party for supposedly violating the party directives and acting against the interests of the party. He was a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat from 1976 to 1982.<ref name="Rajya Sabha" /> After the Indira Gandhi's [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]], the Jana Sangh and many other opposition parties merged into the [[Janata Party]]. Advani and colleague [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] fought the [[Lok Sabha Elections]] of 1977 as members of the Janata Party.

===Janata Party to Bharatiya Janata Party===
The [[Janata Party]] was formed by political leaders and activists of various political parties who had been united in opposing the state of Emergency imposed in 1975 by then-Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zarhani|first=Seyed Hossein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3tqDwAAQBAJ|title=Governance and Development in India: A Comparative Study on Andhra Pradesh and Bihar after Liberalization|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=978-1-351-25518-9|pages=189}}</ref> After elections were called in 1977, the Janata Party was formed from the union of the Congress (O), the Swatantra Party, the Socialist Party of India, the Jana Sangh and the Lok Dal. [[Jagjivan Ram]] split from the [[Indian National Congress]], bringing a small faction known as the Congress for Democracy with him, and joined the Janata alliance. The widespread unpopularity of Emergency rule gave the Janata Party and its allies a landslide victory in the election.<ref name="B">{{cite book|author=G. G. Mirchandani|title=320 Million Judges|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2003|isbn=81-7017-061-3|pages=90–100}}</ref> [[Morarji Desai]] became the [[Prime Minister of India]], Advani became the [[Minister of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Minister of Information and Broadcasting]] and Vajpayee became the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Foreign Minister]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Basu|first=Amrita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TTrjCQAAQBAJ|title=Violent Conjunctures in Democratic India|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-08963-1|pages=69}}</ref>

The erstwhile members of the Jana Sangh quit the Janata Party and formed the new Bharatiya Janata Party. Advani became a prominent leader of the newly founded BJP and represented the party in the [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house of the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]]) from Madhya Pradesh for two terms beginning in 1982.<ref name=LS/><ref name="Rajya Sabha" />

===The rise of the BJP===
{{Further|Ram Rath Yatra}}
[[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] was appointed the first president of the new party. [[Ramachandra Guha]] writes that despite the factional wars within the Janata government, its period in power had seen a rise in support for the RSS, marked by a wave of communal violence in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan|pages=563–564}}</ref> Despite this, the BJP under Vajpayee initially took a more moderate approach to Hindutva, to gain a wider appeal. This strategy was unsuccessful, as the BJP won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984.<ref name=Malik>{{cite journal|last1=Malik|first1=Yogendra K.|first2=V. B.|last2=Singh|title=Bharatiya Janata Party: An Alternative to the Congress (I)?|journal=Asian Survey|date=April 1992|volume=32|issue=4|pages=318–336|jstor=2645149|doi=10.2307/2645149}}</ref> A few months prior to the election, [[Indira Gandhi]] was assassinated, creating a sympathy wave for the Congress that also contributed to the BJP's low tally, as the Congress won a record number of seats. This failure led to a shift in the party's stance; Advani was appointed party president, and the BJP returned to the hardline Hindutva of its predecessor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan}}</ref>

[[Image:Dmitry Medvedev in India 4-5 December 2008-7.jpg|thumb|right|280px|L.K. Advani with [[Dmitry Medvedev]] of Russia.]]
Under Advani, the BJP became the political face of the [[Ayodhya dispute]] over the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]]. In the early 1980s, the [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) had begun a movement for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity [[Rama]] at the site of the [[Babri mosque|Babri Masjid]] in [[Ayodhya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/744403/in-the-times-of-yakub-memon-remembering-the-babri-masjid-demolition-cases|title=In the times of Yakub Memon, remembering the Babri Masjid demolition cases|access-date=29 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730231427/http://scroll.in/article/744403/in-the-times-of-yakub-memon-remembering-the-babri-masjid-demolition-cases#|archive-date=30 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple once stood there that had been demolished by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]] when he constructed the Babri mosque. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has supported the claim that a Hindu structure once stood at the site, without commenting on a possible demolition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evidence of temple found: ASI|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030826/main6.htm|date=25 August 2003|access-date=3 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411193402/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030826/main6.htm#|archive-date=11 April 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm |title=Layers of truth|work = The Week|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050323101829/http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm|archive-date = 23 March 2005}}</ref> The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election manifesto, which provided rich dividends in the general elections of 1989. Despite the Congress winning a plurality in the election, it declined to form a government, and so the [[National Front (India)|National Front]] government of [[VP Singh]] was sworn in. The support of the BJP, with its tally of 86 seats, was crucial to the new government.<ref name="Guha2007">{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan|pages=582–598}}</ref>

Advani embarked on a "Rath Yatra", or chariot journey, to mobilise ''karsevaks'', or volunteers, to converge upon the Babri Masjid to offer prayers. This Rath Yatra, undertaken in an air-conditioned van decorated to look like a chariot, began from [[Somnath]] in Gujarat and covered a large portion of Northern India until it was stopped by the Chief Minister of Bihar, [[Laloo Prasad Yadav|Lalu Prasad Yadav]], on the grounds that it was leading to communal violence.

===1996 General Elections===
After the 1996 general elections, the BJP became the single largest party and was consequently invited by the [[President of India|President]] to form the Government. However, Advani himself did not contest the 1996 elections from any constituency over allegations of involvement in the [[Hawala scandal]].<ref>{{cite news |url =https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/lk-advani-parliamentary-history-2019-lok-sabha-elections-1077707-2017-11-01|title =How Advani will create Parliamentary history whether he contests 2019 Lok Sabha elections or not|publisher =[[India Today Group]]|quote =But, he resigned in 1996 in the wake of the Jain hawala diary case.

===Second term (1998–99)===
After two years in the political wilderness, the BJP-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), came to power with Vajpayee returning as Prime Minister in March 1998, when elections were called after India saw two unstable Governments headed by [[H. D. Deve Gowda]] and [[I. K.

After the fall of two United Front government between 1996 and 1998 (H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral), the Lok Sabha, (lower house) of India's Parliament was dissolved and new elections were held. Now, a coalition of political parties signed up with BJP to form the Nationwide Democratic Alliance (NDA), headed by A. B. Vajpayee. The NDA won a majority of seats in parliament. However, the govt survived only 13 several months until mid-1999 when [[All Indian Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) under [[J. Jayalalitha]] withdrew its assistance to the government. With the NDA no longer having a majority, the Parliament was again dissolved and new elections were organised. Vajpayee remained the Prime Minister until elections were organised.<ref name=":0" />

Advani assumed the office of [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Home Minister]] and was later elevated to the position of Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Advani appointed deputy prime minister|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Advani-appointed-deputy-prime-minister/articleshow/14487268.cms|date=29 June 2002|website=The Times of India|access-date=10 May 2020}}</ref> As Union Minister, Advani had a tough time with India facing a string of internal disturbances in the form of rebel attacks allegedly supported by [[Pakistan]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} The NDA government lasted for its full term of five years till 2004, the first non-Congress government to do so.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1dZC9ITxgwC|title=Wondering Man, Money & Go(l)d|publisher=Wondering Man|isbn=978-1-84693-016-4|pages=24|language=en}}</ref>

As elections approached in 2004, Advani was supremely confident and conducted an aggressive campaign.

His two close associates, [[Uma Bharati]], and [[Madan Lal Khurana]], and longtime rival [[Murali Manohar Joshi]] publicly spoke out against him. In June 2005, he drew much criticism when he, while on a visit to the Jinnah Mausoleum at Karachi – his town of birth, endorsed [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] and described him a "secular" leader. This did not sit well with the RSS either and Advani was forced to relinquish his post as BJP president. However, he withdrew the resignation a few days later.<ref>{{Cite news|title=L K Advani resigns for 3rd time in 8 years, once over row on Jinnah remarks|work=The Economic Times|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/l-k-advani-resigns-for-3rd-time-in-8-years-once-over-row-on-jinnah-remarks/articleshow/20524464.cms|access-date=6 August 2020}}</ref>

The relationship between Advani and the RSS reached a low point when the latter's chief [[K. S.

===Prime Minister candidacy===

In an interview with a news channel in December 2006, Advani stated that as the Leader of the Opposition in a parliamentary democracy, he considered himself the Prime Ministerial candidate for the general elections, ending on 16 May 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-12-11/india/27823025_1_l-k-advani-rajnath-singh-pakistan-visit|title=I'll be candidate for PM: Advani|date=11 December 2006|work=The Times of India|access-date=30 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219142107/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-12-11/india/27823025_1_l-k-advani-rajnath-singh-pakistan-visit#|archive-date=19 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of his colleagues were not supportive of his candidacy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/764246.cms|title=Advani opens his heart, and a can of worms|date=11 December 2006|work=The Economic Times|location=India|access-date=3 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214143219/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/764246.cms#|archive-date=14 December 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

A major factor in favour of Advani was that he had always been the most powerful leader in the BJP with the exception of Vajpayee, who endorsed Advani's candidacy. On 2 May 2007, BJP President Rajnath Singh stated that: "After Atal there is only Advani. Advani is the natural choice. It is he who should be PM".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-02/india/27883339_1_mohan-rao-bhagwat-vajpayee-and-advani-suresh-soni|title=LK 'natural' choice for PM: Rajnath|date=2 May 2007|author=Mohua Chatterjee, TNN|work=The Times of India|access-date=30 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219143857/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-02/india/27883339_1_mohan-rao-bhagwat-vajpayee-and-advani-suresh-soni#|archive-date=19 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> On 10 December 2007, the Parliamentary Board of BJP formally announced that L.

However, [[Indian National Congress]] and its allies won the 2009 general elections, allowing incumbent Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to continue in office. Following the defeat in the elections, L.

The ''yatra'' has been linked to the ''Mandir-Masjid'' dispute centred around ''Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid'' site at Ayodhya. The BJP and Advani, however, focused the yatra on the secularism–communalism debate.
