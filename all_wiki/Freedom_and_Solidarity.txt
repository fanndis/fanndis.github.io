== History ==
=== Foundation ===
[[Richard Sulík]] was special adviser to two [[Minister of Finance (Slovakia)|Ministers of Finance]], [[Ivan Mikloš]] and [[Ján Počiatek]], with whom he worked to simplify the tax system and implement Slovakia's 19% [[flat tax]].  He announced his intention to found Freedom and Solidarity on 10 October 2008, calling for a party dedicated to [[economic freedom]] and questioning the commitment of the [[Slovak Democratic and Christian Union – Democratic Party]] (SDKÚ-DS) to that objective.<ref name="Jeden z autorov daňovej reformy">{{cite news |title=Jeden z autorov daňovej reformy Sulík zakladá novú stranu |newspaper=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]] |date=11 November 2008 |url=http://www.sme.sk/c/4170206/jeden-z-autorov-danovej-reformy-sulik-zaklada-novu-stranu.html |language=sk}}</ref> Analysts cited a lack of any [[Liberalism|liberal]] party in the country.<ref name="Jeden z autorov daňovej reformy"/> After securing the 10,000 signatures required to found a party, SaS made its public debut in February 2009,<ref name="Richard Sulík rozbieha stranu">{{cite news |title=Richard Sulík rozbieha stranu Sloboda a Solidarita |newspaper=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]] |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.sme.sk/c/4346276/richard-sulik-rozbieha-stranu-sloboda-a-solidarita.html |language=sk}}</ref> ahead of the [[2009 European Parliament election in Slovakia|European Parliament election]] in June 2009. The party set publicly declared goals of entering the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|National Council]] in [[2010 Slovak parliamentary election|2010]] and entering government in 2014.<ref name="Richard Sulík rozbieha stranu"/>

At SaS's founding congress in Bratislava on 28 February 2009, Richard Sulík was elected as Chairman and Jana Kiššová as General Manager.
SaS selected economist Ján Oravec, to be its candidate for the [[2009 European Parliament election in Slovakia|2009 European elections]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Stranu Sloboda a Solidarita povedie ekonóm Sulík |newspaper=[[Slovak News Agency]] |date=28 March 2009 |url=http://aktualne.centrum.sk/domov/politika/clanek.phtml?id=1178613 |language=sk}}</ref> The party supported the SDKÚ–DS candidate [[Iveta Radičová]] in the [[2009 Slovak presidential election|presidential election]] in March and April 2009, but she was defeated in the second round.

With others, Sulík was approached by [[Declan Ganley]] to join the [[Libertas.eu]] alliance of [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] parties for the European elections, but turned down the invitation in order to remain independent. While he was also a sceptic of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] and more generally a critic of European intransparency and bureaucracy, he did not share the isolationist position of Libertas. In the 2009 European Parliament election, SaS received 4.71% of the votes, just missing the 5% [[election threshold|threshold]]. SDKÚ–DS accused SaS of unnecessarily furthering the fragmentation of the political right in Slovakia. In the [[2009 Slovak regional elections|2009 regional elections]], SaS won one seat in [[Bratislava]].

=== 2009 referendum and 2010 parliamentary election ===
[[File:Richard Sulík.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Richard Sulík]] founded SaS in 2009 to advance the ideas that he had proposed as counsellor to the Finance Ministry]]
Later in 2009, SaS promoted a referendum striving for major cuts to politicians' privileges. The demands include downsizing the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|Slovak parliament]] from 150 to 100 MPs, scrapping their immunity from criminal prosecution and limits to be placed on the public finances spent on government officials' cars. Furthermore, they demand that the radio and television market should be further liberalized, abolishing concessionary fees, and public officials' right to comment and reply to media coverage should be removed from the press law.<ref>{{cite news |title=Referendum 2009 committee seeks simultaneous vote with parliamentary elections |first=Zuzana |last=Vilikovská |newspaper=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |date=26 January 2010 |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/37748/10/referendum_2009_committee_seeks_simultaneous_vote_with_parliamentary_elections.html }}</ref> In January 2010, SaS announced that by the end of 2009 it had managed to collect the 350,000 signatures needed in order to call a referendum.  SaS forwarded the signatures to the Slovak president [[Ivan Gašparovič]], requesting him to schedule the referendum for the date of the [[2010 Slovak parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] on 12 June 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sulík posúva referendum, Gašparovičovi neverí |newspaper=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]] |date=12 February 2010 |url=http://www.sme.sk/c/5237653/sulik-posuva-referendum-gasparovicovi-neveri.html |language=sk}}</ref>

In March 2010, people reported Sulík to the police for the content of the manifesto for the [[2010 Slovak parliamentary election|2010 parliamentary election]], arguing that the party's manifesto commitment to legalisation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] constituted the criminal offence of 'spread of addiction'.<ref>{{cite news |title=Trestné oznámenie na predsedu SaS preverí bratislavská prokuratúra |newspaper=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]] |date=25 March 2010 |url=http://zilina.sme.sk/c/5300981/trestne-oznamenie-na-predsedu-sas-preveri-bratislavska-prokuratura.html |language=sk}}</ref>  This was thrown out by the prosecutors, who refused to press charges.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sulík nešíril toxikomániu, ako si mysleli Žilinčania |newspaper=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]] |date=4 May 2010 |url=http://zilina.sme.sk/c/5358646/sulik-nesiril-toxikomaniu-ako-si-mysleli-zilincania.html |language=sk}}</ref>  The party's candidates were the most open about the state of their personal wealth.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fair-Play Alliance: Candidates Are Not Transparent About Their Wealth |newspaper=[[Radio Slovakia International]] |date=9 June 2010 |url=http://www.rozhlas.sk/inetportal/rsi/core.php?page=showSprava&id=29795&lang=2 }}</ref> In the election to the National Council, SaS received 12.14%, coming third, and won 22 seats. The party was the only one in opposition that took votes from [[Direction – Social Democracy]] (Smer–SD),<ref name="Slovak Facebook Users May End Fico"/> although it was estimated that more of its votes came from former SDKÚ–DS voters.<ref>{{cite news |title=SaS is attracting voters from Smer and SDKÚ-DS; Most-Híd from SMK |first=Zuzana |last=Vilikovská |newspaper=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/39093/10/sas_is_attracting_voters_from_smer_and_sdku_most_hid_from_smk.html }}</ref>

The party entered into coalition negotiations with the three other centre-right parties, namely the [[Slovak Democratic and Christian Union – Democratic Party]] (SDKÚ–DS), [[Christian Democratic Movement]] (KDH) and [[Most–Híd]]. The parties agreed a common programme and allocated ministries, with SaS controlling four ministries as well as choosing the [[Speaker of the National Council of the Slovak Republic|Speaker of the National Council]]. During the negotiations, [[Igor Matovič]], one of the four MPs elected on the SaS list from the [[Ordinary People (Slovakia)|Ordinary People]] faction, alleged that he had been offered a bribe to destabilise the talks, prompting Sulík to make a formal complaint to the [[prosecutor]].<ref>{{cite news |title=SaS: R.

In February 2011, Igor Matovič was ejected from the caucus for voting for Smer–SD's proposed restrictions on [[dual nationality]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Coalition loses another MP |author=Michaela Terenzani-Stanková |url=http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/41611/2/coalition_loses_another_mp.html |newspaper=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref> Ordinary People filed to become an independent political party on 28 October 2011 and run as a separate list, along with two small conservative parties. In the [[2012 Slovak parliamentary election|2012 parliamentary election]], SaS received 5.88% of the vote, placing it the sixth-largest party in the National Council with 11 deputies.

In the [[2014 European Parliament election in Slovakia|2014 European Parliament election]], SaS came in sixth place nationally, receiving 6.66% of the vote and had one member elected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ep2014.statistics.sk/EP-dv/Tabulka3_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528053354/http://ep2014.statistics.sk/EP-dv/Tabulka3_en.html |archivedate=28 May 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>
