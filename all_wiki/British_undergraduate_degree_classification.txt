The '''British undergraduate degree classification''' system is a [[Grade (education)|grading]] structure for [[undergraduate degree]]s or [[bachelor's degree]]s and [[Master's degree#Integrated Masters Degree|integrated master's degrees]] in the United Kingdom. The system has been applied (sometimes with significant variations) in other countries and regions.

== History ==
The classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom was developed in 1918. Honours were then a means to recognise individuals who demonstrated depth of knowledge or originality, as opposed to relative achievement in examination conditions.

Concern exists about possible [[grade inflation]]. It is claimed that academics are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students good marks and grades with little regard for those students' actual abilities, in order to maintain their league table rankings.<ref name=":0">{{cite news| last =Lambert| first =Harry| title =The great university con: how the British degree lost its value| newspaper =New Statesman| date =21 August 2019| url =https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2019/08/great-university-con-how-british-degree-lost-its-value| accessdate = 21 August 2019}}</ref> The percentage of graduates who receive a First (First Class Honours) has grown from 7% in 1997 to 26% in 2017, with the rate of growth sharply accelerating toward the end of this period.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reform.uk/publication/a-degree-of-uncertainty-an-investigation-into-grade-inflation-in-universities/

== Degree classification ==
A bachelor's degree can be an ''[[honours degree]]'' (bachelor's with honours) or an ''ordinary degree'' (bachelor's without honours). Honours degrees are classified, usually based on a [[weighted average]] (with higher weight given to marks in the later years of the course, and often zero weight to those in the first year) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments. Grade boundaries can vary by institution, but typical values are given below.

* ''First Class Honours'' (1st, 1 or I) – typically 70% or higher
* ''Second Class Honours'';
** ''Upper division'' (2:1, 2i or II-1) – typically 60–69%
** ''Lower division'' (2:2, 2ii or II-2) – typically 50–59%
* ''Third Class Honours'' (3rd, 3 or III) – typically 40–49%

Students who do not achieve honours may be awarded an ordinary degree, sometimes known as a 'pass'. Ordinary degrees, and other exit awards such as the [[Diploma of Higher Education]] (DipHE; for completing the first two years of a degree course) and [[Certificate of Higher Education]] (CertHE; for completing the first year of a degree course), may be unclassified (pass/fail) or, particularly in Scotland where the ordinary degree is offered as a qualification in its own right, classified into pass, merit and distinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/school-of-languages,-linguisti/undergraduate-study/student-handbook/general-university-regulations/your-degree-classification.aspx|title=Your degree classification|work=Student Handbook: General University Regulations|publisher=[[University of Hull]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142841/http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/school-of-languages,-linguisti/undergraduate-study/student-handbook/general-university-regulations/your-degree-classification.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/qualitymanual/assessmentandawards/degree-classification.aspx|title=Degree classification|publisher=[[University of Nottingham]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218063419/https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/academicservices/qualitymanual/assessmentandawards/degree-classification.aspx|archivedate=18 February 2017}}</ref>

Integrated master's degrees are usually classified with honours in the same way as a bachelor's honours degree, although some integrated master's degrees are classified like postgraduate taught master's degrees or [[foundation degree]]s into: 
* ''Distinction'' – typically 70% and higher 
* ''Merit'' – typically 60-69% 
* ''Pass'' – typically 50-59%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|website=Postgrad.com|accessdate=16 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217143015/https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|archivedate=17 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/academicadvice/degreeclassification.aspx|title=Degree classification|publisher=[[University of the West of England]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142754/http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/academicadvice/degreeclassification.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2017}}</ref>

At most institutions, the system allows a small amount of discretion.<ref name="Seaton">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/18/higher-education-degree-classification|title=Degree classification is unfair to many students|last=Seaton|first=Nigel|date=19 April 2011|work=The Guardian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202005614/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/18/higher-education-degree-classification|archivedate=2 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A candidate may be elevated to the next degree class if his or her average marks are close to (or the [[median]] of their weighted marks achieves) the higher class, and if they have submitted several pieces of work worthy of the higher class.  However, even students with a high average mark may be unable to take honours if they have failed part of the course and so have insufficient credits.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a bachelor's degree with honours normally takes three years of full-time study and usually requires 360 [[Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme|credits]], of which at least 90 are at level 6 (final year of a bachelor's degree) level, while an ordinary bachelor's degree normally requires 300 credits, of which 60 are at level 6.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2730#.WKWxz6gXZoM|title=Higher education credit framework for England: guidance on academic credit arrangements in higher education in England|isbn=9781844828708|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|date=August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817191542/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2730#.WKWxz6gXZoM|archivedate=17 August 2016|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref> In Scotland, the honours bachelor's degree takes four years and requires 480 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 10 of the Scottish framework (last year of the honours degree) and 90 at level 9 (penultimate year), while the ordinary degree takes three years and requires 360 credits with a minimum of 60 at level 9 (last year of the ordinary degree).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616065231/http://scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 June 2014|title=Interactive framework|accessdate=16 February 2017|publisher=SCQF}}</ref>

In Scotland, it is possible to start university a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom, as the Scottish [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher exams]] are often taken at age 16 or 17 (as opposed to 18), so Scottish students often end a four-year course at the same age as a student from elsewhere in the UK taking a three-year course, assuming no [[gap year]]s or students skipping the first year (direct entry to 2nd year).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/direct-entry/|title=Direct entry to second year {{!}} University of St Andrews|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref>

When a candidate is awarded a degree with honours, ’(Hons)’ may be suffixed to their designatory letters – for example, BA (Hons), BSc (Hons), BMus (Hons), MA (Hons).<ref name=Eurydice>{{cite web|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/United-Kingdom-England:Bachelor#Certification|title=Bachelor|at=Certification|website=Eurydice|publisher=[[European Commission]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094322/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/United-Kingdom-England:Bachelor#Certification|archivedate=20 February 2017}}</ref> An MA (Hons) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities (c.f. [[Scottish MA]]) and is at the same level as a bachelor's degree. 
 
===Distribution of classes===
The [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA) has published the number of degrees awarded with different classifications since 1994–1995. The relative proportions of different classes have changed over this period, with increasing numbers of students being awarded higher honours. The table below shows the percentage of classified degrees (i.e., not including fails or unclassified degrees such as [[MBBS]]) in each class at five-year intervals; note that HESA stopped giving statistics separately for third class honours and pass degree after 2003 and that a small number of undivided second class honours degrees (shown under "other" along with "unknown", which makes up the bulk of this category) were awarded up to 1996.

First Class Honours, referred to as a 'first', is the highest honours classification and indicates high academic achievement.  Historically, First Class Honours were uncommon, but as of 2019 are awarded to nearly thirty percent of graduates from British universities.<ref name=":0" /> The increase is said by some commentators to be due to student-demanded [[grade inflation]] rather than the quality of students or improvements to their education.<ref name=":0" />{{Additional citation needed|date=November 2019}}

{{Redirects here|2:1|the film format|Univisium}}
The upper division is commonly abbreviated to '2:1" or 'II.i' (pronounced ''two-one'').  The 2:1 is a minimum requirement for entry to many postgraduate courses in the UK.  It is also required for the award of a [[research council]] postgraduate studentship in the UK, although possession of a master's degree can render a candidate eligible for an award if their initial degree was below the 2:1 standard.

The percentage of candidates who achieve Upper Second Class Honours can vary widely by degree subject, as well as by university.<ref name="HESA"/>

A 2:1 degree is sometimes nicknamed an [[Attila the Hun]] (two-one)<ref name='telegraph'>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1377510/How-to-get-a-Geoff-Hurst-in-slang-at-university.html|title=How to get a 'Geoff Hurst' in slang at university|work=The Telegraph|date=8 December 2000|access-date=1 March 2019|first=Nicole|last=Martin}}</ref> in the UK.

===Lower Second Class honours===
This is the lower division of Second Class degrees and is abbreviated as '2:2' or 'II.ii' (pronounced ''two-two'').

===Third Class honours===
Third Class Honours, referred to as a "Third", is the lowest honours classification in most modern universities. Historically, the University of Oxford awarded Fourth Class Honours degrees and, until the late-1970s, did not distinguish between upper and lower Second Class Honours degrees.<ref name="Alderman">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|title=Tear up the class system|first=Geoffrey|last=Alderman|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000647/http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/14/administration.highereducation|archivedate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

===Ordinary degree===
While most university bachelor's degree courses lead to honours degrees, some universities offer courses leading to ordinary degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/international-and-eu-students/ucas-terms-explained|title=UCAS terms explained|publisher=[[UCAS]]|accessdate=16 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217142621/https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/international-and-eu-students/ucas-terms-explained|archivedate=17 February 2017}}</ref> Some honours courses permit students who do not gain sufficient credits in a year by a small margin to transfer to a parallel ordinary degree course. Ordinary degrees may also sometimes be awarded to honours degree students who do not pass sufficient credits in their final year to gain an honours degree, but pass enough to earn an ordinary degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/faqs/?faqno=552|title=Faculty Handbook Online 2013/14: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Durham University|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107040202/https://www.dur.ac.uk/faculty.handbook/faqs/?faqno=552|archivedate=7 November 2014}}</ref>

Some Scottish universities offer three-year ordinary degrees as a qualification in their own right, as well as an honours degree over four years. This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degrees with three years of study. An ordinary degree in Scotland is not a failed honours degree, as in certain English universities. Students can decide, usually at the end of their second or third year, whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year. Scottish universities may also award their ordinary degrees with distinction if a student achieves a particularly good grade average, usually 70% or above. A common example of a Scottish ordinary degree is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] course taken by graduates of other subjects, as this is sufficient (without honours) for entry into the legal profession.

===Variations in classification===

At the [[University of Cambridge]], undergraduate [[Tripos]] examinations are split into one or more Parts, which span either one or two years. Each student receives a formal classification for each Part (i.e. Class I, II.i, II.ii, or III).<ref name="Cambridge">{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|title=The structure of undergraduate courses at the University of Cambridge|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509185935/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/camdata/tripos.html|archivedate=9 May 2012}}</ref> Officially a grade simply exists for every Part of the degree, not for the overall degree.

At the [[University of Oxford]], a formal degree Class is given, and this is typically based on the final examinations. In Oxford, examinations for [[Prelims]] or [[Honour Moderations]] are also undertaken in first/second year, but these results do not typically affect the final degree classification. Until the 1970s, the four honours divisions in Oxford's moderations and final examinations were named first, second, third and fourth class, but eventually Oxford gave in and adopted the numbering used by other English universities.<ref name="Alderman"/>

====Variations of First Class honours====

At the [[University of Cambridge]], [[Tripos]]es (undergraduate degree examinations) are split into one or more Parts. Attaining First Class Honours in two different Parts culminates in graduating with a 'Double First'.<ref name="Cambridge"/> It is possible in some Triposes to be awarded a 'Starred First', for examination scripts that "consistently exhibit the qualities of first class answers to an exceptional degree."<ref name="CambStarred">{{cite web | url=http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/ugrads-exam-folder/marking-criteria-new | title=Undergraduate Examinations Guidelines for Examiners and Assessors for Tripos Examinations 2015 | publisher=University of Cambridge Faculty of Philosophy | accessdate=21 January 2015 | pages=9 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121114046/http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/curr-students/ugrads-exam-folder/marking-criteria-new | archivedate=21 January 2015}}</ref> Some Cambridge alumni who achieved Firsts in three Parts of the Tripos are described by their colleges and others as having achieved a 'Triple First'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/art-centre/past-exhibitions.html|title=Past exhibitions|at=King's College Exhibition for Black History Month 21 – 28 October|publisher=[[King's College, Cambridge]]|accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/archaeology-and-anthropology-careers-and-talks/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819042048/http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/archaeology-and-anthropology-careers-and-talks/ |archivedate=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/once_a_caian._issue_8.pdf |work=Once a Caian|publisher=[[Gonville and Caius College]]|title=Music Ancient & Modern |accessdate=2016-08-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818193029/https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/once_a_caian._issue_8.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2016|page=14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.society.caths.cam.ac.uk/Public_Magazines/1950r.pdf |title=St Catherine's Society Magazine |publisher=[[St Catherine's College, Cambridge]]|date=July 1950| accessdate=2016-08-03 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040604/http://www.society.caths.cam.ac.uk/Public_Magazines/1950r.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016|page=17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJp7LU5NL0C&pg=PA318|page=318|title=Musik im Exil: die Schweiz under das Ausland 1918–1945|first1=Chris|last1=Walton|first2=Antonio|last2=Baldassarre|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783039104925|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Oxford sometimes grants a congratulatory first, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as "a highly unusual honor in which the examining professors ask no questions about the candidate's written work but simply stand and applaud",<ref name="nyt20030614">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/world/sir-bernard-williams-73-oxford-philosopher-dies.html |title=Sir Bernard Williams, 73, Oxford Philosopher, Dies |last=Lehmann-Haupt |first=Christopher |date=2003-06-14 |newspaper=The New York Times |author-link=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106173405/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/world/sir-bernard-williams-73-oxford-philosopher-dies.html |archivedate=6 January 2017}}</ref> and [[Martin Amis]] described as "the sort where you are called in for a ''[[oral exam|viva]]'' and the examiners tell you how much they enjoyed reading your papers".<ref name=Zachary614>Leader, Zachary (2006). ''The Life of Kingsley Amis''. Cape, p. 614.</ref> A 'double first' at Oxford usually informally refers to First Class Honours in both components of an undergraduate degree, i.e., Moderations/Prelims and the Final Honour School, or in both the bachelor's and master's components of an integrated master's degree.

At [[University College London]], candidates who perform well beyond the requirements of a standard First Class Honours may be nominated to the [[Dean's List]]. This is generated once per year and recognises outstanding academic achievement in final examinations. There are no set criteria for nomination to the list, but typically only a small number of students from each faculty are nominated per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/about-the-faculty/faculty-prizes/deans-list|title=Dean's List commendees|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012075200/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/about-the-faculty/faculty-prizes/deans-list|archivedate=12 October 2016}}</ref>

==International comparisons==

===France===
The University of St Andrews gives equivalencies between French and British grades for its study-abroad programme.<ref name="St Andrews">{{cite web|title=Grade comparison of overseas qualifications|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/registry/csa/creditandgradeconversions/France.pdf|publisher=University of St Andrews|accessdate=15 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020161959/https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/registry/csa/creditandgradeconversions/France.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2016}}</ref> Equivalencies for the purposes of initial teacher training have also been derived by the UK [[NARIC]] for 1st, 2:1 and 2:2 degrees, which do not align with St Andrews' table.<ref name=gov.uk>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-degree-equivalency-table-and-methodology|author=UK NARIC|publisher=National College for Teaching and Leadership|title=Overseas degree equivalency: table and methodology|date=28 May 2015|accessdate=15 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129215739/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-degree-equivalency-table-and-methodology|archivedate=29 January 2017}}</ref>

===South Africa===
The South African Qualifications Authority<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saqa.org.za/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816121445/http://www.saqa.org.za/ |archivedate=16 August 2007}}</ref> (SAQA) compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country.  While the British degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three-year bachelor's degree onto a master's degree (normally requiring a 1st or a 2:1 – those with a 2:2 or a 3rd usually require appropriate professional experience),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/masters-degrees/should-i-do-a-masters|title=Should I do a Masters?|publisher=Prospects|at=Can I do a Masters with a 2:2 or a third?|accessdate=15 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216132355/https://www.prospects.ac.uk/postgraduate-study/masters-degrees/should-i-do-a-masters|archivedate=16 February 2017}}</ref> South Africa does not do so unless the student has proven research capabilities.  South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of master's), by spending an in-depth year (up to 5 modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope.  This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career.

===United States===

US comparison services treat British three-year bachelor's degrees and American four-year bachelor's degrees as equivalent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wenr.wes.org/2016/02/education-in-the-u-k|title=Education in the U.K.|publisher=[[World Education Services]]|date=2 February 2016|accessdate=26 May 2017|quote=The programs result in degrees such as the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Laws, and Bachelor of Education, all of which are equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the U.S. system.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030191855/http://wenr.wes.org/2016/02/education-in-the-u-k|archivedate=30 October 2016}}</ref> Some British sources, such as the [[Dearing Report]], consider British honours degrees equivalent to a US master's degree and US bachelor's degrees as equivalent to British pass degrees in terms of the standard reached in the major subject, due to the higher degree of specialisation in the UK.<ref>{{cite book|title=Quality and standards|chapter=Appendix 5: Higher education in other countries|url=https://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/a5_083.htm|quote=7.21 The team gained the impression, based on an inspection of syllabuses and examination papers, that the American high school diploma compares in standard with GCSE and the associate degree with GCE A-level and Advanced GNVQ, the bachelor's degree with a UK pass degree or higher national diploma and the Master's degree with a bachelor's honours degree from a British university. Further evidence for this conclusion: Howard University in Washington, a university in which over 99 per cent of undergraduates are black, admits overseas applicants from the West Indies with five GCE O-level grades at A-C to the first year of their bachelor's degree programme; Johns Hopkins, one of the most prestigious of the private universities, states in its prospectus that advanced placement is available for students entering with either International Baccalauréat or GCE A-level. The rider must be added, however, that an American education is very much more general than a UK education right up to bachelor's level; it would hardly be reasonable, therefore, to expect the same standard to be reached in the major subject. It was also noted that, in the highest quality institutions, some individual modules taken by senior students compared well in level with UK final honours standard. A given student would take rather fewer of these more demanding modules than a UK student, however.|work=[[Dearing Report|The National Committee of Enquiry into Higher Education (Dearing Report)]]|author=[[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Ron Dearing]]|date=23 July 1997|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024033713/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/a5_083.htm|archivedate=24 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org:80/eis/quusa.htm|title=Comparing your US qualifications with those in the UK|publisher=[[British Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001135341/http://www.britishcouncil.org/eis/quusa.htm|archive-date=1 October 2002|quote=Master's degree - in terms of specialisation, the American Master's degree from prestigious colleges and universities is considered comparable to the British Bachelor (Honours) degree.

In comparing US bachelor's degrees to British honours degrees, equivalencies can be expressed in terms of either [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|US Grade Point Averages]] (GPAs) or letter grades. British institutions normally state equivalence in terms of GPAs. Approximate mappings between British classifications and GPAs can be inferred from the graduate admissions criteria used by British universities, which often give international equivalents.

Degrees in the UK are mapped to levels of the [[Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies]] (FHEQ), which includes the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland (FQHEIS), which has an alternative numbering of levels corresponding to those of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). Bachelor's degrees (including the [[Scottish MA]], but not including [[MB BS|medical degrees]], dentistry degrees or degrees in veterinary science) attained in the UK are at FHEQ level 6/FQHEIS level 9 (ordinary) or 10 (honours); master's degrees (including integrated master's degrees and first degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science) are at FHEQ level 7/FQHEIS level 11, and doctoral degrees are at FHEQ level 8/FQHEIS level 12. Bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees map to first, second and third cycle qualifications in the [[Bologna Process#Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area|Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616065231/http://scqf.org.uk/framework-diagram/Framework.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-06-16|title=The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]]|date=November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083730/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|access-date=24 February 2016}}</ref>

==Progression to postgraduate study==
Regulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary among universities, and are often flexible.  A candidate for a postgraduate master's degree is usually required to have at least a 2:2 bachelor honours degree, although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place in a postgraduate course and to obtain funding, especially in medical and natural sciences.  Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master's program, such as for a [[Master of Research]] course.<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html Entrance requirements: Graduate Prospectus 2010–11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913073724/http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/entry.html |date=13 September 2008 }}, ''[[University of Cambridge]]'', September 2009</ref><ref>[https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&q=565 What are the entry requirements for graduate programmes at LSE?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009014628/https://lfylive.lse.ac.uk/lfy/tc/enquiries/enquiry.html?a=4&q=565 |date=9 October 2011 }}, ''[[London School of Economics]]''</ref>

Candidates with a Third or an Ordinary degree are sometimes accepted, provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation.  A candidate for a doctoral programme who does not hold a master's degree is nearly always required to have a First or 2:1 at bachelor's level.

==Variations==

===International degrees===

====Australia====
Some universities, such as those in Australia, offer ordinary or pass degrees, (for instance, as a three-year B.A. or a three-year BSc) by default.  High-achieving students may be recognised with an honours classification without further coursework or research, as is often the case in engineering, which often contains a research and thesis component,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2012/B-ENG|title=BEng (Bachelor of Engineering)|work=University of Melbourne Handbook|publisher=University of Melbourne|accessdate=31 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722101206/https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2012/B-ENG|archivedate=22 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/info-about/our-faculty/faculty-policies/honours-policy|title=Honours Policy|publisher=Faculty of Engineering, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702165314/http://www.eng.unsw.edu.au/info-about/our-faculty/faculty-policies/honours-policy|archivedate=2 July 2013}}</ref> or law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/honours|title=Honours|publisher=UNSW Faculty of Law|accessdate=31 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516014028/http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/current-students/my-academic-life/honours|archivedate=16 May 2013}}</ref> However, other courses (such as humanities, arts, social sciences, and sciences) and other universities may recognise high-achieving students with an honours classification with further coursework or research, undertaken either concurrently with, and as part of or in addition to, a bachelor's course,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/law/cstudent/undergrad/honours_program.shtml|title="New" Honours Program|publisher=Sydney Law School|accessdate=31 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716063911/http://sydney.edu.au/law/cstudent/undergrad/honours_program.shtml|archivedate=16 July 2013}}</ref> or after completion of a bachelor's course requirements and attaining adequately competitive grades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/currentstudents/honours-mathematics-and-statistics|title=The Honours Year|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813034354/http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/currentstudents/honours-mathematics-and-statistics|archivedate=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/economics/programsandcourses/honours/Pages/default.aspx|title=Honours – Programs & courses – Economics|publisher=Australian School of Business, University of New South Wales|accessdate=31 July 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003205335/http://www.asb.unsw.edu.au/schools/economics/programsandcourses/honours/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>

===British medical and dental degrees===
In the United Kingdom, medicine is usually taught as an undergraduate course, with graduates being awarded a master's level qualification: normally the conjoined degrees of [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS, BM BCh, MB ChB, etc.) although at [[Queen's University Belfast]] (and universities in Ireland) Bachelor in the Art of Obstetrics (BAO) is added, and at some universities only the [[Bachelor of Medicine]] is awarded - all of these have equal standing. Unlike most undergraduate degrees, the MBBS is not normally considered an honours degree, and thus is not classified into first class honours, etc. Students may be awarded "Merits" and "Distinctions" for parts of the course or the whole course (depending on the institution) and "Honours" may be awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course (as a grade above Distinction).<ref name="QAA medicine">{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Subject-benchmark-statement-Medicine.pdf|title=Subject benchmark statement - Medicine|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122221116/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/Subject-benchmark-statement-Medicine.pdf|archivedate=22 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/programme/2016-2017/documents/A101A1001500UProgrammeRegulations.pdf|title=MBBS Programme Regulations 2016/17|publisher=[[Newcastle University]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125936/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/regulations/programme/2016-2017/documents/A101A1001500UProgrammeRegulations.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2017}}</ref>

Medical schools split their year groups into one of 10 [[decile]]s.  These deciles are the major factor in the calculation of Educational Performance Measure (EPM) points used as part of medical students' [[Foundation Programme]] applications, with the top decile receiving 43 points, decreasing by a point for each decile (so the lowest gets 34 points); 7 points can be awarded for other educational achievements (other degrees and publications), and the EPM points are combined with up to 50 points from the Situational Judgement Test to give a total out of 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/pages/fp-afp/faqs/EPM|title=EPM FAQs|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223130240/http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/pages/fp-afp/faqs/EPM|archivedate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_AFP_Applicants_Handbook_2017.pdf|title=FP/AFP 2017 Applicant's Handbook|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223212536/http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_AFP_Applicants_Handbook_2017.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2017}}</ref>

==British Grade Point Average==
Following the recommendation of the Burgess report into the honours degree classification system in 2007, the [[Higher Education Academy]] ran a pilot in 2013–2014 in collaboration with 21 institutions delivering higher education (ranging from [[Russell Group]] universities to [[Further Education]] colleges) to investigate how a Grade Point Average (GPA) system would work best in Britain. Two main weighting systems were tested: an American-style average of all marks, weighted only by credit value, and weighting by "exit velocity" in the manner of the honours classification, where modules in the first year are given a low or zero weight and modules in the final year have a higher weight (a third model was only rarely used). Over two-thirds of providers preferred exit-velocity weighting to the straight average.<ref name="GPA report">{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/grade-point-average-report-gpa-pilot-project-2013-14|title=Grade point average: Report of the GPA pilot project 2013-14|date=28 May 2015|publisher=Higher Education Academy|accessdate=23 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224134517/https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/grade-point-average-report-gpa-pilot-project-2013-14|archivedate=24 February 2017}}</ref>

A GPA scale, tied to percentage marks and letter grades, was recommended for use nationally following the study, to run in parallel with the honours degree classification system.<ref name="GPA report"/>

==Nicknames==
Based on colloquial [[rhyming slang]], British undergraduate honours degree classifications have gained a number of more or less common nicknames, based on the names of various well-known current and historical figures. The following is a summary of these.
