'''''Rachael Ray''''', also known as '''''Rachael''''' and '''''The Rachael Ray Show''''', is an American talk show starring [[Rachael Ray]] that debuted in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in the United States and Canada on September 18, 2006 and also airs in other countries. It is taped at [[Chelsea Studios|Chelsea Television Studios]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=shooting>{{cite web|title=Be In the Audience&nbsp;— Audience Tickets|url=http://www.rachaelrayshow.com/show-info/be_in_the_audience/|work=CBS Studios Inc.|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> The 15th season premiered on September 14, 2020. In the seventh season, the show became the last Harpo show in syndication to switch to [[high-definition television|HD]] with a revamped studio.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Rachael Ray'': Out With the Old Kitchen, In With the New|url=http://hookedonhouses.net/2012/09/18/rachael-ray-out-with-the-old-kitchen-in-with-the-new/|work=Hooked on Houses|accessdate=October 10, 2013|date=September 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=DeFeo|first=Susan|title=Rachael Ray Will Rely On Facials When Her Show Goes HD|url=http://www.dailyglow.com/rachael-ray-will-rely-on-facials-when-her-show-goes-hd-0810.html|work=Everyday Health|accessdate=October 10, 2013|date=August 10, 2012}}</ref>

The concept behind this program showcases Ray's culinary skills. She brings various celebrities on screen to discuss their accomplishments in the entertainment, sports, and media industries. Ray asks for tips and strategies for staying healthy and safe from various health and lifestyle experts, she includes make-over segments, and features musical performances, all of which are features along the same lines of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. She does, however, keep cooking in the forefront by including at least one cooking segment at the end of each episode, and sometimes inviting her celebrity guests to join her in the kitchen. According to Ray, "People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lindne|first=Melanie|title=Happy Day For Rachael Ray|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/18/rachel-ray-food-markets-face-cx_ml_1217autofacescan03.html|work=Forbes|date=December 17, 2007}}</ref> The set has the audience seated on a large turntable that rotates so that the audience can always see the "action" on the circular stage that surrounds them. At the end of each show, with the exception of a few more guests after Ray's cooking segments, Ray's tagline is, "We'll see you when we see you."

On March 9, 2007, ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' revealed that the show's theme music was written and recorded by Ray's husband, John Cusimano. The original theme song to the show was performed by R&B, Soul and Jazz group [[The Neville Brothers]]. Their song had the same rhythm and melody as their classic hit "[[Yellow Moon]]", but with different lyrics. [[Aaron Neville]] sang the song. Starting with the fifth season, the original theme was retired. With the start of the seventh season, the show was updated and shot in a new studio. The new studio is in [[New York City]] in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea neighborhood]], and shares the building with ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]''. Audience members can be seen lined up outside the studios usually on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.<ref name=shooting/> Episodes are shot at 11:30&nbsp;a.m. and 3:30&nbsp;p.m. each day.<ref name=shooting/>
