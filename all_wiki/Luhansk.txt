'''Luhansk''' or '''Lugansk''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|l|uː|ˈ|h|æ|n|s|k}}, {{IPAc-en|us|-|ˈ|h|ɑː|n|-}}; {{lang-uk|Луганськ|Luhans'k}}, {{IPA-uk|lʊˈɦɑnʲsʲk|IPA|uk-Луганськ.ogg}}, {{IPAc-en|uk|-|ˈ|ɡ|æ|n|-}}, {{IPAc-en|us|-|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|-}}; {{lang-ru|Луганск|Lugansk}}, {{IPA-ru|lʊˈɡansk|IPA}}), formerly known as '''Voroshilovgrad''' (1935–1958 and 1970–1990), is a city in eastern [[Ukraine]], near the border with [[Russia]] in the disputed [[Donbass|Donbass Region]]. Luhansk is currently the capital and administrative center of the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] (LPR), an unrecognized nation that was established in 2014. Until its capture by LPR, Luhansk was the administrative center of the Luhansk Oblast. Population has been estimated as {{Ua-pop-est2020|401,297}}

==History==
The city traces its history to 1795 when the British industrialist [[Charles Gascoigne]] founded a metal factory near the [[Zaporizhian Cossacks]] settlement [[Kamianyi Brid, Luhansk|Kamianyi Brid]]. The settlement around the factory was known as ''Luganskiy Zavod''. In 1882 the factory settlement Luganskiy Zavod was merged with the town of Kamianyi Brid into the city of Luhansk. Located in the [[Donets Basin]], Luhansk developed into an important industrial center of Eastern Europe, particularly as a home to the major [[locomotive]]-building company [[Luhanskteplovoz]]. The city was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] between 14 July 1942 and 14 February 1943.

On 5 November 1935, the city was renamed '''Voroshilovgrad''' ({{lang-ru|Ворошиловград|Voroshilovgrad}}; {{lang-uk|Ворошиловград|Voroshylovhrad}}) in honour of Soviet military commander and politician [[Kliment Voroshilov]]. On 5 March 1958, with the call of Khrushchev not to give names of living people to cities, the old name was reinstated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/bio/hruschev_sn/01.html|script-title=ru:'Военная Литература' – Биографии – С.Н.

Finally, on 4 May 1990, a decree of the [[Ukrainian parliament|Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR]] gave the city back its original name.

In 1994 a referendum took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast]] and the [[Luhansk Oblast]], with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level; however, the referendum was annulled by the Ukrainian government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thekievtimes.ua/society/372400-donbass-zabytyj-referendum-1994.html|script-title=ru:Донбасс: забытый референдум-1994|trans-title=Donbass: the forgotten referendum-1994|language=ru|publisher=Thekievtimes.ua|date=14 May 2014|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>

During the [[War in Donbass]], separatists seized governmental buildings in the region, proclaiming the [[Luhansk People's Republic]]. An [[2014 Donetsk and Luhansk status referendums|independence referendum]], unconstitutional under the Ukrainian law, was held on 11 May 2014.

On 7 September 2006, archaeologists in Ukraine announced that an ancient structure had been discovered near Luhansk, which the press reported as a pyramid antedating those in Egypt by at least 300 years. The stone foundations of the structure were said to resemble Aztec and Mayan pyramids in [[Mesoamerica]]. It was later concluded that the site in question was not a pyramid but was still of great interest.
