== Background ==
=== Geography ===
The Pebble prospect is in a remote, wild, and generally uninhabited part of the Bristol Bay watershed. The nearest communities, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} distant, are the villages of [[Nondalton, Alaska|Nondalton]], [[Newhalen, Alaska|Newhalen]], and [[Iliamna, Alaska|Iliamna]]. The site is {{convert|200|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage, Alaska.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://northern.org/programs/clean-water-mines/hardrock-mines-in-interior-and-arctic-alaska/pebble-project/pebble-project|title=Pebble Project — Northern Alaska Environmental Center|access-date=2015-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622085806/http://northern.org/programs/clean-water-mines/hardrock-mines-in-interior-and-arctic-alaska/pebble-project/pebble-project|archive-date=2015-06-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Pebble is approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of, and upstream of, [[Lake Iliamna]]. The deposit area is characterized by relatively flat land dotted by glacial ponds, interspersed with isolated mountains or ranges of hills rising one or two thousand feet above the flats. Pebble is under a broad flat valley at about {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above sea level dividing the drainages of Upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pebblepartnership.com/location.html|title=Pebble Partnership: Location|publisher=}}</ref>

Upper Talarik Creek flows into Lake Iliamna, which flows through the [[Kvichak River]] into Bristol Bay. Waters in the Koktuli River drain into the [[Mulchatna River]], a tributary of the [[Nushagak River]] which empties into [[Bristol Bay]] at [[Dillingham]]. Water from [[Lake Clark]], approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Pebble, flows down the Newhalen River to Lake Iliamna.<ref>http://www.nature.nps.gov/water/planning/management_plans/lacl_wrsr_final_screen.pdf</ref>

=== Geology ===
==== Regional ====
The Kahiltna terrane is interpreted to represent a sediment trough formed on the landward (Alaska) side of the [[Wrangellia]] volcanic arc terrane, prior to collision of Wrangellia with Alaska. The Wrangellia and Kahiltna terranes docked to Alaska in the Cretaceous Period. This part of the Kahiltna terrane is dominated by [[Late Triassic]] [[basalt]], [[andesite]] and sedimentary rocks overlain by Jurassic-Cretaceous andesitic turbidites. Cretaceous granitic intrusive activity was widespread in the Kahiltna terrane. Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks, and Quaternary glacial deposits, developed over the older rocks.<ref name="cprm.gov.br"/>

The [[Lake Clark (Alaska)]] fault, or a splay, probably lies within {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} of the Pebble deposits and possibly much closer. The Lake Clark fault is a major right-lateral [[strike-slip fault|strike-slip]] crustal feature, considered to be a westward expression of the Castle Mountain fault. The actual ground trace of the fault and its splays are unknown in the Pebble area, due to extensive ground cover.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/1368b/report.pdf |last1=Detterman |first1=R.L. |last2=Reed |first2=B.L. |year=1980 |title=Stratigraphy, structure, and economic geology of the Iliamna quadrangle, Alaska |journal=U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1368-B}}</ref><ref name=usgs2004>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1709a/pp1709a.pdf|pages=4|author1=Peter J.

==== The ore body ====
A contiguous body of ore is known as Pebble West where mineralization locally extends to the surface and as Pebble East where it is deeply buried. Pebble holds mostly low-grade ore, requiring a large-scale operation to economically recover it.

The Pebble deposit is hosted in porphyritic [[granodiorite]] to [[tonalite]] of [[Late Cretaceous|Upper Cretaceous]] age intruded into deformed [[sedimentary rock]]s of the [[Jurassic]] to [[Cretaceous]] Kahiltna [[flysch]] [[terrane]].<ref name=usgsiq>{{cite web|url=http://ardf.wr.usgs.gov/ardf_data/Iliamna.pdf|title= USGS Resource Data File - Iliamna quadrangle|publisher= USGS|date=2004|pages=1–117}}</ref>

The copper ore is a [[calc-alkaline|calc-alkali]] [[porphyry copper]]-gold-molybdenum deposit. The ore body extends from the surface to at least {{convert|1700|m}} depth. In the western part of the orebody, mineralization occurs in a complex of several small granodiorite [[cupola (geology)|cupolas]], [[diorite]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]], older intrusions, [[breccias]], and sediments. The western part of the deposit is locally exposed at the surface; thin [[gossans]] are developed and oxidation reaches {{convert|100|ft|m}} in depth. The orebody extends eastward across a fault contact, at depth. East of the fault mineralization occurs in abundant sills and in the intruded sediments. Farther east, and deeper, the sills coalesce into a deeply buried granodiorite [[pluton]]. Mineralization and ore continue into the pluton. The eastern part of the deposit was eroded when it was exposed at the surface millions of years ago. It has since been buried by a thickening-to-the-east wedge of post-mineralization-age Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic sedimentary rocks.<ref name="cprm.gov.br">{{cite web|url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1190904.html|title= Geology and exploration history of the super-giant Pebble copper/gold/molybdenum|author1=Mark Rebagliati (Northern Dynasty Minerals Canada)|author2=James Lang (Lang Geoscience Inc, Canada)|website=International Geological Society|publisher= Geological Survey of Brazil|date=August 2008}}</ref><ref>''Pebble Project Metal Leaching/Acid Rock Drainage Characterization DRAFT Sampling and Analysis Program, SRK Consulting for Northern Dynasty, June 2005'' [http://www.dnr.state.ak.us/mlw/mining/largemine/pebble/2005_plans/fsp_ch08.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719044327/http://www.dnr.state.ak.us/mlw/mining/largemine/pebble/2005_plans/fsp_ch08.pdf |date=July 19, 2008}}</ref>

The age of mineralization at Pebble was reported in 2001 to extend for several million years between 86 million years ago and 89.5 [[wiktionary:MYA|MYA]].<ref name=schrader>{{cite web|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001AM/finalprogram/abstract_27798.htm|title= {{chem|40|AR|39|AR}} and re-os geochronology of the Pebble Copper Cu-Au-Mo porphyry deposit, outhwest Alaska|date=8 November 2001|publisher=The Geological Society of America (GSA)|author1=Schrader, Christian M. |author2=Crowe, Doug |author3=Turner, Kent |author4=Stein, Holly J}}</ref>

Metallic minerals identified at Pebble include [[pyrite]], [[chalcopyrite]], [[molybdenite]], and [[bornite]], along with minor [[covellite]], [[chalcocite]], [[digenite]] and [[magnetite]].

==== Resources ====
In 2008, Pebble was estimated to be the second-largest ore deposit of its type in the world in terms of the value of the contained metal, slightly smaller than Indonesia's [[Grasberg Mine]], which contains more metal in a smaller amount of ore than Pebble.<ref name="ADN1">{{cite web|publisher=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20080225/pebbles-value-keeps-growing |title=Pebble's value keeps growing|accessdate=12 September 2014|date=25 February 2008}}</ref> Estimates have grown throughout the history of the project.

In February 2010, a [[Mineral resource classification#Mineral resources|resource estimate]], based on a total of 509 drillholes and at a 0.3% copper equivalent cutoff (CuEQ), reported the combined Pebble deposit mineral resources of East and West comprise:
* 5.94 billion tonnes of ore as "measured and indicated mineral resources" (=proven, see [[Mineral resource classification]]) grading 0.78% CuEQ, containing 55 billion pounds of copper, 67 million ounces of gold and 3.3 billion pounds of molybdenum; and
* 4.84 billion tonnes of ore as "inferred mineral resources" (=estimated) grading 0.53% CuEQ, containing 25.6 billion pounds of copper, 40.4 million ounces of gold and 2.3 billion pounds of molybdenum.<ref>http://www.pebblepartnership.com/files/PEB-0028%20press%20release%20feb%202010.pdf {{dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref>

The 2014 resource estimate includes 6.44 billion tonnes in the measured and indicated categories containing 57 billion lb copper, 70 million oz gold, 3.4 billion lb molybdenum and 344 million oz silver; and 4.46 billion tonnes in the inferred category, containing 24.5 billion lb copper, 37 million oz gold, 2.2 billion lb molybdenum and 170 million oz silver. Quantities of palladium and rhenium also occur in the deposit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/ndm/Pebble.asp|title=Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. - Pebble - Thu Apr 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>

By dollar value, slightly more than half of the value is from copper, with the remainder split roughly equally between gold and molybdenum. Byproducts of silver, rhenium, and palladium metals would also be recovered.

=== Fisheries ===

Bristol Bay is home to the world's largest [[salmon]] run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay's freshwater tributaries. Commercial fisheries include the world's largest [[sockeye salmon]] fishery. The Kvichak River has the single largest red salmon run in the world.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Alaska Department of Fish and Game| title = Sockeye Salmon - Species Profile, Range and Habitat| url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=sockeyesalmon.main| accessdate = 12 September 2014}}</ref> The Kvichak drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Along with [[herring]] and other fisheries, salmon account for nearly 75% of local jobs.<ref name=OBB>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourbristolbay.com/commercial-fisheries.html|title=Our Bristol Bay - Bristol Bay Commercial Fishing|date=2009|author=OurBristolBay|accessdate=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913080445/http://www.ourbristolbay.com/commercial-fisheries.html|archive-date=13 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Sport fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen exploiting the salmon and [[trout]] populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include [[humpback whitefish]] (''Coregonus pidschianpp''), [[Dolly Varden trout]] (''Salvelinus malma''), Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and [[Rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'').<ref name=OBB-subs>{{cite web|title=Bristol Bay Subsistence Use|url=http://www.ourbristolbay.com/subsistence-fisheries.html|date=2009|author=OurBristolBay|accessdate=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913101543/http://www.ourbristolbay.com/subsistence-fisheries.html|archive-date=13 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Seasonal subsistence harvesting of salmon and year-round subsistence harvesting of freshwater fish is a critical part of life for rural residents, most of whom live downstream of the mine site.<ref name="Alaska FWS">{{cite web|url=http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/pdf/fisheries/reports/02-034Final.pdf|publisher=Alaska Fish and Wildlife Services|title=Freshwater Fish Harvest and Use in Communities of the Kvichak Watershed, 2003, technical paper 297 see in particular, Figures 7 through 14|date=2003|author1=Theodore Krieg|author2=Molly Chytlook|author3=Philippa Coiley-Kenner|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510111405/http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/pdf/fisheries/reports/02-034Final.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-10}}</ref>

=== Human populations ===

The Pebble site is within [[Lake and Peninsula Borough]], about 1,600 inhabitants as of [[United States Census, 2010]], adjacent to the [[Bristol Bay Borough]] of about 1000 inhabitants and the [[Dillingham Census Area]], 4,800 inhabitants. Some 7,500 people live largely rural lifestyles within or near the area downstream of the Pebble site. The populations of [[Lake Clark National Park]] and other parts of the [[Bethel Census Area]] are upstream of the site or in a different watershed.

The populations in the area rely heavily on wild resources for subsistence, harvesting [[moose]], [[caribou]] and salmon. Wild resources play an important part in the region's cultural heritage.

Alaska Native Culture: There are more than 30 Alaska Native Tribes in the region that depend on salmon to support their traditional subsistence ways of life, in addition to other inhabitants and tourists in the area. “If the Pebble mine is developed, the subsistence culture of thousands of people who live in the Bristol Bay region will be threatened”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.savebristolbay.org/bristolbayatrisk|title=What's At Risk|website=Save Bristol Bay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Discovery ===

In 1987 Cominco Alaska Exploration (CAE) (which subsequently became [[Teck Resources]]) collected mineralized surface samples at the Pebble site from color anomalies visible from aircraft. Geologist Phil St. George was credited with the discovery. He led early exploration efforts, drilling out the first half billion tons of the deposit.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=October 17, 2018|title=The Pebble deposit 30 years later: How a 28-year-old geologist made the biggest discovery of his career|work=Pebble Watch|url=https://pebblewatch.com/the-pebble-deposit-30-years-later/|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> The first two exploration holes were drilled in 1988; in 1989 twelve more drill holes, soil sampling, and geophysical surveys indicated that the Pebble West occurrence (originally named Pebble Beach) was part of a large copper porphyry system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&docClass=2&issuerNo=00003151&fileName=/csfsprod/data47/filings/00664204/00000001/C:%5CSEDAR%5CFILINGS%5CNDMYE2003Fm20FJun04.pdf|title=SEDAR Application Error / Erreur &ndash; application SEDAR|publisher=}}</ref>  CAE continued drilling and other work through 1992, with a second drill campaign in 1997, with the resource doubled from 500M short tons to 1B short tons.<ref name="usgsiq"/>{{rp|17}} 

In 2001, Northern Dynasty Minerals, Ltd. optioned the property from [[Teck Cominco]], the successor to CAE's parent company. Northern Dynasty Minerals began exploration in 2002, which continued through 2013. In 2005, Northern Dynasty discovered the Pebble East deposit and acquired 100% ownership of the Pebble mining claims.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |url=http://www.hdgold.com/i/pdf/NDM_FactSheet_Jan2008.pdf |title=NDM Investor Handout |date=9 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711154408/http://www.hdgold.com/i/pdf/NDM_FactSheet_Jan2008.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}</ref>

=== Project funding ===
{{update|section|date=August 2020}}
In 2008, $140 million was budgeted and approximately {{convert|150000|ft|m}} of additional drilling was completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/ndm/NewsReleases.asp?ReportID=296728&_Type=News-Releases&_Title=Pebble-Project-Update|title=Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. - News Releases - Thu Apr 13, 2017|access-date=April 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221133527/http://northerndynastyminerals.com/ndm/NewsReleases.asp?ReportID=296728&_Type=News-Releases&_Title=Pebble-Project-Update|archive-date=February 21, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP): The Pebble Limited Partnership was once one of the largest multinational mining corporations made up of London-based Anglo American, along with Northern Dynasty Minerals, a junior mining company headquartered in Canada. After a few investors walked away, Northern Dynasty was the only company left seeking development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.savebristolbay.org/pebbleproposal|title=Mine Proposal|website=Save Bristol Bay|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

=== Economics ===
Pebble is the largest known undeveloped copper ore body in the world, measured by either the amount of contained metal or the amount of ore.<ref name="Sizing Up the World’s Mega Copper-Gold Projects">{{cite web|url=http://www.resourceinvestor.com/News/2010/6/Pages/Sizing-Up-the-Worlds-Mega-CopperGold-Projects.aspx|title=Sizing Up the World's Mega Copper-Gold Projects - Resource Investor|publisher=}}</ref>

A report released by Northern Dynasty in 2011 predicted profits for mine owners from a large-scale open-pit mine at Pebble, given appropriate assumptions about construction costs ($4.7 billion), scale (200,000 tons per day), lifetime (45 years), metal prices over that lifetime (2011 prices) and the mine design plan.

The study assumed a slurry pipeline would deliver ore concentrate from the mine to a new port on Cook Inlet, and that trucks will haul ore concentrates to Cook Inlet.

The plan expected the mine to return the initial capital investment in 3.2 years, employ over a thousand people for the first 25 years and provide a lifetime 23.2% pretax [[internal rate of return]]. The expected pretax cash flow was approximately $2 billion per year for much of the mine life and significantly more during the later years. The report states that 58% of the ore resource will remain at year 45.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/ndm/Prelim_A.asp|title=Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. - Thu Apr 13, 2017|access-date=June 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714195830/http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/ndm/Prelim_A.asp|archive-date=July 14, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Permits ===

Northern Dynasty has applied for [[water rights]] permits to Upper Talarik Creek and the Koktuli River for use in mining. Altogether, Northern Dynasty has applied for rights to about {{convert|35|e9USgal|m3}} of ground and surface water per year,<ref name=ADNR/> about four times the annual throughput of drinking-quality water at the Anchorage Waste and Wastewater Utility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awwu.biz/website/about_us/aboutawwu.htm|title=Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility Overview|access-date=2009-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819230500/http://www.awwu.biz/website/about_us/aboutawwu.htm|archive-date=2008-08-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Studies ===
{{update|date=June 2017}}
Site-specific baseline data and scientific studies of potential environmental and social effects have been and are being conducted by the project operators and their consultants. These studies address water quality and other concerns. Among these are: 
* quantification of [[Acid mine drainage]] - the chemical stability and weathering products of the tailings (waste rock, which would be wet-stacked without dewatering) generated by the mine, as well as of the newly exposed and blast-fractured rocks within the proposed mine.
* seismic risks to the impoundment systems (earthen tailings dams) designed to contain the tailings and intended to control their chemical behavior in perpetuity.
* the effects of road and bridge construction on fish habitat.<ref name="Pre-Permitting Environmental/ Socio-Economic Data Report Series">{{Cite web|url=http://pebblepartnership.com/pages/environment/environment-pre-permitting.php|title=Pebble Mine Project Alaska|date=February 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209192844/http://pebblepartnership.com/pages/environment/environment-pre-permitting.php|archive-date=2009-02-09}}</ref><ref name="Not Your Grandfather's Copper Mine">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pebblepartnership.com/pages/project-information/video-file.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208200813/http://www.pebblepartnership.com/pages/project-information/video-file.php|url-status=dead|title=Not Your Grandfather's Copper Mine|archivedate=February 8, 2009}}</ref>

The federal Environmental Protection Agency began conducting a scientific review of the Bristol Bay watershed in 2011 focused on the Nushagak and Kvichak river drainages, in response to petitions from tribes, commercial fishing organizations, and other organizations opposed to Pebble. As of February 2011, the report was expected to reach the public-comment stage in late 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adn.com/2011/02/07/1688653/epa-to-review-bristol-bay-projects.html| work=Anchorage Daily News| title=EPA includes Pebble in review of proposed Bristol Bay projects|date =7 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511033806/http://www.adn.com/2011/02/07/1688653/epa-to-review-bristol-bay-projects.html|archive-date=2013-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] released its final environmental impact statement (E.I.S.) for the Pebble Mine project in July 2020, concluding that the project would not lead to "long-term changes in the health of the commercial fisheries in Bristol Bay," under normal conditions. After a preliminary draft of this final statement was sent to federal and state agencies, many other scientific and administrative groups critiqued this conclusion. The U.S Fish and wildlife Service scientists stated that the E.I.S. did not consider habitat destruction that could lead to destruction of salmon stocks in Bristol Bay. The legal director of Trustees for Alaska, a nonprofit public interest law first, indicated that the report was "lacking and thoroughly inadequate."<ref name="NYT-2020-GoldvSalmon" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Pebble Project EIS |url=https://pebbleprojecteis.com/documents/finaleis |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers}}</ref>

=== Possible mining plan ===
The mine itself would be an open-pit mine a mile square in area and a third of a mile deep. Ponds would be dammed to contain tailing, including some toxic materials. A 165-mile natural gas pipeline would be constructed to provide power for the operation, as well as 80 miles of road and pipeline to transport the mined concentrate to [[Cook Inlet]].<ref name="NYT-2020-GoldvSalmon" /> Operating the mine would use and impound large amounts of surface water. The roads would carry fuel, industrial chemicals and supplies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/i/pdf/ndm/NDM_FactSheet_Apr2011.pdf |title=Fact Seeht april 2011|accessdate=June 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722075904/http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/i/pdf/ndm/NDM_FactSheet_Apr2011.pdf |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}</ref>

Pebble East would most likely be an underground mine.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

Pebble would be similar to existing large copper [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] mines such as [[Chuquicamata]], [[Bingham Canyon]] and [[Ok Tedi Mine|Ok Tedi]], although the environmental setting and various technical considerations of Pebble distinguish it from these desert and tropical examples.
Development and construction would consume years and cost billions of dollars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/2719121|title=Pebble Mine Construction Now Estimated at $6 Billion|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205035419/http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/2719121|archivedate=2009-02-05}}</ref> Required [[infrastructure]] includes miles of roads, bridges and powerlines with pipelines for fuel and rock slurries.

Design possibilities include: construction of a port on Iniskin Bay of Cook Inlet with a two-lane freight road roughly {{convert|104|mi|km}} long built along the north side of [[Lake Iliamna]] between the mine and the new port; trucks hauling ore concentrate to the port; pipelines along the road to carry fuel to the mine and a slurry of metal concentrate to the port.

=== Project Timeline ===
In reaction to the mine proposal, ‘Save Bristol Bay,’ started by the local community and environmentalists, has been underway for 10 years.

2010:  Nine Bristol Bay Tribes, commercial fisherman, and sportsman requested the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enact the 404c Environmental Assessment study under the Clean Water Act. The EPA states, “Section 404(c) authorizes EPA to prohibit, restrict, or deny the discharge of dredged or fill material at defined sites in water of the United States (including wetlands) whenever it determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that use of such sites for disposal would have an unacceptable adverse impact on one or more of various resources, including fisheries, wildlife, municipal water supplies, or recreational areas.” <ref name=ej>{{Cite web|url=https://ejatlas.org/conflict/pebble-mine-in-bristol-bay-alaska-usa|title=Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay Alaska, USA {{!}} EJAtlas|last=EJOLT|website=Environmental Justice Atlas|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>

2012:Due to the above request, the EPA issued two drafts of the Environmental Assessment, concluding that the proposal for the Pebble Mine would negatively impact the Bristol Bay salmon. Public input strongly agreed, with over 1 million comments supporting the EPA’s findings and scientists further verifying the data.<ref name=ej/>

2013: The Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR) signed and adapted a Determination of Reclassification and Plan Amendment to the Bristol Bay Area Plan. This plan increased the amount of land classified Wildlife Habitat and Public Recreation in the region.<ref name=ej/>

Also this year, the final Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment (BBWA) was released, confirming that the Pebble Mine could not be operated without impacting Bristol Bay and harming salmon. With this news, Anglo American, one of the first and major investors of the Pebble Mine, pulled out its investment in the project.<ref name=ej/>

2014: The global mining giant Rio Tinto gifted its stake in the mine to two Alaskan Charities, pulling its investments from the project.<ref name=ej/>

2015: EPA released its Proposed Determination suggesting to limit mining in the Bristol Bay region due to the irreversible and detrimental impacts it will have to the local salmon ecosystem. After its release, 89.5% of the country was in support of strong protections for Bristol Bay.<ref name=ej/>

2016: The Inspector General came out in support of the EPA’s Watershed Assessment findings, ultimately encouraging limiting mining due to its unavoidable impact on the salmon wildlife in Bristol Bay, affecting both the natural ecosystem and the economic wellbeing of the area.  <ref name=ej />

2017: After a meeting between the EPA Administration and the CEO of Northern Dynasty (developers for the Pebble Project),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.northerndynastyminerals.com/|title=Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.|website=Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> litigations are settled and the EPA agrees to begin proceedings to withdrawal the Proposed Determination act. Developers move forward with a plan for permits.  In July, after the EPA proposes to withdrawal Proposed Determination, the Pebble Limited Partnership submits permits to the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the key agency in charge of reviewing the permit, laid out in a 3-4 timeline. EPA decided to not withdraw the BBWA.<ref name=ej/><ref name=timeline>{{Cite web|url=https://pebblewatch.com/epa-in-bristol-bay-timeline/|title=EPA in Bristol Bay: timeline|date=2019-08-06|website=Pebble Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>

2018: Due to increased input of concerns for the Bristol Bay fishery because of Pebble Project, EPA decides to suspend withdrawal of Proposed Determination. USACE decides to gather more information regarding the impact to area's fish and natural resources.<ref name=ej/>

2019: EPA submits comments to the USACE Environmental Impact Statement saying that the document underestimates the environmental impacts. More than 700,000 comments are posted in opposition to the Pebble Project.<ref name=ej/>  Later, the Proposed Determination is revoked, saying the five-year old document does not fully consider all information, including the Pebble Limited Partnership's project plan and the additional information considered during the USACE permit process.<ref name=timeline/>

2020: In July, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found in a final environmental analysis that the operation of a Pebble Mine "would not be expected to have a measurable effect on fish numbers" in the Bristol Bay watershed.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Eilperin |first1=Juliet |last2=Dennis |first2=Brady |date=24 July 2020 |title=Trump administration says massive Alaska gold mine won't cause major environmental harm, reversing Obama |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/07/24/pebble-mine-alaska-trump/ |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724152124/https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/07/24/pebble-mine-alaska-trump/ |archive-date=24 July 2020 }}</ref> In November the Corps denied the project a permit for its discharge plan, required under the [[Clean Water Act]] and the [[Rivers and Harbors Act]].<ref name="millman">{{cite news |last1=Milman |first1=Oliver |title=Government blocks proposed mine that threatened Alaska salmon fishery |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/25/pebble-mine-alaska-permit-denied-salmon |access-date=30 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=26 November 2020 |location=London}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
The controversy over the proposed Pebble mine centers largely on the potential risk to the watershed, salmon and other fisheries. Mining opponents claim that the mine poses a significant and unacceptable risk to downstream fish stocks, and could cause an environmental disaster if built. Mining proponents claim that the mine can be developed and operated without significantly harming Bristol Bay area fish.

A steady stream of electoral, legislative, and legal challenges to possible future Pebble mine development are lodged in Alaska. Some of these assert that even the drilling and other scientific investigations conducted to date have caused significant adverse effects to the land and wildlife near the Pebble site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trustees.org/Supporting%20Documents/Complaint.pdf |title=Complaint |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Pebble has been a major issue in Alaska politics since the mid-2000s; national environmental and sport-fishing organizations are involved, while national publications cover the issue.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/us/23alaska.html?scp=3&sq=pebble%20mine&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Vote in Alaska Puts Question: Gold or Fish? | first=William | last=Yardley | date=August 23, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' reports that, as of 2020, public opinion polls in Alaska indicate more opposition than support for the mine. In the local area near the proposed mine location, anti-mine sentiment is even stronger.<ref name="NYT-2020-GoldvSalmon">{{cite news |last1=Fountain |first1=Henry |last2=Johnson |first2=Acacia |title=Gold vs. Salmon: An Alaska Mine Project Just Got a Boost |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/climate/pebble-mine-alaska-environment.html |work=The New York Times |date=24 July 2020}}</ref> In 2006 one poll reported 28% of Alaskans in favor of and 53% opposed to Pebble and another reported 45% of Alaskans in favor and 31% in opposition.

Fifty-seven percent of Alaskan voters in a 2008 statewide election voted against a ballot measure that would have essentially outlawed the project and perhaps similar developments elsewhere in Alaska.

Organizations including the Resource Development Council, Alaska Mining Association, and the Alaska Chamber of Commerce support the project. The proposal has strong support among statewide elected officials.

Opposition to the proposal was led by organizations including; the Renewable Resources Coalition (formed in 2005 to oppose the Pebble project),<ref>{{cite web

The Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC) and other well known groups and figures (like movie star, Robert Redford) have opposed the construction of the mine. In an effort to stop or pause the construction of the mine, the NRDC has created a petition that now has more than a million signatures. The environmental justice nonprofit, Earthworks, has more than 100 gold buyers who have agreed to boycott gold found in the Pebble Bay Mine. These retailers include Tiffany & Co, Jostens, and Zales along with others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Elizabeth A|first1=Holley|last2=Mitcham|first2=Carl|date=November 9, 2015|title=The Pebble Mine Dialogue: A Case Study in Public Engagement and the Social License to Operate.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284796758|journal= Resources Policy|volume=47|pages=20–21|doi=10.1016/j.resourpol.2015.11.002}}</ref>

=== Arguments against the proposal ===
* Opponents to the mine point out that it is about jobs—current sustainable fishing (world class fishery with long history and that is perpetually sustainable) versus the time-limited mining employment that the mine will generate.  (All mines have limited lifespans.) 
* The fish in the watershed, and the wildlife that depend on them, are too important to risk in exchange for the mine's economic benefits. (Bristol Bay is the most valuable [[Sockeye Salmon]] fishery in the world —  employing more than 14,000 people and generating $1.5 billion in annual profit.)<ref name="NatGeo-2020" /><ref>{{cite web

* Accidental discharge of process chemicals and byproducts, [[heavy metals]], and acid mine drainage to the environment are concerns in mine design and operation.  Heavy metals are mobilized by acids.  Downstream salmon and freshwater fish species are vulnerable to mine-generated pollutants.<ref name="Freshwater Fish Harvest and Use in Communities of the Watershed, 2003">[http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/pdf/fisheries/reports/02-034Final.pdf Freshwater Fish Harvest and Use in Communities of the Watershed, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510111405/http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/pdf/fisheries/reports/02-034Final.pdf |date=2009-05-10 }} See in particular Figures 15 through 36</ref>  A threat to the fisheries would amount to a threat to the regional subsistence lifestyle.
* Hard-rock mining already has a notable track record in terms of the permanent and costly legacy of heavy-metal-laden acidic leachate that continuously flows from inactive, depleted old mine sites.  According to the EPA, mining has contaminated portions of the headwaters of over 40 percent of watersheds in the western continental U.S., and reclamation of 500,000 abandoned mines in 32 states could cost tens of billions of dollars.<ref>{{cite web

In this study "violated water quality standards" does not necessarily mean that the mines failed to abide by their permits.

==== Economic ====
Due to Alaska's tax structure, oil and gas drilling returns over 20% of resource value to the state and municipalities, fishing returns 1% to 5%, and mining returns approximately 1.5%.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> However, considering the mine contains over $500 billion in resources,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2008/02/26/326472/pebbles-prospects-grow.html#storylink=cpy |title=Pebbles Prospects Grow|accessdate=January 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927021808/http://www.adn.com/2008/02/26/326472/pebbles-prospects-grow.html |archivedate=September 27, 2012 }}</ref> this 1.5% tax amounts to a maximum of $7.5 Billion in tax revenue over the course of the mine's operation or $166 million/year or some four times the commercial tax budget in 2011 ($43 million).<ref>http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?2441f</ref> The annual revenue potential of the mine is yet unknown, and consequently so is the tax revenue to the State.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.labor.state.ak.us/research/trends/sep07econ.pdf |title=An overview with an outlook for future growth |accessdate=2008-04-25 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306134112/http://www.labor.state.ak.us/research/trends/sep07econ.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Alaska Republican Party | title = Percentage of Resource Production Value Paid to State Municipalities from the Oil and Gas, Mining, and Fishing Industries |url=http://www.akrepublicans.org/seaton/24/pdfs/seat_hb418_08.pdf

=== Arguments for the proposal ===
==== Economic ====
* The mine and supporting activities would provide significant tax revenue to the state. The State of Alaska predicts that direct mining tax revenue, even without Pebble, will be one of the most important sources of non-oil tax revenue (exceeding revenue from fishing).<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/aeis/Bristol/General/Bristol_General_Narrative.htm|title=Bristol Bay Bourough Economic Overview, State of Alaska Dept Commerce and Economic Development|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040824160639/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/Bristol/General/Bristol_General_Narrative.htm|archivedate=2004-08-24}}</ref>

===Secretly taped conversations===
In September 2020, the media reported that an environmental activist group, the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]], while posing as potential investors in the mine had secretly taped conversations with Roland Thiessen, chief executive of Northern Dynasty Minerals, and Tom Collier, chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership.  During the conversations Collier and Thiessen detailed their plans to gain the favor of elected politicians from [[Juneau]] to Washington, D.C. While the Army Corps of Engineers had previously decided that the mine would have  “no measurable effect” on fish populations, in August it informed Pebble Limited Partnership that they had to do more to show how they would offset the damage caused by the mining operation. The ''Washington Post'' wrote, "...but even as the executives jump through several regulatory hoops, [...] they detailed their plan to manage all the decision-makers."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eilperin |first1=Juliet |title=In secret tapes, mine executives detail their sway over leaders from Juneau to the White House |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/09/22/pebble-mine-secret-tapes/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 25, 2020}}</ref>

The ''Post'' wrote, "Thiessen described both of the state’s senators, [[Lisa Murkowski]] and [[Dan Sullivan (U.S. senator)|Dan Sullivan]], as politicians who might make noises about the project to appear sensitive to environmental concerns but ultimately won’t stand in their way."  Referring to the letter the Corps issued in August, Collier was taped saying both senators had misinterpreted the letter and feeling "embarrassed" were "[now] just sort of sitting over in a corner and being quiet, okay?”  Learning of the tapes, Murkowski responded, "Let me be clear: I did not misunderstand the Army Corps’ recent announcement.  I am not ‘embarrassed’ by my statement on it, and I will not be ‘quiet in the corner.’ I am dead set on a high bar for large-scale resource development in the Bristol Bay watershed. The reality of this situation is the Pebble project has not met that bar and a permit cannot be issued to it."  Sullivan also responded saying, "Any suggestion otherwise is either wishful thinking, a blatant mischaracterization, or a desperate attempt to secure funding for a mine that cannot move forward.  This incident demonstrates how far Mr. Collier, who has serious credibility problems of his own, is floundering in the face of this project’s overwhelming challenges."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eilperin |first1=Juliet |title=In secret tapes, mine executives detail their sway over leaders from Juneau to the White House |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/09/22/pebble-mine-secret-tapes/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 25, 2020}}</ref>  

''The Post'' wrote that the tapes also revealed that Thiessen suggested that while the company was seeking a 20 year permit he outlined how it could last another 160 years.  "Once you have something like this in production why would you want to stop?"  In an interview, Senator [[Martin Heinrich]] said the tape raises questions about whether Pebble Mine officials misled Congress, saying, "it really calls into question whether they were lying to Congress or not, which is a crime."  In an interview, the executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency said, "Seeing that the private opinion of that company that their massive plans will be unstoppable once the first artificially sized permit is passed, that is critical information for the public to know before the final decision is made because it clearly may have permanent impacts on an almost priceless resource for Alaska."  Following the release of the tapes, Collier put in his resignation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eilperin |first1=Juliet |title=Alaska mining executive resigns a day after being caught on tape boasting of his ties to GOP politicians |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/09/23/pebble-mine-secret-tapes/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 26, 2020}}</ref>

This controversy has impacted the [[2020 United States Senate election in Alaska]], during which Dan Sullivan is up for re-election. This recording and his campaign contributions from the Pebble Mine corporation has led observers to question the sincerity of his opposition to the project, potentially benefiting his political opponent [[Al Gross (politician)|Al Gross]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-19|title=Senate 2020: In Alaska, a Controversy Over an Embattled Mine Has Tightened the Race|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16102020/alaska-senate-race-election-2020-dan-sullivan-al-gross|access-date=2020-10-22|website=InsideClimate News|language=en-US}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|last=Cohen|first=Rachel M.|date=2020-10-12|title=Locked in Tight Race, GOP Sen.

== Legal challenges ==

=== EPA action ===

On December 18, 2009, an appeal was filed in [[Alaska Superior Court]] contending that a decision in November 2009 by the [[Alaska Department of Natural Resources]]’ commissioner rejecting their challenge of a 2009 exploration permit was inappropriate. The suit contended that ADNR failed to give Alaskans adequate notice and opportunity to comment on the permit and that it failed to consider the appeal. Trustees for Alaska is pursuing the suit for Nunamta Aulukestai and two Bristol Bay residents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trustees.org/Supporting%20Documents/Press%20Release%20Alaska%20Appeal.pdf |title=Appeal |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In July 2017, the EPA sought comments on a proposal to withdraw its objections to the Pebble Mine based on the 1974 Clean Water Act.<ref>{{cite web|title=EPA proposes to withdraw Clean Water Act restrictions for Pebble Mine in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed|url=https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-withdraw-clean-water-act-restrictions-pebble-mine-alaskas-bristol-bay|publisher=EPA|accessdate=24 October 2017|date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

In February 2018, the EPA changed plans to withdraw restrictions on the Pebble Mine on the basis of the Clean Water Act. Instead, Administrator Pruitt offered support of the fishery.

The suit challenged the validity of the 2005 Bristol Bay Area Plan, one of many Area Plans created and administered by the State of Alaska that, along with other State and Federal rules, define land status and the appropriate and legal uses of State land within the plan boundaries.<ref name="2005 Bristol Bay Area Plan">{{Cite web|url=http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/planning/areaplans/bristol/pdf/bbap_complete.pdf|title=2005 Bristol Bay Area Plan}}</ref>

The Bristol Bay Area Plan (BBAP) applies to about {{convert|12|e6acre|km2}} of state-owned uplands and lands beneath rivers and lakes in the Bristol Bay drainages, including lands at and in the vicinity of the proposed mine. The plan also covers about {{convert|7|e6acre|km2}} of state-owned tide and submerged lands.

The suit alleged that the 2005 BBAP, which replaced the original 1984 version, drastically altered, without legal justification, the land-use designations, classifications and acreages defined in the 1984 plan; and that the 2005 plan failed to provide adequate protection for subsistence resources, sport hunting and fishing, wildlife habitat and other renewable resources. If successful, the suit will require ADNR to write a new area plan, a many months-long process involving much public input and review of draft versions, although ultimately, approval of an area plan is decided by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, an appointee of the Governor. As of Aug. 7, 2009, DNR had not filed an answer to the complaint.

=== Nunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR ===

''Nunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR'',<ref name="Nunampta Aulukestai et al v. State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources">{{Cite web|url=http://www.trustees.org/Supporting%20Documents/Complaint.pdf|title=Nunamta Aulukestai et al v. State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources}}</ref> was filed in Alaska Superior Court (Third Judicial District) on July 29, 2009, by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Bristol Bay Native organization Nunamta Aulukestai, former [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of Alaska|Alaska First Lady]] [[Bella Hammond]], original Alaska Constitutional Convention delegate [[Victor Fischer]] and other individuals. The suit seeks "Declaratory and Injunctive Relief," asserting that the Alaska Department of Natural Resources repeatedly violated Section VIII of the [[Alaska Constitution]], which specifically provides that there shall be, "...no disposals or leases of state lands...without prior public notice and other safeguards of the public's interest..."

The plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, an injunction voiding the project's existing permits, including water-use permits. The requested injunction was specific to Pebble permits and would not directly apply to other mining projects. The suit alleges that ADNR's "pattern of permitting," is defective because it was not sufficiently rigorous in determining that issuing a permit would best serve public interest, as demonstrated by a lack of documented scientific studies and by lack of public review and input, prior to issuing permits. A Declaration by one of the plaintiffs references the Commentary on Article VIII on State Lands and Natural Resources of December 15, 1955; "As requirements change and many tasks become routine, appropriate modifications can be made in procedures if rigid requirements are not specified in the Constitution itself."

The suit also alleges that significant, and documented, adverse effects on land, water, and wildlife have already occurred as a result of drilling and other exploration activities at Pebble since 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us-cdn.creamermedia.co.za/assets/articles/attachments/22530_nunamta_v__state_press_release.pdf|title=Bristol Bay Residents Assert Pebble Exploration Violates State Constitution}}</ref>  In late 2009 the presiding judge rejected a State of Alaska motion to dismiss the case and also denied a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop mining exploration. A Petition for Review on the preliminary injunction decision was filed with the [[Alaska Supreme Court]].

In July 2010, the Alaska Superior Court ruled that Nunamta Aulukestai et al. v. State of Alaska DNR would proceed to a non-jury trial in December 2010. The ruling dismissed one of the six claims in the lawsuit and limited the scope of the upcoming trial to the Pebble permits, rather than to the Alaska mineral exploration permitting system in general.<ref name="Bluemink">{{cite news |last1=Bluemink |first1=Elizabeth |title=Judge lets anti-Pebble lawsuit go forward |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/07/13/1365307/judge-lets-anti-pebble-lawsuits.html |access-date=30 November 2020 |work=Anchorage Daily News |date=13 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511072854/http://www.adn.com/2010/07/13/1365307/judge-lets-anti-pebble-lawsuits.html |archive-date=11 May 2013}}</ref>

=== Political actions ===

Two bills designed to outlaw large-scale mining in the Pebble area were introduced in the Alaska state legislature in 2007; both stalled in committee. A third attempted (by ballot measure) piece of legislation was the [[Alaska Clean Water Initiative, 2008]]. It was voted down after months of high-profile public debate, heavy advertising, and a series of judgements by the Alaska State Supreme Court. The measure remained an active public issue; in June 2009 the state of Alaska's Alaska Public Offices Commission reported violations of campaign funding laws during the contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.adn.com/smedia/2009/06/06/03/APOC_staff_report.source.prod_affiliate.7.pdf |title=APOC staff report |accessdate=June 6, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2009/06/05/821271/report-rips-foes-of-pebble-mine.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120718015642/http://www.adn.com/2009/06/05/821271/report-rips-foes-of-pebble-mine.html|archive-date=18 July 2012|url-status=dead|title=Report rips foes of Pebble mine prospect: Pebble &#124; Alaska news at adn.com|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref>

Then-Governor [[Sarah Palin]] was a strong supporter of the project and faced criticism about her opposition to the initiative, the involvement of state government and the intended use of a $7 million federal earmark to facilitate it. Ethics questions were raised about her and her husband [[Todd Palin|Todd]]'s participation.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/us/politics/22mining.html Palin's hand seen in battle over mine in Alaska], [[New York Times]], Michael Powell and Jo Becker, 21 October 2008.

==== Jay Hammond State Game Refuge ====

A proposal to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to create a fish refuge in the Koktuli and Talarik watersheds was supported by mine opponents and opposed by Northern Dynasty. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted to create a panel to study the proposal (which could decide to recommend a refuge to the legislature). Both sides claimed this as a victory.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Anchorage Daily News]] |url=http://www.adn.com/money/industries/mining/story/8486276p-8380034c.html |title=Both sides laud decision on fish refuge |accessdate=January 23, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>  In March 2007 the Board voted to take no action on the proposal due to pending legislation.<ref>{{cite web| title = Alaska Board of Fisheries Summary of Actions from March 07 Meeting| url=http://www.boards.adfg.state.ak.us/fishinfo/meetsum/2006_2007/bof-mar07-psum.pdf| accessdate = 2007-11-28}}</ref>

In January, 2007 Senate Bill 67, introduced by Senator [[Gary Stevens (Alaska politician)|Gary Stevens]], of [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], proposed the establishment of a State Fish and Game Refuge covering about {{convert|7|e6acre|km2}} of state land in the Kvichak and Nushagak drainages (with the refuge to be named after former Alaska Governor [[Jay Hammond]]). It proposed that no uses incompatible with: fish and wildlife populations; commercial or subsistence food gathering; or recreation would be allowed in the refuge. The bill sought to close the refuge to new mining claims. Most significantly, the bill would have made illegal the storage or disposal of any quantity of, "industrial waste," thereby making it impossible to develop any industry, including mines, within the refuge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill_text.asp?hsid=SB0067A&session=25|title=Bill Text 25th Legislature|publisher=}}</ref> The bill died in the Senate Resources Committee.

==== Salmon Spawning Waters ====

In February 2007, a bill to stop the project by increasing protections for spawning salmon died in the Human Resources committee.<ref>{{cite web| title = Alaska State House Journal| url=http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_jrn_page.asp?session=25&bill=HB134&jrn=0224&hse=H| accessdate = 2007-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title = Pebble Backers say Fish Refuge Bill Actually Targets Mine| journal = Alaska Journal of Commerce| url=http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/022507/hom_20070225034.shtml| accessdate = 2007-11-28|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081122001231/http://www.alaskajournal.com/stories/022507/hom_20070225034.shtml |archivedate = November 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="HB 134 text">{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.ak.us/PDF/25/Bills/HB0134B.PDF|title=HB 134 text}}</ref>

==== 2008 Alaska Clean Water Initiative ====
{{Main|Alaska Clean Water Initiative, 2008}}

In August 2008, Ballot Measure 4, the "Alaska Clean Water Initiative," was voted down (approximately 57% against and 43% in favor) in that year's primary election. The measure was written to apply statewide (which the [[Constitution of Alaska]] demands). Supporters of the Measure argued that it would not affect any other mining operation. Opponents argued that it would have had serious, and unnecessary, adverse effects on the mining industry statewide.

==== Property rights ====

Pebble supporters argued that such bills and measures would constitute an illegal taking of [[property rights]] (mineral rights granted by the State of Alaska to holders of mining claims on state land).<ref>[http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?25+Alaska+L.+Rev.+1 Alaska Law Review: Geoffrey Y.
