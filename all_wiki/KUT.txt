'''KUT''', 90.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], is a listener-supported and corporate-sponsored [[public broadcasting|public radio]] station based in [[Austin, Texas]].  KUT is owned and operated by faculty and staff of the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/libraries-and-other-academic-resources/kut-radio/ | title=KUT and KUTX Public Radio | publisher=University of Texas at Austin (utexas.edu)| accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref>  It is the [[National Public Radio]] member station for [[central Texas]].  Its studio operations are located on campus at the Belo Center for New Media.  KUT is one of three radio outlets based on UT campus alongside student-run [[KVRX]] 91.7 FM and [[KUTX]] 98.9 FM.

KUT's main [[transmitter]] [[broadcasts]] with an [[effective radiated power]] of 100,000 [[watt]]s and is located 8 miles west of Downtown Austin at the University of Texas Bee Cave Research Center.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kut.org/how-to-listen | title=KUT: How to Listen | publisher=(KUT.org) | accessdate=8 November 2018}}</ref> KUT is licensed to broadcast in the digital hybrid [[HD Radio|HD]] format.<ref>[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=66573 "Station Search Details: KUT"] (Digital Status) (FCC.gov)</ref>

[[File:KUT 905 Radio.png|175px|right|thumb|KUT ident used until 2016.]]
A second station, KUTX, serving [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] at 90.1 [[megahertz|MHz]], was sold to [[Texas Tech University]] in 2010 in part because [[Angelo State University]] had become part of the Texas Tech University System.  The call letters were changed from KUTX to KNCH.  The KUTX call letters were moved to KUT's repeater station in Somerville, broadcasting to the Bryan/College Station area on 88.1 FM. On August 23, 2012, the UT System Board of Regents voted to move forward to purchase KXBT-FM 98.9 FM (Leander/Austin) from Border Media Business Trust.  On January 2, 2013, KXBT became [[KUTX]], creating an Austin-based sister station for KUT.  At that time, KUT adopted an all-news/talk format utilizing programming from NPR, the BBC, PRI and others.  The music programming formerly heard on KUT was moved to KUTX to create a full-time music service, primarily an eclectic mix of alt pop/rock, folk, Americana, bluegrass, jazz, blues supplemented by specialty programs including Twine Time, Folkways, Across the Water (Celtic music), and Horizontes (Latin music).

==HD Programming==

*KUT HD1 is a digital version of the over-the-air analog signal.
*KUT HD2 is the BBC World Service.
(An [[HD Radio]] is required for all HD stations.)<ref>http://hdradio.com/stations</ref><ref>http://www.freqseek.com/tx/Austin/hd-radio-stations.aspx?page=1</ref>

==Local productions==

Local productions include ''[[In Black America]]'' and ''Texas Standard'' (hosted by [[David Brown (radio host)|David Brown]]). ''[[Latino USA]]'' with [[Maria Hinojosa]] also originated at KUT but is now independently produced.

Former music shows that moved to KUTX include ''Eklektikos,'' hosted by John Aielli (with KUT since 1966); ''Left of the Dial''; and shows hosted by Jay Trachtenberg, and Jody Denberg.

== Funding ==
Like other public radio stations in the United States, KUT broadcasts on-air [[pledge drive]]s in order to raise monetary contributions from listeners.  Listener contributions and corporate [[underwriting|sponsorship]], termed "community support", account for roughly 80% of the station's [[budget]].  [[Sponsor (commercial)|Sponsor]]s are noted on-air in the form of abbreviated announcements called [[underwriting spot]]s.

== History ==

=== University of Texas' early radio activities===
The actual beginning date of [[radio]] transmissions on the UT-Austin campus has never been fully substantiated.  There is an unofficial reference to an on-campus radio operation as early as 1912.  But the most reliable information indicates that the first authorization was an experimental radio station license — bearing the call sign '''5XU''' — that was issued to the University on March 22, 1921.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221816&view=1up&seq=602 "New Stations: Special Land Stations"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', October 1, 1921, page 4. The "5" in the station's call sign indicated that the station was located in the fifth Radio Inspection district, while the "X" specified that it was operating under an "Experimental" license.</ref>

A year later, on March 22, 1922, a new AM band [[broadcast license|broadcasting station license]] was issued, bearing the randomly assigned call letters '''WCM'''.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221816&view=1up&seq=632 "New Stations: Commercial Land Stations"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', April 1, 1922, page 2.</ref> In its first years, the broadcasting station was used for a number of purposes, beginning as a demonstration project in the Physics Department, whose Professor Simpson L. Brown had persuaded the administration to let him build the station in the first place. Beginning in 1923, though, funding concerns prompted a transfer of operational control to the University's Extension Division for [[Agricultural extension|extension]] teaching. One of the [[stipulation]]s of the transfer agreement was that funds would be provided for operations and maintenance to put the station in a "first-class" condition.  The funds, however, did not materialize and broadcasting suffered until a state agriculture official needed a means to broadcast daily crop and [[weather forecasting|weather reports]].<ref name="own">"University of Texas" entry, ''Education's Own Stations'' by S. E. Frost, Jr., 1937, pages 425-428.</ref>

A deal between the official and UT's Extension Division allowed agriculture broadcasts for one hour per day in exchange for equipment maintenance.  At other times of the day, the University would broadcast items of interest from the campus, including a number of faculty lecture series. But by the end of 1924, the Physics Department decided it wanted the station back, and with the approval of the [[Board of Regents]], the Physics Department regained control in the summer of 1925.  They had a new license granted on October 30 and it bore, for the first time, the call letters '''KUT'''.<ref name="own"/>

===KUT history 1925-1929===
Professor [[Simpson L. Brown]] — in addition to his teaching and research work in the Physics Department — served simultaneously as general manager, technical director, and producer.  Programs were aired 3 nights a week from 8 to 10 with no sponsors or commercials. There were concerts by the University Symphony and other Austin musical organizations as well as discussions, lectures, and speeches by faculty, state officials, and agriculture experts.  Weekly services were broadcast from St. David's Episcopal Church and, during football season, fans could listen to play-by-play descriptions of the [[Texas Longhorns|Longhorn]] games.<ref name="own"/>

KUT's early years were ambitious but, by 1927, ambition had outrun the funding.  The expense of operating and maintaining the station had simply become too great for the Physics Department to sustain.  University President Harry Benedict appointed a committee to study the matter, and the committee recommended that the project be discontinued. In 1929 The station equipment was dismantled and returned to the Physics labs for experimentation,<ref name="own"/> and KUT's license was sold and converted to a commercial station,<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3221818&view=1up&seq=838 "Alterations and Corrections: Broadcasting Stations"], ''Radio Service Bulletin'', February 28, 1929, page 12.</ref> which is now [[KTRH]] in Houston. The University of Texas would not return to the airwaves until thirty years later, this time on the FM band.

===KUT chronology 1958 to present===

'''1958''' - Signed on as '''KUT-FM''' on November 10, licensed to the University of Texas as an Educational station broadcasting at 90.7&nbsp;MHz from the School of Journalism (now Geography) building at Whitis Avenue & 24th Street, using a General Electric transmitter built in 1939: power (4,100 watts), antenna height (268 feet), total signal radius (15 miles).
