'''Zewditu''' (also spelled ''Zeoditu''<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/us-treaties/bevans/b-et-ust000007-0662.pdf ''Treaty of Arbitration'' of August 5,1929]</ref> or ''Zawditu'' or ''Zauditu or Zäwditu''; {{lang-gez|ዘውዲቱ}}; born '''Askala Maryam'''; 29 April 1876 – 2 April 1930) was [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Empress of Ethiopia]] from 1916 to 1930. The first female head of an internationally recognized country in [[Africa]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the first [[empress regnant]] of the [[Ethiopian Empire]], her reign was noted for [[Modernization under Haile Selassie I|the reforms]] of her [[Enderase|Regent]] and designated heir ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|Ras]]'' Tafari Makonnen (who succeeded her as Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]), about which she was at best ambivalent and often stridently opposed, due to her staunch conservatism and strong religious devotion. {{As of|2020}} she is the most recent [[Queen regnant|empress regnant]] in history.

==Early life==
Baptised as Askala Maryam ("Askal of Mary," a type of [[flower]]), but using the given name ''Zewditu'', the future Empress was the eldest daughter of the then ''[[Negus]]'' (or King) Menelik of [[Shewa]], the future emperor [[Menelik II]]. ''Zewditu'' is an Amharic word meaning "the Crown", though it sometimes appears erroneously Anglicized as "Judith", with which it is not cognate. Her mother, ''Weyziro'' (Lady) [[Abechi]], was a noblewoman of Wollo and a brief companion of Menelek. Her mother had separated from Menelik when Zewditu was very young, and the future empress was raised by her father and his consort [[Baffana]]. Negus Menelik later married [[Taytu Betul]], but had no children by this wife. Menelik had three acknowledged children: Zewditu herself, had a son Asfaw Wossen who died in infancy, and another daughter Shewa Regga, the mother of [[Iyasu V|''Lij'' Iyasu]], Menelik's eventual heir. However, the Emperor remained closest to Zewditu, who also had good relations with her stepmother Empress Taytu, and was part of her father's household for most of her life.

In 1886{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} the ten-year-old Zewditu was married to ''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'' [[Araya Selassie Yohannes]], son and heir of Emperor [[Yohannes IV]]. The marriage was political, having been arranged when Menelik agreed to submit to Yohannes' rule. Yohannes and Menelik eventually fell into conflict again, however, with Menelik launching a rebellion against Yohannes' rule. Zewditu's marriage was childless, being very young during her marriage, although her husband had fathered a son by another woman. When Araya Selassie died in 1888, she left [[Mekele]] and returned to her father's court in Shewa. Despite the hostility between Menelik and Yohannes, Zewditu managed throughout the conflict to maintain good relations with both. In a sign of his high regard and affection for his daughter-in-law, Emperor Yohannes IV sent Zewditu back to Shewa with a large gift of valuable cattle, at a time when relations between him and her father were at a particularly low point.

Zewditu had two further marriages, both brief, before marrying ''Ras'' [[Gugsa Welle]]. Gugsa Welle was the nephew of Empress Taytu, Zewditu's stepmother. Zewditu had already been on good terms with Taytu, but the establishment of a direct tie between the two helped cement the relationship. Unlike her prior marriages, Zewditu's marriage to Gugsa Welle is thought to have been happy.

==Ascent to power==
Upon the death of Emperor Yohannis IV at the [[Battle of Metemma]] against the Mahdists of the Sudan, in the [[Mahdist War]], Negus Menelik of Shewa assumed power and became Emperor of Ethiopia in 1889. This restored the direct male line succession of the dynasty, as Emperor Yohannes's claim to the throne was through a female link to the line. As the daughter of Menelik II, Zewditu would be the last monarch in direct agnatic descent from the [[Solomonic dynasty]]. Her successor [[Haile Selassie]] was also linked in the female line. Menelik died in 1913, and [[Iyasu V|''Lij'' Iyazu]], the son of Zewditu's half-sister Shewa Regga, who had been publicly declared heir apparent in 1909, took the throne.<ref>{{cite book |last= Marcus|first= Harold G.|title= The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913|year= 1995|publisher=Red Sea Press|location= Lawrenceville|isbn= 1-56902-010-8|pages=241, 261}}</ref> Iyasu considered Zewditu a potential threat to his rule, and exiled her and her husband to the countryside.

[[File:Zewditu and favored priest.png|left|thumb|Empress Zewditu with one of her favored priests]]
Due to fears of instability that might be caused, the cabinet of ministers decided not to publicly proclaim the death of Menelik II. As a result, Iyasu was never officially proclaimed as Emperor Iyasu V. However, both Menelik's death and Iyasu's ''de facto'' accession were widely known and accepted. The Church authorities, the Lord Regent ''Ras'' Tessema, and the ministers agreed that Iyasu's coronation should be postponed until he was a bit older and had taken Holy Communion with his wife, which would make his marriage insoluble in the eyes of the Orthodox Church. However, Iyasu quickly encountered problems with his rule and he was never crowned. He was widely disliked by the nobility for his unstable behavior, and the church held him in suspicion for his alleged [[Islam|Muslim]] sympathies. After a troubled few years, Iyasu was removed from power. Zewditu was summoned to the capital, and on 27 September 1916, the Council of State and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] officially announced the death of Emperor Menelik II and deposed Iyasu in favour of Zewditu.<ref>Marcus, ''Menelik II'', pp. 278–281</ref> Zewditu's official title was "Queen of Kings" (''Negiste Negest''), a modification of the traditional title "King of Kings" (''[[King of Kings|Nəgusä Nägäst]]'').

Initially, Zewditu was not permitted to exercise power herself. Instead, her cousin ''Ras'' Tafari Makonnen was appointed [[regent]], and her father's old loyal general, ''[[Fitawrari]]'' [[Habte Giyorgis Dinagde|Hapte Giorgis Dinagde]] was made commander-in-chief of the army. ''Ras'' Tafari was also made heir apparent to Zewditu, for none of her children had survived to adulthood. In 1928, after an attempt to remove ''Ras'' Tafari Makonnen from power failed, the Empress was compelled to crown her cousin ''Negus''.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bahru Zewde|title= A History of Modern Ethiopia|url= https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderne00bahr|url-access= registration|year= 2001|edition=second|publisher= James Currey|location= Oxford|isbn=0-85255-786-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderne00bahr/page/135 135]}}</ref>

==Reign==

===Political maneuvering===
While the conservative Ethiopian aristocracy was generally supportive of Zewditu, it was less enthusiastic about many of her relatives. Zewditu's stepmother and the aunt of her husband, Dowager Empress [[Taytu Betul]], had withdrawn from the capital after Menelik's death, but was still distrusted somewhat due to the evident favoritism she had practiced during the reign of her late husband. In an attempt to limit her influence, the aristocracy arranged for her nephew—Zewditu's husband ''Ras'' Gugsa Welle—to be appointed to a remote governorship, removing him from court. This move, while intended as a strike against Taytu rather than against Zewditu, is believed to have upset Zewditu considerably. Zewditu also suffered guilt for taking the throne from ''Lij'' Iyasu, whom her father had wanted to succeed him – while she believed that Iyasu's overthrow was necessary, she had admired her father greatly, and was unhappy at having to disobey his wishes. Her separation from her husband and her guilt about Iyasu's overthrow combined to make Zewditu not particularly happy as Empress. Even though he had treated her abominably, she held much personal affection for her nephew Iyasu, and is said to have wept bitterly for him when told that she was being made Empress as her nephew had been excommunicated for apostasy. Increasingly, the Empress retreated from state responsibility into a world of fasting and prayer, whilst the progressive elements that surrounded the heir, Tafari Makonnen, gained in strength and influence at court.

===War against Iyasu===
The early period of Zewditu's reign was marked by a war against ''Lij'' Iyasu, who had escaped captivity. Backed by his father, ''Negus'' [[Mikael of Wollo]], a powerful northern leader, Iyasu attempted to regain the throne.  The two failed to effectively coordinate their efforts however, and after some initial victories Iyasu's father was defeated and captured at the [[Battle of Segale]]. The ''Negus'' was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa in chains, carrying a rock of repentance on his shoulders, before entering the throne room and kissing the Empress's shoes to beg for her mercy. The heir to the throne, ''Ras'' Tafari Makonnen, was not present at this spectacle out of consideration for the feelings of his wife, who was the granddaughter of ''Negus'' Mikael.

Upon hearing of his father's defeat and humiliation, Iyasu himself fled to [[Afar (region)|Afar]]. After years on the run, Iyasu was later captured by ''[[Dejazmach]]'' [[Gugsa Araya Selassie]], the son whom Zewditu's first husband had fathered by another woman. Gugsa Araya was rewarded with the title of ''Ras'' from his former stepmother, and with Princess [[Yeshashework Yilma]], the niece of Tafari Makonnen, as his bride.  When Iyasu was captured, a tearful Empress Zewditu pleaded that he be kept in a special house on the grounds of the palace, where she would see to his care and he could receive religious counsel. She found ''Ras'' Tafari and ''Fitawrari'' Habte Giyorgis Dinagde to be unbendingly opposed, and so gave up. She did, however, ensure that special favorite foods and a constant supply of clothing and luxuries reached Iyasu at his place of arrest in Sellale.

===Rise of Tafari===
{{main article|Haile Selassie}}
{{see also|Rastafari}}
As Empress Zewditu's reign progressed, the difference in outlook gradually widened between her and her appointed heir, ''Ras'' [[Haile Selassie|Tafari Makonnen]]. Tafari was a moderniser, believing that Ethiopia needed to open itself to the world in order to survive. In this, he had the backing of many younger nobles. Zewditu, however, was a conservative, believing in the preservation of Ethiopian tradition. She had the strong backing of the church in this belief. Slowly, however, Zewditu began to withdraw from active politics, leaving more and more power to Tafari. Under Tafari's direction, Ethiopia entered the [[League of Nations]], and abolished [[slavery]]. Zewditu busied herself with religious activities, such as the construction of a number of significant churches.

In 1928 there was a [[Ethiopian coup d'état of 1928|small conservative uprising against Tafari's reforms]], but it was unsuccessful. Empress Zewditu was compelled to grant Tafari, who now controlled most of the Ethiopian government, the title of King (''Negus''). While ''Negus'' Tafari remained under the nominal rule of Zewditu (who was still ''Negeste Negest'', i.e. Empress), Tafari was now in effect the ruler of Ethiopia. A number of attempts were made to displace him, but they were all unsuccessful. In 1930, Zewditu's husband ''Ras'' Gugsa Welle led a [[Gugsa Welle's Rebellion (1930)|rebellion]] against ''Negus'' Tafari in [[Begemder]], hoping to end the regency in spite of his wife's repeated pleas and orders to desist, but was defeated and killed in battle by the modernised Ethiopian army at the [[Battle of Anchem]] on 31 March 1930.

==Death and succession==
On 2 April 1930, two days after ''Ras'' Gugsa Welle was killed in battle, Empress Zewditu died. It is known today that Zewditu suffered from [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and was seriously ill with [[typhoid]], but it is not universally agreed that this was the cause of her death. According to some popular histories, Zewditu died of shock and grief at hearing of her husband's death, but other accounts contradict this, claiming that Zewditu was not informed of the battle's outcome before her sudden death. Some diplomatic sources in Addis Ababa reported at the time that the fever-stricken Empress was immersed in a large container of frigidly cold holy water to cure her of her illness, but that her body went into shock and she died shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite book |last= Henze|first= Paul B. |title= Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia|year= 2000|publisher= Palgrave|location= New York|isbn=0-312-22719-1|page= 205}}</ref>

Zewditu was succeeded on the throne by ''Negus'' Tafari, who took the name of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]].
