'''Volker Kauder''' (born 3 September 1949) is a German lawyer and politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU). He served as [[parliamentary group leader]] of the ruling [[CDU/CSU faction]] in the German ''[[Bundestag]]'' from 2005 to 2018,<ref>http://volker-kauder.de/zur-person/kurz-vita/index.html</ref> during which he was frequently referred to as the "right hand" of  Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].<ref>[http://www.n-tv.de/politik/dossier/Volker-Kauder-im-Portraet-article164462.html Portrait on n-tv]</ref>

==Political career==
===Career in state politics===
Kauder was born in [[Hoffenheim]]. A student of the [[Hegau-Gymnasium]] in [[Singen]], he became a member of [[Young Union|Junge Union]] in the age of 17. In 1991, he became Secretary General of Baden-Würtemberg CDU and subsequently served as the party’s campaign manager for the state elections in 1992, 1996 and [[2001 Baden-Württemberg state election|2001]]. He served in this office until the resignation of party chairman [[Erwin Teufel]] in 2005.

===Career in national politics===
A trained lawyer, Kauder has been a member of the German [[Bundestag]] since the [[1990 German federal election|1990 elections]], representing the town of [[Rottweil]] in southwestern Germany.<ref>Patrick Donahue and Arne Delfs (August 13, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-13/merkel-ally-kauder-says-germany-unable-to-stop-u-k-exit-from-eu.html Merkel Ally Kauder Says Germany Unable to Stop U.K. Exit From EU] ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]''.</ref> In parliament, he first served on the Committee on Labour and Social Affairs. Between 1998 and 2002, he led the Bundestag group of CDU parliamentarians from [[Baden-Württemberg]]. In this capacity, he publicly endorsed [[Edmund Stoiber]] as the joint CDU/CSU candidate for the [[2002 German federal election|2002 national elections]].<ref>[http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/der-neue-cdu-general-hat-seinen-traumjob-aid-1.1609071 Der neue CDU-General hat seinen Traumjob] ''[[Rheinische Post]]'', January 24, 2005.</ref>

Kauder later served as First Parliamentary Secretary of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group from 2002 until 2005, under the leadership of the group’s then-chairwoman [[Angela Merkel]].

In early 2005, Merkel nominated Kauder as Secretary General of the CDU, after his predecessor [[Laurenz Meyer]] was forced to quit over payments he had received from his past employment with [[RWE]], the power company.<ref>Suneal Housely (August 19, 2005), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2bd3065e-10b0-11da-adc0-00000e2511c8.html German election - the key players] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Ahead of the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal elections]], he became Merkel’s confidante and campaign coordinator while spearheading CDU proposals to increase VAT by 2 per cent to fund non-wage labour cost-cutting.<ref>Suneal Housely (August 19, 2005), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2bd3065e-10b0-11da-adc0-00000e2511c8.html German election - the key players] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

Following his party’s victory in the elections, Kauder was elected chairman of the [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentary group in the [[Bundestag]]. He led the group with changing co-chairs from the CSU, [[Peter Ramsauer]] (2005–09), [[Hans-Peter Friedrich]] (2009-11), [[Gerda Hasselfeldt]] (2011-2018), and [[Alexander Dobrindt]] (2017-2018). Since 2005, he has served on the Committee on the Election of Judges (''Wahlausschuss''), which is in charge of appointing judges to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].

In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]], Kauder was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by [[Angela Merkel]], [[Horst Seehofer]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. 

In a surprising vote among members of the CDU/CSU group in September 2018, Kauder was ousted after 13 years as chair. His deputy [[Ralph Brinkhaus]] received 125 votes to Kauder's 112 in a secret ballot.<ref>[https://www.dw.com/en/merkel-ally-sent-packing-in-surprising-parliamentary-group-leadership-vote/a-45635982 Merkel ally sent packing in surprising parliamentary group leadership vote] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', September 25, 2018.</ref>

In 2019, Kauder announced that he would not stand in the [[2021 German federal election|2021 federal elections]] but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.<ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/volker-kauder-kandidiert-nicht-wieder-fuer-den-bundestag-a-1287878.html Früherer CDU-Fraktionschef Kauder kandidiert nicht wieder für den Bundestag] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', September 20, 2019.</ref>

===Social policy===
Kauder is strictly against recognizing [[Islam]] as an equal religion within Germany. In an interview with news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', he replied to the question if Islam is a part of Germany with: "No, Muslims are a part of Germany, Islam is not."<ref>{{citation

In response to increasing numbers of people leaving organized religion, Kauder also criticized the churches in Germany for not proselytizing enough.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/sinkende-mitgliederzahlen-kauder-liest-kirchen-die-leviten-1.1134582 ''Sinkende Mitgliederzahlen Kauder liest Kirchen die Leviten'', sueddeutsche.de, 24. August 2011]</ref> In 2011, he condemned Turkey’s record on religious freedom and suggested that [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|EU accession talks]] with [[Turkey]] should be suspended until the country supports the rights of Christians to ordain priests.<ref>Judy Dempsey (February 28, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/world/europe/01iht-germany01.html German Politicians Assail Turkish Leader Over Cultural Remarks] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

Kauder raised eyebrows in January 2005 when he compared draft [[anti-discrimination legislation]] to Nazi and Communist laws, arguing that the legislation would require people to hold the same political attitudes.<ref>Suneal Housely (August 19, 2005), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2bd3065e-10b0-11da-adc0-00000e2511c8.html German election - the key players] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> In September 2013, [[Claudia Roth]] of the Green Party criticized Kauder for his voting against the criminal liability of [[Marital rape|rape within a marriage]] in 1997.<ref>FAZ: [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/paedophilie-debatte-roth-wirft-union-scheinheiligkeit-vor-12577689.html Roth wirft Union Scheinheiligkeit vor], from 17. September 2013</ref>

In an interview with the German newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'' in December 2010, Kauder argued against the [[LGBT adoption|right of adoption for homosexual couples]], his reasoning being that he doesn't "believe that children would like to get raised in a homosexual partnership."<ref>„[http://www.fr-online.de/politik/-kinder-wollen-keine-homosexuellen-eltern-/-/1472596/5027496/-/view/index.html „Kinder wollen keine homosexuellen Eltern“] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214210846/http://www.fr-online.de/politik/-kinder-wollen-keine-homosexuellen-eltern-/-/1472596/5027496/-/view/index.html |date=2011-02-14 }}“ in Frankfurter Rundschau online, 19. December 2010, last accessed on 21. Dezember 2010</ref> His position regarding this topic was explained by several German media outlets with his closeness to the evangelical organisation Deutsche Evangelische Allianz.<ref>[http://www.taz.de/!63178/ ''Laizismus in Deutschland Die religiöse Zumutung'', taz.de, 21. December 2010]</ref>

When the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] ruled the unequal treatment of [[Civil union|registered civil partnership]]s and married couples regarding income splitting for spouses unconstitutional in May 2013,<ref>http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs20130507_2bvr090906.html</ref> Kauder expressed that with his party, there will not be any equality of traditionally married couples and homosexual partnerships.<ref>http://mobil.stern.de/politik/deutschland/nach-bvg-urteil-union-will-steuerliche-gleichbehandlung-fuer-homo-paare-2021874.html</ref> In June 2017, he voted against Germany’s introduction of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany|same-sex marriage]].<ref>[http://www.suedkurier.de/nachrichten/baden-wuerttemberg/Ehe-fuer-alle-So-haben-die-Abgeordneten-aus-unserer-Region-abgestimmt;art417930,9310851 Ehe für alle: So haben die Abgeordneten aus unserer Region abgestimmt] ''[[Südkurier]]'', June 30, 2017.</ref>

===European integration===
Kauder's criticism of British opposition to the introduction of a [[financial transaction tax]], to curb speculative trading in financial markets, was seized upon by British media in 2011 as an indication of a dire confrontation between the two governments of Germany and the United Kingdom.<ref>Quentin Peel (November 18, 2011), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2be04308-11f5-11e1-a114-00144feabdc0.html Cameron and Merkel bury differences] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> He courted controversy the same year when he declared, in the context of ongoing European [[austerity]] measures, that, "Suddenly Europe is speaking German."<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Now Europe Is Speaking German': Merkel Ally Demands that Britain 'Contribute' to EU Success|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/now-europe-is-speaking-german-merkel-ally-demands-that-britain-contribute-to-eu-success-a-798009.html|website = Spiegel Online|access-date = 27 January 2016|date = 15 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, Kauder criticized the [[European Central Bank]]'s measures to buy the debt of troubled [[eurozone]] states that request a European bailout and fulfill strict domestic policy conditions, arguing that "the ECB has reached the border of what is permitted, also because it is moving into the area of state financing."<ref>Gareth Jones (September 10, 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-eurozone-ecb-germany-idUSBRE88908S20120910 ECB plan puts independence in question: senior Merkel MP] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In discussions on whether there would be a renegotiation of France's 2015 deadline for bringing its deficit in line with the [[Stability and Growth Pact|EU Stability and Growth Pact]]’s limit of 3 percent, Kauder said in a parliamentary debate that it was "high time that everyone understood that we must uphold the rules that we have adopted as law".<ref>Stephen Brown (April 9, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-germany-france-idUSBREA380PZ20140409 Merkel ally warns against 'wrong signal' to France on deficit] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In August 2014, Kauder called for the [[EU]] to adopt common [[Arms industry|arms export]] regulations, saying there would be an increasing number of European defense companies in the future, "especially German-French ones."<ref>Michelle Martin (August 17, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/17/us-germany-arms-exports-idUSKBN0GH0O720140817 Senior Merkel ally calls for common European arms export rules] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Transatlantic relations===
Reacting to revelations about [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|NSA surveillance activities]] in Germany in 2013, Kauder blamed the [[United States]] for a "grave breach of trust" and demanded it should drop its "global power demeanor."<ref>Annika Breidthardt (October 27, 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/28/us-germany-usa-spying-idUSBRE99Q09F20131028 German paper says Obama aware of spying on Merkel since 2010] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> However, he did not want a publicly accessible investigation into the claims of US surveillance of chancellor Merkel's mobile phone, insisting that only a secretly operating committee can effectively handle the issue.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/union-lehnt-untersuchungsausschuss-zu-nsa-spaehskandal-ab-a-930127.html</ref>

In 2014, Kauder stated that the [[United States]] – through their military engagement in [[Iraq]] – “acquired a special responsibility for the country" and that "[i]t's the Americans' task to deal with security in Iraq."<ref>John Vinocur (June 23, 2014), [https://online.wsj.com/articles/the-west-at-its-worst-1403554234 The West at its Worst: America is weak, Europe is afraid, and the brutal men in Iraq and Iran all know it.] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>

Regarding the latest developments of the Euro crisis in Greece, Kauder stated in June 2015 that an essential condition for granting further financial aids for Greece would be that the IMF would be involved in the process as well, not only as a consultant but also financially.

===Corruption===
Kauder has voted no on legislative proposals against parliamentary corruption; he did so again in spring 2013.<ref>''[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/gesetz-gegen-abgeordneten-korruption-ausgebremst-vom-eigenen-bruder-1.1643935 Gesetz gegen Abgeordneten-Korruption: Ausgebremst vom eigenen Bruder]'', by [[Robert Roßmann]], ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 8. April 2013</ref>

===Smoking===
According to health politician [[Karl Lauterbach]] (SPD), Kauder was the driving force blocking a ban of smoking that Germany already in 2004 committed to the [[World Health Organization]] to introduce until 2010.<ref>[http://m.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/karl-lauterbach-kinder-sind-goldstaub-fuer-die-tabakindustrie-a-1203956.html "Kinder sind Goldstaub für die Tabakindustrie"], Claus Hecking, Spiegel Online, April 23, 2018</ref>

==Religious affiliation==
Volker Kauder is a confessing [[evangelical]] and has expressed his trust in the [[bible]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article4302613/Evangelikale-als-eine-Macht-in-der-deutschen-Politik.html German newspaper [[Die Welt]], August 11, 2009: Evangelikale als eine Macht in der deutschen Politik]</ref> He also supports persecuted christians in other countries.<ref>[https://www.tagesspiegel.de/meinung/im-rechten-glauben-kauder-im-kampf-gegen-die-christenverfolgung/4577852.html German newspaper [[Tagesspiegel]], September 6, 2011: Kauder im Kampf gegen die Christenverfolgung]</ref>

== Controversy ==
In 2015, Kauder provoked fury among fellow conservatives by proposing that MPs from the CDU/CSU parliamentary group who dissent on Greek bailout votes should be punished, warning that lawmakers should not expect positions on important parliamentary committees if they broke ranks.<ref>Stephen Brown (August 10, 2015), [http://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-aide-cracks-down-on-greek-bailout-rebels/ Merkel aide cracks down on bailout rebels] ''[[Politico]]''.</ref>
He was vocal in his disapproval of the Greek Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]'s rejection of offers throughout the negotiation process.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eric|first1=Kirschbaum|title=German party leader accuses Greek finance minister of 'trying to divide Europe'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/german-party-leader-accuses-greek-finance-minister-of-trying-to-divide-europe-2015-6|website=Reuters|accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref>
