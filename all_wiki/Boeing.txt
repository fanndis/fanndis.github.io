==History==
{{main|History of Boeing}}
The Boeing Company was started in 1916, when American lumber industrialist [[William E. Boeing]] founded Aero Products Company in Seattle, Washington. Shortly before doing so, he and Conrad Westervelt created the [[Boeing Model 1|"B&W" seaplane]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Boeing-Company|title=Boeing Company {{!}} Description, History, & Aircraft|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerotime.aero/en/civil/12736-boeing-100-years-history|title=History of Boeing: Pioneering aviation for 100 years|website=www.aerotime.aero|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In 1917, the organization was renamed Boeing Airplane Company, with William Boeing forming Boeing Airplane & Transport Corporation in 1928.<ref name=":1" /> In 1929, the company was renamed [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]], followed by the acquisition of several aircraft makers such as Avion, Chance Vought, Sikorsky Aviation, Stearman Aircraft, [[Pratt & Whitney]], and Hamilton Metalplane.<ref name=Britannica_Boe/>

In 1931, the group merged its four smaller airlines into [[United Airlines]]. In 1934, the manufacture of aircraft was required to be separate from air transportation.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Airlines|title=United Airlines {{!}} American corporation |website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> Therefore, Boeing Airplane Company became one of three major groups to arise from dissolution of United Aircraft and Transport; the other two entities were [[United Aircraft]] (later [[United Technologies]]) and United Airlines.<ref name=Britannica_Boe/><ref name=":2" />

In 1960, the company bought Vertol Corporation, which at the time, was the biggest independent fabricator of [[helicopter]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yucommentator.org/2019/12/crash-landing/|title=Crash Landing|date=2019-12-22|website=The Commentator|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> During the 1960s and 1970s, the company diversified into industries such as outer space travel, marine craft, agriculture, energy production and transit systems.<ref name=Britannica_Boe/>

In 1995, Boeing partnered with Russian, Ukrainian and Anglo-Norwegian organizations to create Sea Launch, a company providing commercial launch services sending satellites to geostationary orbit from floating platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/What_Happened_to_Sea_Launch_999.html|title=What Happened to Sea Launch|website=Space Daily|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In 2000, Boeing acquired the satellite segment of [[Hughes Electronics]].<ref name=Britannica_Boe>{{cite web |author=Stanley I.

The airline industry is responsible for about 11% of [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted by the U.S. transportation sector.<ref name="boe_energy" /> Aviation's share of the greenhouse gas emissions was poised to grow, as air travel increases and ground vehicles use more alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.<ref name="boe_energy"/> Boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80%.<ref name="boe_energy"/> The solution blends algae fuels with existing [[jet fuel]].<ref name="boe_energy">{{cite news |author=Ángel González |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/boeingaerospace/2003858756_boeingenergy30.html |title=To go green in jet fuel, Boeing looks at algae |work=The Seattle Times |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405100626/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/boeingaerospace/2003858756_boeingenergy30.html |archive-date=April 5, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Boeing executives said the company was collaborating with Brazilian biofuels maker [[Tecbio]], [[Aquaflow Bionomic]] of New Zealand, and other fuel developers around the world. As of 2007, Boeing had tested six fuels from these companies, and expected to test 20 fuels "by the time we're done evaluating them".<ref name="boe_energy"/> Boeing also joined other aviation-related members in the [[Algal Biomass Organization]] (ABO) in June 2008.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/06/first-airlines.html First Airlines and UOP Join Algal Biomass Organization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623084737/http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/06/first-airlines.html |date=June 23, 2008}}, Green Car Congress, June 19, 2008.</ref>

===Electric propulsion===
For NASA's N+3 future airliner program, Boeing has determined that [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric]] engine technology is by far the best choice for its subsonic design. Hybrid electric propulsion has the potential to shorten takeoff distance and reduce noise. Boeing created a team to study electric propulsion in future generation of subsonic commercial aircraft. SUGAR for Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research includes, BR&T, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, General Electric, and Georgia Tech. There are five main concepts of the team is reviewing. SUGAR Free and Refined SUGAR, are two concepts based on conventional aircraft similar to the 737. SUGAR High and SUGAR Volt, are both high span, strut-based wing concepts. The final concept is SUGAR Ray, which is a wing body hybrid. The SUGAR Volt concept has resulted in a drop in fuel burn of more than 70 percent and a reduction of total energy use by 55 percent. This reduction is the result of adding an electric battery gas turbine hybrid propulsion system.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2010/06/corp_envision_06_14_10.html |title=Boeing Feature Story: Envisioning tomorrow's aircraft |publisher=Boeing |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906062915/http://www.boeing.com/Features/2010/06/corp_envision_06_14_10.html |archivedate=September 6, 2013}}</ref>
