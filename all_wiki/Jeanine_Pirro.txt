She was a frequent contributor to [[NBC News]], including regular appearances on ''[[The Today Show]]''. She was also the first female judge elected in [[Westchester County]], New York.

Pirro was elected the first female [[District Attorney]] of Westchester County.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westchesterda.net/about-the-office/former-district-attorneys |title=Former District Attorneys |website=Westchester County District Attorney |access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref> As district attorney, Pirro gained visibility in cases of [[domestic abuse]] and crimes against the elderly. Pirro briefly sought the Republican nomination for [[United States Senate]] to run against [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2006, but dropped out to accept the nomination for [[New York Attorney General]], which she did not win. In 2018, she authored the book ''[[Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy]]''.

==Westchester County law career==
===Assistant District Attorney===
In 1975, District Attorney Carl Vergari appointed Pirro to the position of Assistant District Attorney of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] in New York State, where she began her career by writing appeals and handling minor cases. In 1977, Pirro approached Vergari and requested that he apply for a federal grant for local district attorney's offices to establish bureaus that specialized in [[domestic violence]]. She hoped that Vergari would take advantage of potential funding, as well as a 1977 change in New York law that moved many domestic violence cases from [[family court]] to [[criminal law|criminal court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/Reporter/3dseries/2010/2010_07943.htm |title=Richardson v. Richardson |last=Leventhal |first=J. |date=November 3, 2010 |website=New York State Law Reporting Bureau |access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref> Vergari agreed to apply for the grant, and his office became one of four in the nation to win the grant. In 1978, he appointed Pirro to be the first chief of the new Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Bureau. Pirro was known to be an aggressive bureau chief. Due to possible coercion, she had a strict policy against dropping cases at a victim's request.<ref name="The Observer">{{cite news |url=http://observer.com/2005/08/pirros-brief-da-says-she-remade-rules/ |title=Pirro's Brief: D.A. Says She Remade Rules |last1=Schneider-Mayerson |first1=Anna |date=August 22, 2005 |newspaper=[[The New York Observer]] |access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>

Many people praised Pirro for her passion as Domestic Violence Bureau Chief, but she attracted increasing criticism from some colleagues for what they considered her  "attention-grabbing" behavior and violations of tradition. On multiple occasions, Chief District Attorney Vergari spoke to Pirro concerning her violation of office policy. She had issued press releases with her own name—and not Vergari's—on top. The relationship between Pirro and Vergari disintegrated in the late 1980s, after Pirro claimed sole responsibility for the establishment of the Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Bureau.<ref name="The Observer"/>

On June 1, 1990, just five months prior to Pirro's first appearance on the ballot for County Court Judge, she attracted widespread attention for rushing to conduct a bedside investigation of Maria Amaya at the Intensive Care Unit of United Hospital in [[Port Chester]]. Amaya had been charged with four counts of second-degree murder for the deaths of her four children. She was a 36-year-old immigrant from [[El Salvador]] who had a history of being hospitalized for mental issues. Amaya had killed the four children and attempted suicide, believing that they were being corrupted by drugs and sex.<ref name="Pirro Mania"/>

Vergari had served as district attorney for Pirro's entire tenure as an assistant district attorney and her time on the bench. In 1999, he critiqued Pirro as "bright and capable" and someone who "plays hardball seeking publicity," but who was also "very self-centered in everything she does."<ref name="Pirro Mania"/> While recognized for her prosecution of domestic violence, she was criticized for her relative prosecutorial absence in bringing charges involving major public corruption or [[organized crime]].<ref name=garbage/> These criticisms intensified when Pirro's husband was later convicted of several felonies tied to [[organized crime]], including tax evasion and conspiracy.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/02/nyregion/pirro-sentenced-to-29-months-in-us-prison.html Spirro Sentenced] New York Times August 14, 2004, Retrieved December 18, 2019.</ref> "One would have to believe that there's no organized crime in Westchester County, not a single corrupt official, and every union in this county is as clean as the driven snow," according to William I. Aronwald, who headed the [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Federal Organized Crime Strike Force]] during the 1970s and who was targeted for assassination by [[Colombo crime family]] head [[Carmine Persico]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/nyregion/mob-figure-admits-roles-in-murders-including-judge-s.html Mob Figure Admits Roles In Murders, Including Judge's] New York Times August 14, 2004, Retrieved December 18, 2019.</ref>

During a 1986 abortive campaign for [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]], Pirro boasted to have never lost a case in "about 50 trials." This number was disputed when presented in 2005 to colleagues, who said that the real number of trials personally handled by Pirro "wasn't more than 10." Pirro's then-spokesman, Anne Marie Corbalis, contended only that Pirro had a "100% felony conviction rate" as an Assistant District Attorney.<ref name="The Observer"/>

===Court Judge===
Pirro left the District Attorney's office after her November 1990 election as a judge of the Westchester County Court. She had successfully run on the Republican and [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative]] party lines against Democratic nominee and [[New Castle, New York|New Castle]] Town Justice Lawrence D. Lenihan and [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]] nominee August C. Nimphius, Jr.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/nyregion/six-judicial-seats-are-on-nov-6-ballot.html |title=Six Judicial Seats Are on Nov. 6 Ballot |last1=Melvin |first1=Tessa |date=October 28, 1990 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref> When she was sworn in on January 1, 1991, Pirro became Westchester County's first female judge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} She was a judge for two years.

===District Attorney===
In November 1993, Pirro was elected Westchester County District Attorney; she was the first woman to hold that position. She was re-elected in 1997 and 2001. On May 23, 2005, Pirro announced that she would not seek re-election to a fourth term as Westchester County District Attorney.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050523/NEWS10/505230360/1026 |title=Jeanine Pirro will not seek re-election as county DA |first=Glenn |last=Blain |date=May 23, 2005 |newspaper=The Journal News |access-date=April 4, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525091645/http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050523%2FNEWS10%2F505230360%2F1026 |archive-date=May 25, 2005 }}</ref>

On December 31, 1993—within hours of Pirro's midnight inauguration as District Attorney—[[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps]] newspaper heiress [[Anne Scripps Douglas]] was savagely bludgeoned in the head with a hammer by her estranged husband, Scott Douglas, as she slept in their [[Bronxville, New York]], home. By the time police arrived, Scott Douglas had fled the scene. Anne Scripps Douglas died in the hospital on January 6. Scott Douglas subsequently committed suicide by jumping off the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. Pirro, already known as a passionate prosecutor of domestic violence cases, was a frequent presence in the media during the period between the murder and when Scott Douglas's body washed ashore in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] in early March 1994. This increase in Pirro's national profile led to her surfacing as a frequent guest on network and cable television news in June 1994, [[O. J. Simpson murder case|when O.J. Simpson was arrested for the murder of his ex-wife]], appearing frequently as a talking head for ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Larry King Live]]'', and ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]''.<ref name="The Observer"/><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/nymag/features/862/index3.html |last=Gray |first=Kevin |title=Pirro Mania |page=4 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>

Within months of taking office, Pirro undertook a costly renovation to the district attorney's facilities and expanded to an additional floor of the county courthouse. The largest expenses were a new kitchenette and a media room, costing $20,000, to assist Pirro's growing profile; additional expenditures were made to remodel her personal office with mahogany.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/nymag/features/862/index4.html |last=Gray |first=Kevin |title=Pirro Mania |page=5 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>

Pirro was the first female president of the [[District Attorneys Association of the State of New York|New York State District Attorneys Association]]. Also while district attorney, she was appointed by then-Governor [[George Pataki]] to chair the New York State Commission on Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board. Its report and recommendations resulted in legislation passing that enhanced protections of, and safeguards for, the victims of domestic abuse.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/people/judge-jeanine-pirro |title=Judge Jeanine Pirro |website=[[Fox News]] Insider |access-date=April 4, 2019}}</ref>

During her tenure as district attorney, she repeatedly refused to reopen the murder case of [[Jeffrey Deskovic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/pull-jeanine-pirro-show-jail-hell-article-1.321706 |title=Pull Pirro show for my jail hell |first=Rich |last=Schapiro |date=September 25, 2008 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |access-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref> In 1990, Deskovic was falsely convicted of killing a 15-year-old girl, and spent 16 years in prison before he was exonerated by [[DNA evidence]], and the real killer confessed to the crime. He later won a $41.6 million lawsuit against Daniel Stephens and Westchester County for his wrongful conviction.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/10/24/jeff-deskovic-wrongly-convicted-of-rape-and-murder-awarded-41-6-million-in-damages/ |title=Jeff Deskovic, wrongly convicted of rape and murder, awarded $41.6 million in damages |last1=Balko |first1=Radley |date=October 24, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref>

==Statewide political career==

=== 1986 Lieutenant Gubernatorial candidacy ===
On May 26, 1986, Pirro, then an assistant district attorney, was announced as the running mate of [[Westchester County Executive]] and presumptive Republican gubernatorial nominee [[Andrew P. O'Rourke|Andrew O'Rourke]]. Pirro was selected by O'Rourke and [[New York State Republican Committee]] Chairman Anthony J. Colavita after nearly a dozen individuals declined the position, including [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] Executive [[Ed Rutkowski]], [[Hempstead, New York|Hempstead]] Presiding Supervisor [[Thomas Gulotta]], and the Executives of [[Broome County, New York|Broome]] and [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida Counties]].
Colavita, who said at the press conference that he "had so many say 'no' to me (during the lieutenant governor search), it doesn't hurt anymore," pointed to Pirro's prosecutorial experience, ability to effectively use crime as an issue, Italian married name, youth, and status as a woman when asked about her strengths as a candidate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/27/nyregion/a-prosecutor-is-picked-to-run-with-o-rourke.html |title=A Prosecutor Is Picked To Run With O'Rourke |first=Frank |last=Lynn |date=May 27, 1986 |newspaper=The New York Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703163235/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/27/nyregion/a-prosecutor-is-picked-to-run-with-o-rourke.html |archive-date=July 3, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Pirro's selection frustrated many New York Republicans, with [[New York State Assembly|Assembly]] Minority Leader [[Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr.]] traveling on May 27 from [[Albany, New York|Albany]] to the first night of the State Republican Committee's Nominating Convention in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], to tell O'Rourke and Colavita that his conference was concerned by Pirro's lack of political experience or statewide stature. Many Republicans also worried that if Pirro were nominated, their ticket would be too geographically dominated by downstate and the suburbs, with O'Rourke, like Pirro, being from Westchester, and the presumptive nominees for attorney general, [[Peter T. King|Peter King]] and United States Senate, [[Alfonse D'Amato]] both hailing from [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]].<ref name="Lynn">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/29/nyregion/surprise-gop-candidate-leaves-race.html |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Frank |last=Lynn |title=Surprise G.O.P.

On May 28, just one day prior to the scheduled vote for the lieutenant gubernatorial nomination at the state party convention in Syracuse, Pirro announced her withdrawal from the race, saying that her husband could not disclose his legal clients or the couple's business interests (later revealed to have been her husband's partial ownership of a Connecticut garbage hauling company with alleged mafia connections),<ref name=garbage>[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/17/nyregion/she-s-a-politician-he-avoided-attention-not-anymore.html She's a Politician.

Pirro had privately informed O'Rourke and Colavita of her decision during the evening of May 27, and the two were generally supportive, telling the press that her departure had nothing to do with Rappleyea's intervention. Pirro was replaced just six hours after her announcement by Michael Kavanagh, the District Attorney of [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]].<ref name="Lynn"/>

===2006 U.S. Senate campaign===
On August 10, 2005, Pirro announced that she would seek the Republican nomination to challenge first-term incumbent [[United States Senator|senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], in the [[New York U.S. Senate election, 2006|2006 election for U.S. Senator from New York]]. Other Republicans who announced campaigns for the nomination were [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]], a former mayor of [[Yonkers]], William Brenner, an attorney in [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]], and attorney [[Edward F. Cox|Edward Cox]], the son-in-law of former president [[Richard Nixon]]. In a widely publicized moment when she was declaring her candidacy, Pirro misplaced page 10 of her speech and went silent for 32 seconds, something that was widely considered to have damaged her campaign before it even started.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/12/31/media_tip_how_to_recover_from_a_brain_freeze.html |title=Media Tip: How to Recover From a Brain Freeze |website=[[Political Wire]] |date=December 31, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122143001/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/12/31/media_tip_how_to_recover_from_a_brain_freeze.html |archive-date=January 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During an appearance at the Crime Victims Resource Center, Pirro described herself this way: "I am [[Red states and blue states|red]] on [[fiscal policy]]. I am [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and I support the [[Bush tax cuts|Bush tax cut]]... I have broad [[Red states and blue states|blue]] stripes when it comes to social issues...

On December 21, 2005, Pirro dropped out of the Senate race after continuing pressure from party chiefs. This decision was reached after a lagging fundraising effort, and polls that showed she would be easily defeated by Clinton (a [[Quinnipiac University]] poll forecast Pirro would lose to Clinton 62 percent to 30 percent). In a statement, she said "I have decided that my law enforcement background better qualifies me for a race for New York State attorney general than a race for the United States Senate."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/22/ap/politics/mainD8EL0AJ00.shtml |title=cbsnews.com |date=December 22, 2005 |website=CBS News }}{{dead link|date=May 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Spencer was eventually chosen as the Republican Party's nominee for the U.S. Senate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news/59855/spencer-wins-senate-nod--pirro-accepts-ag-spot-at-gop-convention |title=Spencer Wins Senate Nod, Pirro Accepts AG Spot At GOP Convention |website=[[NY1]] |date=May 31, 2006 |accessdate=December 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140707002123/http://www.ny1.com/content/news/59855/spencer-wins-senate-nod--pirro-accepts-ag-spot-at-gop-convention |archive-date=July 7, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Pirro was the host of Fox News' ''[[Justice with Judge Jeanine]]'', which premiered in January 2011. The program aired on weekends and focused on the big legal stories of the week.

"He should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at." Pirro asked the name of Cohen's father-in-law, but Trump replied, though regarding the affairs of a private citizen, "I don't know, but you'll find out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there."
