==History==
The University of Chicago Booth School of Business traces its roots back to 1898 when university faculty member [[James Laurence Laughlin]] chartered the College of Commerce and Politics,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/commercialeduca00coungoog|title=Commercial Education at Home and Abroad: A Comprehensive Handbook|last=Hooper|first=Frederick|last2=Graham|first2=James|date=1901|publisher=Macmillan and Company|pages=[https://archive.org/details/commercialeduca00coungoog/page/n211 141]|language=en}}</ref> which was intended to be an extension of the school's founding principles of "scientific guidance and investigation of great economic and social matters of everyday importance." The program originally served as a solely undergraduate institution until 1916, when academically oriented research masters and later doctoral-level degrees were introduced.

In 1916, the school was renamed the ''School of Commerce and Administration''. Soon after in 1922, the first [[doctorate]] program was offered at the school. In 1932, the school was rechristened as the ''School of Business''.<ref name="Facts" /> The School of Business offered its first [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) in 1935.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XdcpCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA442|title=The University of Chicago: A History|last=Boyer|first=John W.|date=2015-09-23|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226242514|language=en}}</ref> A landmark decision was taken by the school at about this time to concentrate its resources solely on graduate programs, and accordingly, the undergraduate program was phased out in 1942. In 1943, the school launched the first [[Executive MBA]] program. The school was renamed to ''Graduate School of Business'' (or more popularly, the ''GSB'') in 1959, a name that it held till 2008.  That year alumnus [[David G. Booth]] gave the school a gift valued at $300 million, and in honor of the gift the school was renamed the ''University of Chicago Booth School of Business''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/11/06/alumnus-david-booth-gives-300-million-university-chicago-booth-school-business-na |title=Alumnus David Booth gives $300 million; University of Chicago Booth School of Business.|work=University of Chicago News|date=November 8, 2008|access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref>

During the latter half of the twentieth century, the business school was instrumental in the development of the [[Chicago School of economics]], an economic philosophy focused on free-market, minimal government involvement, due to faculty and student interaction with members of the university's influential Department of Economics.  Other innovations by the school include initiating the first [[PhD]] program in business (1920), founding the first academic business journal (1928), offering the first Executive MBA ([[Master of Business Administration|EMBA]]) program (1943), and for offering the first weekend MBA program (1986).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9712/9712centennial2.html|title=Centennial Report, University of Chicago Magazine, December 1997|website=magazine.uchicago.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/history|title=History|website=The University of Chicago Booth School of Business}}</ref> Students at the school founded the [[National Black MBA Association]] (1972), and it is the only U.S. business school with permanent campuses on three continents: Asia (2000), Europe (1994), and North America (1898).

== Publications ==

=== ''Chicago Booth Review'' ===
''Chicago Booth Review'' is a magazine devoted to business research, particularly research conducted by Chicago Booth's own faculty. In addition to covering new findings in finance, behavioral science, economics, entrepreneurship, accounting, marketing, and other business-relevant subjects, the magazine features essays from Chicago Booth faculty and other academics. It is published quarterly in print and several times a week online.

''Chicago Booth Review'' is the most recent of several successive vehicles Chicago Booth has used to convey its intellectual capital to an outside audience. Starting in the 1960s, the school published the Selected Papers series, a collection of articles written by faculty members or excerpted from faculty speeches. In 1997, Booth launched ''Capital Ideas'' ({{ISSN|1934-0060}}) as a separate newsletter featuring articles about faculty research. That subsequently evolved into a quarterly magazine, which in 2016 relaunched as ''Chicago Booth Review''.
