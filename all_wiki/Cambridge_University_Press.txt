==History==
[[File: Cambridge University Press building.jpg|thumb|Cambridge University Press head office in Cambridge]]
[[File:Cambridge University Press building2.jpg|thumb|Cambridge University Press building in Cambridge]]
Cambridge University Press is the oldest university press in the world. It originated from [[letters patent]] granted to the [[University of Cambridge]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1534. Cambridge is one of the two [[privileged presses]] (the other being [[Oxford University Press]]). Authors published by Cambridge have included [[John Milton]], [[William Harvey]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Stephen Hawking]].<ref name=":2">{{cite book

University [[printing]] began in Cambridge when the first practicing University Printer, Thomas Thomas, set up a printing house in 1584.<ref name=":1" /> In July 1697 the [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] made a loan of £200 to the university "towards the printing house and press" and [[James Halman]], [[Registrary]] of the University, lent £100 for the same purpose.<ref>''The Cambridge University Press 1696—1712'' (CUP, 1966), p. 78</ref>

The press began using steam-powered machine presses by the 1850s. It was in this period that the Press turned down what later became the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] – a proposal for which was brought to Cambridge by [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] before he turned to Oxford.<ref name=":2" />

In 1975 the Press launched its English language teaching publishing business.<ref>{{cite web

 |url        = https://www.cambridge.org/about-us/who-we-are/history/timeline
 |access-date = 26 July 2019}}</ref> In 1981 the Press built a new purpose-built building named The Edinburgh Building with its adjoining warehouse to accommodate the Press's expansion. This site was sold to [[Cambridge Assessment]] in 2015 for the construction of The Triangle Building.

In 1986 the Press acquired the long-established Bible and prayer book publisher Eyre & Spottiswoode, which gave the Press the ancient and unique title of 'The Queen's Printer'.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Black|first1=Michael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gB4SzjmLvAC&q=cambridge+university+press+kevin+taylor&pg=PA58|title=A Short History of Cambridge University Press|last2=Black|first2=Michael H.|date=2000-03-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77572-4|language=en}}</ref>

In 1992 the Press opened a bookshop at 1 [[Trinity Street, Cambridge|Trinity Street]]. It the oldest known bookshop site in Britain.<ref>{{cite web

The Press bookshop showcases Press books as well as selling a wide selection of gifts, including mugs, diaries, bags, postcards, maps, and other Cambridge souvenirs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our Bookshop|url=https://www.cambridge.org/gb/about-us/visit-bookshop,%20https://www.cambridge.org/gb/about-us/visit-bookshop|access-date=2020-06-30|website=Cambridge University Press|language=en}}</ref>

In 2012 the Press sold its printing operation to MPG Books Group<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cambridge University Press ends printing after 400 years {{!}} The Bookseller|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/cambridge-university-press-ends-printing-after-400-years#:~:text=with%20MPG...-,More%20than%20400%20years%20of%20printing%20under%20the%20Cambridge%20University,take%20over%20printing%20for%20CUP.|access-date=2020-06-30|website=www.thebookseller.com}}</ref> and CUP now uses third parties around the world to provide its print publications.

== Controversies ==

===Alms for Jihad===
{{Main| Alms for Jihad}}
In 2007, controversy arose over the Press's decision to destroy all remaining copies of its 2006 book ''[[Alms for Jihad|Alms for Jihad: Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World]]'', by Burr and Collins, as part of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Saudi billionaire [[Khalid bin Mahfouz]].<ref>{{cite web

  | access-date = 4 May 2011}}</ref> Within hours, ''Alms for Jihad'' became one of the 100 most sought after titles on [[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]] in the [[United States]]. The Press sent a letter to libraries asking them to remove copies from circulation. The Press subsequently sent out copies of an "errata" sheet for the book.

The [[American Library Association]] issued a recommendation to libraries still holding ''Alms for Jihad'': "Given the intense interest in the book, and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand, we recommend that U.S. libraries keep the book available for their users." The publisher's decision did not have the support of the book's authors and was criticized by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that English libel laws were excessively strict.<ref>{{cite web

=== China Quarterly ===
On 18 August 2017, following an "instruction" from a Chinese import agency, Cambridge University Press used the functionality that had been built into Cambridge Core to temporarily delete politically sensitive articles from [[the China Quarterly]] on its Chinese website. The articles focused on topics China regards as taboo, including the 1989 [[Tiananmen massacre]], [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]]’s [[Cultural Revolution]], Hong Kong's [[2014 Hong Kong protests|fight for democracy]] and ethnic tensions in [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-40975474|title=《中國季刊》:對中國刪300多篇文章深表關注|date=18 August 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/about-us/media/press-releases/cambridge-university-press-statement-regarding-content-china-quarterly/|title=Cambridge University Press statement regarding content in The China Quarterly|website=Cambridge University Press|language=en|access-date=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@millwarj/open-letter-to-cambridge-university-press-about-its-censorship-of-the-journal-china-quarterly-c366f76dcdac|title=Open Letter to Cambridge University Press about its censorship of the China Quarterly|last=Millward|first=James A.|date=19 August 2017|website=Medium|access-date=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/20/cambridge-university-press-censorship-exposes-xi-jinpings-authoritarian-shift|title=Cambridge University Press censorship 'exposes Xi Jinping's authoritarian shift'|last=Phillips|first=Tom|date=20 August 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 August 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
