"'''Perfect Illusion'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It was released for digital download on September 9, 2016 through [[Interscope Records]] as the lead single from her fifth studio album, ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016). The track was written and produced by Gaga, [[Kevin Parker (musician)|Kevin Parker]], [[Mark Ronson]] and [[BloodPop]]. A [[Pop music|pop]], [[dance-rock]] and [[pop rock]] song, "Perfect Illusion" lyrically delves on the singer's "highest of highs and lowest of lows" in a relationship, and is ultimately a commentary on [[social media]]. Gaga wrote the lyrics using her [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]] [[typewriter]]; after numerous permutations the composers derived the final track. Speculation that the song referred to Gaga's ex-boyfriend [[Taylor Kinney]] was refuted by the singer.

The recording's release was preceded by multiple teasers and [[collage]] of images on the singer's social media accounts. [[Music journalism|Music critics]] gave mixed to positive reviews for "Perfect Illusion", with many of them noting similarities to the work of American musician [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Commercially, the song reached number 15 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as entered a number of subordinate charts. It achieved the top position in France, and in the digital charts of Finland and Greece, and the top 10 in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Scotland and Slovakia.

The music video that accompanied "Perfect Illusion" was directed by Ruth Hogben and Andrea Gelardin. It premiered during the second season of television series ''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. The video shows Gaga dancing and singing the song in a desert during a [[rave]], with guest appearances by the songwriters and producers. Critics both praised and gave negative feedback regarding the simplicity of the clip. The singer performed "Perfect Illusion" on her [[Dive Bar Tour (Lady Gaga)|Dive Bar Tour]] and [[Joanne World Tour]], as well during television and media appearances.

== Background and development ==
Following the release of her third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013), Gaga changed management and joined Artist Nation—an artist management division of [[Live Nation Entertainment]]—along with her manager Bobby Campbell. She also underwent an image overhaul, showcasing more stress on her vocal prowess and subdued image in the media.<ref name="inside">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6494560/inside-lady-gaga-reinvention-long-term-plan|title=Inside Lady Gaga's Latest Reinvention (It's All Part of a Long-Term Plan)|last=Hampp|first=Andrew|date=March 8, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-date=March 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308080718/http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6494560/inside-lady-gaga-reinvention-long-term-plan|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/oscars-2015/show|title=Oscars 2015: The Show|first=Patrick|last=Fallon|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=February 23, 2015|archive-date=February 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223080026/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/oscars-2015/show|url-status=live}}</ref> Among other musical endeavors, Gaga released a collaborative jazz record with American singer [[Tony Bennett]] titled ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'' in 2014,<ref name="press">{{cite press release|url=http://www.universalmusic.ca/press-releases/tony-bennett-lady-gaga-cheek-to-cheek-album-of-classic-jazz-standards-to-be-released-september-23/|title=Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga: ''Cheek to Cheek'' Album of Classic Jazz Standards To Be Released September 23|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=July 30, 2014|publisher=[[Universal Music Canada]]|location=Toronto|archive-date=August 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051628/http://www.universalmusic.ca/press-releases/tony-bennett-lady-gaga-cheek-to-cheek-album-of-classic-jazz-standards-to-be-released-september-23/|url-status=live}}</ref> which won the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/08/grammy-winners-list-2015_n_6600948.html|title=Grammy Winners List For 2015 Includes Beyoncé, 'Frozen' & Kendrick Lamar|last=Rosen|first=Christopher|date=February 8, 2015|accessdate=February 8, 2015|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|archive-date=February 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209033006/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/08/grammy-winners-list-2015_n_6600948.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2016, Gaga confirmed that she would be releasing her fifth studio album later that year, with her working on the logistics and aspects—including the looks she would portray for the record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6836499/lady-gaga-hints-2016-album-release|title=Lady Gaga Hints at New Album Release in 2016|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=August 18, 2016|work=Billboard|archive-date=September 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918015828/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6836499/lady-gaga-hints-2016-album-release|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2725982/lady-gaga-new-album-2016/|title=Lady Gaga Confirms New Album in 2016, And A New Look|last=Bell|first=Crystal|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=August 18, 2016|publisher=[[MTV News]]|archive-date=September 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914052748/http://www.mtv.com/news/2725982/lady-gaga-new-album-2016/|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to BloodPop, there was no conversation about what the song should sound like, they "all kind of spoke a similar language".<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> The track's arrangement was done by Ronson who played synths and guitar with Parker. They were joined by [[Josh Homme]] on the guitar, while BloodPop developed the rhythm and synthesis, alongside Parker playing drums.<ref name="bbc1"/> Ronson and BloodPop's production were bridged together through Parker's use of [[Ableton]].<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

At the session, Gaga led the direction of the production based on her preferences and influences, and used a piano and guitar to compose the song. Ronson explained that during their sessions Gaga was deeply involved with the technicalities of the music being recorded. Concerning this he confessed, "[Gaga] loves just sitting at a piano and barking orders at a drummer and she has an incredible voice," further clarifying that they would begin with the songs first and then go with the other aspects of the composition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7624105/mark-ronson-lady-gaga-new-album-beats-1-interview|last=Daw|first=Robbie|title=Mark Ronson Opens Up About Working On Lady Gaga's New Album|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=August 15, 2016|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|archive-date=May 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531084714/http://www.idolator.com/7624105/mark-ronson-lady-gaga-new-album-beats-1-interview|url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', BloodPop recalled the singer being omnipresent always and it was her decisions which finalized the track's sound.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

Gaga wrote the lyrics using her [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]] [[typewriter]].<ref name="bbc1"/> They were developed several hours into the session, though according to BloodPop, "Every few days, a lyric would change and it'd get better and better".<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> In an interview for [[BBC Radio 1]], Gaga explained that they "would bounce lyrics back and forth", adding: "We stripped everything away. Changed the melody, shifted it.

In Malibu, they recorded at Shangri-La Studios, which BloodPop preferred since it was outside the influence of city life.

=== Production and synopsis ===
A [[music video]] for the song was directed by Ruth Hogben and Andrea Gelardin, who had also shot the cover artwork.<ref name="vidrelease">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7511150/lady-gaga-perfect-illusion-video-date|title=Lady Gaga's 'Perfect Illusion' Video Is Just Days Away|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=September 16, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2016|work=Billboard|archive-date=September 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917041938/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7511150/lady-gaga-perfect-illusion-video-date|url-status=live}}</ref> According to ''[[New York Post|Page Six]]'', the clip was filmed in a desert outside Los Angeles over the course of two days. Gaga's longtime collaborator Brandon Maxwell did the fashion style for the production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pagesix.com/2016/09/03/lady-gaga-shoot-new-music-video-in-the-desert/|title=Lady Gaga shoots new music video in the desert|last=Siegler|first=Mara|date=September 3, 2016|accessdate=September 5, 2016|work=[[New York Post|Page Six]]|archive-date=September 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905194436/http://pagesix.com/2016/09/03/lady-gaga-shoot-new-music-video-in-the-desert/|url-status=live}}</ref> Hogben and Gelardin has been associated for the past 10 years with Gaga, working on different projects. Stylistically, collaborating on ''Joanne'' was a different experience for them. They were present in the recording studio with the singer and Ronson during conception of several tracks and the album's journey helped them understand Gaga's intent with the music. Since "Perfect Illusion" is an "energetic" track they wanted the video to reflect that. It was Gaga's idea to envision the clip as a performance, which became the starting point for Gelardin and Hogben. They wanted her to perform in between people instead on a stage, and asked Ronson, Parker and BloodPop to play cameos.<ref name="vmagcollab"/><ref name="rsvid"/> While being interviewed by ''[[V (American magazine)|V]]'' magazine, the directors elaborated further:
<blockquote>
"We wanted the video to show her without artifice, in a way that her videos may not have done in the past. There is a simplicity in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the [[Ford Bronco|Bronco]] herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic."<ref name="vmagcollab">{{cite web|url=http://vmagazine.com/article/lady-gagas-collaborators-making-joanne/|title=Lady Gaga's Collaborators Reflect on Creating 'Joanne'|last=Defebaugh|first=William|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=December 17, 2016|work=[[V (American magazine)|V]]|archive-date=December 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217042226/http://vmagazine.com/article/lady-gagas-collaborators-making-joanne/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Spencer Kornhaber from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' had hoped that after the ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'' era, Gaga would return to make her music video releases as events, like her previous albums, however he was disappointed that the video for "Perfect Illusion" was toned down. He felt the editing to be "excellently chaotic", and noted that Gaga's shots were filmed at a sped up rate than the others. Other observations included "something strange" with Gaga's eyes, which he theorized was either due to the makeup or her contact lenses "to make the whites bigger", or the directors wanted her to "roll her pupils back". He found Gaga's "fierce, hungry, and perhaps coked out" look fitted with the song's drug references. Kornhaber finished the review saying that the although the clip was "not a work of provocation", it still appeared a brave step since none of the singer's contemporaries would have attempted "something so raw and low-concept".<ref name="atlanticvid">{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/09/lady-gaga-perfect-illusion-video/500927/|title=Will Rock and Roll Save Lady Gaga?|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=December 16, 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|archive-date=December 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174319/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/09/lady-gaga-perfect-illusion-video/500927/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[HuffPost]]''{{'}}s Daniel Welsh felt disappointed watching "Perfect Illusion", since according to him Gaga has an "impressive track record when it comes to videos".<ref name="huffvid">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lady-gaga-perfect-illusion-video_uk_57e26d73e4b0db20a6e7c86f|title=Lady Gaga's 'Perfect Illusion' Music Video Is Here...
