{{Politics of the Republic of China}}

The '''president of the Republic of China'''{{NoteTag|sometimes known as the '''President of China''', '''President of Nationalist China'''<ref>{{cite news |title=Chiang Kai-shek heads for exile |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1949/01/21/Chiang-Kai-shek-heads-for-exile/8351901711848/ |accessdate=1 November 2020 |agency=United Press International |date=21 January 1949}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Mann |first1=Jim |title=1936 Incident Still Echoes in China Rivalry |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-12-12-mn-2567-story.html?_amp=true |accessdate=1 November 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=12 December 1986}}</ref> or '''President of Taiwan'''}} is the [[head of state]] of the Republic of China (ROC), commonly known as [[Taiwan]], and [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]].

Since [[1996 Taiwanese presidential election|1996 presidential election]], the president is [[directly elected]] by [[plurality voting]] to a four-year term, with incumbents limited to serving two terms. The incumbent, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], succeeded [[Ma Ying-jeou]] on May 20, 2016, to become the first female president in the history of Taiwan.

==Powers==
[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|left|The [[Presidential Office Building|Presidential Building]] in [[Zhongzheng District]], [[Taipei]] houses the office of the ROC President currently.]]
[[File:Fongshan Administration Center, Kaohsiung City Government 20140720.jpg|thumb|left|The Presidential Southern Office in [[Fengshan District]], [[Kaohsiung]] opened on 10 March 2017.]]
[[File:臺中市政府陽明大樓.JPG|thumb|left|The Presidential Central Office in [[Fengyuan District]], [[Taichung]] opened on 18 March 2017.]]

The president is currently elected by a [[plurality voting]] [[Presidential elections in Taiwan|direct election]] of the areas administered by the Republic of China for a term of four years.  Before 1991, the president was selected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]] for a term of six years.

The Constitution names the president as head of state and [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] (formerly known as the [[National Revolutionary Army]]).  The president is responsible for conducting foreign relations, such as concluding treaties, declaring war, and making peace.  The president must promulgate all laws and has no right to veto.  Other powers of the president include granting amnesty, pardon or clemency, declaring martial law, and conferring honors and decorations.

The President can appoint [[senior advisor]]s ({{lang|zh-hant|[[:zh:中華民國總統府資政|資政]]}}), National Policy Advisors ({{lang|zh-hant|[[:zh:中華民國總統府國策顧問|國策顧問]]}}) and Strategy Advisors ({{lang|zh-hant|[[:zh:中華民國總統府戰略顧問|戰略顧問]]}}), but they do not form a [[Council of State|council]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.president.gov.tw/en/prog/news_release/document_content.php?id=1105495950&pre_id=1105498161&site=&menu_id=&file_name=&group=&g_category_number=264&category_number_2=149 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223160812/http://www.president.gov.tw/en/prog/news_release/document_content.php?id=1105495950&pre_id=1105498161&site=&menu_id=&file_name=&group=&g_category_number=264&category_number_2=149 |archive-date=23 February 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawSingle.aspx?PCode=A0010012&FLNO=15 |script-title=zh:中華民國總統府組織法§15-全國法規資料庫入口網站|publisher=}}</ref>

The Constitution does not clearly define whether the president is more powerful than the [[Premier of the Republic of China|premier]], as it names the [[Executive Yuan]] (headed by the premier) as the "highest administrative authority" with oversight over domestic matters while giving the president powers as commander-in-chief of the military and authority over foreign affairs. Prior to his election as president in 1948, Chiang Kai-shek had insisted that he be premier under the new Constitution, while allowing the president (to which Chiang nominated [[Hu Shih]]) be a mere figurehead.<ref>U.S. Department of State, ''The China White Paper'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1967), 273.</ref> However, the National Assembly overwhelmingly supported Chiang as president and once in this position, Chiang continued to exercise vast prerogatives as leader and the premiership served to execute policy, not make it. Thus, until the 1980s power in the Republic of China was personalized rather than institutionalized which meant that the power of the president depended largely on who occupied the office.  For example, during the tenure of [[Yen Chia-kan]], the office was largely ceremonial with real power in the hands of [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Chiang Ching-Kuo]], and power switched back to the presidency when Chiang became president. After President [[Lee Teng-hui]] succeeded Chiang as president in 1988, the power struggle within the KMT extended to the constitutional debate over the relationship between the president and the premier. The first three premiers under Lee, [[Yu Kuo-hwa]], [[Lee Huan]], and [[Hau Pei-tsun]] were [[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s who had initially opposed Lee's ascension to power. The appointment of Lee and Hau were compromises by President Lee to placate conservatives in the KMT. The subsequent appointment of the first native Taiwanese premier [[Lien Chan]] was taken as a sign of Lee's consolidation of power. Moreover, during this time, the power of the premier to approve the president's appointments and the power of the Legislative Yuan to confirm the president's choice of premier was removed establishing the president as the more powerful position of the two.

After the 2000 election of [[Chen Shui-bian]] as president, the presidency and the [[Legislative Yuan]] were controlled by different parties which brought forth a number of latent constitutional issues such as the role of the legislature in appointing and dismissing a premier, the right of the president to call a special session of the legislature, and who has the power to call a referendum.  Most of these issues have been resolved through inter-party negotiations.

==Succession==
{{Presidential orders of succession}}
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek 1947.jpg|thumb|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and Army General [[Li Tsung-jen]] were elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] to be the first-term president and vice president on 20 May 1948.]]

The [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] gives a short list of persons who will succeed to the presidency if the office were to fall vacant.  According to the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution]], Article 2:<ref name=AdditionalArticles>{{Cite web | url=http://www.president.gov.tw/en/prog/news_release/document_content.php?id=1105496084&pre_id=&g_category_number=409&category_number_2=373&layer=&sub_category= | title=中華民國總統府}}</ref>

{{quote|Should the office of the vice president become vacant, the president shall nominate a candidate(s) within three months, and the Legislative Yuan shall elect a new vice president, who shall serve the remainder of the original term until its expiration.}}

{{quote|Should the offices of both the president and the vice president become vacant, the president of the Executive Yuan shall exercise the official powers of the president and the vice president. A new president and a new vice president shall be elected in accordance with Paragraph 1 of this article and shall serve out each respective original term until its expiration. The pertinent provisions of Article 49 of the Constitution shall not apply.}}

As no president of the Executive Yuan (also known as the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]]) has ever succeeded to the presidency under these provisions (or their predecessors, under Article 49), it is untested whether, should the office of the premier be vacant as well, whether, pursuant to the Additional Articles, Article 3, the vice president of the Executive Yuan (vice premier), who would be acting premier, would act as president.<ref name=AdditionalArticles/>  There is currently no constitutional provision for a succession list beyond the possibility that the vice president of the Executive Yuan might succeed to the presidency.

Assuming that the vice president of the Executive Yuan would be third in line for the presidency, the current line of succession is:
# [[Lai Ching-te]], [[Vice President of the Republic of China]]
# [[Su Tseng-chang]], [[President of the Executive Yuan]]
# [[Shen Jong-chin]], [[Vice President of the Executive Yuan]]

Presidential succession has occurred three times under the 1947 Constitution:
#President [[Chiang Kai-shek]] declared incapacity on 21 January 1949 amid several Communist victories in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and was replaced by Vice President [[Li Tsung-jen]] as the Acting President. However, Chiang continued to wield authority as the Director-General of the [[Kuomintang]] and Commander-in-Chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]]. Li Tsung-jen lost the ensuing power struggle and fled to the [[United States]] in November 1949. Chiang evacuated with the government to Taiwan on 10 December 1949 and resumed his duties as the President on 1 March 1950.
#President Chiang Kai-shek died on 5 April 1975 and was replaced by Vice President [[Yen Chia-kan]] who served out the remainder of the term.
#President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] died on 13 January 1988 and was replaced by Vice President [[Lee Teng-hui]] who served out the remainder of the term and won two more terms on his own right.

==Diplomatic protocol==
[[File:Pope johnpaul funeral politics.jpeg|thumb|At the [[funeral of Pope John Paul II]], President Chen Shui-bian (''far left''), whom the Holy See recognized as the head of state of China, was seated in the front row ([[List of dignitaries at the funeral of Pope John Paul II|in French alphabetical order]]) beside the first lady and president of Brazil.]]

The diplomatic [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] regarding the President of the ROC is rather complex because of the [[political status of Taiwan]]. In the [[foreign relations of Taiwan|nations that have diplomatic relations with the ROC]], she is accorded the standard treatment that is given to a [[head of state]]. In other nations, she is formally a private citizen, although even in these cases, travel usually meets with strong objections from the People's Republic of China.

The President of ROC has traveled several times to the [[United States]], formally in transit to and from Central America, where a number of countries do recognize the ROC.  This system allows the President to visit the United States without the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] having to issue a visa. During these trips, the President is not formally treated as a head of state, does not meet U.S. government officials in their official capacities and does not visit [[Washington, D.C.]] However, in these visits, the ROC President invariably meets with staff members from the US government, although these visits are with lower-ranking officials in non-governmental surroundings.

In the area of [[Southeast Asia]], the ROC President was able to arrange visits in the early 1990s which were formally private tourist visits, however these have become increasingly infrequent as a result of PRC pressure.

At the annual [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] leaders' summit, the ROC President is forbidden from attending personally and must send a [[List of Chinese Taipei Representatives to APEC|special envoy]] to represent him or her at the event.

However, on 2 December 2016, U.S. President-elect [[Donald Trump]] accepted [[Trump–Tsai call|a congratulatory telephone call]] from the ROC President, a clear break from prior protocol.

{{anchor|Leader of the Taiwan Area}}
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] uses the terms '''Leader of the Taiwan Area''', '''Leader of the Taiwan Region''' ({{zh|t=台灣地區領導人|s=台湾地区领导人|p=Táiwān dìqū lǐngdǎorén|first=t}}) and '''Leader of the Taiwanese Authorities''' ({{zh|labels=no |first=t |t=台灣當局領導人|s=台湾当局领导人|p=Táiwān dāngjú lǐngdǎo rén}}) to describe the [[head of state]] of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) in [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan]]. These terms are used by PRC media to reflect the PRC's [[Political status of Taiwan|official stance]] of not recognizing the ROC as an independent state. 

The PRC media does not use the terms ''"President of Taiwan"'' nor ''"President of the Republic of China"'', which could be inferred as implying recognition of Taiwan as a country, or of [[Two Chinas]]. Hence, the term ''"Leader of the Taiwan Area"'' is used- with "Area" to show that Taiwan is not a country; while "Leader" does not equal "President". According to criteria set by the authorities in Beijing, media in mainland China generally are not allowed to use terms related to the Republic of China to describe the Taiwan authorities. But if the official title cannot be avoided in a news article, quotation marks would be used around terms for all official ROC positions and organizations, e.g. "President of the Republic of China"; "Presidential Office Building" to imply non-recognition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fjsen.com/taiwan/2009-06/03/content_716258.htm|title=Claimed he was the "President of Taiwan" – Ma Ying-jeou: Did not mean Taiwan as a country|publisher=Southeast News|date=2009-06-03|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tw.people.com.cn/GB/14812/14875/7032360.html|script-title=zh:台湾地区领导人选举结束 马英九、萧万长获胜|author=907|publisher=}}</ref> For other countries without official diplomatic ties, terms such as '''Taiwan's President''' have been used. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ait.org.tw/taiwan-inauguration-of-president-tsai-ing-wen|title=Press Statement Michael R.

== History ==
After the outbreak of the [[Wuchang Uprising]] against [[Qing Dynasty|Qing rule]] in 1911, [[1911 Republic of China provisional presidential elections|the revolutionaries elected]] [[Sun Yat-sen]] as the "[[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|provisional president]]" ({{lang|zh-Hant|臨時大總統}}) of the transitional government, with the Republic of China officially established on 1 January 1912. But Sun soon resigned from the provisional presidency in favor of [[Yuan Shikai]], who assumed the title "Great President" ({{lang|zh-hant|大總統}}) in March 1912.  Yuan induced the [[Puyi|Last Emperor]] to abdicate, ending thousands of years of imperial rule in China.  The 1913 Constitution called for a strong [[presidential system]] with notable [[Separation of powers|checks]] on the president by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]]. However, Yuan soon began to assert dictatorial power, ignoring the National Assembly and later abolishing it altogether. In 1915, Yuan proclaimed himself [[Empire of China (1915-1916)|Emperor of China]] in a largely unpopular move and was forced to retract his declaration shortly before his death in 1916.

With Yuan Shikai's death the [[Warlord Era]] began. Vice President [[Li Yuanhong]] succeeded Yuan as president and attempted to reassert the constitutional government, but was soon forced to resign by military strongmen. The presidency, though leading an internationally recognized government, was thereafter to be headed by a series of prominent warlords. This presidency ended in 1928 when the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], led by the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), succeeded in [[Chinese reunification (1928)|conquering North China]].

Sun Yat-sen established a rival (military, not constitutional) government in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917 and took the title of "Generalissimo of the Military Government" ({{zh |labels = no |t = 海陸軍大元帥 |l = Grand Marshal of the Navy and Army }}). He was ousted in 1918 but returned again to Guangzhou in 1921. Claiming to restore the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]], he summoned the members of the original parliament to elect him as president, but since there lacked a quorum, he took the title of "Extraordinary President" ({{lang|zh-Hant|非常大總統}}). Sun, again expelled from Guangzhou in 1922, returned in 1923 to take the title of "Generalissimo of the Military Government." Sun died in 1925 with no clear successor and leadership of the government, now named the [[National Government of the Republic of China|Nationalist Government]], rested in a series of [[Leninist]]-style dual party and state committees, the most powerful of which was the policy-making Central Executive Committee of the [[Kuomintang]]. The government was organized into five branches, with the [[Executive Yuan]], headed by the [[premier of the Republic of China|premier]], holding primary administrative authority. The "Chairman of the Nationalist Government," though not given specific presidential powers, took on the functions of a ''de facto'' head of state and its official English translation was "President of the National Government of the Republic of China". This form of government under the KMT lasted through the Northern Expedition, which moved the capital to Nanjing and gave the Nationalist Government domestic control and foreign recognition, and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], during which the Japanese established puppet Nationalist Governments with almost the identical organizational structure, until the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1947.

Following the Chinese victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalist Government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was restored in Nanjing and the KMT set out to enact a [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] Constitution in line with the last stage of Sun Yat-sen's three stages of national development. The new [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], promulgated on 25 December 1947, established a five-branch government with the office of president ({{lang|zh-hant|總統}}) as head of state. On 20 May 1948, Chiang Kai-shek was formally elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] to be the first term president.

After the KMT lost the Mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, the government was evacuated to Taiwan, where the term limits for the President specified in the 1947 constitution were suspended after 1960.{{NoteTag|According to the Constitution, the president can be reelected once. The term length is six years. Since the constitution was suspended, president Chiang Kai-shek continued to be elected until his death.}} In 1954, as the term of the first National Assembly were about to expire, the Judicial Yuan ruled that the expired seats of the National Assembly would continue in power until the respective delegate region elections could be held. This largely froze the membership of the National Assembly mainland delegates and prevented local Taiwanese from widespread legislative and assembly participation in the expired mainland seats until the early 1970s. The members of the National Assembly continued in their office until 1991, and continued to elect Chiang Kai-shek as president until his death in 1975.

Presidents were elected by the National Assembly until the first [[1996 Taiwan presidential election|direct presidential election]] in 1996, while the term length was shortened from six to four years.
