'''Spinal disc herniation''' is an injury to the cushioning and connective tissue between [[vertebrae]], usually caused by excessive strain or trauma to the spine. It may result in back pain, pain or sensation in different parts of the body, and physical [[disability]]. The most conclusive diagnostic tool for disc [[hernia]]tion is [[MRI]], and treatment may range from painkillers to surgery. Protection from disc herniation is best provided by [[Core (anatomy)|core]] strength and an awareness of body mechanics including [[Good posture|posture]]. {{medical citation needed|date=January 2019}}

When a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an [[intervertebral disc]] allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings, the disc is said to be herniated.

Disc herniation is frequently associated with age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the ''[[Annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|annulus fibrosus]]'', but is normally triggered by [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or straining by lifting or twisting. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the [[posterior longitudinal ligament]] in the spinal canal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com/Chapter_3.html|title=Backache: From Occiput to Coccyx |first=Gerald L. |last=Burke |publisher=MacDonald Publishing |access-date=2013-02-14}}</ref> A tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing [[inflammation]], which can result in severe pain even in the absence of [[nerve root]] compression.

Disc herniation is normally a further development of a previously existing [[disc protrusion]], in which the outermost layers of the ''annulus fibrosus'' are still intact, but can bulge when the disc is under pressure. In contrast to a herniation, none of the central portion escapes beyond the outer layers. Most minor herniations heal within several weeks. Anti-inflammatory treatments for pain associated with disc herniation, protrusion, bulge, or disc tear are generally effective. Severe herniations may not heal of their own accord and may require surgery.

The condition may be referred to as a ''slipped disc'', but this term is not accurate as the spinal discs are firmly attached between the vertebrae and cannot "slip" out of place.

==Signs and symptoms==
Typically, symptoms are experienced on one side of the body only.

Symptoms of a herniated disc can vary depending on the location of the herniation and the types of soft tissue involved. They can range from little or no pain, if the disc is the only tissue injured, to severe and unrelenting [[neck pain]] or [[low back pain]] that radiates into regions served by nerve roots which have been irritated or impinged by the herniated material. Often, herniated discs are not diagnosed immediately, as patients present with undefined pains in the thighs, knees, or feet.

Symptoms may include sensory changes such as numbness, tingling, [[paresthesia]], and motor changes such as muscular weakness, paralysis, and affection of [[reflex]]es. If the herniated disc is in the lumbar region, the patient may also experience [[sciatica]] due to irritation of one of the nerve roots of the [[sciatic nerve]]. Unlike a pulsating pain or pain that comes and goes, which can be caused by muscle spasm, pain from a herniated disc is usually continuous or at least continuous in a specific [[list of human positions|position of the body]].

It is possible to have a herniated disc without pain or noticeable symptoms if the extruded ''nucleus pulposus'' material doesn't press on soft tissues or nerves. A small-sample study examining the cervical spine in symptom-free volunteers found [[Focal neurologic signs|focal]] disc protrusions in 50% of participants, suggesting that a considerable part of the population might have focal herniated discs in their cervical region that do not cause noticeable symptoms.<ref name=emedsports>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/sports/byname/Cervical-Disc-Injuries.htm |title=Frequency of asymptomatic cervical disc protrusions |first=Robert E |last=Windsor |work=Cervical Disc Injuries. |publisher=[[eMedicine]] |year=2006 |access-date=2008-02-27}}</ref><ref name=pmid16129249>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ernst CW, Stadnik TW, Peeters E, Breucq C, Osteaux MJ |title=Prevalence of annular tears and disc herniations on MR images of the cervical spine in symptom free volunteers |journal=Eur J Radiol |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=409–14 |date=Sep 2005 |pmid=16129249 |doi=10.1016/j.ejrad.2004.11.003}}</ref>

A herniated disc in the lumbar spine may cause radiating nerve pain in the lower extremities or groin area and may sometimes be associated with bowel or bladder incontinence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arizonapain.com/pain-center/pain-conditions/prolapsed-disc |title=Prolapsed Disc Arizona Pain |publisher=arizonapain.com |access-date=2015-02-10}}</ref>

Typically, symptoms are experienced only on one side of the body, but if a herniation is very large and presses on the nerves on both sides within the spinal column or the ''[[cauda equina]]'', both sides of the body may be affected, often with serious consequences. Compression of the ''cauda equina'' can cause permanent nerve damage or paralysis which can result in loss of bowel and bladder control and sexual dysfunction. This disorder is called [[cauda equina syndrome]]. Other complications include [[chronic pain]].

==Cause==

When the spine is straight, such as in standing or lying down, internal pressure is equalized on all parts of the discs. While sitting or bending to lift, internal pressure on a disc can move from 17 [[pounds per square inch|psi]] (lying down) to over 300 psi (lifting with a rounded back).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Herniation of the contents of the disc into the spinal canal often occurs when the anterior side (stomach side) of the disc is compressed while sitting or bending forward, and the contents (''nucleus pulposus'') get pressed against the tightly stretched and thinned membrane (''annulus fibrosus'') on the posterior side (back side) of the disc. The combination of membrane-thinning from stretching and increased internal pressure (200 to 300 psi) can result in the rupture of the confining membrane. The jelly-like contents of the disc then move into the spinal canal, pressing against the spinal nerves, which may produce intense and potentially disabling pain and other symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Some authors favour degeneration of the intervertebral disc as the major cause of spinal disc herniation and cite trauma as a minor cause.<ref name=Simeone>{{cite book|last1=Simeone|first1=F.A.|last2=Herkowitz|first2=H.N.|last3=Garfin|title=Rothman-Simeone, The Spine |isbn=9780721647777|year=2006}}</ref> Disc degeneration occurs both in [[degenerative disc disease]] and aging.<ref name="cite journal|pmid=22643389">{{cite journal|title=Imaging the intervertebral disk: age-related changes, herniations, and radicular pain.|pmid=22643389 |doi=10.1016/j.rcl.2012.04.014 |volume=50|issue=4|date=July 2012|vauthors=Del Grande F, Maus TP, Carrino JA |journal=Radiol. Clin. North Am.|pages=629–49}}</ref> With degeneration, the disc components – the ''nucleus pulposus'' and ''annulus fibrosus'' – become exposed to altered loads. Specifically, the nucleus becomes fibrous and stiff and less able to bear load. Excess load is transferred to the ''annulus'', which may then develop fissures as a result. If the fissures reach the periphery of the ''annulus'', the nuclear material can pass through as a disc herniation.<ref name="cite journal|pmid=22643389"/>

Mutations in several genes have been implicated in intervertebral disc degeneration. Probable candidate genes include [[type I collagen]] (sp1 site), [[FACIT collagen|type IX collagen]], [[vitamin D receptor]], [[aggrecan]], [[asporin]], [[MMP3]], [[interleukin-1]], and [[interleukin-6]] [[gene polymorphism|polymorphisms]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Mutation in genes – such as [[MMP2]] and [[THBS2]] – that encode for proteins and enzymes involved in the regulation of the extracellular matrix has been shown to contribute to lumbar disc herniation.<ref name="urlGenetic background of degenerative disc disease in the lumbar spine">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6698496/ |title=Genetic background of degenerative disc disease in the lumbar spine }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A Functional Polymorphism in THBS2 that Affects Alternative Splicing and MMP Binding Is Associated with Lumbar-Disc Herniation|first=Yuichiro |last=Hirose |display-authors=etal|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=82|pages=1122–1129|date=May 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.03.013 |pmid=18455130 |issue=5 |pmc=2427305}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

The majority of spinal disc herniations occur in the [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]] spine (95% at L4–L5 or L5–S1).<ref name=Moore286>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith L. Moore, Anne M.R. Agur; in collaboration with and with content provided by Arthur F. Dalley II; with the expertise of medical illustrator Valerie Oxorn and the developmental assistance of Marion E.|title=Essential clinical anatomy|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0-7817-6274-8|pages=286|edition=3rd}}</ref> The second most common site is the [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] region (C5–C6, C6–C7). The [[thoracic vertebrae|thoracic]] region accounts for only 1–2% of cases. Herniations usually occur postero-laterally, at the points where the ''annulus fibrosus'' is relatively thin and is not reinforced by the posterior or anterior longitudinal ligament.<ref name=Moore286/> In the cervical spine, a symptomatic postero-lateral herniation between two vertebrae will impinge on the nerve which exits the spinal canal between those two vertebrae on that side.<ref name=Moore286/> So, for example, a right postero-lateral herniation of the disc between vertebrae C5 and C6 will impinge on the right C6 spinal nerve. The rest of the spinal cord, however, is oriented differently, so a symptomatic postero-lateral herniation between two vertebrae will impinge on the nerve exiting at the next intervertebral level down.<ref name=Moore286/>

{{Anchor|lumbar}} [[File:Blausen 0484 HerniatedLumbarDisc.png|thumb|Herniated lumbar disc]]
Lumbar disc herniations occur in the  back, most often between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebral bodies or between the fifth and the [[sacrum]]. Here, symptoms can be felt in the lower back, [[buttocks]], [[thigh]], [[Perineum|anal/genital region]] (via the [[perineal nerve]]), and may radiate into the foot and/or [[toe]]. The [[sciatic nerve]] is the most commonly affected nerve, causing symptoms of [[sciatica]]. The [[femoral nerve]] can also be affected and cause the patient to experience a numb, tingling feeling throughout one or both legs and even feet or a burning feeling in the hips and legs.<ref>{{EMedicine|emerg|303|Lumbar herniation}}</ref>  A herniation in the lumbar region often compresses the nerve root exiting at the level below the disc. Thus, a herniation of the L4–5 disc compresses the L5 nerve root, only if the herniation is posterolateral.

===Cervical disc herniation===
[[File:06 Cervical MRI scan R T1WFSE G T2WfrFSE STIR B.jpg|thumb|Herniated disc at C6–C7 level]]
Cervical disc herniations occur in the neck, most often between the fifth and sixth (C5–6) and the sixth and seventh (C6–7) cervical vertebral bodies. There is an increased susceptibility amongst older (60+) patients to herniations higher in the neck, especially at C3–4.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Al-Ryalat|first=Nosaiba Tawfik|last2=Saleh|first2=Saif Aldeen|last3=Mahafza|first3=Walid Sulaiman|last4=Samara|first4=Osama Ahmad|last5=Ryalat|first5=Abdee Tawfiq|last6=Al-Hadidy|first6=Azmy Mohammad|date=March 2017|title=Myelopathy associated with age-related cervical disc herniation: a retrospective review of magnetic resonance images|journal=Annals of Saudi Medicine|volume=37|issue=2|pages=130–137|doi=10.5144/0256-4947.2017.130|issn=0975-4466|pmid=28377542|pmc=6150546}}</ref> Symptoms of cervical herniations may be felt in the back of the skull, the neck, shoulder girdle, [[scapula]], arm, and hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cervicalherniateddisc.com/herniated-disc-info/what-are-the-symptoms-of-a-herniated-cervical-disc.html|title=Symptoms of Herniated Cervical Disc}}</ref>  The nerves of the [[cervical plexus]] and [[brachial plexus]] can be affected.<ref>{{EMedicine|pmr|25|Cervical herniation}}</ref>

===Intradural disc herniation===
Intradural disc herniation is a rare form of disc herniation with an incidence of 0.2–2.2%. Pre-operative imaging can be helpful for diagnosis, but intra-operative findings are required for confirmation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kobayashi|first1=K|title=Intradural disc herniation: Radiographic findings and surgical results with a literature review|journal=Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery|date=October 2014|volume=125|pages=47–51|doi=10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.06.033|pmid=25086430}}</ref>

=== Inflammation ===

It is increasingly recognized that back pain resulting from disc herniation is not always due solely to compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots, but may also be caused by chemical inflammation.<ref name=chemical>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peng B, Wu W, Li Z, Guo J, Wang X |title=Chemical radiculitis |journal=Pain |volume=127 |issue=1–2 |pages=11–6 |date=Jan 2007 |pmid=16963186 |doi=10.1016/j.pain.2006.06.034}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall LL, Trethewie ER |title=Chemical irritation of nerve-root in disc prolapse |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=7824 |page=320 |date=Aug 1973 |pmid=4124797 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(73)90818-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarron RF, Wimpee MW, Hudkins PG, Laros GS |title=The inflammatory effect of nucleus pulposus.

==Diagnosis==

===Terminology===
Terms commonly used to describe the condition include ''herniated disc'', ''prolapsed disc'', ''ruptured disc'', and ''slipped disc''. Other conditions that are closely related include [[disc protrusion]], [[radiculopathy]] (pinched nerve), [[sciatica]], disc disease, disc degeneration, [[degenerative disc disease]], and black disc (a totally degenerated spinal disc).

The popular term ''slipped disc'' is a misnomer, as the intervertebral discs are tightly sandwiched between two vertebrae to which they are attached, and cannot actually "slip", or even get out of place. The disc is actually grown together with the adjacent vertebrae and can be squeezed, stretched and twisted, all in small degrees. It can also be torn, ripped, herniated, and degenerated, but it cannot "slip".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/slipped_disk/article_em.htm |title=Slipped discs: "they do not actually 'slip'..." |publisher=Emedicinehealth.com |access-date=2011-12-19}}</ref> Some authors consider that the term ''slipped disc'' is harmful, as it leads to an incorrect idea of what has occurred and thus of the likely outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spine-inc.com/glossary/p/prolapsed-disc.html |title=Prolapsed disc |publisher=Spine-inc.com |access-date=2011-12-19}}</ref><ref>Ehealthmd.com [http://www.ehealthmd.com/library/backpain/BAK_faq.html FAQ: "...the entire disc does not 'slip' out of place."]</ref><ref name=Burke/> However, during growth, one vertebral body can slip relative to an adjacent vertebral body, a deformity called [[spondylolisthesis]].<ref name=Burke>{{cite web |url=http://www.macdonaldpublishing.com/Chapter_6.html |title=Backache: From Occiput to Coccyx |first=Gerald L. |last=Burke |publisher=MacDonald Publishing |access-date=2008-03-14}}</ref>

===Physical examination===
Diagnosis of spinal disc herniation is made by a practitioner on the basis of a patient's history and symptoms, and by [[physical examination]]. During an evaluation, tests may be performed to confirm or rule out other possible causes with similar symptoms  –  spondylolisthesis, degeneration, [[tumor]]s, [[metastases]] and space-occupying [[lesion]]s, for instance – as well as to evaluate the efficacy of potential treatment options.

====Straight leg raise====
The [[straight leg raise]] is often used as a preliminary test for possible disc herniation in the lumbar region. A variation is to lift the leg while the patient is sitting.<ref name=pmid6446157>{{cite journal |vauthors=Waddell G, McCulloch JA, Kummel E, Venner RM |title=Nonorganic physical signs in low-back pain |journal=Spine |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=117–25 |year=1980 |pmid=6446157 |doi=10.1097/00007632-198003000-00005}}</ref> However, this reduces the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of the test.<ref name=pmid17601462>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rabin A, Gerszten PC, Karausky P, Bunker CH, Potter DM, Welch WC |title=The sensitivity of the seated straight-leg raise test compared with the supine straight-leg raise test in patients presenting with magnetic resonance imaging evidence of lumbar nerve root compression |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=88 |issue=7 |pages=840–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17601462 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.04.016}}</ref> A Cochrane review published in 2010 found that individual diagnostic tests including the straight leg raising test, absence of tendon reflexes, or muscle weakness were not very accurate when conducted in isolation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=van der Windt|first=Daniëlle AWM|last2=Simons|first2=Emmanuel|last3=Riphagen|first3=Ingrid I|last4=Ammendolia|first4=Carlo|last5=Verhagen|first5=Arianne P|last6=Laslett|first6=Mark|last7=Devillé|first7=Walter|last8=Deyo|first8=Rick A|last9=Bouter|first9=Lex M|last10=de Vet|first10=Henrica CW|last11=Aertgeerts|first11=Bert|date=2010-02-17|title=Physical examination for lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation in patients with low-back pain|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007431.pub2|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd007431.pub2|issn=1465-1858}}</ref>

====Spinal imaging====

*[[Projectional radiography]] (X-ray imaging). Traditional plain X-rays are limited in their ability to image soft tissues such as discs, muscles, and nerves, but they are still used to confirm or exclude other possibilities such as tumors, infections, fractures, etc. In spite of their limitations, X-rays play a relatively inexpensive role in confirming the suspicion of the presence of a herniated disc. If a suspicion is thus strengthened, other methods may be used to provide final confirmation.

</gallery>
*[[Computed tomography]] scan (CT or CAT scan) is a diagnostic image created after a computer reads X-rays. It can show the shape and size of the spinal canal, its contents, and the structures around it, including soft tissues. Still, visual confirmation of a disc herniation can be difficult with a CT.
*[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) without contrast is a diagnostic test that produces three-dimensional images of body structures using powerful magnets and computer technology. It can show the spinal cord, nerve roots, and surrounding areas, as well as enlargement, degeneration, and tumors. It shows soft tissues better than CAT scans. An MRI performed with a high magnetic field strength usually provides the most conclusive evidence for diagnosis of a disc herniation. [[MRI#T1 and T2|T2]]-weighted images allow for clear visualization of protruded disc material in the spinal canal.

*[[Myelography]]. An X-ray of the spinal canal following injection of a contrast material into the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid spaces will reveal displacement of the contrast material. It can show the presence of structures that can cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, such as herniated discs, tumors, or [[bone spur]]s. Because myelography involves the injection of foreign substances, MRI scans are now preferred for most patients. Myelograms still provide excellent outlines of space-occupying lesions, especially when combined with CT scanning (CT myelography).
*The presence and severity of [[myelopathy]] can be evaluated by means of [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), a neurophysiological method that measures the time required for a neural impulse to cross the [[pyramidal tracts]], starting from the [[cerebral cortex]] and ending at the [[anterior horn cells]] of the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spinal cord. This measurement is called the ''central conduction time'' (''CCT''). TMS can aid physicians to:
:*determine if myelopathy exists
:*identify the level of the spinal cord where myelopathy is located. This is especially useful in cases where more than two lesions may be responsible for the clinical symptoms and signs, such as in patients with two or more cervical disc hernias<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deftereos SN, et al. |title=Localisation of cervical spinal cord compression by TMS and MRI|journal=Funct Neurol |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=99–105 |date=April–June 2009 |pmid=19775538 }}</ref>
:*assess the progression of myelopathy with time, for example before and after cervical spine surgery
:*TMS can also help in the differential diagnosis of different causes of pyramidal tract damage.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen R, Cros D, Curra A, et al. |title=The clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation: report of an IFCN committee |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=504–32 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18063409 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2007.10.014 }}</ref>
*[[Electromyography]] and [[nerve conduction study|nerve conduction studies]] (EMG/NCS) measure the electrical impulses along nerve roots, peripheral nerves, and muscle tissue. Tests can indicate if there is ongoing nerve damage, if the nerves are in a state of healing from a past injury, or if there is another site of nerve compression. EMG/NCS studies are typically used to pinpoint the sources of nerve dysfunction [[distal]] to the spine.

====Differential diagnosis====
Tests may be required to [[Differential diagnosis|distinguish]] spinal disc herniations from other conditions with similar symptoms.

*Discogenic pain
*Mechanical pain
*[[Myofascial]] pain
*[[Abscess]]
*[[Aortic dissection]]
*[[Discitis]] or [[osteomyelitis]]
*[[Hematoma]]
*Mass lesion or [[malignancy]]
*[[Myocardial infarction]]
*[[Sacroiliac joint dysfunction]]
*[[Spinal stenosis]]
*[[Spondylosis]] or [[spondylolisthesis]]

==Treatment==

In the majority of cases spinal disc herniation can be treated successfully conservatively, without surgical removal of the herniated material. [[Sciatica]] is a set of symptoms associated with disc herniation. A study on sciatica showed that about one-third of patients with sciatica recover within two weeks after presentation using conservative measures alone, and about three-quarters of patients recovered after three months of conservative treatment.<ref name=pmid11887877>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vroomen PC, de Krom MC, Knottnerus JA |title=Predicting the outcome of sciatica at short-term follow-up |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=52 |issue=475 |pages=119–23 |date=Feb 2002 |pmid=11887877 |pmc=1314232 }}</ref> However the study did not indicate the number of individuals with sciatica that had disc herniations.

Initial treatment usually consists of [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), but long-term use of NSAIDs for people with persistent back pain is complicated by their possible cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicity.

[[Epidural steroid injection|Epidural corticosteroid injections]] provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement for those with sciatica, but are of no long-term benefit.<ref name=pinto_2012>{{cite journal |last=Pinto |first=RZ |author2=Maher, CG |author3=Ferreira, ML |author4=Hancock, M |author5=Oliveira, VC |author6=McLachlan, AJ |author7=Koes, B |author8= Ferreira, PH |title=Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |date=18 December 2012 |volume=157 |issue=12 |pages=865–77 |pmid=23362516 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-157-12-201212180-00564}}</ref> Complications occur in up to 17% of cases when injections are performed on the neck, though most are minor.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abbasi A, Malhotra G, Malanga G, Elovic EP, Kahn S |title=Complications of interlaminar cervical epidural steroid injections: a review of the literature |journal=Spine |volume=32 |issue=19 |pages=2144–51 |date=Sep 2007 |pmid=17762818 |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e318145a360}}</ref> In 2014, the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) suggested that the "injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space of the spine may result in rare but serious adverse events, including loss of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death", and that "the effectiveness and safety of epidural administration of corticosteroids have not been established, and FDA has not approved corticosteroids for this use".<ref name=FDA>{{cite journal |title=Epidural Corticosteroid Injection: Drug Safety Communication - Risk of Rare But Serious Neurologic Problems |date=2014 |url=https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm394530.htm|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170406123757/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm394530.htm |archive-date=April 6, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Lumbar disc herniation===

Non-surgical methods of treatment are usually attempted first. Pain medications may be prescribed to alleviate acute pain and allow the patient to begin exercising and stretching. There are a number of non-surgical methods used in attempts to relieve the condition. They are considered [[indication (medicine)|indicated]], [[contraindication|contraindicated]], relatively contraindicated, or inconclusive, depending on the safety profile of their [[risk–benefit ratio]] and on whether they may or may not help:

====Indicated====
*Education on proper body mechanics
*[[Physical therapy]] to address mechanical factors, and may include modalities to temporarily relieve pain (i.e. [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]], [[electrical stimulation]], [[massage]])
*[[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs)
*[[Weight control]]
*[[Spinal manipulation]]. Moderate quality evidence suggests that spinal manipulation is more effective than placebo for the treatment of acute (less than 3 months duration) lumbar disc herniation and acute sciatica.<ref name="Leininger">{{cite journal |journal= Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am |year=2011 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=105–25 |title= Spinal manipulation or mobilization for radiculopathy: a systematic review |vauthors=Leininger B, Bronfort G, Evans R, Reiter T |pmid=21292148 |doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2010.11.002}}</ref><ref name="Hahne AJ, Ford JJ, McMeeken JM 2010 E488–504">{{cite journal |journal= Spine |year=2010 |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=E488–504 |title= Conservative management of lumbar disc herniation with associated radiculopathy: a systematic review |vauthors=Hahne AJ, Ford JJ, McMeeken JM |pmid=20421859 |doi=10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181cc3f56}}</ref> The same study also found "low to very low" evidence for its usefulness in treating chronic lumbar symptoms (more than 3 months) and "the quality of evidence for ... cervical spine-related extremity symptoms of any duration is low or very low".

When different forms of surgical treatments including (discetomy, microdiscectomy, and chemonucleolysis) were compared evidence was suggestive rather than conclusive. A Cochrane review from 2007 reported: "surgical discectomy for carefully selected patients with sciatica due to a prolapsed lumbar disc appears to provide faster relief from the acute attack than non‐surgical management. However, any positive or negative effects on the lifetime natural history of the underlying disc disease are unclear. Microdiscectomy gives broadly comparable results to standard discectomy. There is insufficient evidence on other surgical techniques to draw firm conclusions." <ref>{{Citation|last=Gibson|first=JNA|title=Surgical interventions for lumbar disc prolapse|date=2007-01-24|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001350.pub3|work=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd001350.pub3|access-date=2020-01-31|last2=Waddell|first2=G}}</ref> Regarding the role of surgery for failed medical therapy in people without a significant neurological deficit, a [[Cochrane review]] concluded that "limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice".

Following surgery, rehabilitation programmes are often implemented. There is wide variation in what these programmes entail. A Cochrane review found low- to very low-quality evidence that patients who participated in high-intensity exercise programmes had slightly less short term pain and disability compared to low-intensity exercise programmes. There was no difference between supervised and home exercise programmes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oosterhuis|first=Teddy|last2=Costa|first2=Leonardo OP|last3=Maher|first3=Christopher G|last4=de Vet|first4=Henrica CW|last5=van Tulder|first5=Maurits W|last6=Ostelo|first6=Raymond WJG|date=2014-03-14|title=Rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003007.pub3|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003007.pub3|issn=1465-1858|pmc=7138272}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Disc herniation can occur in any disc in the spine, but the two most common forms are lumbar disc herniation and cervical disc herniation. The former is the most common, causing [[low back pain]] (lumbago) and often leg pain as well, in which case it is commonly referred to as [[sciatica]]. Lumbar disc herniation occurs 15 times more often than cervical (neck) disc herniation, and it is one of the most common causes of low back pain. The cervical discs are affected 8% of the time and the upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) discs only 1–2% of the time.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000442|Herniated nucleus pulposus}} Frequency</ref>

The following locations have no discs and are therefore exempt from the risk of disc herniation: the upper two cervical intervertebral spaces, the [[sacrum]], and the [[coccyx]]. Most disc herniations occur when a person is in their thirties or forties when the ''nucleus pulposus'' is still a gelatin-like substance. With age the ''nucleus pulposus'' changes ("dries out") and the risk of herniation is greatly reduced. After age 50 or 60, [[osteoarthritis|osteoarthritic]] degeneration (spondylosis) or [[spinal stenosis]] are more likely causes of low back pain or leg pain.
*4.8% of males and 2.5% of females older than 35 experience sciatica during their lifetime.
*Of all individuals, 60% to 80% experience back pain during their lifetime.
*In 14%, pain lasts more than two weeks.
*Generally, males have a slightly higher incidence than females.

==Prevention==
Because there are various causes of back injuries, prevention must be comprehensive. Back injuries are predominant in [[manual labor]], so the majority of [[low back pain]] prevention methods have been applied primarily toward [[biomechanics]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobs WC, Arts MP, van Tulder MW, et al. |title=Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review |journal=Eur Spine J |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2232–51 |date=November 2012 |pmid=22814567 |pmc=3481105 |doi=10.1007/s00586-012-2422-9 }}</ref> Prevention must come from multiple sources such as education, proper body mechanics, and [[physical fitness]].

===Education===

Education should emphasize not lifting beyond one's capabilities and giving the body a rest after strenuous effort. Over time, [[poor posture]] can cause the intervertebral disc to tear or become damaged. Striving to maintain [[neutral spine|proper posture]] and body alignment will aid in preventing disc degradation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marrone|first=Lisa|title=Overcoming Back and Neck Pain|year=2008|publisher=Harvest House|pages=37}}</ref>

===Exercise===

Exercises that enhance back strength may also be used to prevent [[back injury|back injuries]]. Back exercises include the prone press-ups, upper back extension, [[transverse abdominis]] bracing, and floor bridges. If pain is present in the back, it can mean that the stabilization muscles of the back are weak and a person needs to train the trunk musculature. Other preventative measures are to lose weight and not to work oneself past fatigue. Signs of [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] include [[tremor|shaking]], poor coordination, muscle burning, and loss of the transverse abdominal brace. Heavy lifting should be done with the legs performing the work, and not the back.

Swimming is a common tool used in strength training. The usage of lumbar-sacral support belts may restrict movement at the spine and support the back during lifting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marrone|first=Lisa|title=Overcoming Back and Neck Pain|year=2008|publisher=Harvest House|pages=31}}</ref>

==Research==
Future treatments may include [[stem cell therapy]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leung VY, Chan D, Cheung KM |title=Regeneration of intervertebral disc by mesenchymal stem cells: potentials, limitations, and future direction |journal=Eur Spine J |volume=15 Suppl 3 |issue= Suppl 3|pages=S406–13 |date=Aug 2006 |pmid=16845553 |pmc=2335386 |doi=10.1007/s00586-006-0183-z}}</ref>
