'''Oprah Winfrey Network''' ('''OWN''') is an American multinational [[basic cable]] channel jointly owned by [[Discovery Inc.]] and [[Harpo Studios]] that launched on January 1, 2011, replacing the [[Discovery Health Channel]].

The network is led by talk show host and namesake [[Oprah Winfrey]] and largely features entertainment and lifestyle programming targeting [[African American]] audiences, and reruns of [[talk show]] programming from the Harpo Studios library (including Oprah's [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|former eponymous series]]). Initially a 50/50 joint venture, Discovery acquired a larger stake in the network in 2017. Harpo remains a "significant" minority stakeholder and Winfrey is contracted with the channel through at least 2025.

As of February 2015, OWN is available to approximately 81.9 million pay television households (70.3% of households with television) in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223220414/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 23, 2015|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Development ===
After becoming Discovery Communications' new CEO in 2007, [[David Zaslav]] found [[Discovery Health Channel|Discovery Health]] to be underperforming, and taking in significantly lower carriage fees in comparison to the company's [[Discovery Channel|namesake]]. As a result, he began to explore the possibility of re-launching the channel as a joint venture with another partner. Zaslav's wife was an avid reader of Oprah Winfrey's [[O, The Oprah Magazine|''O'' magazine]] (a joint venture with [[Hearst Corporation]]); believing that her [[values]] could serve as the basis for a cable network, he contacted Winfrey's agents to hold a meeting in April 2007.<ref name="nyt-own"/> On January 15, 2008, Discovery Communications officially announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Winfrey's studio [[Harpo Productions]], under which it would re-launch Discovery Health as "OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network", in the second half of 2009.<ref name="nyt-own"/><ref name="wp-ownannounce"/>

Winfrey would serve as the chairwoman of the channel, which was expected to deal in factual programming oriented towards her personal philosophy of "living your best life"; this would include topics such as health, love, parenting, and spirituality. Discovery provided $100 million in funding, and Harpo provided access to its library and Winfrey's website, Oprah.com.<ref name="nyt-own"/> As it was still under contract with [[CBS Television Distribution]] through May 2011, her existing syndicated talk show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' was not expected to air on OWN, but there was a possibility that a continuation of it (or a successor) could air on OWN in the future.<ref name="nyt-own"/>

Winfrey and her long-time partner [[Stedman Graham]] had discussed the idea of forming her own channel as early as 1992. After Winfrey demonstrated discontent over [[tabloid talk show|"confrontational" talk shows]] on television, Graham suggested that she should form an "Oprah Winfrey Network" if she were dissatisfied with the current state of television.<ref name="nyt-own"/> OWN was not Winfrey's first cable television venture, having been co-founder of the women's cable network [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. However, her involvement was limited to being an investor; Winfrey distanced herself from the channel when discussing OWN, stressing the importance of actually having influence over programming when participating in such ventures.<ref name="nyt-own"/><ref name="wp-ownannounce">{{cite web|title=Discovery, Winfrey to Team Up On Network|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011501562.html|website=Washington Post|access-date=April 29, 2017}}</ref>

==== Delays and launch ====
In November 2008, Zaslav stated that Winfrey had planned to not renew her contract with CBS for ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' beyond the 2010–11 season, and that the show could move to OWN in some form following the end of the syndicated run. Harpo Productions denied the report, stating that Winfrey "has not made a final decision as to whether she will continue her show in syndication beyond [2011]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Oprah-Ending-2011-58308.aspx |title=Will Oprah Winfrey End Show in 2011? |work= [[TV Guide]] |date=November 8, 2008 |access-date=November 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pagesix.com/2008/11/08/winfreys-set-to-disown-abc/|title=WINFREY’S SET TO DISOWN ABC|date=2008-11-08|work=Page Six|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}</ref> The development of OWN was affected by internal conflicts, as well as Winfrey's continued commitment to her talk show. Its launch was pushed back from its originally-announced target of 2009 to an unspecified date. Zaslav pressured Oprah into moving her talk show to the channel, believing that it could boost its business.<ref name="nyt-own"/>

In November 2009, Lisa Erspamer—a Harpo executive that had been a co-executive producer of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' since 2006—was named chief creative officer of OWN.<ref name="nyt-own">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/business/19oprah.html|title=Oprah’s Network Is Her Highest Hurdle|work=The New York Times|last=Stelter|first=Brian|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref> Due to her history of working with Winfrey, the appointment of Erspamer was seen as having stabilized OWN's development: network CEO Christina Norman described Erspamer's arrival as being an "injection of Oprah's DNA" into the upcoming channel.<ref name="nyt-own"/><ref name=":0" /> Later on November 20, Winfrey officially announced that ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' would conclude in 2011, after its 25th and final season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/a-tearful-winfrey-explains-her-departure/|title=A Tearful Winfrey Explains Her Departure|last=Stelter|first=Brian|work=Media Decoder|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref> With the end of her talk show, Winfrey's commitments with Discovery were revised; a commitment for Winfrey to host a talk show on OWN and appear in at least 35 hours of programming per-year, was replaced with a commitment to appear in at least 70 hours of programming per-year, including ''[[Oprah's Next Chapter]]''—a primetime interview series hosted by Winfrey.<ref name="nyt-own"/>

The official launch of OWN was set for January 1, 2011, so that it would occur while Oprah's talk show was still on the air. Plans now called for at least 600 hours of original programming in 2011, as well as acquired and library programming (including reruns of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' later in the year, and ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]''); although Winfrey did make appearances in some of the programming aired on-launch (such as ''[[Oprah's Master Class]]''), her involvement was expected to increase following the end of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''.<ref name="nyt-own" /> After the launch of OWN, Discovery Health's programming was merged into another Discovery-owned channel, FitTV—which rebranded as Discovery Fit & Health a month later on February 1, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/discovery-health-lives-combining-fittv/362449|title=Discovery Health Lives On, Combining With FitTV |website=Multichannel|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/01/17/48429/discovery-to-launch-new-health-fitness--ch|title=Discovery To Launch New Health, Fitness Channel|work=TVNewsCheck|date=January 17, 2011|access-date=April 26, 2015}}</ref> It was subsequently re-branded again as [[Discovery Life]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/07/discovery-rebrand-fit-health-life-800818/|title=Discovery Will Rebrand Fit & Health Channel As Discovery Life|last=Lieberman|first=David|date=2014-07-08|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-27}}</ref>

=== Early struggles, targeting African Americans ===
During its first year of operation, OWN struggled to build an audience and viewership,<ref name="deadline-cohenown"/>  with most of its programs being low-rated besides ''[[Our America with Lisa Ling]]'' (the first OWN program to be renewed for a second season), and ''[[Season 25: Oprah Behind The Scenes]].'' Its average viewership was 135,000 during its second month on air, which was lower than that of Discovery Health.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/business/media/28own.html?_r=3&ref=business|title=Oprah’s New Channel Struggles to Pull In Viewers|last=Stelter|first=Brian|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2011/03/own-moves-behind-the-scenes-to-sunday-goes-to-3-nights-of-original-programming-112344/|title=OWN Moves 'Behind The Scenes' To Sunday, Goes To 3 Nights Of Original Programming|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2011-03-09|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref>  Norman defended the network's ratings, stating that first-run broadcasts of its original series were drawing larger audiences than those of Discovery Health, and that Discovery's goal was to improve OWN's monthly audience to between 50 and 60 million viewers by the end of the year.<ref name=":1" /> In March 2011, the channel modified its schedule to only have three original nights of primetime programming per-week, moving ''Oprah Behind The Scenes'' to Sunday nights alongside ''Oprah's Master Class''.<ref name=":2" />

On May 6, 2011, OWN's CEO Christina Norman was removed, and replaced by Discovery executive Peter Liguori as an interim CEO.<ref>[https://www.tvguide.com/News/Oprah-OWN-CEO-1032818.aspx "Oprah Replaces OWN CEO, Says Network Is 'Not Where I Want It to Be'"]. ''[[TV Guide]]''. May 9, 2011.</ref> In July, Winfrey assumed the role of CEO, and  named [[Sheri Salata]] as a co-president.<ref name=":0" />  As of September 2011, Discovery had invested $254 million in programming for OWN.<ref name="thr-sweetiepies">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/own-shifting-attention-to-african-american-viewers-271469|title=OWN Shifting Attention to Its African-American Viewers|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref> The October 2011 premiere of ''[[Welcome to Sweetie Pie's]]'' brought notable gains to the fledgling channel: it was the network's highest-rated series to date, and boosted OWN's average primetime viewership to 216,000. The show was especially popular among [[African American]] audiences, which prompted OWN's executives to factor this demographic into its programming decisions and advertising sales going forward.<ref name="thr-sweetiepies"/> October 16 saw the premiere of a new Sunday program, ''[[Super Soul Sunday]]'', which would include features and segments that "present an array of perspectives on what it means to be alive in today's world."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2011/09/own-to-launch-super-soul-sunday-block-176745/|title=OWN To Launch 'Super Soul Sunday' Block|date=2011-09-27|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref>

''[[The Rosie Show]]''—a talk show hosted by another formerly-syndicated personality, [[Rosie O'Donnell]]—also premiered in October, to an average of 497,000 viewers (along with an additional million via a simulcast across sister channels Discovery Fit & Health, [[Investigation Discovery]], [[Destination America|Planet Green]], and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rosie-odonnell-own-ratings-246768|title=Rosie O'Donnell's New OWN Talk Show Soft in Ratings Debut|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref> By November, its ratings had fell to an average of 171,000 nightly viewers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Biz-Ellen-The-Chew-Anderson-Talk-Shows-1039722.aspxy|title=The Biz: Analyzing This Season's Talk Shows|date=2011-11-15|work=TVGuide.com|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref> In January 2012, an attempt was made to retool the program by hiring Shane Farley (producer of the syndicated ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show|Rosie O'Donnell Show]]''), and giving it a smaller, more intimate studio.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/own-revamps-rosie-show-new-set-exec-producer-39036|title=OWN Revamps 'The Rosie Show' With New Set, Exec Producer|work=Broadcasting & Cable|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/chi-rosie-odonnell-show-set-changes-20120118-story.html|title=Rosie's new talk show set a head-scratcher|last=Metz|first=Nina|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref> However, viewership was still low, and the series was cancelled in March 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/own-cancels-rosie-odonnell-talk-show-39265|title=OWN Cancels Rosie O'Donnell Talk Show|work=Broadcasting & Cable|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-us}}</ref>

During its first year of operations, OWN's average primetime audience was 264,000 viewers. This was only slightly higher than the average primetime audience of 216,000 the channel had as Discovery Health.<ref name=":0" /> On January 26, 2012, Lisa Erspamer resigned from OWN; she was replaced in the interim by veteran Discovery executive and former TLC vice president Rita Mullin.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/at-oprah-winfrey-network-the-revolving-door-spins-again/2012/01/26/gIQAvlO0TQ_story.html|title=At Oprah Winfrey Network, the Revolving Door Spins Again|last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date= January 26, 2012|access-date= April 12, 2012}}</ref> A March 2012 ''[[Oprah's Next Chapter]]'' interview with [[Whitney Houston]]'s daughter [[Bobbi Kristina Brown]] and her family (following Houston's death in February) became OWN's highest-rated single program to date, with 3.5 million viewers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2012/03/oprahs-interview-with-whitney-houstons-daughter-delivers-ratings-record-for-own-242799/|title=Oprah's Interview With Whitney Houston's Daughter Delivers Ratings Record For OWN|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2012-03-12|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref>

On September 15, 2012, OWN premiered ''[[Iyanla: Fix My Life]]''—a reality series starring [[Iyanla Vanzant]]. It attracted critical acclaim and a large audience; its two-night premiere event was seen by 1.1 and 1.6 million total viewers respectively. The Sunday-night airing was the third-highest-rated program of the night across ad-supported cable networks, and was the highest-rated program of the night among women 18-49 and African American women 25–54.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/arts/television/iyanla-fix-my-life-on-own.html|title=‘Iyanla: Fix My Life,’ on OWN|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2012/09/owns-iyania-fix-my-life-debuts-strong-return-of-welcome-to-sweetie-pie-hits-series-high-338396/|title=OWN's 'Iyanla: Fix My Life' Debuts Strong, 'Welcome To Sweetie Pie's' Return Hits Series High|last=Patten|first=Dominic|date=2012-09-18|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="wired-foundvoice" />

=== Tyler Perry development deal and resurgence ===
In October 2012, OWN announced an exclusive multi-year development deal with [[Tyler Perry]]—a long-time friend of Winfrey. Under the deal—which marked the channel's expansion into scripted programming—Perry's future productions would air on OWN, including two new series set to premiere in 2013. By then, OWN had begun to see larger gains in audience share, especially among women in the [[key demographic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2012/10/own-enters-scripted-programming-via-multi-year-deal-with-tyler-perry-for-2-series-345945/|title=Oprah’ OWN And Tyler Perry In Deal For Scripted Series: Exclusive & Multi-Year|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2012-10-01|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref>

Perry's first two productions for OWN—the drama series ''[[The Haves and the Have Nots (TV series)|The Haves and the Have Nots]]'', and the sitcom ''[[Love Thy Neighbor (U.S. TV series)|Love Thy Neighbor]]''—were set to premiere on May 28 and 29, 2013 respectively.<ref name="thr-perryshows">{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/own-sets-premieres-tyler-perrys-432953 | title=OWN Sets Premieres for Tyler Perry's Scripted Series, Greenlights Two Shows | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=April 4, 2013 | access-date=April 8, 2013 | author=Philiana Ng}}</ref> OWN also ordered a third season of Perry's sitcom ''[[Tyler Perry's For Better or Worse|For Better or Worse]]'', which had been cancelled by [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/02/own-picks-up-tyler-perrys-sitcom-for-better-or-worse-orders-third-season/|title=OWN Picks Up Tyler Perry’s Sitcom ‘For Better Or Worse’, Orders Third Season|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2013-02-20|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref> The two-hour series premiere of ''The Haves and the Have Nots'' overtook ''[[Life with La Toya]]'' (1.18 million) as OWN's highest-rated series premiere to date, with the first episode attracting 1.77 million viewers, and growing to 1.8 million for the second.<ref name="thppi">{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-tyler-perry-premiere-559937 | title=TV Ratings: Tyler Perry Premiere Gives OWN a Record Launch | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=May 29, 2013 | access-date=May 30, 2013 | first=Michael |last=O'Connell}}</ref><ref name="ddpl">{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/05/solid-debut-for-tyler-perrys-the-haves-and-have-nots-on-own/ | title=Solid Debut For Tyler Perry's 'The Haves And Have Nots' On OWN | website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=May 29, 2013 | access-date=May 30, 2013 | first=Nellie|last=Andreeva}}</ref>

By July 2013, Discovery considered the network to be "cash flow positive".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/discovery-ceo-zaslav-declares-own-cash-flow-positive-151503/|title=Discovery CEO Zaslav Declares OWN Cash-Flow Positive|website=Adweek|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Winfrey revealed that in 2012, she had a [[nervous breakdown]] over the channel's performance.

She explained that "after 25 years of being No. 1, I had become accustomed to success. I didn't expect failure. I was tested and I had to dig deep", and that the scenario "forced me not to just talk the talk. Failure is a great teacher. I knew this intellectually.
