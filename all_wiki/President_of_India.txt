{{Politics of India}}
The '''president of India''', officially the '''President of the Republic of India''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: {{lang|hi-Latn|Bhārat kē Rāṣhṭrapati}}), is the [[figurehead|ceremonial]] [[head of state]] of [[India]] and the [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Indian Armed Forces]].

The president is [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] by an [[electoral College (India)|electoral college]] comprising the [[Parliament of India]] (both houses) and the [[state Legislative Assembly (India)|legislative assemblies]] of each of [[States and union territories of India|India's states and territories]], who themselves are all [[directly elected]].

Although the [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 53 %7BExecutive power of the Union%7D|Article 53]] of the [[Constitution of India]] states that the president can exercise his powers directly or by subordinate authority, with few exceptions, all of the executive powers vested in the president are, in practice, exercised by the [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] (a subordinate authority) with the help of the [[Union Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]].<ref name="[[The Constitution of India]]">{{cite book|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|title=Constitution of India|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice, [[Government of India]]|page=26|accessdate=27 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The president is bound by the constitution to act on the [[advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the prime minister and cabinet as long as the advice is not violating the constitution.

[[File:Flag of the President of India (1950–1971).svg|thumb|left|200px|[[Presidential Standard of India]] (1950–1971)]]
[[India]] achieved independence from the British on [[Independence Day (India)|15 August 1947]], initially as a [[dominion]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] with [[George VI]] as king, represented in the country by a [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/specials/india/470815independence-day.html "India and Pakistan Become Nations; Clashes Continue" – New York Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401064557/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/specials/india/470815independence-day.html|date=1 April 2013}} Retri2013.</ref> Still, following this, the [[Constituent Assembly of India]], under the leadership of [[B. R. Ambedkar|B.R.Ambedkar]], undertook the process of drafting a completely new constitution for the country.

The president shall not accept any actions of the executive or legislature which are unconstitutional. The president is the foremost, most empowered and prompt defender of the constitution (Article 60), who has pre-emptive power for ensuring constitutionality in the actions of the executive or legislature. The role of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution of India is the second line of defence in nullifying any unconstitutional actions of the executive and legislative entities of the Indian Union.

===Limitations===

''Legislature'' – Any bill passed by parliament can either be signed, [[Pocket veto|withheld]] or returned to parliament by the President of India. If President signs, it becomes a law. If President returns or withholds the bill till expiry and same bill is again introduced and passed in the parliament, it automatically becomes a law without President's signature. 

''Executive'' – Although the President is bound by the constitution to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, it is ultimately the President who gives final order. Hence, declining the PM's advice or withholding it for long without being able to constitutionally challenge this decision is beyond the power of the President. Similarly the PM can object to any decision taken alone by the President without consulting the cabinet.    

''Judiciary'' – Only the judiciary has the power to convert any death sentence (rarest) to life imprisonment. 

=== Duty ===
The primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India as made part of his [[#Oath or affirmation|oath]] (Article 60 of Indian constitution).<ref name="const" /> The president is the common head of all independent constitutional entities. All his actions, [[Three Judges Cases|recommendations]] ([[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 3]], Article 111, Article 274, etc.) and supervisory powers ([[Article 74 (Constitution of India)|Article 74(2)]], Article 78C, Article 108, Article 111, etc.) over the executive and legislative entities of India shall be used in accordance to uphold the constitution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/09spec.htm|title=How Kalam asserted presidential power|last=Bhatt|first=Sheela|date=9 June 2006|work=Rediff India|accessdate=15 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182146/http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/09spec.htm|archivedate=16 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> There is no bar on the actions of the president to contest in the court of law.<ref name="india times">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-08-26/education/27323497_1_powers-impeachment-resolution|title=The President's role|last=Gupta|first=V. P.|date=26 August 2002|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref>

=== Legislative powers ===
Legislative power is constitutionally vested in the [[Parliament of India]] of which the president is the head, to facilitate the lawmaking process per the constitution (Article 78, Article 86, etc.). The president summons both the houses ([[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]]) of the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] and prorogues them. He can [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolve the Lok Sabha]].<ref name="SharmaB.k.2007" />{{rp|147}}

The president inaugurates parliament by addressing it after the general elections and also at the beginning of the first session every year per Article 87(1). The presidential address on these occasions is generally meant to outline the new policies of the [[Government of India|government]].<ref name="Chowdhury">{{Cite web|title=Article 87 - Advocatespedia|url=https://advocatespedia.com/Article_87|access-date=22 November 2020|website=advocatespedia.com}}</ref>{{rp|145}}

All [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] passed by the parliament can become laws only after receiving the assent of the president per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 111]]. After a bill is presented to him, the president shall declare either that he assents to the Bill, or that he withholds his assent from it.  As a third option, he can return a bill to parliament, if it is not a [[money bill]], for reconsideration. President may be of the view that a particular bill passed under the [[Lawmaking procedure in India|legislative powers]] of parliament is violating the constitution, he can send back the bill with his recommendation to pass the bill under the constituent powers of parliament following the [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368]] procedure. When, after reconsideration, the bill is passed accordingly and presented to the president, with or without amendments, the president cannot withhold his assent from it. The president can also withhold his assent to a bill when it is initially presented to him (rather than return it to parliament) thereby exercising a [[pocket veto]] on the advice of prime minister or council of ministers per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 74]] if it is inconsistent to the constitution.<ref name="india times" /> Article 143 gave power to the president to consult the [[Supreme Court of India|supreme court]] about the constitutional validity of an issue. The president shall assent to [[Amendment of the Constitution of India|constitutional amendment bills]] without power to withhold the bills per [[s:Constitution of India/Part XX|Article 368 (2)]].

When either of the two Houses of the [[Parliament of India]] is not in session, and if the government feels the need for an immediate procedure, the president can promulgate ordinances which have the same force and effect as an act passed by parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid for no more than six weeks from the date the parliament is convened unless approved by it earlier.<ref name="Association1956">{{cite journal|last=Bakshi|first=P.M.|date=June 1956|title=Comparative Law: Separation of Powers in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mvOn6ZnieIC&pg=PA554|url-status=live|journal=[[ABA Journal]]|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|volume=42|page=554|issn=0747-0088|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517040623/https://books.google.com/books?id=1mvOn6ZnieIC&pg=PA554|archivedate=17 May 2016}}</ref> Under [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 123]], the president as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that immediate action is mandatory as advised by the union cabinet and he is confident that the government commands majority support in the parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of parliament when in force and it is the responsibility of the president to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for promulgation of the ordinance are no longer applicable. Bringing laws in the form of ordinances has become a routine matter by the government and president, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of the law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of an ordinance after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of parliament is an unconstitutional act by the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/repeated-promulgation-of-ordinances-because-a-bill-is-held-up-in-the-rajya-sabha-is-a-violation-of-constitutional-principles/|title=Repeated promulgation of ordinances because a bill is held up in the Rajya Sabha is a violation of constitutional principles|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927134804/http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/repeated-promulgation-of-ordinances-because-a-bill-is-held-up-in-the-rajya-sabha-is-a-violation-of-constitutional-principles/|archivedate=27 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The president should not incorporate any matter in an ordinance which violates the constitution or requires an amendment to the constitution. The president should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the parliament or violates the constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/re-promulgation-of-ordinances-fraud-on-constitution-sc-4456354/|title=Re-promulgation of ordinances fraud on Constitution: SC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103133724/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/re-promulgation-of-ordinances-fraud-on-constitution-sc-4456354/|archivedate=3 January 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=3 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Executive powers ===
{{Quote|The President of the Indian Union will be generally bound by the advice of his Ministers. ... He can do nothing contrary to their advice nor can do anything without their advice. The [[President of the United States]] can dismiss any Secretary at any time.

As per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 53]], the [[Executive (government)|executive power]] of the country is vested in the president and is exercised by president either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the constitution. When parliament thinks fit it may accord additional executive powers to the president per [[s:Constitution of India/Part V|Article 70]] which may be further delegated by the president to the [[Governors of states of India|governors of states]] per [[s:Constitution of India/Part VI|Article 160]]. [[Union Council of Ministers|Union cabinet]] with [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] as its head, should aid and advice the president in performing his functions. Per [[Article 74 of the Constitution of India|Article 74 (2)]], the council of ministers or prime minister are not accountable legally to the advice tendered to the president but it is the sole responsibility of the president to ensure compliance with the constitution in performing his duties. President or his subordinate officers is bound by the provisions of the constitution notwithstanding any advice by union cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/494666/?formInput=article%2075%20%283%29%20%20doctypes%3A%20supremecourt|title=U.N.

==== National emergency ====
{{See also|The Emergency (India)}}
A national emergency can be declared in the whole of India or a part of its territory for causes of war or armed rebellion or an external aggression. Such an emergency was declared in India in 1962 ([[Sino-Indian War|Indo-China war]]), 1971 ([[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistan war]]),<ref name="Omar2002">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6-wZP7Tz8YC&pg=PA129|title=Emergency Powers and the Courts in India and Pakistan|last=Omar|first=Imtiaz|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-90-411-1775-5|page=129|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603104218/https://books.google.com/books?id=o6-wZP7Tz8YC&pg=PA129|archivedate=3 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and 1975 to 1977 (declared by [[Indira Gandhi]]).<sup>[[The Emergency (India)|[see main]]]</sup>

Under [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part XVIII|Article 352]] of the India constitution, the president can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the cabinet of ministers headed by the [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]].

National Emergency has been proclaimed 3 times in India till date. It was declared first in 1962 by President [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], during the [[Sino-Indian War]]. This emergency lasted through the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] and up to 1968. It was revoked in 1968. The second emergency in India was proclaimed in 1971 by President [[V. V. Giri]] on the eve of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. The first two emergencies were in the face of external aggression and War. They were hence external emergencies. Even as the second emergency was in progress, another internal emergency was proclaimed by President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]], with [[Indira Gandhi]] as prime minister in 1975. In 1977, the second and the third emergencies were together revoked.

==== State emergency ====
{{See also|Federalism in India}}
If the president is not fully satisfied, on the basis of the report of the governor of the concerned state or from other sources that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the constitution, he can proclaim under Article 356 a state of emergency in the state.<ref name="const" /> Such an emergency must be approved by the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] within a period of 2 months.

Under [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part XVIII|Article 356]] of the [[Constitution of India|Indian constitution]], it can be imposed from six months to a maximum period of three years with repeated parliamentary approval every six months. If the emergency needs to be extended for more than three years, this can be achieved by a [[Constitution of India|constitutional amendment]], as has happened in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]].

During such an emergency, the president can take over the entire work of the executive, and the governor administers the state in the name of the president. The Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jwLBRuWHnkC&pg=SL3-PA27|title=New ICSE History and Civics|publisher=Frank Brothers|isbn=978-81-8409-587-6|page=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505140727/https://books.google.com/books?id=5jwLBRuWHnkC&pg=SL3-PA27|archivedate=5 May 2016|url-status=live}}{{year needed|date=May 2013}}</ref> (see [[National Emergency in India|National emergency]] for explanation).

This type of emergency needs the approval of the parliament within 2 months. It can last up to a maximum of three years via extensions after each 6-month period. However, after one year it can be extended only if

The [[Sarkaria Commission]] held that presidents have unconstitutionally misused the provision of Article 356 many times for achieving political motives, by dismissing the state governments although there was no constitutional break down in the states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ncrwc/finalreport/v2b2-5.htm|title=National Commission to Review the Working of the Article 356 of the constitution|year=2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509030437/http://lawmin.nic.in/ncrwc/finalreport/v2b2-5.htm|archivedate=9 May 2015|url-status=dead|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> During 2005, President's rule was imposed in [[Bihar]] state, misusing Article 356 unconstitutionally to prevent the democratically elected state legislators to form a government after the state elections.

There is no provision in the constitution to re-promulgate president's rule in a state when the earlier promulgation ceased to operate for want of parliaments approval within two months duration. During 2014 in Andhra Pradesh, president's rule was first imposed on 1 March 2014 and it ceased to operate on 30 April 2014. President's rule was promulgated after being fully aware that the earliest parliament session is feasible at the end of May 2014 after the general elections.

== Selection process ==

=== Eligibility ===
[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 58 %7BQualifications for election as President%7D|Article 58]] of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president. A president must be:
* a [[Indian nationality law|citizen of India]]
* of 35 years of age or above
* qualified to become a member of the [[Lok Sabha]]

A person shall not be eligible for election as president if he holds any [[office of profit]] under the Government of India or the Government of any State or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.

Certain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates. These are:
* The current [[Vice President of India|vice-president]]
* The governor of any state
* A Minister of the Union or of any state (including [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] and [[Chief Minister (India)|chief ministers]])<ref name=Kumar />{{rp|72}}

In the event that the vice-president, a state governor or a minister is elected president, they are considered to have vacated their previous office on the date they begin serving as president.

A member of parliament or of a State Legislature can seek election to the office of the president but if he is elected as president, he shall be deemed to have vacated his seat in parliament or State Legislature on the date on which he enters upon his office as President '''[Article 59(1)]'''.

'''Article 57''' provides that a person who holds, or who has held, office as president shall, subject to the other provisions of this constitution, be eligible for re-election to that office.

== Time of election ==
Article 56(1) of the constitution provides that the president shall hold office
for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office. According to Article 62, an election to fill a vacancy caused by the expiration
of the term of office of President shall be completed before the expiration of the term. An election to fill a vacancy in the office of President occurring by reason of
his death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held as soon as possible
after, and in no case later than six months from, the date of occurrence of the vacancy; and the person elected to fill the vacancy shall, subject to the provisions of Article 56, be entitled to hold office for the full term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office. To meet the contingency of an election to the office of President not being completed in time due to unforeseen circumstances like countermanding of election
due to death of a candidate or on account of postponement of the poll for any valid
reason, Article 56(1)(c) provides that the president shall, notwithstanding the
expiration of his term, continue to hold office until his successor enters upon his office.

=== Conditions for the presidency ===
{{Main|Electoral College (India)}}

Certain conditions, per [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 59 %7BConditions of President's office%7D|Article 59]] of the Indian constitution, debar an otherwise eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections. The conditions are:
* The president shall not be a member of either house of the parliament or of a house of the legislature of any state, and if a member of either house of the parliament or of a house of the legislature of any state be elected president, he shall be deemed to have vacated his seat in that house on the date on which he enters upon his office as president.
* The president shall not hold any other office of profit.
* The president shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of his official residences and shall be also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by parliament by law and until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule.
* The emoluments and allowances of the president shall not be diminished during his term of office.<ref name="sharma kanhaiya" />{{rp|170}}

=== Election process ===
Whenever the office becomes vacant, the new president is chosen by an [[Electoral College (India)|electoral college]] consisting of the elected members of both houses of [[Parliament of India|parliament]] (M.P.s), the elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies ([[Vidhan Sabha]]) of all States and the elected members of the legislative assemblies (MLAs) of union territories with legislatures, i.e., [[Delhi|National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi]], [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], and [[Puducherry]]. The election process of President is more extensive process than [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] who is also elected indirectly (not elected by people directly) by the [[Lok Sabha]] members only. Whereas President being the constitutional head with duties to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and [[rule of law]] in a [[constitutional democracy]] with [[Ouster clause|constitutional supremacy]], is elected in an extensive manner by the members of Lok Sabha, [[Rajya Sabha]] and [[Vidhan Sabha|state legislative assemblies]] in a secret ballot procedure.

The nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of {{INRConvert|15|k}} in the [[Reserve Bank of India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/President_VP_Elec2012/Presidential_Elections-FAQ.pdf|title=Election to the president of India|publisher=Election commission of India|page=16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310171823/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/President_VP_Elec2012/Presidential_Elections-FAQ.pdf|archivedate=10 March 2014|url-status=live|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.

The election is held in accordance with the system of [[proportional representation]] (PR) by means of the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) method. The voting takes place by a [[secret ballot]] system. The manner of election of President is provided by [[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 55 %7BManner of election of President%7D|Article 55]] of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]].<ref name="LibraryLibrary">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQLff_T-uFAC&pg=PT167|title=Public Administration|author1=Great Britain. Ministry of Overseas Development. Library|author2=Great Britain. Overseas Development Administration.

Each elector casts a different number of votes. The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.

The actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state's population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies by the total number of elected representatives of the parliament.

Although Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]], they tend to vote for the candidate supported by their respective parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070012825|title=Balance of power in presidential race|date=22 May 2007|publisher=[[NDTV]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007104210/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070012825|archivedate=7 October 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>

The president may also be removed before the expiry of the term through [[impeachment]] for violating the [[Constitution of India]] by the [[Parliament]] of India. The process may start in either of the two houses of the [[Parliament of India|parliament]]. The house initiates the process by levelling the charges against the president. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by at least one-quarter of the total members of that house. The notice is sent up to the president and 14 days later, it is taken up for consideration.

A resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total number of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the president has the right to defend oneself through an authorised [[counsel]]. If the second house also approves the charges made by special majority again, the president stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.<ref name="Bhardwaj">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBC05B0NnYIC&pg=SL1-PA238|title=Study Package For CLAT and LL.B Entrance Examinations|last=Bhardwaj|first=A.P.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India)|isbn=978-0-07-107468-1|pages=238–239|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603232129/https://books.google.com/books?id=SBC05B0NnYIC&pg=SL1-PA238|archivedate=3 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Under [[s:Constitution of India/Part XIX|Article 361]] of the constitution, though the president cannot be summoned for questioning except on his voluntary willingness to testify in the court in support of his controversial deeds, the unconstitutional decisions taken by the president would be declared invalid by the courts. The case would be decided by the courts based on the facts furnished by the Union government for the president's role. As clarified by the supreme court in the case ''Rameshwar Prasad & Ors vs Union of India & Anr'' on 24 January 2006; though the president cannot be prosecuted and imprisoned during his term of office, he can be prosecuted after he/she steps down from the post for any guilt committed during the term of presidency as declared earlier by the courts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1885130/|title=Rameshwar Prasad And Ors vs Union Of India And Anr on 24 January, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016074238/http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1885130/|archivedate=16 October 2010|url-status=live|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> No president has resigned on impropriety to continue in office for declaring and nullifying his unconstitutional decisions by the courts till now.

== Succession ==
The Office of the president falls vacant in the following scenarios:
# On the expiry of their term.
# By reason of death.
# By reason of [[resignation]].
# Removal by supreme court.
# Removal by impeachment.
[[wikisource:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 65 %7BThe Vice-President to act as President or to discharge his functions during casual vacancies in the office, or during the absence, of President%7D|Article 65]] of the [[Constitution of India|Indian constitution]] says that the [[Vice-President of India]] will have to discharge the duties, if the office falls vacant due to any reason other than the expiry of the term.<ref name="Arora" />{{rp|20.10}} The vice-president reverts to their office when a new president is elected and enters office. When the president is unable to act because of absence, illness or any other cause, the vice-president discharges the president's functions until the president resumes the duties.

A vice-president who acts as or discharges the functions of the president has all the powers and immunities of the president and is entitled to the same emoluments as the president. When a vice-president discharges the duties of the president, he/she does not function as the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.

The [[Parliament of India|Indian parliament]] has enacted the law—''The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969'' —<ref>{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.5/pres2012/4000rs.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704004059/http://164.100.47.5/pres2012/4000rs.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2012|url-status=live|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref> for the discharge of the functions of the president when vacancies occur in the offices of the president and of the vice-president simultaneously, owing to removal, death, resignation of the incumbent or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the [[Chief Justice of India|chief justice]]—or in his absence, the senior most judge of the [[Supreme Court of India]] available—discharges the functions of the president until a newly elected president enters upon his office or a newly elected vice-president begins to act as president under Article 65 of the constitution, whichever is the earlier.<ref name="BakshiM2010" />{{rp|96}} For example, in 1969, when President [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Husain]] died in Office, Vice-President [[V. V. Giri]] served as the acting president of India. However, later, V.V Giri resigned from both posts (Acting President of India and Vice-President of India) as he became a candidate in the 1969 presidential election in India. In this event, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice [[Mohammad Hidayatullah]] served as the acting president of India until the next president was elected.

== Important presidential interventions in the past ==
The president's role as defender of the constitution and the powers as Head of State, especially in relation to those exercised by the prime minister as leader of the government, have changed over time. In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.

=== Proving majority in the parliament ===
{{Main|Vote of confidence}}

In 1979, Prime Minister [[Charan Singh]], did not enjoy a parliamentary majority. He responded to this by simply not advising the president to summon parliament.<ref name="Darpan2007" /> Since then, presidents have been more diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions.

=== Proof of Majority to form a Government ===
Since the 1990s, Parliamentary elections have generally not resulted in a single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister prove he has the support of the [[Lok Sabha]] (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/10/stories/2005111003281400.htm|title=K.R.

=== Vetoing of a Bill ===
{{See also|Pocket veto|Zail Singh}}

Since the Indian constitution does not provide any time limit within which the president is to declare his assent or refusal, the president could exercise a "pocket veto" by not taking any action for an indefinite time. The veto was used in 1986 by President [[Zail Singh]] over the Postal Bill. The president did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government [[arbitrary power]]s to intercept postal communications indiscriminately.<ref name="Bhardwaj" /><ref name="Presidential Years of Zail Singh">{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?202610|title=Presidential Years|last=Sundar Rajan|first=K.T.|date=4 December 1996|work=Outlook|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603054921/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?202610|archivedate=3 June 2012|url-status=live|accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="Show of Dissent">{{cite web|url=http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20060612/nation5.html|title=Show of Dissent|last=Bhattacharjya|first=Satarupa|date=12 June 2006|work=[[India Today]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326055411/http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20060612/nation5.html|archivedate=26 March 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=13 June 2012}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, President [[K. R. Narayanan]] introduced explaining to the nation (by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan communiqués), the thinking that led to the various decisions he took while exercising his discretionary powers; this has led to openness and transparency in the functioning of the president.<ref name="ram_int">[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/nic/narayanankr.pdf Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203201144/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/nic/narayanankr.pdf|date=3 February 2006}} with K.

Retrieved 24 February 2006].</ref>

=== Return of a Bill ===
{{See also|Office of profit}}

The constitution gives the president the power to return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration. If the parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the president is obliged to sign it. In mid-2006, President [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] sent back a controversial bill regarding the exclusion of certain offices from the scope of 'offices of profit', the holding of which would disqualify a person from being a member of parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/kalam-returns-office-of-profit-bill/11851-4.html|title=Kalam returns Office of Profit Bill|date=31 May 2006|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620221052/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/kalam-returns-office-of-profit-bill/11851-4.html|archivedate=20 June 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> The combined opposition, the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]], hailed the move.
