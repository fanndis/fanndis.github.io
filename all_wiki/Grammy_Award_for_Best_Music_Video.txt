The '''Grammy Award for Best Music Video''' is an honor presented at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309064412/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/factsheets/env-grammy_awards_info%2C0%2C5838827.htmlstory|archive-date=March 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> to performers, directors, and producers of quality short form [[music video]]s. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=June 18, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717182938/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|archive-date=July 17, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Originally called the '''Grammy Award for Best Video, Short Form''', the award was first presented in 1984, as was a similar award for [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Best Long Form Music Video]]. From 1986 to 1997, the category name was changed to '''Best Music Video, Short Form'''. However, in 1988 and 1989, the award criteria were changed and the video awards were presented under the categories [[Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video|Best Concept Music Video]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video|Best Performance Music Video]]. The awards were returned to the original format in 1990. The category was called '''Best Short Form Music Video''' until 2012, from 2013 it was shortened to '''Best Music Video'''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/56th-annual-grammy-awards |title= 56th Annual GRAMMY Awards (2013) |accessdate= January 11, 2018 |publisher= [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190321012128/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/56th-annual-grammy-awards |archive-date= March 21, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref> Award recipients include the performers, directors, and producers associated with the winning videos, except for its first two years when the Grammy went to the performing artist only. For unknown reasons, the award for the Best Music Video in [[1987 Grammy Awards|1987]] - ''Brothers in Arms'' by [[Dire Straits]] - went to the band only, not to the director(s) and/or producer(s).

[[Johnny Cash]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Michael Jackson]] hold the record for the most wins as a performer in this category, with two each. [[Mark Romanek]] holds the record for the most wins as a director, with a total of three. Icelandic singer [[Björk]] holds the record for the most nominations as a performer without a win, with four.
