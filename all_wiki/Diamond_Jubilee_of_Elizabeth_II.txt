The year 2012 marked the '''Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II''' being the 60th anniversary of the accession of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 6 February 1952. The only [[Diamond jubilee|Diamond Jubilee]] celebration for any of Elizabeth's predecessors was in 1897, for the 60th anniversary of the 1837 accession of [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Queen Victoria]].

Following the tradition of the Queen's [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]] and [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilees]], commemorative events were held throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The Queen and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] toured the United Kingdom and other members of the Royal Family toured the rest of the Commonwealth as the monarch's representatives. The jubilee celebrations marked the beginning of the withdrawal of the Duke of Edinburgh from public life and a more prominent role for the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry in commonwealth affairs.

Numerous events and tributes were held over the year and throughout the Commonwealth, culminating in a jubilee pageant held in London. The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust was set up as a charitable foundation with a mission to leave a lasting legacy across the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web |title=Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust |url=https://www.jubileetribute.org/ |website=Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust}}</ref> Other projects included the [[Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Wood]] and the issuing of [[Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal|commemorative medals]].

===Saint Vincent and the Grenadines===
In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a Diamond Jubilee Celebrations Committee was established to oversee events staged to mark, between February and June 2012, the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II's accession as queen regnant of the country, from 1952 to 1979 as [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]] and thereafter as [[Monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Queen of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The committee head, former Minister of Culture Rene Baptiste, stated the aim was to "showcase what we have to offer, as well as our loyalty to the Parliament..." The Earl and Countess of Wessex, aboard [[RFA Fort Rosalie (A385)|RFA ''Fort Rosalie'']], arrived for their tour of country on 25 February and visited the restored [[Botanic Gardens St. Vincent]] and planted a Pink Poui tree, attended an official lunch at Government House, and planted [[Roystonea|Royal Palms]] on the [[Grenadines]].

Trade unionist Noel Jackson said he heard displeasure expressed by Vincentians towards the royal tour and that "a lot of people were cursing." Senator Julian Francis, the General Secretary of the governing [[Unity Labour Party]], stated the public reaction to the presence of the royal couple "confirmed to me that we could not have won [[2009 Vincentian constitutional referendum|the 2009 referendum on a republic]]. The outpouring of the people in St. Vincent to come and greet Prince Edward yesterday confirmed to me that people, in the majority in St. Vincent, still want the monarchy... It was like a carnival in town yesterday."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://i-witness-news.com/2012/02/27/majority-of-vincentians-still-want-the-monarchy/| title=Majority of Vincentians 'still want the monarchy'| date=27 February 2012| publisher=I-Witness News| accessdate=28 February 2012| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301110030/http://i-witness-news.com/2012/02/27/majority-of-vincentians-still-want-the-monarchy/| archivedate=1 March 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A Diamond Jubilee Lecture was delivered in March, a flower show and tea party was held at Government House on 4 and 5 May, a stamp exhibition was mounted at the National Trust headquarters and an exhibition of photographs of the Queen in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was displayed at the National Public Library. A Queen's Birthday parade took place, as did a Diamond Jubilee Beacon Event on 4 June, part of the wider plan to light such beacons at the same time across the Commonwealth.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.thevincentian.com/dcmain.aspx?p=0&i=9355&skin=75&tID=198 |last=Clarke |first=Karissa |title=Big plans to mark Queen's Diamond Jubilee |date=2 February 2012 |newspaper=The Vincentian |accessdate=5 February 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
