==Terminology and characteristics==
The term electroclash describes a musical movement that combined [[synthpop]], [[techno]], [[punk rock|punk]] and [[performance art]]. The genre was in reaction to the rigid formulations of techno music, putting an emphasis on song writing, showmanship and a sense of humour,<ref name=Lynskey2002/> described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as one of "the two most significant upheavals in recent dance music history".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/theguide/music/story/0,,2281522,00.html "The female techno takeover"], ''The Guardian'', May 24, 2008</ref> The visual aesthetic of electroclash has been associated with the 1982 [[cult film]] ''[[Liquid Sky]]''.<ref>[http://www.phinnweb.org/313ctr0/electroclash/index3.html "The Great Electroclash Swindle"].

== Criticism ==
The electroclash label and the hype around it were fiercely criticized by some of its acclaimed protagonists in the early 2000s. For example, [[I-F]] and other artists signed an "Anti-Electroclash-Manifest", where they complained about the sellout of the style by those who would "rule the media waves" and only "sell the old freshly packaged".<ref name="Andreas Hartmann"/><ref name="Sonja Eismann"/> In 2002, Toktok vs. Soffy O. stated that when they were first asked about electroclash they just thought: "This is nothing else than what we've known for at least five years and what is now reaching the recycling peak for the third or fourth time".<ref name="Sonja Eismann"/>
