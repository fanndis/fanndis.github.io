'''Scott Philip Brown''' (born September 12, 1959) is an American diplomat, attorney, and politician serving as the [[United States Ambassador]] to [[New Zealand]] and [[Samoa]]. He is a former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] for [[Massachusetts]] (2010–2013), and also was the 2014 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for the U.S. Senate in [[New Hampshire]]. Prior to his Senate tenure, Brown served as a member of the [[Massachusetts General Court]], first in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|State House of Representatives]] (1998–2004) and then in the [[Massachusetts Senate|State Senate]] (2004–2010).

In 2010, Brown faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Massachusetts Attorney General [[Martha Coakley]] in a [[2010 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts|special election]] which occurred after the 2009 death of longtime Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. While initially trailing Coakley by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge and posted a come-from-behind win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since [[Edward Brooke]] in 1972. Brown [[2012 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|ran for a full Senate term]] in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger [[Elizabeth Warren]]. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined [[Fox News]] as a commentator, and joined [[Nixon Peabody]] where he provided legal services.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/02/former_sen_scott_brown_to_serv.html |title=Scott Brown joins Kadant paper company board of directors |newspaper=MassLive |date=February 6, 2013 |access-date=April 21, 2017 |first1=Robert |last1=Rizzuto |first2=Shira |last2=Schoenberg }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/sen-scott-brown-joins-fox-news-article-1.1263276 |title=Scott Brown, former Massachusetts senator, joins Fox News |newspaper=NY Daily News |date=February 13, 2013 |accessdate=April 21, 2017 |first=David |last=Hinckley }}</ref><ref name="Bump 9 Sept 2014"/>

After re-establishing residence in [[New Hampshire]], Brown then campaigned for the U.S. Senate from New Hampshire in the [[2014 United States Senate election in New Hampshire|2014 elections]].

==Early career (1978–1992)==

===Army National Guard service===
Brown has said the rescue efforts of [[Army National Guard]] during the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] impressed him. When he was 19, he joined the [[Massachusetts Army National Guard]], received his basic training at [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]],<ref name="dog" /> and attended [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) classes at the campus of [[Northeastern University]].<ref name="key">{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/07/guard_service_a_key_to_candidate_brown/ |work=The Boston Globe|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=January 16, 2010|title=Guard service a key to candidate Brown|first=Brian C.|last=Mooney}}</ref> He was trained in [[Infantry Branch (United States)|infantry]], [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|quartermaster]], and [[airborne forces|airborne]] duties, and in 1994 he joined the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] (JAG).<ref name="key" /> He was active in the Guard for 35 years rising to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. As the Army National Guard's head [[defense attorney]] in [[New England]], Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive [[drug test]]s,<ref name="live">{{cite news|title=Republican Scott Brown, seeking to fill the seat held by Ted Kennedy, favors more troops in Afghanistan, opposes health insurance overhaul|first=Dan|last=Ring|date=November 30, 2009|accessdate=January 13, 2010|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/11/republican_scott_brown_seeking.html|publisher=MassLive.com}}</ref> and provided [[estate planning]] and real estate advice to those who were about to deploy to war zones.<ref name="key" /> He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in [[Kazakhstan]] and a week in [[Paraguay]].<ref name="live" />

===Modeling===
In June 1982, Brown, then a 22-year-old law student at Boston College, won ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine's "America's Sexiest Man" contest. After two weeks on a [[crash diet]] of "three cans of tuna a day" and intensive workouts<ref name="arsenault20110217">{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/02/17/brown_describes_childhood_of_beatings_sexual_abuse/?page=full|title=Brown describes beatings, sexual abuse in childhood|date=February 17, 2011|first=Mark and Christopher Rowland|last=Arsenault|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref> he was featured in the magazine's [[centerfold]], posing [[nude]] but strategically positioned so that according to Brown, "You don't see anything".

==State political career (1992–2010)==
Brown "caught the political bug" in 1992 when he was elected property [[assessor (property)|assessor]] of [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]].<ref name="live" /> In 1995, he was elected to the Wrentham [[Board of Selectmen]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Frank|title=Brown had low-key style in state Legislature|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2012/10/21/scott-brown-years-legislature-marked-low-key-style-few-major-policy-initiatives/tvli5UcmrHriutytyuqIAK/story.html|newspaper=Boston Globe|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref>

He successfully ran for the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in 1998, representing the 9th Norfolk District for three terms. Brown again moved up the ladder of state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat [[Cheryl Jacques]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=101A977201BF7A8C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Preservation plan on tap|date=March 24, 2004|first=Gretchen|last=Weber|author2=Franco Ordonez |author3=Emma Stickgold |author4= Lisa Kocian |accessdate=February 9, 2010|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref> Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004, and again in November 2006, running without opposition the second time. He won re-election in November 2008, defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59–41 percent margin. Following his re-election, Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40-seat [[Massachusetts Senate]]. In the Massachusetts Senate, Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection, professional licensing, education, election laws, public safety, and veterans' affairs.<ref name="glance" />

[[File:Scottbrown.jpg|thumb|right|Brown speaking to constituents]]
In February 2007, a controversy arose after Brown's appearance at [[King Philip Regional High School]] in [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]] as part of a debate on [[gay marriage]]. The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, [[Ayla Brown|Ayla]]. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/homepage/8998943093096972286|title=Brown on hot seat after quoting 'F' word at school appearance|author=Heather McCarron|work=[[The MetroWest Daily News]]|date=February 10, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923132917/http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/homepage/8998943093096972286|archive-date=September 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In January 2010, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that during six terms in the Legislature, three each in the House and Senate, Brown had a modest record of legislative initiatives, but he had carved out a niche as a leading advocate for [[veterans]].

Brown had stated that win or lose in his 2014 New Hampshire Senatorial bid, he planned to remain a New Hampshire resident for the rest of his life.

In October 2017, the U.S. State Department advised Brown to be more culturally sensitive after he called [[United States Peace Corps]] volunteers "beautiful" and told servers at an event that they could make good money in the food service industry. The State Department conducted a review and Brown was counseled on standards of conduct for government employees.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Joshua|title=Scott Brown's pay is $155,000 per year.

During this time, 112 other international diplomats used the government run quarantine facilities, which were temporarily housed in New Zealand hotels, to spend 14 days in monitored quarantine, but Brown's group of 6 did not.  Brown's flouting of the uniform quarantine -- partly credited with keeping New Zealand mostly Covid-19 free -- caused a furor as it was revealed when Brown had returned from a "working holiday" in the US. The incident has upset many New Zealanders with what is described as "special treatment."

Brown is a signer of [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]'s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].<ref name="ATR">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref> In a letter to the editor of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' written on January 8, 2012, Brown wrote, "With out-of-control government spending and rising debt and deficits, politicians in Washington have proven time and time again that they cannot manage hard-earned taxpayer money responsibly. So why should we give them even more?"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-01-08/letters/30601157_1_government-spending-tax-code-antitax-pledge | work=The Boston Globe | title=Brown's stance: Keep taxes low until Congress kicks spending habit | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728121031/http://articles.boston.com/2012-01-08/letters/30601157_1_government-spending-tax-code-antitax-pledge | archive-date=July 28, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Brown opposed a proposed multibillion-dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation. Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, said that he is "opposed to higher taxes, especially in the midst of a severe recession". He also opposed it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] fees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/01/brown_criticize.html |title=Mass.

The bill combined the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], stating: "Banks making lending decisions with government funds is not the way to get our economy moving again."<ref>[https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/09/15/senate_oks_tax_breaks_for_small_businesses/ Small-business tax breaks clear a hurdle in the Senate 'Brown decries plan, calling it a new bailout; End of filibuster a win for Obama'].

On December 12, 2010, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that "[c]ampaign contributions to [Brown] from the financial industry spiked sharply during a critical three-week period last summer as the fate of the Wall Street regulatory overhaul hung in the balance and Brown used the leverage of his swing vote to win key concessions sought by firms."<ref name="Globe">Slack, Donovan (December 12, 2010) [https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/12/12/banks_donations_soared_as_brown_negotiated/?page=full Donations poured in as Brown's role grew], ''[[Boston Globe]]''</ref> Brown received more than ten times the amount of contributions from the [[financial services industry]] as [[House Financial Services Committee]] chairman (and author of the legislation) [[Barney Frank]] during the same period.<ref name="Globe" /> According to the ''[[Boston Globe|Globe]]'':

Brown's efforts benefited large Massachusetts companies such as MassMutual Financial Group, Liberty Mutual Insurance, Fidelity Investments, and State Street Corp., whose executives and political action committees contributed $29,000 to Brown during the three-week period he was extracting the concessions from Democrats.

They also benefited major out-of-state institutions such as Goldman Sachs, UBS, and JPMorgan Chase. Those and other out-of-state financial interests gave Brown a total of $50,000 during the period.<ref name="Globe" />}}

In December 2011, with a temporary payroll tax cut set to expire at the end of the month, the Senate considered the Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011, which would extend the tax cut for 113 million workers or families and fund the plan by a 3.25 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million.  Brown voted against proceeding to take up the bill (i.e., voted against [[cloture]] that would end the [[filibuster]]).  He announced that his opposition was to the surtax on high incomes.<ref>{{cite web| title = U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 112th Congress&nbsp;– 1st Session| publisher = [[United States Senate]]| date = December 1, 2011| url = https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&session=1&vote=00219| accessdate =December 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Citation

===Foreign policy===
Brown supported President Barack Obama's decision to send 30,000 more troops to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|fight in Afghanistan]]. He cited [[Stanley McChrystal]]'s recommendations as a reason for his support.<ref name="live" /> He also advocates that suspected terrorists be tried in [[military tribunal]]s and not civilian courts.<ref name="key" /> He also supported the limited use of "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]", including [[waterboarding]] against non-citizen terrorist suspects.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brown and Coakley clash over terror suspects' rights|date=January 5, 2010|accessdate=January 19, 2010|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/05/brown_coakley_clash_over_suspected_terrorists_rights/ |work=The Boston Globe | first=Brian C. | last=Mooney}}</ref> He supports a [[two-state solution]] for the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] in which Israel and a new, independent [[Palestinian state]] would co-exist side by side.<ref name="caller" />

===Veterans services===
In 2007, Brown wrote a law establishing a check off box on State income tax forms to allow a filer to indicate if he or she is a veteran of the [[Iraq War|Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]] wars. The measure's purpose is to locate and inform returning veterans of benefits they qualify for.  Known as the "Welcome Home" bonus, it was passed with [[bipartisan]] support.<ref name="bio" />  Brown also amended the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], with Senator [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]] ([[Rhode Island|RI]]), to create a dedicated military liaison office within the newly formed [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], which aside from defending against unscrupulous lenders, also ensures protection of military families against fraudulent life insurance policies.  The measure passed the [[United States Senate]] 99 to 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf |title=H.R. 4173 (111th Congress) |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}</ref>

===Health care===
Brown supported the 2006 [[Massachusetts health care reform]], which requires all residents to have [[health insurance]], with a state-subsidized plan created for those who cannot afford to insure themselves. Brown did not support President Obama's health care reform plan in the form approved.  He stated that the plan was fiscally unsound, and during his campaign he pledged to be the 41st vote to [[filibuster]] the bill in the Senate.<ref>{{cite news| author = Browenstein, Joseph| url = https://abcnews.go.com/Health/HealthCare/scott-brown-win-massachusetts-begs-question-health-care/story?id=9615918| title = Health Care Overhaul's Uncertain, Super-Majority-Free Future| work = [[ABC News]]| date = January 21, 2010}}</ref>

Brown voted for a state measure on patients' rights that, among other provisions, requires emergency rooms to provide what is known as the [[emergency contraception|morning-after pill]]<ref name="abcnews.go.com"/> to rape victims to prevent an unwanted pregnancy from developing.  In consideration of health care workers who might have a religious objection to administering this medication, Brown attached what became known as the Conscientious Objector amendment which would have exempted these workers, as well as religious hospitals, from being required to provide this medication.  However, Brown's amendment also required that all hospitals still had to provide a means for the patient to receive the medication, either by providing another healthcare worker willing to administer the medication, or, in the case of religious hospitals, to provide transportation to another facility, and in a timely manner.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/24/nation/la-na-scott-brown24-2010jan24 |title=What makes Scott Brown run? |author=Kathleen Hennessey |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 1, 2010}}</ref>  The amendment did not pass.<ref name="Estes">{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/06/in_debate_senate_candidates_seek_to_define_differences/?page=full |title=In debate, Senate candidates seek to define differences |author=Andrea Estes |work=The Boston Globe |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=March 1, 2010}}</ref> Brown remains in favor of allowing religious hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraception on moral or religious grounds, as he stated in the January 5, 2010 candidate debate.<ref name="Estes" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.969bostontalks.com/Podcasts/1466/010510senatedebatepart1.mp3 |title=96.9 Boston Talks podcast of the January 5, 2010 debate |accessdate=July 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707071222/http://media.969bostontalks.com/Podcasts/1466/010510senatedebatepart1.mp3 |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Energy policy===
Brown supports expanding [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], and [[nuclear power]], and [[offshore drilling]] exploration as a means to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.<ref name="dog" /> But, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an [[Cape Wind|offshore wind farm]] should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition, saying he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.<ref>{{cite news |author=Seelye, K.

Brown has stated that ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' is settled law and is self-described as "pro-choice" or [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-abortion rights]].
