'''Sylhet''' ({{lang-bn|সিলেট}}, [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]]: ꠍꠤꠟꠐ) is a [[metropolitan city]] in northeastern [[Bangladesh]]. It is the administrative seat of [[Sylhet Division]]. The city is located on the right bank of the [[Surma River]] in northeastern [[Bengal]]. It has a [[subtropical]] climate and lush highland terrain. The city has a population of more than half a million.<ref name="phc2011" /> Sylhet is one of Bangladesh's most important spiritual and cultural centres. It is one of the most important cities of Bangladesh, after [[Dhaka]] and [[Chittagong]] due to its importance to the country's economy. Sylhet produces the highest amount of tea and gas in the country.

In 1303, the Sultan of Lakhnauti [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] [[Conquest of Sylhet|conquered Sylhet]] by defeating [[Gour Govinda]].<ref name="Fazal2013">{{cite book |author=Tanweer Fazal |year=2013 |title=Minority Nationalisms in South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bGMAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA53 |publisher=Routledge |pages=53 |isbn=978-1-317-96647-0}}</ref> Sylhet was a realm of the [[Bengal Sultanate]].

The hinterland of the Sylhet valley is the largest [[Natural gas and petroleum in Bangladesh|oil and gas]]-producing region in Bangladesh. It is also the largest hub of [[tea production in Bangladesh]]. It is notable for its high-quality [[Arundo|cane]] and [[agarwood]].<ref name="global.britannica.com">https://www.britannica.com/place/Sylhet</ref><ref name="archive.thedailystar.net">{{Cite news |last=Siddiquee |first=Iqbal |date=19 October 2011 |title=Agar farming sees export markets |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-207067 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref> The city is served by the [[Osmani International Airport]] which is named after [[M. A. G. Osmani|General M A G Osmani]], the Commander of the Bangladesh Liberation Forces. People from Sylhet form a significant portion of the [[Bangladeshi diaspora]], particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as other countries in the Middle East.

==Toponymy==
{{Main|Names of Sylhet}}
The name ''Sylhet'' is an [[anglicisation]] of ''Shilhot'' (শিলহট). Its origins seem to come from the [[Sanskrit]] words of শিলা śilā (meaning stone) and হট্ট haṭṭa (meaning marketplace). These words match the landscape and topography of the hilly region. The shila stones were abundant across Sylhet and King [[Gour Govinda]] is known to have used stones to guard his capital. The word changed to Shilhot due to the [[elision]] of letter-final {{lang|bn|অ}} ''ô'' in the [[Bengali language]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/DUJL/article/view/3344|title=Politics and Literary Activities in the Bengali Language during the Independent Sultanate of Bengal|first=AKM Golam|last=Rabbani|date=7 November 2017|journal=Dhaka University Journal of Linguistics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=151–166 |access-date=7 November 2017 |via=banglajol.info}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Sylhet}}
{{See also|1971 Bangladesh genocide}}

In 1995, the Government of Bangladesh declared Sylhet as the sixth [[Divisions of Bangladesh|divisional headquarters]] of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londoni.co/index.php/travel-guide/29-location-guide/3-sylhet-bangladesh|title=Basics of Islam|website=Londoni}}</ref> Sylhet has played a vital role in the [[Bangladeshi economy]]. Several of Bangladesh's [[Finance Minister of Bangladesh|finance ministers]] have been Members of Parliament from the city of Sylhet. [[Badar Uddin Ahmed Kamran]] was a longtime mayor of Sylhet. [[Humayun Rashid Choudhury]], a diplomat from Sylhet, served as [[President of the UN General Assembly]] and Speaker of the [[Jatiyo Sangshad|Bangladesh National Parliament]].

In 2001, the municipality was upgraded to the [[Sylhet City Corporation]]. It was made a metropolitan city in 2009.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

== Geography and climate ==
Sylhet is located at {{Coord|24.8917|N|91.8833|E|}}, in the north eastern region of Bangladesh within the Sylhet Division, within the Sylhet District and Sylhet Sadar Upazila. Sylhet has a typical Bangladesh [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') bordering on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'') at higher elevations. The rainy season from April to October is hot and humid with very heavy showers and thunderstorms almost every day, whilst the short dry season from November to February is very warm and fairly clear. Nearly 80% of the annual average rainfall of {{convert|4200|mm|in|-1}} occurs between May and September.<ref>[http://weather.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx?wealocations=wc:BGXX0010&q=Sylhet%2c+BGD+forecast:averagesm Monthly Averages for Sylhet, BGD] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701141245/https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/ |date=1 July 2019 }} MSN Weather. Retrieved 25 May 2009.</ref>

The city is located within the region where there are hills and basins which constitute one of the most distinctive regions in Bangladesh. The [[physiography]] of Sylhet consists mainly of hill soils, encompassing a few large depressions known locally as "[[beel]]s" which can be mainly classified as [[oxbow lake]]s, caused by tectonic subsidence primarily during [[1762 Arakan earthquake|the earthquake of 1762]].

Geologically, the region is complex having diverse sacrificial geomorphology; high topography of Plio-[[Miocene]] age. Available limestone deposits in different parts of the region suggest that the whole area was under the ocean in the Oligo-Miocene. In the last 150 years three major earthquakes hit the city, at a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the [[Richter Scale]], the last one took place in 1918, although many people are unaware that Sylhet lies on an earthquake prone zone.<ref name="ds10Feb2006">{{cite news |last=Siddiquee |first=Iqbal |date=10 February 2006 |title=Sylhet growing as a modern urban centre |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/ourcities/ourcities24.htm |work=Our Cities: 15th Anniversary Special |publisher=The Daily Star |access-date=25 May 2009}}</ref>

Sylhet Municipality was established in 1878. A devastating earthquake demolished almost the entire town on [[1897 Assam earthquake|12 June 1897]] following which a modern and European model new town was built on the wreckage. Many new roads were constructed in the late 1890s and Sylhet became really connected to the other parts of the country with the establishment of an extension line of [[Assam Bengal Railway]] in 1912–15. From the beginning of the 20th century, the importance of Sylhet increased with the establishment of the tea industry. In the 1950s and 1960s, rapid urbanisation took place in the town, fostered by the expatriate Sylhetis and the process is still ongoing.

On 10 April 2001, Sylhet was changed to a city corporation from a municipal board, and currently the city is administrated by the ''Sylhet City Corporation''. At present, Sylhet is the district-headquarters as well as the divisional headquarters of the districts of [[Sunamganj]], [[Habiganj]], [[Moulvibazar District|Moulvibazar]] and [[Sylhet District]]. The Sylhet City Corporation is responsible for the services that are provided within the city which includes traffic, roads, garbage collection, water supply, registrations and many others. The corporation consists of the Mayor and 22 other commissioners, and focuses on the development of the city.<ref>[http://www.swadhinata.org.uk/sylhetpartnership/sylhet.htm The Sylhet City Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212105351/http://www.swadhinata.org.uk/sylhetpartnership/sylhet.htm |date=12 December 2009 }} Swadhinata Trust.

== Economy ==
[[File:Sylhet, by Murshed.jpg|thumb|One of the commercial areas of Sylhet]]
The Sylhet Metropolitan Area is one of Bangladesh's main business centers. Sylhet's economy is closely linked with the [[Bangladeshi diaspora]], especially the [[British Bangladeshi]] community. The city receives a significant portion of the country's annual [[remittances]], which have driven growth in real estate and construction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-16190888|title=Returning home to build mansion|date=22 December 2011|via=www.bbc.com|work=BBC News}}</ref> A number of shopping centers, restaurants and hotels have opened as a result. Sylhet also relies on [[religious tourism]], with thousands of devotees visiting its [[Sufi]] shrines annually, as well as [[ecotourism]] in its broader natural hinterland. Nature [[resort]]s have been built in the city's outskirts. Several important [[List of companies in Bangladesh|Bangladeshi companies]] are based in Sylhet, including Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution, Sylhet Gas Fields and [[Alim Industries Limited|Alim Industries]]. [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]] operates several flights from Sylhet to the United Kingdom and the Middle East. Roads connect Sylhet with the Indian states of [[Meghalaya]] and Assam.

Sylhet's [[hinterland]] plays a vital role in the [[economy of Bangladesh]]. It is home to the country's largest [[natural gas]] fields, sole [[crude oil]] field,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Haripur_Oilfield|title=Haripur Oilfield - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org}}</ref> largest [[tea]] plantations, rubber, [[palm oil]], [[Arundo|cane]], [[agarwood]]<ref name="archive.thedailystar.net"/> and [[citrus]] farms. Rice production in the region is one of the country's highest. Heavy industries include [[power plant]]s, [[fertilizer]] plants, cement plants and [[liquefied petroleum gas]] plants. Other major industries in the region include [[ceramics]], machinery and equipment, ready-made garments and pharmaceuticals. Most of the tea production in Bangladesh is based around Sylhet, and the industry also has significant exports. The area is also known for producing oranges and other similar fruits. One of these fruit is called "Satkara" which is a variety of grapefruit that can be used in pickles and even as an ingredient in traditional Sylheti curry dishes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Two Bangladeshi [[Finance Minister of Bangladesh|finance ministers]] from the city have been elected to the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]: [[Saifur Rahman (politician)|Saifur Rahman]] of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and [[Abul Maal Abdul Muhith]] of the Awami League.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Sylhet}}
[[File:Hason Raja.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hason Raja]]]]
Sylhet has a very diverse culture which is noticeably distinct from that of Bengali owing to the influx of multi-ethnic immigrants in ancient times. There is a widely held misconception through which Sylhetis are usually seen as having a conservative mindset; a very inaccurate portrayal of Sylhetis and their culture, while in reality it's quite the opposite thanks to Sylheti culture's liberal and pro-plurality outlook. Sylhet is religiously very diverse, and is noted for peaceful co-existence, harmony, and mutual respect between its inhabitants of different faiths since ancient times. Sylhet has a distinct cultural and economic development, and [[Sylheti language|linguistic differences]] (Greater Sylhet region was a part of Assam and Surma Valley State for much of the British Raj in comparison to the rest of Bangladesh), and given that Sylhet has, for most of its recent history, been a region of a larger entity.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/20/race.bookscomment Not all Bangladeshis oppose the filming of Brick Lane] The Guardian (by Iqbal Ahmed) 20 July 2006</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/29/topstories3.books 'You sanctimonious philistine' – Rushdie v Greer, the sequel] The Guardian (by Paul Lewis) 29 July 2006</ref> As so many Sylhetis are resident abroad, Sylhet has a major flow of foreign currency from non-resident Bangladeshis.

The traditional dance of Sylhet is called ''Sylheti Dhamail''.
