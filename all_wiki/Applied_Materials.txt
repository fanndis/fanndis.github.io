==History==

Founded in 1967 by Michael A. McNeilly and others, Applied Materials [[Initial public offering|went public]] in 1972.  In subsequent years, the company diversified, until James C. Morgan became CEO in 1976 and returned the company's focus to its core business of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Tyya N.|title=Vault Guide to the Top Manufacturing Employers|date=14 June 2005|publisher=Vault|isbn=978-1581313246|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6puQvy0Yf8C&pg=PA30|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=McCaffery|first1=Richard|title=TMF Interview With Applied Materials Chairman and Chief Executive James Morgan|url=http://www.fool.com/foolaudio/transcripts/1999/stocktalk991222_amat.htm|accessdate=16 April 2016|work=The Motley Fool|date=17 December 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811225937/http://www.fool.com/foolaudio/transcripts/1999/stocktalk991222_amat.htm|archive-date=11 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> By 1978, sales increased by 17%.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wheelwright|first1=Steven C.|title=Managing New Product and Process Development: Text Cases|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451602319|page=428|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awmav051w24C&pg=PA428|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref>

In November 1996, Applied Materials acquired two [[Israel]]i companies for an aggregate amount of $285 million. Opal Technologies and Orbot Instruments for $175 million and $110 million in cash, respectively. Orbot produces systems for inspecting patterned silicon wafers for yield enhancement during the semiconductor manufacturing process, as well as systems for inspecting masks used during the patterning process. Opal develops and manufactures high-speed [[metrology]] systems used by semiconductor manufacturers to verify critical dimensions during the production of integrated circuits.<ref>{{cite news|title=Applied Materials Buys Orbot Instruments, Opal for $285 Mln; Opal chairman Meny Erad: "This is a great day for Israeli high-tech." |url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=352491 |newspaper=Globes |date=26 November 1996 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116102738/http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=352491 |archive-date=16 January 2013 }}</ref>

==Organization==
Applied is organized into three major business sectors: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.<ref name="Aug16 PR">{{cite press release |date=18 August 2016 |title=Applied Materials Announces Record Results |url=http://www.appliedmaterials.com/company/news/press-releases/2016/08/applied-materials-announces-record-results |publisher=Applied Materials |access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> Applied Materials also operates a [[Venture Capital|venture]] investing arm called Applied Ventures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Malia|title=Why Intel, Applied Materials are banking on a Corvallis startup|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/morning_call/2014/02/why-corvallis-may-be-critical-to-the.html|accessdate=4 May 2016|work=Portland Business Journal|date=20 February 2014}}</ref>

=== Semiconductor Systems ===
The company develops and manufactures equipment used in the wafer fabrication steps of [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|creating a semiconductor device]], including [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD), [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD), [[rapid thermal processing]] (RTP), [[chemical mechanical polishing]] (CMP), etch, [[ion implantation]] and wafer inspection.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shields|first1=Anne|title=Overview of Applied Materials Silicon Systems segment|url=http://marketrealist.com/2015/01/overview-applied-materials-silicon-systems-segment/|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=Market Realist|date=12 January 2015}}</ref> The company acquired Semitool for this group in late 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pimentel|first1=Benjamin|last2=Bartash|first2=Jeffry|title=Applied Materials to acquire Semitool for $364 million|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/applied-materials-to-buy-semitool-for-364-millon-2009-11-17|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=MarketWatch|date=17 November 2009}}</ref> In 2019, Applied Materials agreed to buy semiconductor manufacturer Kokusai for $2.2 Billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/applied-materials-said-buy-kokusai-055450368.html|title=Applied Materials to Buy Kokusai From KKR for $2.2 Billion|website=finance.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref>

=== Applied Global Services ===
The Applied Global Services (AGS) group offers equipment installation support and warranty extended support, as well as maintenance support. AGS also offers new and refurbished equipment, as well as upgrades and enhancements for installed base equipment. This sector also includes automation software for manufacturing environments.<ref name="Aug16 PR" />

=== Display and Adjacent Markets ===

AGS combined an existing business unit with the display business of [[Applied Films Corporation]], acquired in mid-2006.

The manufacturing process for [[TFT LCD]]s (thin film transistor liquid crystal displays), commonly employed in computer monitors and televisions, is similar to that employed for [[integrated circuit]]s. In cleanroom environments both TFT-LCD and integrated circuit production use [[photolithography]], chemical and physical vapor deposition, and testing.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Energy and Environmental Solutions (former sector) ===

In 2006, the company acquired Applied Films, a glass coating and web coating business. Also in 2006, Applied announced it was entering the solar manufacturing equipment business. The solar, glass and web businesses were organized into the company's Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) sector.

In 2007, Applied announced the Applied SunFab [[thin film]] photovoltaic module production line, with [[single-junction cell|single]] or [[Tandem cell|tandem junction]] capability. SunFab applies [[silicon thin film]] layers to glass substrate that then produce electricity when exposed to sunlight. In 2009, the company's SunFab line was certified by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2009/01/amats-sunfab-modules-awarded-iec-certification-54520.html|title="AMAT's SunFab Modules Awarded IEC Certification."

Since July 2016 this sector is no longer reported separately. Remaining solar business activities have been included in "Corporate and Others".<ref name="Aug16 PR" />
