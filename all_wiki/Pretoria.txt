'''Pretoria''' ({{IPA-af|prɛˈtʊəria}};<ref>{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Pretoria|accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> {{lang-zu|ePitoli}}), is one of [[South Africa]]’s three [[Capital city|capital cities]],<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Pretoria|title=Pretoria {{!}} national administrative capital, South Africa |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=18 July 2018|language=en}}</ref> serving as the seat of the executive branch of government, and as the host to all foreign embassies to South Africa.<ref name="auto"/> ([[Cape Town]] is the [[legislature|legislative]] capital and [[Bloemfontein]] the [[judicial]] capital.)<ref>{{cite web |title=South Africa at a glance |url=https://www.gov.za/about-sa/south-africa-glance |website=South African Government |accessdate=18 June 2020 |quote=Bloemfontein (judicial)  The Constitutional Court is located in Johannesburg.}}</ref>

Pretoria straddles the [[Apies River]] and extends eastward into the foothills of the [[Magaliesberg]] mountains. It has a reputation as an academic city and center of research, being home to the [[Tshwane University of Technology]] (TUT), the [[University of Pretoria]] (UP), Sefako Makgatho Health Science University (SMU), the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA), the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), and the [[Human Sciences Research Council]]. It also hosts the [[National Research Foundation (South Africa)|National Research Foundation]] and the [[South African Bureau of Standards]]. Pretoria was one of the host cities of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Pretoria is the eighth richest city in Africa and the fourth richest in South Africa.

Pretoria is the central part of the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality|Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] which was formed by the amalgamation of several former local authorities, including [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] and [[Soshanguve]]. Some have proposed [[Pretoria#Proposed change of name| changing the official name from Pretoria to Tshwane]], which has caused some public controversy.

Pretoria is named after the [[Voortrekker]] leader [[Andries Pretorius]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Raper|first=Peter E.|title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names|url=https://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames/SaPlaceNames#page/n373/mode/2up|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=28 August 2013|page=373|year=1987}}</ref> and South Africans sometimes call it the "Jacaranda City," because of the thousands of [[Jacaranda mimosifolia|jacaranda]] trees planted along its streets and in its parks and gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/provinces.htm#gauteng |title=South Africa's provinces: Gauteng |accessdate=14 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622084057/http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/provinces.htm#gauteng |archivedate=22 June 2011  }}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Pretoria}}
[[File:Pretorius.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Andries Pretorius]] (27 November 1798 – 23 July 1853), Pretoria's eponym]]
Pretoria was founded in 1855 by [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius|Marthinus Pretorius]], a leader of the [[Voortrekkers]], who named it after his father [[Andries Pretorius]] and chose a spot on the banks of the ''[[Apies River|Apies rivier]]'' ([[Afrikaans]] for "Monkeys river") to be the new [[capital city|capital]] of the [[South African Republic]] ({{lang-nl|Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek}}; ZAR). The elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the Voortrekkers after his victory over [[Dingane]] and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s in the [[Battle of Blood River]] in 1838. The elder Pretorius also negotiated the [[Sand River Convention]] (1852), in which the United Kingdom acknowledged the independence of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. It became the capital of the South African Republic on 1 May 1860.

The founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end of the Boers' settlement movements of the [[Great Trek]].

===Boer Wars===
{{Main|Boer Wars}}
During the [[First Boer War]], the city was besieged by Republican forces in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty which ended the war was signed in Pretoria on 3 August 1881 at the [[Pretoria Convention]].

The [[Second Boer War]] resulted in the end of the [[Transvaal Republic]] and start of British [[hegemony]] in South Africa. The city surrendered to British forces under [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]] on 5 June 1900 and the conflict was ended in Pretoria with the signing of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902 at [[Melrose House]].

The [[Pretoria Forts]] were built for the defence of the city just prior to the Second Boer War. Though some of these forts are today in ruins, a number of them have been preserved as national monuments.

[[File:Union-buildings-pretoria.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Union Buildings]], seat of South Africa's government]]

===Union of South Africa===
{{Main|Union of South Africa}}
The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the [[Orange River Colony]] were united with the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and [[Natal Colony]] in 1910 to become the [[Union of South Africa]]. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital and Bloemfontein served as the judicial capital. Between 1910 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. (As the capital of the ZAR, Pretoria had superseded [[Potchefstroom]] in that role.)
On 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status.<ref>South African History Online, [http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/pretoria-receives-city-status], 2011]</ref> When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 54</ref>

==Geography==
Pretoria is situated approximately {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of [[Johannesburg]] in the northeast of [[South Africa]], in a transitional belt between the plateau of the [[Highveld]] to the south and the lower-lying [[Bushveld]] to the north. It lies at an altitude of about {{convert|1,339|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm|title=Elevation Finder|first=Free Map|last=Tools|publisher=}}</ref> in a warm, sheltered, fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the [[Magaliesberg]] range.

===Climate===
[[File:Magaliesberg08.jpg|thumb|The city is surrounded by the [[Magaliesberg]] range]]
Pretoria has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cwa) with long hot rainy summers, and short, mild winters. The city experiences the typical winters of South Africa with cold, clear nights and mild to moderately warm days. Although the average lows during winter are mild, it can get cold due to the clear skies, with nighttime low temperatures in recent years in the range of {{convert|2|to|-5|C|abbr=on}}.

The average annual temperature is {{convert|18.7|°C}}.<ref>GHCN climate data, 30-year climate average 1979–2008, Goddard Institute of Space Studies</ref> This is rather high, considering the city's relatively high altitude of about {{convert|1,339|m|abbr=off}}, and is due mainly to its sheltered valley position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for much of the year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Rain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in 1959, 1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history.

During a nationwide heatwave in November 2011, Pretoria experienced temperatures that reached {{convert|39|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, unusual for that time of the year. Similar record-breaking extreme heat events also occurred in January 2013, when Pretoria experienced temperatures exceeding {{convert|37|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} on several days. The year 2014 was one of the wettest on record for the city. A total of {{convert|914|mm|0|abbr=on}} fell up to the end of December, with {{convert|220|mm|0|abbr=on}} recorded in this month alone. In 2015, Pretoria saw its worst drought since 1982;  the month of November 2015 saw new records broken for high temperatures, with {{convert|43|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} recorded on 11 November after three weeks of temperatures between {{convert|35|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|43|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}. Pretoria reached a new record high of {{convert|44|C|abbr=on}} on 7 January 2016.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Depending on the extent of the area understood to constitute "Pretoria", the population ranges from 700,000<ref>Population, according to the 2001 Census, of the [http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/77612 Pretoria "main place"].</ref> to 2.95&nbsp;million.<ref>Population, according to the [http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf 2007 Community Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825124835/http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf |date=25 August 2013 }}, of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality after the 2011 annexation of the Metsweding District Municipality.</ref> The main languages spoken in Pretoria are [[Pedi language|Sepedi]], [[Sotho language|Sesotho]], [[Setswana language|Setswana]], [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]], [[Afrikaans]] and English. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since its founding, it has been a major [[Afrikaner]] population centre, and there are roughly 1&nbsp;million Afrikaners living in or around the city.

=== Ethnic groups ===
Even since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself has had a white majority, albeit with an ever-increasing black middle-class. However, in the townships of [[Soshanguve]] and [[Atteridgeville]] black people make up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the [[Afrikaners]] and the largest black ethnic group are the [[Northern Sotho people|Northern Sotho]]s.

The lower estimate for the population of Pretoria includes largely former white-designated areas, and there is therefore a white majority. However, including the geographically separate townships increases Pretoria's population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.

Pretoria's [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] were ordered to move from Pretoria to [[Laudium]] on 6 June 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/transfer-indian-community-pretoria-laudium-ordered|title=Transfer of the Indian community of Pretoria to Laudium ordered.|last=tinashe|date=1 June 2012|publisher=}}</ref>

==Cityscape==
Pretoria is known as the "Jacaranda City" due to the approximately 50,000 [[Jacaranda]]s that line its streets. Purple is a colour often associated with the city and is often included on local council logos and services such as the [[A Re Yeng]] rapid bus system and the logo of the local [[Jacaranda FM]] radio station.

===Architecture===
{{See also|Pretoria Forts}}
:''{{Commons category-inline||bullet=none|Buildings in Pretoria}}''

Pretoria has over the years had very diverse cultural influences and this is reflected in the architectural styles that can be found in the city. It ranges from 19th century Dutch, German and British [[colonial architecture]] to [[Modern architecture|modern]], [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], [[neomodern]], and [[Art Deco|art deco]] architecture styles with a good mix of a uniquely South African style.

Some of the notable structures in Pretoria include the late 19th century [[Palace of Justice (South Africa)|Palace of Justice]], the early 20th century [[Union Buildings]], the post-war [[Voortrekker Monument]], the diverse buildings dotting the main campuses of both the [[University of Pretoria]] and the [[University of South Africa]], traditional [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch]] style [[Mahlamba Ndlopfu]] (the President's House), the more modern [[Reserve Bank of South Africa]] (office skyscraper) and the Telkom [[Lukasrand Tower]]. Other well-known structures and buildings include the [[Loftus Versfeld Stadium]], The South African [[State Theatre, South Africa|State Theatre]] and the Oliver Tambo building which is the Headquarters of the [[Department of International Relations and Cooperation]].

===Central business district===
[[File:Prétoria-skyline.jpg|thumb|The Central Business District]]

Despite the many corporate offices, small businesses, shops, and government departments that are situated in [[List of Pretoria suburbs|Pretoria's sprawling suburbs]], its Central Business District still retains its status as the traditional centre of government and commerce. Many banks, businesses, large corporations, shops, shopping centres, and other businesses are situated in the city centre which is towered by several large skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the Poyntons Building ({{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} tall), the ABSA Building ({{convert|132|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} tall) and the [[Reserve Bank of South Africa]] building ({{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} tall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/southafricanreservebankbuilding-pretoria-southafrica |title=South African Reserve Bank Building, Pretoria &#124; Building 103551 |location=Pretoria / |publisher=Emporis |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>

The area contains a large amount of historical buildings, monuments, and museums that include the [[Pretoria City Hall]], Pretorius Square, [[Church Square, Pretoria|Church Square]] (along with its many historical buildings and statues), and the [[Ou Raadsaal]]. There is also the [[Transvaal Museum]] (the country's leading natural history museum, which although it has changed venues a number of times, has been around since 1892), the [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa]] (or more colloquially known as the Pretoria Zoo), [[Melrose House]] Museum in Jacob Maré Street, the [[Pretoria Art Museum]] and the [[African Window]] Cultural History Museum.

Several National Departments also have Head Offices in the Central Business district such as the Department of Health, Basic Education, Transport, Higher Education and Training, Sport and Recreation, Justice and Constitutional Development, Public Service and Administration, Water and Environmental Affairs and the National Treasury. The district also has a high number of residential buildings which house people who primarily work in the district.

===Parks and gardens===
Pretoria is home to the [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa]], as well as the [[Pretoria National Botanical Garden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sa-venues.com/national-botanical-gardens.htm|title=National Botanical Gardens|publisher=SA-Venues|accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref> There are also a number of smaller parks and gardens located throughout the city, including the [[Austin Roberts (zoologist)|Austin Roberts]] Bird Sanctuary, Pretorius Square gardens, the Pretoria [[Rosarium]], [[Church Square, Pretoria|Church Square]], Pretoria Showgrounds, [[Springbok Park]], [[Freedom Park (South Africa)|Freedom Park]], [[Jan Cilliers Park]] and [[Burgers Park]], the oldest park in the city and now a national monument. In the suburbs there are also several parks that are notable: Rietondale Park, "Die Proefplaas" in the Queenswood suburb, Magnolia Dell Park, Nelson Mandela Park and Mandela Park Peace Garden and Belgrave Square Park.

====Jacaranda city====
[[File:Jacaranda Trees Pretoria.jpg|thumb|A street lined with [[Jacaranda mimosifolia|jacarandas]] in Pretoria, with the [[Union Buildings]] atop [[Meintjieskop]] in the background]]

{{One source|section|date=November 2019}}
Pretoria's nickname "the Jacaranda City" comes from the around 70,000 jacaranda trees that grow in Pretoria and decorate the city each October with their purple blossoms. The first two trees were planted in 1888 in the garden of local gardener, [[J.D. Cilliers]], at Myrtle Lodge on Celliers Street in [[Sunnyside, Pretoria|Sunnyside]]. He obtained the seedlings from a Cape Town nurseryman who had harvested them in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The two trees still stand on the grounds of the Sunnyside Primary School.

The jacaranda comes from tropical [[South America]] and belongs to the family [[Bignoniaceae]]. There are around fifty species of jacaranda, but the one found most often in the warmer areas of [[Southern Africa]] is [[Jacaranda mimosifolia]].

At the end of the 19th century, the flower and tree grower James Clark imported jacaranda seedlings from [[Australia]] and began growing them on a large scale. In November 1906, he donated two hundred small saplings to the Pretoria City Council, which planted them on Koch Street (today Bosman Street). The city engineer Walton Jameson, soon known as "Jacaranda Jim," launched a program to plant jacaranda trees throughout Pretoria, and by 1971 there would already be 55,000 of them in the city.

Most jacarandas in Pretoria are lilac in color, but there are also white ones planted on Herbert Baker Street in [[Groenkloof]].

The Jacaranda Carnival is an old tradition that was held from 1939 to 1964. After a hiatus of over twenty years, it resumed in 1985. Festivities include a colorful march and the crowning of the Jacaranda Queen.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boshoff |first1=Dawie |title=Jakarandastad vier fees |journal=Suid-Afrikaanse Panorama |date=March–April 1990 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=73–75}}</ref>

===Buses===
Various bus companies exist in Pretoria, of which [[PUTCO]] is one of the oldest and most recognised. Tshwane municipality provides the remainder of the bus services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshwane.gov.za/busbooklet.cfm |title=Tshwane Bus Booklet |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528122549/http://www.tshwane.gov.za/busbooklet.cfm |archivedate=28 May 2010}}</ref>

===Road===
The [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] is the major freeway that runs through Pretoria. It enters the city from the south as the [[Ben Schoeman Highway]]. At the Brakfontein Interchange with the [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] it continues as The N1 Eastern Bypass bisects the large expanse of the eastern suburbs, routing traffic from [[Johannesburg]] to [[Polokwane]] and the north of the country. The [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]] is the original N1, and served the same function before the construction of the highway. It runs through the centre of city rather than the eastern suburbs.

The [[N4 road (South Africa)|N4]] enters the city as a highway from [[Witbank|eMalahleni]] in the east, merging with the N1 at the Proefplaas Interchange. It begins again north of the city, branching west from the N1 as the [[Platinum Highway]], forming the [[Pretoria Bypass|Northern Bypass]], and heading to [[Rustenburg]]. The N4 runs east–west through South Africa, connecting [[Maputo]] to [[Gaborone]]. Before the Platinum Highway was built, the N4 continued passed the Proefplaas Interchange to the city centre, where it became a regular road, before again becoming a highway west of the city. These roads are now designated the M2 and M4. There is a third, original east–west road: the [[R104 road (South Africa)|R104]], previously named Church Street. Church Street has been renamed Helen Joseph from Nelson Mandela Church Square, WF Nkomo from Nelson Mandela to R511, Stanza Bopape from Nelson Mandela to the East and Elias Motswaledi from R511 to the West.

The [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] starts in the centre of town from the M4 (former N4). It is a normal road heading south through the centre before becoming the Ben Schoeman highway. At the Brakfontein interchange, the Ben Schoeman highway becomes the N1, but the N14 continues as the intersecting west-south-western highway towards [[Krugersdorp]]. The [[R114 road (South Africa)|R114]] parallels the N14 in its westward journey running just to the north of the highway.

The [[R21 road (South Africa)|R21]] provides a second north–south highway, further east. It starts from the Fountains Interchange south of the city centre, but is still a road until Monument Park, when it becomes a true highway. It crosses the N1 east of the Brakfontein Interchange at the Flying Saucer Interchange and runs north–south towards [[Ekurhuleni]] (specifically [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]] and [[Boksburg]]). Importantly it links Pretoria with the [[OR Tambo International Airport]] in Kempton Park.

A proposed third north–south highway, in the west of the city, the [[R80 road (South Africa)|R80]] is partially built. At present the highway begins in [[Soshanguve]]. It terminates just north of the city centre at an intersection with the M1. Plans have been in place for some time to extend this all the way past the M4 and N14 highways to the N1 in Randburg.

Pretoria is also served by many regional roads. The [[R55 road (South Africa)|R55]] starts at an interchange with the R80, and runs north–south west of the city to [[Sandton]]. The [[R50 road (South Africa)|R50]] starts from the N1 just after the Flying Saucer Interchange in the south-east of the city, and continues south-east towards [[Delmas, Mpumalanga|Delmas]]. The [[R511 road (South Africa)|R511]] runs north–south from [[Randburg]] towards [[Brits, North West|Brits]] and barely by-passes Pretoria to the west. The [[R514 road (South Africa)|R514]] starts from the M1, north of the city centre, and terminates at the R511. The [[R513 road (South Africa)|R513]] crosses Pretoria's northern suburbs from east to west. It links Pretoria to [[Cullinan, Gauteng|Cullinan]] and [[Bronkhorstspruit]] in the east and [[Hartbeespoort]] in the west. The [[R566 road (South Africa)|R566]] takes origin in Pretoria's northern suburbs, and exits the town to the west just north of the R513. It connects Pretoria to [[Brits, North West|Brits]]. Finally the [[R573 road (South Africa)|R573]] starts from the R513, just east of the town and heads north-east to [[Siyabuswa]].

Pretoria is also served internally by [[Metropolitan Routes in Pretoria|metropolitan routes]].

===Airports===
For scheduled air services, Pretoria is served by Johannesburg's airports: [[OR Tambo International Airport|OR Tambo International]], {{convert|45|km}} south of central Pretoria; and [[Lanseria Airport|Lanseria]], {{convert|35|km}} south-west of the city. [[Wonderboom Airport]] in the suburb of Wonderboom in the north of Pretoria primarily services light commercial and private aircraft. However, as from August 2015, scheduled flights from Wonderboom Airport to Cape Town International Airport were made available by SA Airlink. There are two military air bases to the south of the city, [[AFB Swartkop|Swartkop]] and [[AFB Waterkloof|Waterkloof]].

===Music===
A number of popular South African bands and musicians are originally from Pretoria. These include Desmond and the Tutus, Bittereinder, The Black Cat Bones, [[Seether]], popular mostwako rapper [[JR (rapper)|JR]], Joshua na die Reën and [[DJ Mujava]] who was raised in the town of Attridgeville.

The song "Marching to Pretoria" refers to this city.  Pretoria was the capital of the [[South African Republic]] (a.k.a. Republic of the Transvaal; 1852–1881 and 1884–1902) the principal battleground for the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]], the latter which brought both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State republic under British rule.  "Marching to Pretoria" was one of the songs that British soldiers sang as they marched from the [[Cape Colony]], under British Rule since 1814, to the capital of the Southern African Republic (or in Dutch, ''Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek''). As the song's refrain puts it: "We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria/We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hurrah."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/folk-songs-with-chords/Marching%20To%20Pretoria.htm |title=Traditional & Folk Songs with Chords: Marching To Pretoria |publisher=Traditionalmusic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>

The opening line of [[John Lennon]]'s [[Beatles]]' song [[I Am the Walrus]], "I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together," is often believed to be based on the lyric "I'm with you and you're with me and so we are all together"<ref>traditionalmusic.co.uk, ''op. cit.''</ref> in "Marching to Pretoria." Lennon denied this, insisting his lyrics came from "nothing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/i-am-the-walrus/lyrics.html |title="'I Am the Walrus' Lyrics," Shmoop: We Speak Student |publisher=Shmoop.com |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>

===Jewish community===
{{further|Afrikaner-Jews|Lithuanian Jews}}
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2019}}
Pretoria has a small Jewish community of around 3,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Support Association for Zionism – South African Jewry: History of Pretoria Jewry |url=http://www.sazionism.co.za/history-of-pretoria-jewry.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721043724/http://www.sazionism.co.za/history-of-pretoria-jewry.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 July 2015 |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref> Jewish citizens have been in Pretoria since its foundation in the 19th century and played an important role in its industrial and economic growth. A Mr. De Vries, the first Jewish inhabitant of Pretoria, was a prominent citizen and prosecutor, a member of the [[Volksraad]] and a pioneer of the [[Afrikaans language]]. Another famed Jewish Pretorian was [[Sammy Marks]].

Other early Jewish settlers, many of them immigrants from [[Lithuania]], were not as educated as De Vries and often did not speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Afrikaans, or [[English language|English]]. Many of them spoke only [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and made a living as shopkeepers in the local retail industry. Most Jewish residents stayed neutral in the [[Second Boer War]], though some joined the [[South African Republic]] army.

The first congregation was founded between 1890 and 1895, and in 1898 the first synagogue opened on Paul Kruger Street. A second synagogue, known as the Great Synagogue, opened in 1922. Both synagogues are no longer in operation, but a [[Reformed Judaism|Reformed]] synagogue, Temple Menorah, opened in the early 1950s.

The Jewish community of Pretoria's golden age was in the early 20th century, when many Jewish sports clubs, charities, and youth groups flourished. After 1948, many Jews left for Cape Town or Johannesburg.

The synagogue on Paul Kruger Street was purchased by the government in 1952 to become the new home of the High Court where prominent opposition figures in the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were tried, including [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Walter Sisulu]], and 26 others were prosecuted for treason from 1 August 1958 to 29 March 1961; the [[Rivonia Trial]] was held there in 1963–1964.

Two Jewish schools arose in Pretoria, the Miriam Marks School, which was founded in 1905, and the Carmel School, which opened in 1959. Only the second, currently also operating as a synagogue, remains. Pretoria's Reformed congregation shares a rabbi with the Johannesburg one, though the synagogue no longer operates and services take place in worshippers' private homes.

===Buddhist community===
A [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] center, the Jang Chup Chopel Rigme Centre ("Center of Light") was founded in early January 2015 by Duan Pienaar or Gyalten Nyima (his adopted monastic name) in [[Waverley, Pretoria|Waverley]] around Pretoria-Moot. Pienaar is the only Afrikaner ordained in the highly selective [[Tibet]]an [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhist]] community in [[Bylakuppe]], in southern [[India]]. His instructor [[Lama]] [[Kyabje Choden Rinpoche]] is the highest tantric master after the [[Dalai Lama]]. Pienaar, who studied Buddhist teachers for twenty years, spent two years in India.<ref>{{cite journal |title=En daar verrys toe 'n Boeddhiste-sentrum |journal=Pretoria Moot Rekord |date=24 April 2015 |page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Zyl |first1=Seugnet |title=Boere-Boeddhis begin sentrum in Pretoria |url=https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Boere-Boeddhis-begin-sentrum-in-Pretoria-20150415 |accessdate=16 November 2019 |work=Netwerk24 |date=15 April 2015}}</ref>

===Commerce===
The city is a major commercial centre and an important industrial centre. Its main industries are iron and steel works, copper casting, and the manufacture of automobiles, railway carriages and heavy machinery.

Pretoria has a number of industrial areas, business districts and small home businesses. A number of chambers of commerce exist for Pretoria and its business community including Pretoriaweb, a business networking group that meets once a month to discuss the issues of doing business in Pretoria. The members of Pretoriaweb also discuss issues in various social media environments and on the website.

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Pretoria coa.jpg|thumb|Pretoria civic coat of arms (1907)]]
The Pretoria civic arms, designed by Dr. Frans Engelenburg,<ref name=pre>Bodel, J.D.;  'The Coat of Arms and Other Heraldic Symbols of the City of Pretoria' in ''Pretoriana'' (November 1989).</ref> were granted by the [[College of Arms]] on 7 February 1907.  They were registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in March 1953<ref name=og>Transvaal ''Official Gazette'' 2372 (11 March 1953).</ref> and at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in May 1968.<ref name=boh>http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Bureau provided new artwork, in a more modern style, in 1989.<ref name=tor>'Nuwe Standswapen' in ''Toria'' (July 1989).</ref>

The arms were: ''Gules, on an mimosa tree eradicated proper within an orle of eight bees volant, Or, an inescutcheon Or and thereon a Roman praetor seated proper''.  In layman's terms : a red shield displaying an uprooted mimosa tree surrounded by a border of eight golden bees, superimposed on the tree is a golden shield depicting a Roman praetor. The tree represented growth, the bees industry, and the praetor (judge) was an heraldic pun on the name.

The crest was a three-towered golden castle;  the supporters were an eland and a kudu;  and the motto ''Praestantia praevaleat Pretoria''.
The coat of arms have gone out of favour after the City Council amalgamated with its surrounding councils to form the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]].

===Tertiary education===
{{See also|List of universities in South Africa}}

Pretoria is one of South Africa's leading academic cities and is home to both the largest residential university in South Africa, largest distance education university in South Africa and a research intensive university.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The three Universities in the city in order of the year founded are as follows:

====University of South Africa====
[[File:UNISA Main Campus.jpg|thumb|The Muckleneuk Campus of [[UNISA]].]]
The [[University of South Africa]] (commonly referred to as Unisa), founded in 1873 as the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]], is the largest university on the African continent and attracts a third of all higher education students in South Africa. It spent most of its early history as an examining agency for Oxford and Cambridge universities and as an incubator from which most other universities in South Africa are descended. In 1946 it was given a new role as a distance education university and in 2012 it had a student headcount of over 300,000 students, including African and international students in 130 countries worldwide, making it one of the world's mega universities. Unisa is a dedicated open distance education institution and offers both vocational and academic programmes.

====University of Pretoria====
[[File:Ou Lettere, e, Tuks.jpg|thumb|Old Arts Building (''Ou Lettere Gebou'') of the [[University of Pretoria]].]]
The [[University of Pretoria]] (commonly referred to as UP, Tuks, or Tukkies) is a multi campus [[public university|public]] research university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100523104119724 |title=SA Universities Retrieved 21 January 2011 |publisher=Universityworldnews.com |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> The university was established in 1908 as the Pretoria campus of the [[Johannesburg]] based [[Transvaal University College]] and is the fourth South African institution in continuous operation to be awarded university status.

====Tshwane University of Technology====
[[File:Tshwane University of Technology.jpg|thumb|[[Tshwane University of Technology]].]]
The [[Tshwane University of Technology]] (commonly referred to as TUT) is a [[higher education]] institution, offering [[vocational]] oriented diplomas and degrees, and came into being through a merger of Technikon Northern Gauteng, Technikon North-West and Technikon Pretoria. TUT caters for approximately 60,000 students and it has become the largest residential higher education institution in South Africa.

===CSIR===
The [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) is South Africa's central scientific research and development organisation. It was established by an act of [[Parliament of South Africa|parliament]] in 1945 and is situated on its own [[campus]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csir.co.za/profile_of_csir.html |title=Profile of the |publisher=CSIR |accessdate=16 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120724121225/http://www.csir.co.za/profile_of_csir.html |archivedate=24 July 2012  }}</ref> It is the largest research and development organisation in Africa and accounts for about 10% of the entire African R&D budget. It has a staff of approximately 3,000 technical and scientific researchers, often working in multi-disciplinary teams. In 2002, Dr. Sibusiso Sibisi was appointed as the president and CEO of the CSIR.

===Air force bases===
While technically not within the city limits of Pretoria, [[Air Force Base Swartkop]] and [[Air Force Base Waterkloof]] are often used for defence related matters within the city. These may include aerial military transport duties within the city, aerospace monitoring and defence as well as VIP transport to and from the city.

==Proposed change of name==
On 26 May 2005 the [[South African Geographical Names Council]] (SAGNC), which is linked to the Directorate of Heritage in the Department of Arts and Culture, approved changing the name of Pretoria to [[Tshwane]], which is already the name of the Metropolitan Municipality<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4584211.stm |title=Pretoria name change is approved|work=BBC News  |date=27 May 2005 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> in which Pretoria, and a number of surrounding cities are located. Although the name change was approved by the SAGNC, it has not yet been approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture. The matter is under consideration while he has requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer that public response back to the SAGNC, before presenting his recommendation before parliament, who will vote on the change. Various public interest groups have warned that the name change will be challenged in court, should the minister approve the renaming. The long process involved made it unlikely the name would change anytime soon, if ever, even assuming the Minister had approved the change in early 2006.

The Tshwane Metro Council has advertised ''Tshwane'' as "Africa's leading capital city" since the name change was approved by the SAGNC in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed officially, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. Following a complaint lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it was ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,9294,2-7-12_2097251,00.html |title=SABC pulls 'Tshwane city' ads |publisher=News24.com |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309023142/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0%2C9294%2C2-7-12_2097251%2C00.html |archivedate=9 March 2009  }}</ref>  Despite the rulings of the ASA, Tshwane Metro Council failed to discontinue their "City of Tshwane" advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that Tshwane Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. Refusing to abide by the ASA's request, the Metro Council was banned consequently from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to Tshwane as the capital. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=594&art_id=vn20070423045707464C538603 |title=SA capital advert row sparks ad-alert threat, IOL |publisher=Iol.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/business/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=buss&ArticleID=1518-1786_2103974 |title=Media can't place Tshwane ads, FIN24 |publisher=Fin24.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

After the ruling, the Metro Council continued to place ''Tshwane'' advertisements, but placed them on council-owned advertising boards and busstops throughout the municipal area. In August 2007, an internal memo was leaked to the media in which the Tshwane mayor sought advice from the premier of Gauteng on whether the municipality could be called the "City of Tshwane" instead of just "Tshwane".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2158167,00.html |title=Down with Pretoria signs!: South Africa: Politics |publisher=News24 |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309023138/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0%2C%2C2-7-12_2158167%2C00.html |archivedate=9 March 2009  }}</ref> This could increase confusion about the distinction between the city of Pretoria and the municipality of Tshwane.

In early 2010 it was again rumoured that the South African government would make a decision regarding the name, however, a media briefing regarding name changes, where it may have been discussed, was cancelled shortly before taking place.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wilson Johwa |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=92376 |title=Mashatile postpones name changes after 'technicality'. |publisher=Businessday.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> Rumours of the name change provoked outrage from Afrikaner civil rights and political groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/local/article287159.ece |title=AfriForum to fight for Pretoria name. |publisher=Timeslive.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203184916/http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/local/article287159.ece |archivedate=3 February 2010}}</ref> It later emerged that the registration of the municipality as a geographic place had been published in the [[government gazette]] as it had been too late to withdraw the name from the publication,<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20100203042043944C666729 |title=Pretoria name change rethink |publisher=Iol.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> but it was announced that the name had been withdrawn, pending "further work" by officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=548186&sn=Detail&pid=6182&Pretoria-Tshwane-delayed |title=Pretoria/Tshwane delayed. |publisher=Jacarandafm.com |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=158607&sn=Detail |title=Xingwana retracts Pretoria name change. |publisher=Politicsweb.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> The following week, the registration of "Tshwane" was officially withdrawn in the Government Gazette.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/2208061.htm |title=It's officially Pretoria. iafrica.com |publisher=News.iafrica.com |accessdate=3 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209002319/http://news.iafrica.com/sa/2208061.htm |archive-date=9 February 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=550881&sn=Detail&pid=6182&Pretoria-is-Pretoria-again---for-now |title=Pretoria is Pretoria again – for now. |publisher=Jacarandafm.com |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> The retraction had reportedly been ordered at the behest of the [[Deputy President of South Africa]] [[Kgalema Motlanthe]], acting on behalf of President Jacob Zuma, as minister of Arts and Culture [[Lulu Xingwana]] had acted contrary to the position of the ANC, which is that Pretoria and the municipality are separate entities, which was subsequently articulated by ANC secretary general [[Gwede Mantashe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leadershiponline.co.za/articles/politics/487-government-policy |title=Government policy.'Leadership' |publisher=Leadershiponline.co.za |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611151631/http://www.leadershiponline.co.za/articles/politics/487-government-policy |archivedate=11 June 2010}}</ref>

In March 2010, the "Tshwane Royal House Committee", claiming to be descendants of Chief Tshwane, called for the name to be changed, and for the descendants of Chief Tshwane to be recognised, and to be made part of the administration of the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article354858.ece |title=Tshwane Royals: 'Change Pretoria for benefit of all'. |publisher=Timeslive.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140308/http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article354858.ece |archivedate=17 March 2010}}</ref>

According to comments made by Mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa in late 2011, the change would occur in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|author=Location Settings |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Pretoria-will-become-Tshwane-mayor-20111122 |title=Pretoria will become Tshwane – mayor |publisher=News24 |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/old-cities-new-names |title=Old cities, new names &#124; Radio Netherlands Worldwide |publisher=Rnw.nl |accessdate=16 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118070506/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/old-cities-new-names |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, there remained considerable uncertainty about the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Pretoria-of-Tshwane-Minister-weet-self-nie-20120127 |title=Pretoria of Tshwane?
