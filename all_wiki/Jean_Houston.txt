==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Houston was born in [[New York City]] to Mary Todaro Houston who was of [[Sicilian American|Sicilian]] descent, and Jack Houston who was related to [[Sam Houston]] of [[Texas]].<ref name=houston-mythic-life>Houston, Jean 1996 ''A Mythic Life.'' New York: Harper Collins</ref> Her father was a comedy writer who developed material for stage, television and the movies, including for comedians [[Bob Hope]] and [[George Burns]]. His work required him, and the family, to move frequently.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Berger|first=Joseph|date=1996-06-25|title=Performing Seances?

Houston attended [[Barnard College]] in [[New York City]] in the class of 1958.

She subsequently earned a Ph.D. in Psychology from Union Graduate School and a Ph.D. in Religion from the Graduate Theological Foundation.{{When|date=October 2013}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeanhouston.com/Jean-Houston/meet-jean.html |title=Meet Jean |publisher=Jean Houston |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>

===Career===
While participating in a US Government sanctioned research project on the effects of [[LSD]], Houston became acquainted with Robert Masters, a writer and researcher into the varieties of human behavior and potentials. The two married in 1965 and soon became known for their work in the [[Human Potential Movement]]. Together they conducted research into the interdependence of body, mind, and spirit at The Foundation for Mind Research for 14 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mythicjourneys.org/guest_houston.html|title=Mythic Imagination Institute|website=www.mythicjourneys.org|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=McLellan|first=Joseph|date=1978-12-02|title=Jean Houston: A Matter of Mind Over...|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1978/12/02/jean-houston-a-matter-of-mind-over/2f624492-e3b4-473f-8876-67015bb3eba6/|access-date=2020-07-03|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

The [[psychedelic experience]] research Houston and Masters conducted culminated in the 1966 publication of ''The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience.'' The U.S. government banned [[psychedelic research]] that same year. This classic in psychedelic studies detailed the expanded cognition and creativity participants experienced under the influence of LSD. After the research ban, Houston and Masters shifted their focus to explore other ways of achieving [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] without the use of drugs. Houston and Masters' 1972 book ''Mind Games'' detailed their findings that [[guided imagery]] and specific programs of bodily movement could reprogram the brain toward more integrated ways of experiencing the world. [[John Lennon]] called ''Mind Games'' "one of the two most important books of our time."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Rubin|first=Howard Jay|date=May 1985|title=Vision of the Possible: An Interview with Jean Houston|url=https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/114/visions-of-the-possible|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3 July 2020|website=The Sun Magazine}}</ref>

Houston taught at [[Marymount College, Tarrytown]] from 1965 to 1972.<ref name="books.google.com">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leIjcCSB_MoC&pg=PA131|title = Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience|isbn = 9780393322385|last1 = Gardner|first1 = Martin|date = 17 October 2001}}</ref> She was a lecturer at [[Hunter College]] for less than a year in 1961.<ref name="books.google.com"/> Her interest in anthropology brought about a close association with [[Margaret Mead]], who lived with Houston and Masters for several years before her death in 1978.

In 1982, Houston began teaching a seminar based on the concept of "the ancient mystery schools."<ref>Scott London, "[http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/houston.html On Soul, Shadow and the American Psyche: An Interview with Jean Houston]," ''Salt Journal'' (November/December 1997), portions of this interview were broadcast on the NPR series "Insight & Outlook."</ref> Houston explores the ancient idea of [[Potentiality and actuality|entelechy]] and proposes that individuals possess an innate potentiality which motivates their experience and actions. A technique she advocates for acknowledging and developing this inner spiritual self involves imagining the realization of one's potential in full embodied form in order to integrate it with one's present physical self.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heron|first=John|title=Feeling and Personhood: Psychology in Another Key|publisher=SAGE|year=1992|isbn=0803987293|location=London|pages=70}}</ref>

==Controversy==
During the first term (1993â€“1997) of the [[Clinton administration]], First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]], while she was writing ''[[It Takes a Village]]'' (1996), invited Houston to work with her in the [[White House]] as an advisor. Houston facilitated a creative thinking, role-playing exercise wherein Clinton engaged in imaginary dialogues with [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=":0" /> [[Bob Woodward]]'s book ''The Choice'' revealed this exercise publicly in 1996. After both the ''[[New York Post]]'' and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' labeled Houston "Hillary's Guru" and the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' dubbed her the "First Lady's Spiritual Adviser", ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' reported that Houston had "suddenly found herself the hapless butt of a thousand gags."<ref>{{cite web|author=Anne-Marie O'Neill |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20141719,00.html |title=Rare 'medium' |publisher=People.com |date=1996-07-08 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref> When the media subsequently "beat a path to her door,"{{cite quote|date=December 2019}} she was compelled to explain, "We were using an imaginative exercise to force her ideas, to think about how Eleanor would have responded to a particular problem," Dr. Houston said. "I have never been to a seance." <ref>{{cite web|author= Joseph Berger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/25/us/performing-seances-no-just-pushing-the-membrane-of-the-possible.html |title= Performing Seances?
