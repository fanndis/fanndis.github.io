[[PBS]] is not included; member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. [[Ion Television]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] are also not included since the majority of both networks' schedules consist of syndicated reruns (with limited original programming on the former). The CW is not included on weekends since it does not carry network programming on those days. However, it will return to programming a two-hour Sunday night schedule [[2018–19 United States network television schedule|next season]].

New series are highlighted in '''bold'''. All times are [[Eastern Time Zone|U.S. Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] (except for some live sports or events). Subtract one hour for [[Central Time Zone|Central]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]], and [[Hawaii-Aleutian Time Zone|Hawaii-Aleutian]] times.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by [[Nielsen Media Research]].<ref name="BM2">Highest-rated series is based on the annual top-rated programs list compiled by [[Nielsen Media Research]] and reported on [http://www.timbrooks.net/ratings/ TimBrooks.net/Ratings]</ref>

===Notes===
*On both CBS and NBC, ''Thursday Night Kickoff'' and ''Football Night in...'' started at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. ET out of primetime depending on the network carrying the game, preempting local programming. NBC's scheduling for the NFL's [[National Football League Kickoff game|Kickoff Game]] and [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving night game]] was under the different ''Sunday Night Football'' package and game coverage filled the entirety of primetime.

*NBC's Pacific and Mountain Time Zone affiliates carry new episodes of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in real time with the rest of the United States, placing its airtime within the prime time period throughout this season (except for the February 3 episode due to the commitments to carry the [[7th Annual NFL Honors]]); a re-air is broadcast after the late local news in those time zones. The network's affiliates in Alaska, Hawaii and other Pacific islands carry the show on delay as usual.
