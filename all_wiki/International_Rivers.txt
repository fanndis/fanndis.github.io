'''International Rivers''' is a [[non-profit]], [[non-governmental]], [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[human rights]] organization. Founded in 1985 by social and environmental activists, International Rivers works with policy and financial analysts, scientists, journalists, [[Sustainable development|development]] specialists, with volunteers to combat destructive [[dams]] and their legacies in over 60 countries.

The organization has staff in [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], and the United States. The staff has expertise in a range of issues and uses research, education, and [[Interest group|advocacy]] to achieve the organization's mission.{{CN|date=April 2018}}

==About==
The organization stated aims are to protect [[river]]s and defend the rights of communities that depend on them. It is active against the development model with which dams are associated, which International Rivers holds to be unsustainable. It promotes alternative solutions for meeting water, [[Energy (society)|energy]] and [[Flood#Flood defences, planning, and management|flood-management]] needs. The organization is dedicated to giving dam-affected people the tools to participate in the development of local lands in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]].

By facilitating international [[grassroots]] organizing and informed participation, the organization  seeks to change the terms of the debate over river development. The group works with its numerous partners to advocate for social reparations, [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and decommissioning of existing dams. International Rivers states that it works to clarify the traditionally top-down decision-making of large infrastructure projects. It also argues against industry's presentation of [[hydropower]] regards [[climate change]], making clear that [[reservoirs]] often produce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions that further impact on the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lima|first1=Ivan B T|last2=Ramos|first2=Fernando M|last3=Bambace|first3=Luis A W|last4=Rosa|first4=Reinaldo R|title=Methane Emissions from Large Dams as Renewable Energy Resources: A Developing Nation Perspective|journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change|date=February 2008|volume=13|issue=2|pages=193–206|doi=10.1007/s11027-007-9086-5}}</ref>

==Programs==
The organization has undertaken a two-pronged approach to analyzing and promoting viable water and energy solutions. Combining its efforts to change global policy with campaigning on specific key projects, the organization simultaneously addresses the root causes and localized consequences of destructive dam development. Their campaigns throughout [[Africa]], [[China]], [[Latin America]], [[South Asia]]  and [[Southeast Asia]] focus on the intersection of dams and climate change, reforming the policies and practices of international financial institutions, and promoting water and energy solutions that recognize human rights and environmental sustainability.

==Contributions==
Among its accomplishments, the organization counts its integral involvement with the formation of the [[World Commission on Dams]] as one of its most important contributions.  The commission was a global, multi-stakeholder body initiated in 1997 by the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Conservation Union]], formed in response to growing opposition to dams. During its two-year lifetime, the WCD conducted the most exhaustive study of dams done to date, ultimately evaluating over 1,000 dams in 79 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=The World Commission on Dams Framework - A Brief Introduction|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/the-world-commission-on-dams-framework-a-brief-introduction-2654|website=International Rivers|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref> In its published final report, the WCD concluded that although "dams have made an important and significant contribution to human development, and benefits derived from them have been considerable... in too many cases an unacceptable and often unnecessary price has been paid to secure those benefits, especially in social and environmental terms, by people displaced, by communities downstream, by taxpayers and by the [[natural environment]]."<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ADams_and_development.pdf&page=1 WCD final report]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Since the organization's inception, worldwide construction of dams has decreased by half, and universal recognition of the consequences of hydropower continues to increase.<!--Is IR claiming credit for this? If so, give a convincing cite.-->

The organization publishes a journal, ''World Rivers Review'', focused on addressing the state of various dam projects, ecosystems, and people.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Rivers Review – December 2014: Focus on the Mekong|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/node/8456|website=International Rivers|accessdate=10 April 2018|date=3 December 2014}}</ref> It also publishes an annual report on a variety of dam-related subjects.<ref name=AR-2016>{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2016|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/ir_annual_report_2016_fa.pdf|website=International Rivers|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>
