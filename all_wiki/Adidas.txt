Adidas' revenue for 2018 was listed at €21.915 billion.<ref name="FY2018"/>

The company was started by [[Adolf Dassler]] in his mother's house; he was joined by his elder brother [[Rudolf Dassler|Rudolf]] in 1924 under the name ''Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik'' ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes ([[track spikes|spikes]]) for multiple athletic events.

The [[three stripes]] are Adidas' identity mark, having being used on the company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid.

The company was founded by [[Adolf Dassler|Adolf "Adi" Dassler]] who made sports shoes in his mother's [[scullery]] or laundry room in [[Herzogenaurach]], Germany after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his older brother [[Rudolf Dassler|Rudolf]] joined the business, which became "Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory" ({{lang|de|Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik}}).<ref name="Sneaker Wars">{{Cite book|author=Barbara Smit|page=5|title=Sneaker Wars|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2009|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-124658-6}}</ref> The electricity supply in Herzogenaurach was unreliable, so the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment.<ref name=DW>{{cite web|last=James|first=Kyle|url=http://www.dw.de/the-town-that-sibling-rivalry-built-and-divided/a-2074427 |title=The Town that Sibling Rivalry Built, and Divided |work=Deutsche Welle |date=3 July 2006}}</ref>

Dassler assisted in the development of [[track spikes|spiked running shoes]] (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.freelapusa.com/the-history-of-track-spikes/|title=The History of Track Spikes|date=2014-02-15|work=Freelap USA|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-US}}</ref> In 1936, Dassler persuaded U.S. [[Sprint (running)|sprinter]] [[Jesse Owens]] to use his hand made spikes at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. Following Owens' four gold medals, the name and reputation of Dassler shoes became known to the world's sportsmen and their trainers. Business was successful and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes every year before World War II.<ref name=rediff>{{cite web |url=http://in.rediff.com/sports/2005/nov/08adi.htm |title=How Adidas and PUMA were born |publisher=in.rediff.com |date=8 November 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117230846/http://in.rediff.com/sports/2005/nov/08adi.htm |archive-date=17 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Both Dassler brothers joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] in May 1933 and became also members of the [[National Socialist Motor Corps]].<ref>Smit, Barbara (2007).

In 1943 the shoe production was forced to cease operations and the company’s facilities and workforce was used to manufacture [[Panzerschreck|anti-tank weapons]]. From 1942 to 1945 at least nine [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] were working at both sites of the company.<ref>Karlsch, Rainer et al. (2018).

The Dassler factory, used for production of [[Panzerschreck|anti-tank weapons]] during the Second World War, was nearly destroyed in 1945  by US forces, but was spared when Adolf Dassler's wife convinced the GIs that the company and its employees were only interested in manufacturing sports shoes. American occupying forces subsequently became major buyers of the Dassler brothers' shoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoes and Nazi Bazookas: The Prehistory of Adidas and Puma|work=Der Spiegel|date=4 March 2009|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/shoes-and-nazi-bazookas-the-prehistory-of-adidas-and-puma-a-611400.html|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>

===Split and rivalry with Puma===
The brothers split up in 1947 after relations between them had broken down,<ref name=sneakerwars>{{cite book|last=Esterl |first=Mike |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120606066903653643 |title=Review of "Sneaker Wars: The Enemy Brothers Who Founded Adidas and PUMA and the Family Feud That Forever Changed the Business of Sport", Barbara Smit, March 2008 |isbn=978-0-06-124657-9 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref> with Rudolf forming a new firm that he called Ruda – from Rudolf Dassler, later rebranded [[Puma (brand)|Puma]], and Dassler forming a company formally registered as Adidas AG from Adi Dassler on 18 August 1949.  An [[urban myth]] has promulgated the [[backronym]] ''All Day I Dream About Sports''.<ref name="history" />

[[Puma SE]] and Adidas entered into a fierce and bitter business rivalry after the split. Indeed, the town of Herzogenaurach was divided on the issue, leading to the nickname "the town of bent necks"—people looked down to see which shoes strangers wore.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ramachandran|first=Arjun|title=Town divided by tale of two shoes|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 September 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/town-divided-by-tale-of-two-shoes-20090918-fv01.html|accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref>  Even the town's two [[Football team|football club]]s were divided: [[ASV Herzogenaurach]] club was supported by Adidas, while [[FC Herzogenaurach|1 FC Herzogenaurach]] endorsed Rudolf's footwear.<ref name="DW" />  When handymen were called to Rudolf's home, they would deliberately wear Adidas shoes.  Rudolf would tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of free Pumas.<ref name="DW" />  The two brothers never reconciled and although they are now buried in the same cemetery, they are spaced as far apart as possible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Allan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/6216728/Adidas-and-Puma-bury-the-hatchet-after-60-years-of-brothers-feud-after-football-match.html |title=Adidas and Puma bury the hatchet after 60 years of brothers' feud after football match |publisher=Telegraph |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>

In 1948, the first football match after World War II, several members of the [[West Germany national football team|West German national football team]] wore Puma boots, including the scorer of West Germany's first post-war goal, [[Herbert Burdenski]].  Four years later, at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], [[1500 metres]] runner [[Josy Barthel]] of [[Luxembourg]] won Puma's first Olympic gold in [[Helsinki]], Finland.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

At the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], Puma paid German sprinter [[Armin Hary]] to wear Pumas in the 100 meter sprint final.  Hary had worn Adidas before and asked Adolf for payment, but Adidas rejected this request.  The German won gold in Pumas, but then laced up Adidas for the medals ceremony, to the shock of the two Dassler brothers.  Hary hoped to cash in from both, but Adi was so enraged he banned the Olympic champion.<ref name=rediff/>

In 1952, following the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], Adidas acquired its signature 3-stripe logo from the Finnish athletic footwear brand [[Karhu Sports]], for two bottles of whiskey and the equivalent of 1600 euros.<ref>{{cite book | title  = International cases in the business of sport | author = Simon Chadwick, Dave Arthur | page = 438 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7506-8543-6 }}</ref><ref name="Sabotage">{{cite web|last1=Weather|first1=Sneaker|title=Karhu: The Brand That Sold Adidas The Three Stripes|url=http://sabotagetimes.com/style/karhu-the-original-brand-with-three-stripes#!|website=Sabotage Times|publisher=Sabotage Times|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>

The Trefoil logo was designed in 1971 and  launched in 1972,<ref name=tmtk>[https://thinkmarketingmagazine.com/adidas-logo-transformations/ Adidas logo and brand transformations story] at Think Marketing, 22 Aug 2012</Ref> just in time for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Munich]].<ref>[ History] on Adidas-Group.com</ref> This logo lasted until 1997, when the company introduced the "three bars" logo (that had been designed by then Creative Director Peter Moore), initially used on the ''Equipment'' range of products.<ref name=tmtk/> 

===Tapie affair===
[[File:Bernard_Tapie_2012.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Bernard Tapie]], a former French businessman who once owned Adidas but has since relinquished his control over the company due to [[debt]]]]
After a period of trouble following the death of Adolf Dassler's son [[Horst Dassler]] in 1987, the company was bought in 1989 by French industrialist [[Bernard Tapie]], for [[French franc|₣]]1.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (now €243.9&nbsp;million), which Tapie borrowed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-16/business/fi-273_1_adidas-ag|title = LA TImes 7/16/1990 - French Investor to buy adidas}}</ref> Tapie was at the time a famous specialist of rescuing bankrupt companies, an expertise on which he built his fortune.

Tapie decided to move production [[offshoring|offshore]] to Asia. He also hired [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for promotion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blablawriting.com/menswear-manufacturerswholesalers-essay|title=Menswear Manufacturers/Wholesalers Essay Sample|date=2017-04-24|work=Bla Bla Writing|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} He sent, from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, a shoe sales representative to Germany and met Adolf Dassler's descendants (Amelia Randall Dassler and Bella Beck Dassler) and was sent back with a few items to promote the company there.

In 1992, unable to pay the loan interest, Tapie mandated the [[Crédit Lyonnais]] bank to sell Adidas,<ref name="Tapie sale"/> and the bank subsequently converted the outstanding debt owed into [[Stock|equity]] of the enterprise, which was unusual as per the prevalent French banking practice. The [[state-owned]] bank had tried to get Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour to Tapie, it is reported, because Tapie was [[Political minister|Minister]] of Urban Affairs (ministre de la Ville) in the French government at the time.

[[Robert Louis-Dreyfus]], a friend of Bernard Tapie, became the new CEO of the company in 1994. He was also the president of [[Olympique de Marseille]], a team Tapie had owned until 1993.<ref>[https://www.om.net/en/tapie-era-1986-1993 “The Tapie era (1986-1993)”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722155918/https://www.om.net/en/tapie-era-1986-1993 |date=22 July 2018 }}.

BBC. Retrieved 22 July 2018</ref> He was the object of several lawsuits, notably related to [[match fixing]] at the football club. During 1997, he served 6 months of an 18-month prison sentence in [[La Santé]] prison in Paris. In February 2000, Crédit Lyonnais sold Adidas to Louis-Dreyfus for a much higher amount of money than Tapie owed, 4.485&nbsp;billion (€683.514&nbsp;million) francs rather than 2.85&nbsp;billion (€434.479&nbsp;million). They also purposely bankrupted Tapie's company that owned Adidas, because only the company had the right to sue them.

===Post-Tapie era===
[[File:An Adidas shoe.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An Adidas shoe, with the company's [[Three stripes|three parallel bars]]]]
In 1994, combined with [[FIFA]] Youth Group, [[SOS Children's Villages]] became the main beneficiary.

In 1997, Adidas AG acquired the [[Salomon Group]] who specialized in ski wear, and its official corporate name was changed to Adidas-Salomon AG. With this acquisition Adidas also acquired the Taylormade Golf company and [[Maxfli]], which allowed them to compete with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Golf.

In 1998, Adidas sued the [[NCAA]] over their rules limiting the size and number of commercial logos on team uniforms and team clothing. Adidas withdrew the suit, and the two groups established guidelines as to what three-stripe designs would be considered uses of the Adidas trademark.

As CEO of Adidas, Louis-Dreyfus quadrupled revenue to 5.84 billion euros ($7.5 billion) from 1993 through 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-01-31/louis-dreyfus-widow-ousts-men-running-commodities-giant-as-newest-chairman|title=Louis-Dreyfus Widow Chairman Ousts Men Running Commodities Giant|author=Alan Katz|date=31 January 2012|work=Bloomberg.com}}</ref> In 2000, he announced he would resign the following year, due to illness.

In 2003, Adidas filed a lawsuit in a British court challenging Fitness World Trading's use of a two-stripe motif similar to Adidas's [[three stripes]]. The court ruled that despite the simplicity of the mark, ''Fitness World'' 's use was infringing because the public could establish a link between that use and Adidas's mark.<ref>{{cite news |last=Osborn |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,995976,00.html |title=Adidas told its three stripes don't constitute a trademark |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2003 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>

In September 2004, top English fashion designer [[Stella McCartney]] launched a joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership with the corporation. This line is a sports performance collection for women called "Adidas by Stella McCartney",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adidas.com/campaigns/women/content/stella/stella.asp?strCountry_Adidascom=com |title=Stella McCartney collection |publisher=Adidas.com |accessdate=26 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111060514/http://www.adidas.com/campaigns/women/content/stella/stella.asp?strCountry_Adidascom=com |archive-date=11 November 2010 }}</ref> and it has been critically acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0565383/bio|title=Stella McCartney}}</ref>

Also, on 3 May 2005, Adidas told the public that they sold their partner company [[Salomon Group]] for €485m to [[Amer Sports]] of Finland.
In August 2005, Adidas declared its intention to buy [[Reebok]] for $3.8&nbsp;billion (US$). This takeover was completed with partnership in January 2006<ref name="history" /> and meant that the company had business sales closer to those of Nike in North America. The acquisition of Reebok also allowed Adidas to compete with Nike worldwide as the number two athletic shoemaker in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2005/08/03/adidas-rachete-l-americain-reebok-pour-tenter-de-faire-jeu-egal-avec-nike_677359_3234.html|title=Adidas rachète l'américain Reebok pour tenter de faire jeue egal avec nike |publisher=Le Monde |date=3 August 2005|accessdate=17 October 2016 |language=fr}}</ref>

Adidas has global corporate headquarters in Germany, and many other business locations around the world such as Portland OR, Hong Kong, Toronto, Taiwan, England, Japan, Australia, and Spain.

In 2005, Adidas introduced the [[Adidas 1]], the first ever production shoe to use a [[microprocessor]]. Dubbed by the company "The World's First Intelligent Shoe", it features a microprocessor capable of performing 5 million calculations per second that automatically adjusts the shoe's level of cushioning to suit its environment. The shoe requires a small, user-replaceable battery that lasts for approximately 100 hours of running. On 25 November 2005, Adidas released a new version of the Adidas 1 with an increased range of cushioning, allowing the shoe to become softer or firmer, and a new motor with 153 percent more torque.<ref>[http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/recreation/1278181 Adidas 1 Is The Most Technically Advanced Running Shoe] ''Popular Mechanics'', 7 December 2004</ref>

On 11 April 2006, Adidas announced an 11-year deal to become the official [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] clothing provider. The company has been making [[NBA]], [[NBDL]], and [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] jerseys and products as well as team-coloured versions of the "Superstar" basketball shoe. This deal (worth over $400&nbsp;million) took over the previous Reebok deal that had been put in place in 2001 for 10 years.

In November 2011, Adidas announced that it would acquire outdoor action sport performance brand Five Ten through a share purchase agreement.

Since 1970, [[FIFA]], the world governing body of football, has commissioned [[List of FIFA World Cup official match balls|specially designed]] [[ball (association football)|footballs]] for use in its own [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] tournaments. The [[Adidas Telstar]] was the first ball commissioned for the World Cup in 1970. The balls supplied for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], the "[[Adidas Teamgeist|Teamgeist]]", were particularly noteworthy for their ability to travel further than previous types when struck, leading to longer range goals. Goalkeepers were generally believed to be less comfortable with the design of the ball, claiming it was prone to move significantly and unpredictably in flight.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Michael|title=Official World Cup ball, Jabulani, getting the blame for soft goals - Robert Green - and missed ones |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/official-world-cup-ball-jabulani-blame-soft-goals-robert-green-missed-article-1.182196|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=4 June 2010}}</ref>

====Cricket====
[[File:Tendulkar batting against Australia, October 2010 (1), cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Indian cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]], batting with his personalized Adidas cricket bat]]

Adidas began manufacturing cricket footwear in the mid 1970s, with their initial target market being Australia. Their shoes were a radical departure from traditional leather cricket boots which had remained basically unchanged for decades, being lighter and more flexible but also offering less toe protection, so that it became not uncommon to see batsmen who had been struck by the ball on the foot hopping around in pain. Having continued to manufacture cricket footwear for many years, in 2006 the company finally entered the field of bat manufacture in 2008 and currently their bat range includes the Pellara, Incurza, Libro and M-Blaster models.

In the 1990s, Adidas signed the superstar Indian batsman [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and made shoes for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/brand-tendulkar-will-never-lose-value/3801/ |title=Brand Tendulkar will never lose value |work=The Indian Express |location=India |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> From 2008 until his retirement, Adidas had sponsored the cricket bat used by Tendulkar.

====Tennis====
Adidas has been involved with tennis equipment since the mid 1960s and has historically sponsored many top tennis players, beginning with two of the most dominant male tennis players at the start of the professional era in the late 1960s, [[Stan Smith]] and [[Ilie Nastase]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, not only were they exclusive apparel and footwear sponsors of world number one men's tennis players [[Ivan Lendl]] and [[Stefan Edberg]] and ladies' world number one [[Steffi Graf]] but each player had their own, exclusive graphic styles designed for their use during play, which were in turn marketed to the general public. Ivan Lendl even spent the vast majority of his dominant career playing with several different models of Adidas tennis racquets, primarily using the legendary Adidas GTX-Pro and then later the Adidas GTX Pro-T. The company recently introduced a new line of tennis [[racquet]]s. While the Feather is made for the "regular player", and the Response for the "club player", Adidas targets the "tournament player" with the 12.2 oz Barricade tour model.<ref>Tennis-warehouse.com</ref>

====Adilette====
Adilette was the first ever pair of [[sandals]] made by Adidas, originally developed in 1963.<ref name="history"/> Adidas claims that a group of athletes approached [[Adolf Dassler|Adi Dassler]] requesting a shoe be made for the locker room.

To this day, the resulting sandals are a best-seller.<ref name="history-60">{{cite web|url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/ourgroup/assets/History/pdfs/60Years_HistoricalOverview_e.pdf|title=60 years of Adidas|page=5|publisher=Adidas Group|date=February 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513235723/http://www.adidas-group.com/en/ourgroup/assets/History/pdfs/60Years_HistoricalOverview_e.pdf|archive-date=13 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since the original navy blue and white Adilette sandals were created nearly fifty years ago, more varieties have been created in different colours (black, red, green, grey, orange, brown, yellow, pink, golden, silver). Most recently, Adidas has introduced a colour scheme that goes along with its Predator and adizero line; the scheme is dubbed warning (orange) and purple. Usually, the three stripes appear in the contrasting colour on the strap of the classic models. The most common adilette livery is in navy blue or black, mixed with white colours. Also the Woodilette and Trefoil models follow a similar design but without stripes on the strap.

The model provides a contoured orthopedic rubber sole with synthetic upper, and was designed as an après-sport [[Slide (footwear)|slide]], but the adilette were quickly used everywhere out of the sporting world. Opting for a wide, over the foot strap rather than the design of [[flip flops]], the adilette sandals provide a fresh style and a different level of comfort for the wearer. The strap is also glued to the sides of the sandal, which directs tension to less stressful areas of the sandal, which gives the sandals more durability.

====Santiossage====
The '''Santiossage''' is a [[Slide (footwear)|slide]]-style sandal. The sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a velcro strap toward the front of the shoe. [[Santiossage]] comes in black, navy, or red. On the side of the shoe, toward the heel on either side, the manufacturer's name appears, as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the foot-bed. Notably, there are tiny clear massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging after-sport footaches, although the sandals are worn casually among non-athletes. Seen through these clear nubs are Adidas' three stripes.

====Adissage====
[[File:Adissage.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A pair of Adissage]]
'''Adissage''' is also a slide sandal. Available in black, navy, light blue, black with pink, and other assorted colors, the sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a [[velcro]] strap toward the front of the shoe. On the side of the shoe, toward the heel on either side, the manufacturers name appears, as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the footbed. Like the '''Santiossage''', there are tiny black massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging foot aches after sport, although popular as a casual sandal amongst non-athletes as well.

==Marketing==
[[File:Bilbao BUM Chuck D chandal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Chuck D]] in an Adidas sweatsuit]]
During the mid to late 1990s, Adidas divided the brand into three main groups with each a separate focus: '''Adidas Performance''' was designed to maintain their devotion to the athlete; '''[[Adidas Originals]]''' was designed to focus on the brand's earlier designs which remained a popular life-style icon; and '''Style Essentials''', which dealt with the fashion market; the main group within this being '''Y-3''' (which is a collaboration between Adidas and renowned Japanese fashion designer [[Yohji Yamamoto]] - the Y representing Yamamoto and the 3 representing the three stripes of Adidas).

Launched in 2004, ''"Impossible is Nothing"'' is one of the company's most memorable campaigns.<ref name="history" /> The campaign was developed by 180/TBWA based in Amsterdam, but significant work was also done by [[TBWA\Chiat\Day]] in San Francisco.<ref name="new brand">{{cite web|url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/media/news-archive/press-releases/2004/impossible-nothing-adidas-launches-new-global-brand-advertising-/|title='Impossible Is Nothing' Adidas launches New Global Brand Advertising Campaign|publisher=adidas-group.com|accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref> A few years later, Adidas launched a basketball specific campaign -- "''Believe in 5ive''"—for the 2006-2007 NBA season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joannapenabickley.typepad.com/on/2007/06/on-adidas-do-yo.html|title=On: adidas+Do You Believe in 5IVE|accessdate=3 June 2016}}</ref>

In 2011, ''"Adidas is all in"'' became the global marketing strategy slogan for Adidas. The slogan aimed to tie all brands and labels together, presenting a unified image to consumers interested in sports, fashion, street, music and pop culture. There appears to be connection with the phrase "all-in" meaning "exhausted" in some English speaking nations.

In 2015, Adidas launched "''Creating the New''" as its new strategic business plan until 2020.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2015-11/06/content_22390945.htm|title=Adidas unveils new five-year plan to strengthen business growth|last=Zhuoqiong|first=Wang|date=6 November 2015|website=China Daily|access-date=2018-01-26}}</ref> This plan has three strategic choices: speed, cities and open source.<ref name=":0" />

==Criticism==
Adidas's business practises/[[ethics]] and commitment to worker welfare have been scrutinised and often criticised.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2008/06/11/OlympicLabour/ |title=Tyee – Homepage |publisher=Thetyee.ca |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0308-03.htm |title=News & Views |publisher=Common Dreams |date=8 March 2002 |accessdate=26 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929193658/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0308-03.htm |archive-date=29 September 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===2011 All Blacks replica rugby jersey pricing controversy===
[[File:All blacks jersey whitebackg.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The All Blacks jersey caused controversy]]
Unhappy with the local price of the Adidas replica All Blacks jersey, New Zealand-based [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] fans have asked for price cuts and begun purchasing the jersey from overseas vendors after it was revealed that the local price of NZ$220 was more than twice the price offered on some websites.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/5410579/Adidas-stands-by-All-Blacks-jersey-price |title=Adidas stands by All Blacks jersey price |work=The Dominion Post |location=NZ |date=8 August 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011 | first=Kent | last=Blechynden}}</ref>

Adidas has responded by enforcing cross-border agreements to stop overseas retailers from selling to New Zealand residents. It has been labelled a public relations disaster by leading New Zealand PR firms and Consumer advocate groups. The largest New Zealand sportswear retailer [[Rebel Sport]] has stated it is angry and is considering selling the All Blacks Jerseys to the general public below cost.

===2012 "shackle" sneakers===
On 14 June 2012, Adidas posted on their Facebook page a picture of a pair of [[Jeremy Scott]]-designed shoes containing shackles. The picture was of a planned shoe line that Adidas intended to release in July. The photo quickly caused controversy including that of [[Jesse Jackson]] who was quoted as saying "The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive".<ref name="Shackles">{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Jessie|date=19 June 2012|title=Adidas cancels 'shackle' shoes after outcry |work=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/18/us/adidas-shackle-shoes/index.html|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> Jackson threatened a boycott, and NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] was at one point reportedly contacted in hopes that he would intervene.<ref name="Shackles" /> Shortly after the outcry, the company cancelled the product.<ref name="Shackles" />

===Sweatshops and labour rights violations===
Adidas has been criticized for operating [[sweatshops]], particularly in Indonesia.  Between 2006 and 2007, Adidas rejected many of its suppliers that supported unions in favour of subcontractors with worse labour rights records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.au/explore/workers-rights/adidas |title=Adidas |publisher=[[Oxfam|Oxfam Australia]] |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref>  By subcontracting work to different suppliers, it is more difficult for Adidas to ensure company labour standards are enforced.  Adidas' policy includes the freedom for workers to take part in [[collective bargaining]] and a non-retaliation policy towards workers who express concerns.{{When|date=October 2019}}<ref name="sustainability">{{Cite web |url=http://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/suppliers_and_workers/code_of_conduct/default.aspx |title=Our Workplace Standards |publisher=Adidas |accessdate=11 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028235222/http://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/suppliers_and_workers/code_of_conduct/default.aspx |archive-date=28 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  In practice, however, many of Adidas' suppliers have not upheld these standards.  At the Panarub factory in [[Java]], 33 workers were fired after striking for better pay in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.au/explore/workers-rights/adidas/inside-adidas-indonesian-factories#workers |title=Inside Adidas' Indonesian Factories |publisher=[[Oxfam|Oxfam Australia]] |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref>  PT Kizone is another Indonesian factory where Adidas has been criticized over treatment of workers.  They produced products for Adidas as well as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] until they closed in January 2011.  2,686 workers who were laid off are owed $3 million in severance pay and benefits. Nike has contributed $1.5 million but Adidas has not acted.  A campaign has been initiated by [[United Students Against Sweatshops]] calling for universities to cut contracts with Adidas.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/business/students-object-to-use-of-sweatshop-labor-on-college-clothing.html |title=Students Battle a Dallas Cowboys Unit Over College Apparel |work=The New York Times |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |first=Steven |last=Greenhouse}}</ref>  On 16 July 2012, [[War on Want]] organised activists in London to replace Adidas price tags in sports stores with 34p ones,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waronwant.org/component/content/article/17607 |title=Adidas rocked by price tag protest over workers' rights |date=17 July 2012 |publisher=War on Want |accessdate=27 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022203826/http://www.waronwant.org/component/content/article/17607 |archive-date=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> a reference to the low hourly wage rate paid to the Indonesian workers who make Adidas goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/16843 |title=Adidas criticised for 'sweatshop' Olympic merchandise |date=16 July 2012 |publisher=[[Ekklesia (think tank)|Ekklesia]] |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>  The campaign group [[Labour Behind the Label]] claimed that the basic pay of Indonesian Adidas workers was only £10 a week.  William Anderson, head of social and environmental affairs for the Asia Pacific region, posted an entry on the company blog in which he claimed that total wages including bonuses and overtime were often double the hourly wage, and drew attention to [[purchasing power parity]].<ref name="poverty">{{cite web |url=http://blog.adidas-group.com/2012/07/%E2%80%9Cpoverty-wages%E2%80%9D-in-the-sporting-goods-industry-what-does-this-mean/#more-6238 |title='Poverty Wages' in the sporting goods industry – What does this mean? |last1=Anderson |first1=Bill |date=10 July 2012 |work=adidas Group blog |publisher=Adidas |accessdate=23 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715004805/http://blog.adidas-group.com/2012/07/%E2%80%9Cpoverty-wages%E2%80%9D-in-the-sporting-goods-industry-what-does-this-mean/|archive-date=15 July 2012 }}</ref>

In April 2014, one of the biggest strikes on mainland [[China]] took place at the [[Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings]] Dongguan shoe factory, producing amongst others for Adidas.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1486399/yue-yuen-strikers-vow-continue-until-benefit-contribution-deficit-paid Yue Yuen strikers vow to continue until benefit contribution deficit paid in full], South China Morning Post, 18 April 2013.</ref>

===Soviet themed items, and advertising===
In 2018, Adidas promoted a line of Soviet themed items, after a social media outcry they were taken off the market.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/05/08/adidas-pulls-soviet-themed-shirts-after-international-criticism-a61385 |title=Adidas Pulls Soviet-Themed Shirts After International Criticism  |work=The Moscow Times |date=8 May 2020 |access-date=2020-11-23}}</ref>
