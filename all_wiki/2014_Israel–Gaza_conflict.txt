The following year (2006) Hamas won [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|a majority of seats in the Palestinian legislative elections]].

In February 2007, on the brink of civil war, Fatah and Hamas leaders traveled to Mecca, where they agreed to form a national unity government, a deal the US opposed because it preferred that Fatah continue to isolate Hamas. Fayyad became finance minister in the new government, despite, he says, American pressure not to join. The Peruvian diplomat Alvaro de Soto, former UN envoy to the Quartet, wrote in a confidential "End of Mission Report" that the violence between Hamas and Fatah could have been avoided had the US not strongly opposed Palestinian reconciliation.

Human rights groups and the UN use the Gaza Health Ministry's number of Palestinians killed in Gaza as preliminary and add to or subtract from it after conducting their own investigations. For example, human rights groups say that the casualty count provided by the Health Ministry most likely includes victims of [[#Killing of suspected collaborators|Hamas executions]], domestic violence, and natural deaths,<ref name=nytimes_methodology /> but they (the human rights groups) remove the accused collaborators (who were shot as close range) from their own counts.<ref name=executions /> Israel contends that the Health Ministry's casualty count also includes deaths caused by [[#Killing and shooting of Gazan civilians|rocket or mortar malfunctions]].<ref name=nytimes_methodology />

According to the OCHA 2015 overview, of the 2,220 Palestinians killed in the conflict, 742 fatalities came from 142 families, who suffered the loss of 3 or more family members in individual bombing incidents on residential buildings.<ref name="OCHA2015" />
According to data provided by the Palestinian International Middle East Media Center, 79.7% of the Palestinians killed in Gaza were male, with the majority between 16 and 35. In contrast, a New York Times analysis states that males of ages that are most likely to be militants form 9% of the population but 34% of the casualties, while women and children under 15, who are least likely to be legitimate targets, form 71% of the general population and 33% of the casualties.<ref name=nytimes_methodology /><ref>{{cite news |author1=Davidovich, Joshua |author2=[[Haviv Rettig]] Gur |author3=Marissa Newman |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/day-20-idf-toll-rises-to-42-hamas-breaches-truce-resumes-rocket-fire-kerry-heads-home/#liveblog-entry-1036480 |title=Majority of Gaza dead are fighting-age men |work=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=27 July 2014 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref> Israel has pointed to the relatively small numbers of fatalities among women, children and men over 60, and to instances of Hamas fighters being counted as civilians (perhaps due to the broad definition of "civilian" used by the Gaza Health Ministry), to support its view that the number of the dead who were militants is 40–50%.<ref name="yahooDisputeCasulaties" /> The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] calculates that 5% of Gaza's military forces were killed in the war.<ref name="heres-what-really-happened" /> Jana Krause, from the war studies department at [[King's College London]], stated that "a potential explanation other than combatant roles" for the tendency of the dead to be young men "could be that families expect them to be the first ones to leave shelters in order to care for hurt relatives, gather information, look after abandoned family homes or arrange food and water."<ref name="BBCdisputeCasualties" /> ITIC reported instances in which children and teenagers served as militants, as well as cases where the ages of casualties reported by GHM were allegedly falsified, with child militants listed as adults and adults listed as children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/Data/articles/Art_20713/E_161_14_1392241240.pdf |title=The War of Casualties: During Operation Protective Edge children and teenagers were exploited by terrorists as auxiliaries and operatives.

A number of tunnels leading into both Israel and Egypt were destroyed throughout the operation.

The [[BRICS]] countries called for restraint on both sides and a return to peace talks based on the [[Arab Peace Initiative]]. The [[European Union]] condemned the violations of the laws of war by both sides, while stressing the "unsustainable nature of the status quo", and calling for a settlement based on the [[two-state solution]]. The [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the [[Arab League]], and most Latin American countries were critical of Israel, with some countries in the latter group withdrawing their ambassadors from Israel in protest. South Africa called for restraint by both sides and an end to "collective punishment of Palestinians". {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

An unknown number of Palestinians, estimated in the hundreds or thousands, tried to flee to Europe due to the conflict. The Palestinian rights group Adamir collected the names of 400 missing persons. In what was described by [[International Organization for Migration]] as the "worst shipwreck in years", a boat carrying refugees was rammed by smugglers and capsized off the coast of [[Malta]], resulting in the deaths of about 400 people. According to interviews with survivors, they paid smugglers between $2,000–$5,000 or used legal travel permits, to get to Egypt.

The war saw strained relations between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Many Arab businesses closed as part of a one-day general strike in solidarity with Gaza, leading to Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] to call for the boycott of Arab businesses that participated in the strike. Thousands demonstrated against the war, including some who threw stones and blocked streets. About 1,500 Arabs were arrested over involvement in protests against the war. Numerous Arabs were fired or disciplined by their employers over comments against Israel and the war on social media. The most notable case was that of a psychological counselor who worked for the [[Lod]] municipality, who was terminated on the orders of the Mayor of Lod after writing a Facebook post expressing joy over the deaths of 13 Israeli soldiers in the [[Battle of Shuja'iyya]]. Arabs reported an increase in racism and violence from right-wing Jews. However, some Israeli Jews against the war joined in anti-war protests, and a handful were also arrested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-arabs-caught-in-the-middle-of-gaza-war/|title=Israeli Arabs caught in the middle of Gaza war|first=Aron|last=Heller|website=timesofisrael.com|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Carlstrom |first1=Gregg |title=Businesses strike in Israel over Gaza |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/businesses-strike-israel-over-gaza-2014721191110588315.html |accessdate=27 July 2014 |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=21 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/lod-psychologist-fired-for-joyful-post-on-soldier-deaths/|title=Lod psychologist fired for joyful post on soldier deaths|website=timesofisrael.com|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/after-gaza-arab-israelis-fear-rising-discrimination/|title=After Gaza, Arab Israelis fear rising discrimination|first=Ben|last=Sales|website=timesofisrael.com|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/4-israeli-arabs-disciplined-over-anti-war-facebook-posts-1.5256408|title=Workplaces Discipline Israeli Arabs for Facebook Posts Against Gaza Incursion|first1=Or|last1=Kashti|first2=Eli|last2=Ashkenazi|first3=Nir|last3=Hasson|date=23 July 2014|accessdate=6 January 2019|via=Haaretz}}</ref>

==== Intimidation of journalists ====
Israeli officials said Hamas intimidates journalists in Gaza.

=== Alleged violations by Israel ===
Israel received some 500 complaints concerning 360 alleged violations. 80 were closed without criminal charges, 6 cases were opened on incidents allegedly involving criminal conduct, and in one case regarding 3 IDF soldiers in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Shuja'iyya]], a charge of looting was laid. Most cases were closed for what the military magistrates considered to be lack of evidence to sustain a charge of misconduct. No mention was made of incidents during the "Black Friday" events at Rafah.<ref>[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=772843 Israeli army exonerates itself in scores of investigations into 2014 Gaza war crimes], [[Ma'an News Agency]] 25 August 2016.</ref><ref>Gili Cohen, [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.738447'IDF Closes Probes of Alleged Crimes, Some Involving Civilian Deaths, in 2014 Gaza War,']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Haaretz]]24 August 2016.</ref>

==== Civilian deaths ====
Many of those killed were civilians, prompting concern from many humanitarian organisations. An investigation by [[Human Rights Watch]] concluded that Israel had probably committed war crimes on three specific incidents involving strikes on UNWRA schools.<ref>[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=726796 "HRW: Israel likely to have committed Gaza war crimes"], [[Ma'an News Agency]] 10 September 2014.</ref> Amnesty International stated that: "Israeli forces have carried out attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians, including through the use of precision weaponry such as drone-fired missiles, and attacks using munitions such as artillery, which cannot be precisely targeted, on very densely populated residential areas, such as Shuja'iyya.

Palestinians returning to their homes during the ceasefire reported that IDF soldiers had trashed their homes, destroyed home electronics such as TV sets, spread feces in their homes, and carved slogans such as "Burn Gaza down" and "Good Arab = dead Arab" in walls and furniture. The IDF did not respond to a request by ''[[The Guardian]]'' for comment.<ref>{{cite news |author=Harriet Sherwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/palestinians-return-home-israeli-troops-faeces-graffiti |title=Palestinians returning home find Israeli troops left faeces and venomous graffiti |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 August 2014 |accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>

On 5 November 2014, Amnesty International published a report examining eight cases where the IDF targeted homes, resulting in the deaths of 111 people, of whom 104 were civilians. Barred from access to Gaza by Israel since 2012, it conducted its research remotely, supported by two contracted Gaza-based fieldworkers who conducted multiple visits of each site to interview survivors, and consulted with military experts to evaluate photographic and video material. It concludes, in every case, that  "there was a failure to take necessary precautions to avoid excessive harm to civilians and civilian property, as required by international humanitarian law" and "no prior warning was given to the civilian residents to allow them to escape." As Israel did not disclose any information regarding the incidents, the report said it was not possible for Amnesty International to be certain of what Israel was targeting; it also said that if there were no valid military objectives, international humanitarian law may have been violated, as attacks directed at civilians and civilian objects, or attacks which are otherwise disproportionate relative to the anticipated military advantage of carrying them out, constitute war crimes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Families under the Rubble: Israeli Attacks on Inhabited Homes |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/032/2014/en/ |website=Amnesty International |accessdate=10 November 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rudoren |first1=Jodi |title=Amnesty International Says Israel Showed 'Callous Indifference' in Gaza |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/world/middleeast/amnesty-international-says-israel-showed-callous-indifference-to-gaza-civilians.html?_r=0 |website=The New York Times |accessdate=14 November 2014 |date=4 November 2014}}</ref>

On 23 July, twelve human rights organizations in Israel released a letter to Israeli government warning that "Gaza Strip's civilian infrastructure is collapsing".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ward |first1=Olivia |title=Ban Ki-moon condemns shelling of UN-run school in Gaza |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/07/24/ban_kimoon_condemns_shelling_of_unrun_school_in_gaza.html |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=24 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Gisha |title=Severe Electricity and Water Shortages in the Gaza Strip |url=http://gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/letters/letter-en-23-7-14.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> They wrote that "due to Israel's ongoing control over significant aspects of life in Gaza, Israel has a legal obligation to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza are met and that they have access to adequate supplies of water and electricity." They note that many water and electricity systems were damaged during the conflict, which has led to a "pending humanitarian and environmental catastrophe".

==== Human shields ====
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]] accused Israel of having "defied international law by attacking civilian areas of Gaza such as schools, hospitals, homes and U.N. facilities. "None of this appears to me to be accidental," Pillay said. "They appear to be defying – deliberate defiance of – obligations that international law imposes on Israel.""<ref name=AP-warcrimes /> The [[Jaffa]] based NGO [[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel|Physicians for Human Rights]] stated in a report in January 2015 that the IDF had used human shields during the war. IDF criticized the report's conclusions and methodology which "cast a heavy shadow over its content and credibility".<ref>Gili Cohen, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.638179 'NGO accuses IDF of gross abuses during Gaza war,'] [[Haaretz]] 21 January 2015.</ref> [[Defense for Children International]]-Palestine reported that 17-year-old Ahmad Abu Raida was kidnapped by Israeli soldiers who, after beating him up, used him as a [[human shield]] for five days, forcing him to walk in front of them with police dogs at gunpoint, search houses and dig in places soldiers suspected there might be tunnels.<ref>[http://972mag.com/palestinian-teen-i-was-used-as-a-human-shield-in-gaza/95800 Palestinian teen: I was used as a human shield in Gaza], 972mag.com; retrieved 22 August 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.dci-palestine.org/documents/israeli-forces-use-palestinian-child-human-shield-gaza Israeli forces use Palestinian child as human shield in Gaza], Defence for Children International Palestine.

The IDF confirmed that the troops suspected Ahmad of being a militant based on the affiliation of his father (a senior official in Gaza's Tourism Ministry) with Hamas and so detained him during the ground operation. The IDF and Israeli authorities challenged the credibility of DCI-P noting their "scant regard for truth".<ref name=NYT_Raida /> The IDF Military Advocate General opened criminal investigation into the event.<ref name=IDFMAG />

This included 1,000 self-produced short range rockets (15–20&nbsp;km range), 2,500 smuggled short range rockets, 200 self-made Grad rockets, and 200 smuggled Grad rockets. In addition, to these short range rockets, Hamas held an assortment of mid and long range rockets, both self-made and smuggled, that totaled over several thousand.<ref>[https://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/07/10/6-million-lives-in-danger-the-deadly-rocket-arsenal-of-hamas/].

The UNHRC, quoting Amnesty International, stated that armed groups in Gaza have used BM-21 Grad rockets with ranges varying from 20&nbsp;km to 48&nbsp;km, in addition to locally produced rockets reaching as far as 80&nbsp;km, such as the M-75 and J-80. The majority of the rockets had no guidance system. Mortars having a range of up to 8&nbsp;km, have been actively used along the Green Line. Other weapons included rocket-propelled grenades, home-made drones, SA 7 Grail anti-aircraft missiles, Kornet 9M133 anti-tank guided missiles, and a wide array of small arms, rifles, machine guns and hand grenades.<ref>{{cite web |title=The United Nations Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict |url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoIGaza/A_HRC_CRP_4.doc |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=24 June 2015}}</ref>

According to them, "of the nine cross-border tunnels detected, none actually stretches into the grounds of a civilian community".

It was alleged that Hamas planned to use 14 tunnels to send hundreds of militants to kill or kidnap as many Israelis as possible. The putative plan failed, in this view, because the kidnapping of the 3 teenagers, the West Bank crackdown, and pressure from Egypt pre-empted its execution. Khaled Mashal has denied these allegations; he has insisted that killing civilians was never Hamas’s intention, and that his group only targets soldiers and those living on occupied territory.<ref name="Ciralsky" />

== Efforts to reconstruct Gaza ==

As of 1 February 2015, only US$125&nbsp;million of the $2.7&nbsp;billion for reconstruction had been paid out, while tens of thousands of Gazans were still homeless.

They stated that "Israel, as the occupying power, is the main duty bearer and must comply with its obligations under international law.
