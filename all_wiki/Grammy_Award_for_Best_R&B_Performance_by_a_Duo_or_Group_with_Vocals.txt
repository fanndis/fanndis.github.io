The [[Grammy Award]] for '''Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal''' was awarded between 1970 and 2011.  From 1967 to 1969 and in 1971 the award included instrumental performances.  The award had several minor name changes:

*From 1967 to 1968 the award was known as '''Best Rhythm & Blues Group Performance, Vocal or Instrumental'''
*In 1969 it was awarded as '''Best Rhythm & Blues Performance by a Duo or Group, Vocal or Instrumental'''
*In 1970 it was awarded as '''Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group'''
*In 1971 it was awarded as '''Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group, Vocal or Instrumental'''
*In 1972 it was awarded as '''Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Group'''
*From 1973 to 1980 it was awarded as '''Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus'''
*From 1981 to 2003 it was awarded as '''Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal''' 
*In 2004 it was awarded as '''Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals'''

The award has been discontinued after 2011 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. As of 2012, all solo and duo/group vocal performances in the R&B category were shifted to the newly formed '''[[Best R&B Performance]]''' category.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for music released in the previous year.
