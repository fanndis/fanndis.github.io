The '''Aspen Institute''' is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1949 as the '''Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/about/#history|title=About the Aspen Institute|website=aspeninstitute.org|access-date=31 March 2018}}</ref> The Institute and its international partners promote the creation of a free, just, and equitable society in a [[nonpartisan]] and nonideological setting through seminars, policy programs, conferences, and leadership development initiatives. The institute is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, and has campuses in [[Aspen, Colorado]] (its original home), and near the shores of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] at the [[Wye River (Maryland)|Wye River]] in [[Maryland]]. It has partner Aspen Institutes in [[Berlin]], [[Rome]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Tokyo]], [[New Delhi]], [[Prague]], [[Bucharest]], [[Mexico City]], and [[Kiev]], as well as leadership initiatives in the United States and on the [[African continent]], India, and [[Central America]].

The Aspen Institute is largely funded by foundations such as the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]], the [[Gates Foundation]], the [[Lumina Foundation]], and the [[Ford Foundation]], by seminar fees, and by individual donations. Its board of trustees includes leaders from politics, government, business and academia who also contribute to its support.

==History==
The institute was largely the creation of [[Walter Paepcke]], a [[Chicago]] businessman who had become inspired by the [[Great Books]] program of [[Mortimer Adler]] at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org/about/history|title=About - The Aspen Institute|access-date=18 October 2016}}</ref>  In 1945, Paepcke visited [[Bauhaus]] artist and architect [[Herbert Bayer]], AIA, who had designed and built a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist home outside the decaying former mining town of Aspen, in the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork Valley]]. Paepcke and Bayer envisioned a place where artists, leaders, thinkers, and musicians could gather. Shortly thereafter, while passing through Aspen on a hunting expedition, oil industry maverick [[Robert O. Anderson]] (soon to be founder and CEO of [[Atlantic Richfield]]) met with Bayer and shared in Paepcke's and Bayer's vision. In 1949, Paepcke organized a 20-day international celebration for the 200th birthday of [[Germany|German]] [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. The celebration attracted over 2,000 attendees, including [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Thornton Wilder]], and [[Arthur Rubinstein]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/obituaries/elizabeth-paepcke-91-a-force-in-turning-aspen-into-a-resort.html | title=Elizabeth Paepcke, 91, a Force In Turning Aspen Into a Resort | date=18 June 1994 | website=The New York Times | access-date=18 March 2016 }}</ref>

In 1949, Paepcke founded the Aspen Institute; and later the [[Aspen Music Festival]] and eventually (with Bayer and Anderson) the [[International Design Conference at Aspen]] (IDCA).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/01/arts/herbert-bayer-85-a-designer-and-artist-of-bauhaus-school.html | title=Herbert Bayer, 85, a designer and artist of Bauhaus School | date=1 October 1985 | website=The New York Times | access-date=18 March 2016 }}</ref> Paepcke sought a forum "where the human spirit can flourish", especially amid the whirlwind and chaos of modernization. He hoped that the Institute could help business leaders recapture what he called  "eternal verities": the values that guided them intellectually, ethically, and spiritually as they led their companies. Inspired by philosopher [[Mortimer Adler]]'s Great Books seminar at the [[University of Chicago]], Paepcke worked with Anderson to create [https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/executive-leadership-development/aspen-executive-seminar-3/ the Aspen Institute Executive Seminar].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/education/aspen-a-4th-decade-for-ancestorof-a-growing-business-breed.html | title=ASPEN: A 4TH DECADE FOR ANCESTOR...OF A GROWING BUSINESS BREED | date=31 August 1981 | website=The New York Times | access-date=18 March 2016 }}</ref> In 1951, the Institute sponsored a national [[photography]] conference attended by [[Ansel Adams]], [[Dorothea Lange]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Berenice Abbott]], and other notables. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Institute added organizations, programs, and conferences, including the [[Aspen Center for Physics]], the [[Aspen Strategy Group]], Communications and Society Program and other programs that concentrated on education, communications, justice, Asian thought, science, technology, the environment, and [[international relations|international affairs]].

In 1979, through a donation by [[Corning Glass]] industrialist and philanthropist Arthur A. Houghton Jr. the Institute acquired a 1,000-acre (4&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) campus on the eastern shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Maryland]], known today as the [[Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Centers|Wye River Conference Centers]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-04-26/news/0004270191_1_aspen-institute-elian-gonzalez-houghton/2 | title=Cuban boy moves to Md.

In 1996, the first Socrates Program seminar was hosted.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

In 2005, it held the first [[Aspen Ideas Festival]], featuring leading minds from around the world sharing and speaking on global issues. The institute, along with ''[[Atlantic Monthly|The Atlantic]]'', hosts the festival annually. It has trained philanthropists such as [[Carrie Morgridge]].<ref name="twsDenverPost1">{{cite news

[[Walter Isaacson]] was the president and CEO of Aspen Institute from 2003 to June 2018. Isaacson announced in March 2017 that he would step down as president and CEO at the end of the year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/aspen_institute_walter_isaacso.html|title=Walter Isaacson to leave Aspen Institute, become Tulane professor|work=NOLA.com|access-date=2017-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref> On November 30, 2017, [[Daniel R.

In April 2020, the company received approximately $8 million in federally backed small business loans as part of the [[Paycheck Protection Program]]. The company received scrutiny over this loan, which meant to protect small and private businesses. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted their large endowment and membership of billionaires made this problematic. [[Dele Olojede]], a fellow at the institute, called it "contrary to the stated purpose of this institute", that "one of America’s most elite institutions thinks it is okay to take the money", going on to say "Those who purport to be values-based and public-spirited leaders cannot at the same time put self interest first, when there is so much human suffering and death".<ref name="wash_Aspe">{{Cite web |title=Aspen Institute think tank receives $8 million federal small-business loan |author=Jonathan O'Connell |work=The Washington Post |access-date=13 May 2020 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/13/aspen-institute-think-tank-receives-8-million-federal-small-business-loan/}}</ref> The day after Olojede and the Washington Post highlighted the funding, Aspen Institute announced they would return it, stating "Upon listening to our communities and further reflection, we have made the decision to return the loan".<ref name="wash_ret">{{Cite web |title=Aspen Institute to return $8 million in small business funds |author=Jonathan O'Connell |work=The Washington Post |date=14 May 2020 |access-date=14 May 2020 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/14/aspen-institute-sba/ |quote=“We believe that our application, which was made in the first week of the PPP, was consistent with the goals of the program.
