(corporation)|company]] owned by [[Finland|Finnish]] company [[Nokia]]. With headquarters located in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill]], [[New Jersey]], the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world. Bell Labs has its origins in the complex past of the [[Bell System]].

In the late 19th century, the laboratory began as the Western Electric Engineering Department and was located at [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|463 West Street]] in New York City. In 1925, after years of conducting research and development under [[Western Electric]], the Engineering Department was reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories and under the shared ownership of [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] and Western Electric.

Researchers working at Bell Labs are credited with the development of [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], the [[photovoltaic cell]], the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD), [[information theory]], the [[Unix]] operating system, and the programming languages [[B (programming language)|B]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[S (programming language)|S]]. Nine [[Nobel Prize]]s have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2018/12/18/2018-nobel-prize-in-physics-laureate-arthur-ashkin-delivers-his-nobel-lecture-at-nokia-bell-labs/|title=2018 Nobel Prize in Physics laureate Arthur Ashkin delivers his Nobel Lecture at Nokia Bell Labs|website=Nokia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>

==Origin and historical locations==

=== Bell's personal research after the telephone ===
In 1880, when the [[France|French government]] awarded [[Alexander Graham Bell]] the [[Volta Prize]] of 50,000 [[French franc|francs]] (approximately US$10,000 at that time; about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1879|r=-4}}}} in January 2019's dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} for the [[invention of the telephone]], he used the award to fund the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] (''Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory'') in [[Washington, D.C.]] in collaboration with [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] and Bell's cousin [[Chichester Bell]].<ref name="Bruce1990">Bruce, Robert V. ''Bell: Alexander Bell and the Conquest of Solitude''. Ithaca, New York: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]], 1990. {{ISBN|0-8014-9691-8}}.</ref> The laboratory was variously known as the ''Volta Bureau'', the ''Bell Carriage House'', the ''Bell Laboratory'' and the ''Volta Laboratory''.

It focused on the analysis, recording, and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education to permit the "[increased] diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf":<ref name="Bruce1990" /> resulting in the founding of the Volta Bureau (c. 1887) which was located at [[Alexander Melville Bell|Bell's father]]'s house at 1527 35th Street N.W. in Washington, D.C. Its carriage house became their headquarters in 1889.<ref name="Bruce1990" />

In 1893, Bell constructed a new building close by at 1537 35th Street N.W., specifically to house the lab.<ref name="Bruce1990" /> This building was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1972.<ref name="nhlsum">{{cite web

After the invention of the telephone, Bell maintained a relatively distant role with the Bell System as a whole, but continued to pursue his own personal research interests.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alexander Graham Bell, A Life|last=Mackay|first=James|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc.|year=1997|location=USA}}</ref>[[File:Volta Laboratory and Bureau nw22.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=An oblique view of a large salmon colored two story stone building, of some prominence|Bell's 1893 Volta Bureau building in Washington, D.C.]]

===Early antecedent===
The Bell Patent Association was formed by [[Alexander Graham Bell]], Thomas Sanders, and [[Gardiner Hubbard]] when filing the first patents for the telephone in 1876.

Bell Telephone Company, the first telephone company, was formed a year later. It later became a part of the American Bell Telephone Company.

[[American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T) and its own subsidiary company, took control of American Bell and the Bell System by 1889.

American Bell held a controlling interest in Western Electric (which was the manufacturing arm of the business) whereas AT&T was doing research into the service providers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Telephone Enterprise|last=Garnet|first=Robert|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1985|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=1–44}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/about/history-bell-labs/|title=Nokia Bell Labs History|date=20 July 2018|website=Nokia Bell Labs}}</ref>

In 1884, the [[American Bell Telephone Company]] created the Mechanical Department from the Electrical and [[Patent]] Department formed a year earlier.

===Formal organization and location changes===
[[File:Bell Laboratories West Street.jpg|alt=463 West Street New York Bell Labs|thumb|The original home of Bell Laboratories beginning in 1925, 463 West Street, New York.]]
In 1896, Western Electric bought property at [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|463 West Street]] to station their manufacturers and engineers who had been supplying AT&T with their product. This included everything from [[telephone]]s, [[telephone exchange]] switches, and transmission equipment.

In 1925, Bell Laboratories was developed to better consolidate the research activities of the Bell System. Ownership was evenly split between [[Western Electric]] and [[AT&T]]. Throughout the next decade the [[AT&T]] Research and Development branch moved into West Street.

Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the [[Bell Telephone Company]], U.S. government work, and a few workers were assigned to basic research. The first president of research at Bell Labs was [[Frank B. Jewett]] who stayed there until 1940.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Donofrio|first=Angelo|date=May–June 1966|title=West Street Story|journal=Bell Labs Reporter|volume=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Idea Factory|last=Gertner|first=Jon|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2012|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Manufacturing the Future|last=Adams, Butler|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|location=Cambridge}}</ref>

By the early 1940s, Bell Labs engineers and scientists had begun to move to other locations away from the congestion and environmental distractions of New York City, and in 1967 Bell Laboratories headquarters was officially relocated to [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill]], New Jersey.

Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey|Holmdel]], [[Crawford Hill]], the [[Deal Test Site]], [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]], [[Lincroft, New Jersey|Lincroft]], [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]], [[Middletown Township, New Jersey|Middletown]], [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]], [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], [[Chester Township, New Jersey|Chester]], and [[Whippany, New Jersey|Whippany]]. Of these, Murray Hill and Crawford Hill remain in existence (the Piscataway and Red Bank locations were transferred to and are now operated by [[Telcordia Technologies]] and the Whippany site was purchased by [[Bayer]]<ref>{{cite web|title=It's official! Bayer buys Alcatel-Lucent site in Hanover Twp|url=http://newjerseyhills.com/hanover_eagle/news/it-s-official-bayer-buys-alcatel-lucent-site-in-hanover/article_d32b1704-9fc7-11e1-8336-001a4bcf887a.html?mode=story|publisher=The Hanover Eagle|access-date=21 May 2012}}</ref>).

The largest grouping of people in the company was in [[Illinois]], at [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]-[[Lisle, Illinois|Lisle]], in the [[Chicago]] area, which had the largest concentration of employees (about 11,000) prior to 2001. There also were groups of employees in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[North Andover, Massachusetts]]; [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]; [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]; and [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania]]; Burlington, North Carolina (1950s–1970s, moved to Greensboro 1980s) and [[Westminster, Colorado]]. Since 2001, many of the former locations have been scaled down or closed.

[[File:Bell Labs Holmdel.jpg|thumbnail|right|Old [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex]].  Located in New Jersey, about 20 miles south of New York.]]

The [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex|Holmdel site]], a 1.9 million square foot structure set on 473 acres, was closed in 2007. The mirrored-glass building was designed by [[Eero Saarinen]]. In August 2013, Somerset Development bought the building, intending to redevelop it into a mixed commercial and residential project. A 2012 article expressed doubt on the success of the newly named Bell Works site,<ref>{{cite news|title=Future takes shape for Bell Labs site|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/realestate/commercial/future-takes-shape-for-bell-labs-site.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0&gwh=5E7B08AA3F6C8953AB163DA6FD824D78|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=September 29, 2013}}</ref> but several large tenants had announced plans to move in through 2016 and 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icims.com/about-us/news-room/press-releases/icims-plans-move-to-landmark-bell-works-building-commits-to|title=iCIMS Plans Move to Landmark Bell Works Building, Commits to Continued Growth in NJ|date=July 10, 2016|website=ICIMS.com|access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2017/04/nyc-based_insurance_company_reportedly_signs_lease.html|title=Hundreds of new workers to move into historic Bell Labs building|date=April 10, 2017|website=NJ.com|access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>

==Discoveries and developments==
[[File:Bell Laboratories logo.svg|thumb|right|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1969 until 1983]]{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}
Bell Laboratories was, and is, regarded by many as the premier research facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including [[radio astronomy]], the [[transistor]], the [[laser]], [[information theory]], the operating system [[Unix]], the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], [[solar cells]], the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD), and many other optical, wireless, and wired communications technologies and systems.

=== 1920s ===
In 1926, the laboratories invented an early example [[Sound film|synchronous-sound motion picture]] system, in competition with [[Movietone sound system|Fox Movietone]] and [[Phonofilm|DeForest Phonofilm]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9015241 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503182230/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9015241 |archive-date=2006-05-03 | title=Bell Laboratories |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

In 1924, Bell Labs physicist [[Walter A. Shewhart]] proposed the [[control chart]] as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewhart's methods were the basis for [[statistical process control]] (SPC): the use of statistically based tools and techniques to manage and improve processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including [[Six Sigma]].

In 1927, a Bell team headed by [[Herbert E. Ives]] successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line [[television]] images of [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]] from Washington to New York. In 1928 the [[thermal noise]] in a resistor was first measured by [[John Bertrand Johnson|John B. Johnson]], and [[Harry Nyquist]] provided the theoretical analysis; this is now termed ''Johnson noise''. During the 1920s, the [[one-time pad]] [[cipher]] was invented by [[Gilbert Vernam]] and [[Joseph Mauborgne]] at the laboratories. Bell Labs' [[Claude Shannon]] later proved that it is unbreakable.

===1930s===
[[File:Green Banks - Jansky Antena.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the directional antenna used in the discovery of radio emission of extraterrestrial origin by [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1932]]

In 1931, a foundation for [[radio astronomy]] was laid by [[Karl Jansky]] during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance [[Shortwave bands|shortwave communications]]. He discovered that [[radio]] waves were being emitted from the center of the [[galaxy]]. In 1931 and 1932, experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings were made by the labs of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]].<ref>[https://www.stokowski.org/Harvey_Fletcher_and_Bell_Labs_Stereo.htm Leopold Stokowski, Harvey Fletcher, and the Bell Laboratories Experimental Recordings], Stokowski.org. Retrieved 2020-03-03.</ref> In 1933, [[Stereophonic sound|stereo signals]] were transmitted live from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1937, the [[vocoder]], an electronic speech compression device, or codec, and the [[Voder]], the first electronic [[Speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]], were developed and demonstrated by [[Homer Dudley]], the Voder being demonstrated at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Bell researcher [[Clinton Davisson]] shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with [[George Paget Thomson]] for the discovery of [[electron diffraction]], which helped lay the foundation for [[solid-state electronics]].

===1940s===
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[transistor]], a [[point-contact transistor|point-contact]] [[germanium]] device, was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947.  This image shows a replica.]]

In the early 1940s, the [[photovoltaic cell]] was developed by [[Russell Ohl]]. In 1943, Bell developed [[SIGSALY]], the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II. The British wartime codebreaker [[Alan Turing]] visited the labs at this time, working on speech encryption and meeting [[Claude Shannon]].<ref>{{cite book| author-link1=Jack Copeland | first1=Jack | last1=Copeland | author-link2=Jonathan Bowen | first2=Jonathan | last2=Bowen | chapter=Chapter 1: Life and work & Chapter 18: Delilah—encrypting speech | title=The Turing Guide | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2017 | isbn=978-0198747833 | title-link=The Turing Guide }}</ref>

Bell Labs Quality Assurance Department gave the world and the United States such statisticians as [[Walter A. Shewhart]], [[W. Edwards Deming]], [[Harold F. Dodge]], [[George D. Edwards]], Harry Romig, R. L. Jones, Paul Olmstead, E.G.D. Paterson, and [[Mary N. Torrey]]. During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee – Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.

In 1947, the [[transistor]], probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Shockley|William Bradford Shockley]] (and who subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956). In 1947, [[Richard Hamming]] invented [[Hamming code]]s for [[error detection and correction]]. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]", one of the founding works in [[information theory]], was published by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers [[Harry Nyquist]] and [[Ralph Hartley]], but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of [[History of cryptography|modern cryptography]] with his 1949 paper ''[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]''.

===1950s===
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2020}}
In 1952, [[William Gardner Pfann]] revealed the method of [[zone melting]] which enabled semiconductor purification and level doping.

The 1950s also saw developments based upon [[information theory]]. The central development was [[binary code]] systems. Efforts concentrated on the prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances, including the [[N-carrier]] system. TD [[microwave radio relay]], [[direct distance dialing]], E-[[repeater]], [[wire spring relay]], and the [[Number Five Crossbar Switching System]].

In 1953, [[Maurice Karnaugh]] developed the [[Karnaugh map]], used for managing of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebraic]] expressions. In 1954, the first modern [[solar cell]] was invented at Bell Laboratories. In 1956 [[TAT-1]], the first [[transatlantic communications cable]], was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland in a joint effort by AT&T, Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies. In 1957,  [[Max Mathews]] created [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC]], one of the first computer programs to play [[electronic music]]. [[Robert C. Prim]] and [[Joseph Kruskal]] developed new [[greedy algorithm]]s that revolutionized [[network planning and design|computer network design]]. In 1958, a technical paper by [[Arthur Schawlow]] and [[Charles Hard Townes]] first described the [[laser]]. In 1959, [[Mohamed M. Atalla]] and [[Dawon Kahng]] invented the [[MOSFET|metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET).<ref name="computerhistory"/> The MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) of circuits underlying today's [[information society]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===1960s===
[[File:Nobel Prize 2009-Press Conference KVA-19.jpg|thumb|240px|The charge-coupled device was invented by George E. Smith and Willard Boyle]]
In December 1960, [[Ali Javan]] and his associates [[William R. Bennett, Jr.|William Bennett]] and [[Donald Heriot]] successfully operated the first [[gas laser]], the first continuous-light laser, operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity. In 1962, the [[electret microphone]] was invented by [[Gerhard Sessler|Gerhard M. Sessler]] and [[James Edward Maceo West]]. Also in 1962, [[John R. Pierce]]'s vision of [[communications satellite]]s was realized by the launch of [[Telstar]]. In 1964, the [[Carbon dioxide laser]] was invented by [[Kumar Patel]]. The research of [[Philip W. Anderson]] into electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems led to improved understanding of metals and insulators for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1977.<ref>Banks, Michael, "[https://physicsworld.com/a/condensed-matter-physics-pioneer-philip-anderson-dies-aged-96/ Condensed-matter physics pioneer Philip Anderson dies aged 96]'', ''[[Physics World]]'', March 30, 2020</ref> In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the [[cosmic microwave background]], for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978.<ref>http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/</ref> Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s. Ken C. Knowlton invented the computer animation language [[BEFLIX]]. The first digital computer art was created in 1962 by Noll. In 1966, [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] was developed by [[J.R. Arthur]] and [[A.Y. Cho]]; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]] created the computer operating system [[UNIX]] for the support of telecommunication switching systems as well as general purpose computing. From 1969 to 1971, [[Aaron Marcus]], the first graphic designer involved with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone. In 1969, the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) was invented by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]], for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. In the 1960s, the [[Bell Laboratories Building (Manhattan)|New York City site]] was sold and became the [[Westbeth Artists Community]] complex.

===1970s===
[[File:The C Programming Language logo.svg|left|thumb|125px|The C programming language was developed in 1972.]]

The 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the [[personal computing]] revolution. In 1972, [[Dennis Ritchie]] developed the compiled programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] as a replacement for the interpreted language [[B (programming language)|B]] which was then used in a [[worse is better]] rewrite of UNIX.  Also, the language [[AWK]] was designed and implemented by [[Alfred Aho]], [[Peter Weinberger]], and [[Brian Kernighan]] of Bell Laboratories. In 1972, [[Marc Rochkind]] invented the [[Source Code Control System]].

In 1970, [[A. Michael Noll]] invented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized [[telephone exchange]] switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by [[Erna Schneider Hoover]], who received one of the first [[software patent]]s for it. In 1976, [[Optical fiber]] systems were first tested in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and in 1980, the first single-chip [[32-bit]] [[microprocessor]], the [[Bellmac 32]]A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.

The 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; [[1ESS switch|1A]]/[[4ESS switch|#4 TOLL]] Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced floor space needs. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that needed only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain.

===1980s===
[[File:Bell Labs logo, 1984-1995.png|frame|Bell Laboratories logo, used from 1984 until 1995]]

In 1980, the [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[CDMA]] digital cellular telephone technology was patented. In 1982, [[Fractional quantum Hall effect]] was discovered by [[Horst Ludwig Störmer|Horst Störmer]] and former Bell Laboratories researchers [[Robert B. Laughlin]] and [[Daniel C. Tsui]]; they consequently won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for the discovery. In 1985,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/explore/stories-changed-world/bjarne-stroustrop-awarded-prize-c-language/|title=The Rise of C++ - Bell Labs|website=www.bell-labs.com|access-date=2016-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630230413/http://bell-labs.com/explore/stories-changed-world/bjarne-stroustrop-awarded-prize-c-language/|archive-date=2017-06-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> the programming language [[C++]] had its first commercial release.<ref name="JANA">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wolEBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA12|title=C++ AND OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING PARADIGM|last=JANA|first=DEBASISH|date=2014-10-01|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

In 1984, the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna became an important component in [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]]. In 1984, [[Karmarkar's algorithm]] for linear programming was developed by mathematician [[Narendra Karmarkar]]. Also in 1984, [[Modification of Final Judgment|a divestiture agreement]] signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: [[Bellcore]] (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created [[local exchange carrier]]s. AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. ''Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc.'' became a wholly owned company of the new [[AT&T Technologies]] unit, the former Western Electric. The [[5ESS Switch]] was developed during this transition. In 1985, [[laser cooling]] was used to slow and manipulate atoms by [[Steven Chu]] and team. In 1985, the modeling language ''A Mathematical Programming Language'' [[AMPL]] was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.  Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]] "For contribution over decades to modern communication systems". During the 1980s, the operating system ''[[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]]'' was developed extending the UNIX model. Also, the [[Radiodrum]], an electronic music instrument played in three space dimensions was invented. In 1988, [[TAT-8]] became the first transatlantic [[fiber-optic cable]]. Bell Labs in Freehold, NJ developed the 1.3-micron fiber, cable, splicing, laser detector, and 280 Mbit/s repeater for 40,000 telephone-call capacity.

Arthur Ashkin invented optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers. A major breakthrough came in 1987, when Ashkin used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. He immediately began studying biological systems and optical tweezers are now widely used to investigate the machinery of life.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2018/press-release/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2018|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref>

Also in 1994, [[Peter Shor]] devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL electron [[lithography]], which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The operating system [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]], an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the then-new [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] programming language [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]]. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bell-labs.com/project/dali/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116221538/http://www.bell-labs.com/project/dali/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=1997-01-16 | title=The Dali Home Page}}</ref>

In 1996, AT&T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment manufacturing business, into a new company named [[Alcatel-Lucent|Lucent Technologies]]. AT&T retained a small number of researchers who made up the staff of the newly created [[AT&T Labs]].

In 1997, the smallest then-practical transistor (60 [[nanometer]]s, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first [[Optical IP Switching|optical router]] was invented.

===2000s===
[[Image:Alcatel Lucent Logo.svg|thumb|200px|Pre-2013 logo of Alcatel-Lucent, parent company of Bell Labs]]

2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which [[DNA machine]] prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered [[Dye laser|organic laser]] invented; a large-scale map of cosmic [[dark matter]] was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes [[Organic electronics|plastic transistors]] possible, was invented.

In 2002, physicist [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön was fired]] after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.

In 2003, the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].<ref>[http://www.njnano.org/resources/index.shtml New Jersey Nanotechnology Consortium.

In 2005, [[Jeong H. Kim]], former President of Lucent's Optical Network Group, returned from academia to become the President of Bell Laboratories.

In April 2006, Bell Laboratories' parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]]. On 1 December 2006, the merged company, [[Alcatel-Lucent]], began operations. This deal raised concerns in the United States, where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, LGS Innovations, with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories' and Lucent's sensitive [[U.S. government]] contracts. In March 2019, LGS Innovations was purchased by [[CACI]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/caci-international-to-buy-private-equity-backed-lgs-innovations-for-750-million-11548897592|title=CACI International to Buy Private-Equity Backed LGS Innovations for $750 Million|first=Laura|last=Cooper|date=January 31, 2019|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref>

In December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs making the company shut down for a short period of time.

As of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics research, according to a report by the scientific journal ''Nature''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Access : Bell Labs bottoms out : Nature News |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7207 |pages=927 |author=Geoff Brumfiel |doi=10.1038/454927a |pmid=18719552 |year=2008 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

On 28 August 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.<ref>{{cite journal |url = https://www.wired.com/2008/08/bell-labs-kills/|first = Priya|last = Ganapati|title = Bell Labs Kills Fundamental Physics Research|date = 2008-08-27|access-date = 2008-08-28|journal = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080828233520/http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/08/bell-labs-kills.html|archive-date = 28 August 2008 |url-status = live}}</ref>

|  [[File:Clinton Davisson.jpg|50px]]|| style="background:darkkhaki;" | [[Clinton Davisson]] || Davisson and [[Lester Germer]] performed an experiment showing that electrons were [[diffracted]] at the surface of a crystal of nickel. This celebrated Davisson-Germer experiment confirmed the [[de Broglie hypothesis]] that particles of matter have a wave-like nature, which is a central tenet of [[quantum mechanics]]. Their observation of diffraction allowed the first measurement of a [[wavelength]] for [[electrons]]. He shared the Nobel Prize in 1937 with [[George Paget Thomson]], who independently discovered electron diffraction at about the same time as Davisson.
