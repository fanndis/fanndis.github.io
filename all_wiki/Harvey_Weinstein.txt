== Film career ==
=== 1970s: Early work and creation of Miramax ===
{{See also|Miramax}}
In the late 1970s, using profits from their concert promotion business, the brothers founded the independent film distribution company [[Miramax]], named after their parents Miriam and Max.<ref name="auto"/> The company's first releases were primarily music-oriented concert films, such as [[Paul McCartney]]'s ''[[Rockshow]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alisa |last=Perren |title=Indie, Inc.: Miramax and the Transformation of Hollywood in the 1990s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIxjwKqGXQ4C&pg=PA21 |date=May 15, 2012 |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |location=Austin, TX |page=21 |isbn=978-0-292-74287-1}}</ref>

=== 1980s: Success with arthouse and independent films ===
In the early 1980s, Miramax acquired the rights to two British films of benefit shows filmed for the human rights organization [[Amnesty International]]. Working closely with [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]], the producer of the original films, the Weinstein brothers edited the two films into one movie tailored for the American market. The resulting film was released as ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in May 1982, and it became Miramax's first hit. The movie raised considerable sums for Amnesty International and was credited by Amnesty with having helped to raise its profile in the United States.<ref name="biskind" /><ref name=Mason/> [[File:HarveyWeinstein(CannesPH).jpg|thumb|upright|Weinstein at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]]]The Weinsteins slowly built upon this success throughout the 1980s with [[Art film|arthouse films]] that achieved critical attention and modest commercial success. Harvey Weinstein and Miramax gained wider attention in 1988 with the release of [[Errol Morris]]' documentary ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', which detailed the struggle of [[Randall Dale Adams]], a wrongfully convicted inmate sentenced to [[death row]]. The publicity that soon surrounded the case resulted in Adams' release and nationwide publicity for Miramax. In 1989, their successful launch release of [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' propelled Miramax to become the most successful independent studio in America.<ref>{{cite book|first=Christophe|last= Greuet|title=Coupez: Ces films que George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Jean Reno, Kim Basinger aimeraient oublier|page=45|language=fr|publisher=Carnot|year=2004|isbn=2-84855-073-2}}</ref>

Also in 1989, Miramax released two [[Art film|arthouse films]], [[Peter Greenaway]]'s ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]'', and director [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s film ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'', both of which the [[MPAA]] [[MPAA film rating system|rating board]] gave an [[X-rating]], effectively stopping nationwide release for these films. Weinstein sued the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]] over the rating system. His lawsuit was later thrown out, but the MPAA introduced the [[NC-17]] rating two months later.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alisa|last=Perren|title=Indie, Inc.: Miramax and the Transformation of Hollywood in the 1990s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIxjwKqGXQ4C&pg=PA21|date=May 15, 2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=978-0-292-74287-1|pages=44–45}}</ref>

=== 1990s–2004: Further success, Disney ownership deal ===
Miramax continued to grow its library of films and directors until, in 1993, after the success of ''[[The Crying Game]]'', [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] offered the Weinsteins $80 million for ownership of Miramax.<ref name="lsun">{{cite news |title=Miramax offices close, Disney says brand continues |url= http://www.lowellsun.com/movies/ci_14294787 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Sun (Lowell)|Lowell Sun]] |place= Lowell, MA |date=January 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104021535/http://www.lowellsun.com/movies/ci_14294787 |archive-date= January 4, 2013}}</ref> The brothers agreed to the deal that would cement their Hollywood clout and ensure that they would remain at the head of their company. The following year, Miramax released its first blockbuster, [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', and distributed the popular independent film ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]''.

Miramax won its first [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1997 with the victory of ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''. (''Pulp Fiction'' was nominated in 1995 but lost to ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.)<ref>{{cite web |first=Thom |last=Geier |url=https://www.thewrap.com/httpswww-thewrap-comharvey-weinstein-oscar-campaigns-shakespeare-love-chicago/ |title=A Short History of Harvey Weinstein's Oscar Campaigns (Photos) |work=[[TheWrap]] |location=Santa Monica, CA |date=October 8, 2017 |access-date=June 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119134335/https://www.thewrap.com/httpswww-thewrap-comharvey-weinstein-oscar-campaigns-shakespeare-love-chicago/ |archive-date=November 19, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> This started a string of critical successes that included ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997) and ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998), both of which won several awards, including numerous Academy Awards.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/mar/22/awardsandprizes1 |title=Shakespeare in Love wins 7 Oscars |work=The Guardian |date=March 22, 1999 |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013224456/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/mar/22/awardsandprizes1 |archive-date=October 13, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1998 |title=The 70th Academy Awards |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602003041/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1998 |archive-date=June 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Weisman |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/awards/the-upset-that-wasnt-an-upset-shakespeare-in-love-817869/ |title=The Upset That Wasn't an Upset: 'Shakespeare in Love' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=Los Angeles |date=February 21, 2013 |access-date=October 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018080130/http://variety.com/2013/film/awards/the-upset-that-wasnt-an-upset-shakespeare-in-love-817869/ |archive-date=October 18, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Seija|last=Rankin|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/802830/looking-back-at-the-totally-crazy-story-behind-the-making-of-good-will-hunting|title=Looking Back at the Totally Crazy Story Behind the Making of Good Will Hunting|publisher=[[E!]]|date=October 20, 2016|access-date=October 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013174301/http://www.eonline.com/news/802830/looking-back-at-the-totally-crazy-story-behind-the-making-of-good-will-hunting|archive-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, the company was forced into bankruptcy, with [[Lantern Entertainment]] purchasing all assets in 2018. The company was shut down on July 16, 2018, and the website sometime thereafter.

{{main|Weinstein effect}}
While lauded for opening up the [[independent film]] market and making it financially viable, Weinstein has been criticized for the techniques he applied in his business dealings. [[Peter Biskind]]'s book ''Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film''<ref name="biskind" /> denounced Miramax's release history and editing of arthouse films. For example, the book states that ''[[54 (film)|54]]'' had been originally made as an [[art film|arthouse film]], but after [[Ryan Phillippe]]'s sudden rise to stardom, Weinstein forced director [[Mark Christopher (director)|Mark Christopher]] to re-edit and re-shoot the film to make it more mainstream.

Harvey Weinstein re-edited several Asian films and dubbed them in English. Weinstein tried to release the English-dubbed versions of ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' in the United States theatrically, but their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Weinstein finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Anne |last=Thompson |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/ |title=Girl with Dragon Tattoo Gets U.S. Release |date=October 11, 2009 |magazine=[[Indiewire]] |location=Los Angeles |access-date=July 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725214830/https://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/|archive-date=July 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Xu |first=Gary G. |title=Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham, MD |date=2007 |page=44 |isbn=978-0742554504}}</ref> Furthermore, Weinstein re-edited 1993 Cannes Palme d'Or winner ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' for U.S. theatrical release; 1993 Cannes jury head [[Louis Malle]] was furious. "The film we admired so much in Cannes is not the film seen in this country, which is twenty minutes shorter — but it seems longer, because it doesn't make any sense", Malle complained.<ref>{{cite web|first=Vadim|last=Rizov|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2770996/harvey-weinstein-snowpiercer-cuts/|title=The Legend of Harvey Scissorhands|website=[[MTV.com]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|location=New York City|date=August 9, 2013|access-date=March 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728190849/http://www.mtv.com/news/2770996/harvey-weinstein-snowpiercer-cuts/|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

When Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the U.S. release of ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] was reported to have sent him a [[samurai sword]] in the mail. Attached to the blade was a stark message: "No cuts." Miyazaki commented on the incident: "Actually, my producer did that. Although I did go to New York to meet this man, this Harvey Weinstein, and I was bombarded with this aggressive attack, all these demands for cuts. I defeated him."<ref>{{cite news|first=Xan|last=Brooks|title=A god among animators|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1569689,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=September 14, 2005|access-date=May 23, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625111513/http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1569689,00.html|archive-date=June 25, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> He and his brother Bob have also been criticized for altering the vision of foreign filmmakers hired to create movies for Miramax, such as on the 1997 projects ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (directed by [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[Guillermo del Toro]])<ref>{{cite web|author=Adam White |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/harvey-scissorhands-6-films-ruined-harvey-weinstein/ |title=Harvey Scissorhands: 6 films ruined by Harvey Weinstein |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2017-10-06 |access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> and ''[[Nightwatch (1997 film)|Nightwatch]]'' (directed by [[Danes|Dane]] [[Ole Bornedal]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/who/20191118/282888027498027|title=Ewan McGregor's Life in Horror|website=[[Who (magazine)|WHO Magazine]]|date=November 2019 |access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Weinstein has always insisted that such changes were done in the interest of creating the most financially viable film.

Another example cited by Biskind was [[Phillip Noyce]]'s ''[[The Quiet American (2002 film)|The Quiet American]]'' (2002), whose release Weinstein delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]] owing to audience reaction in test screenings to the film's critical tone toward past U.S. foreign policy. After being told the film would go [[straight to video]], Noyce planned to screen the film in [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in order to mobilize critics to pressure Miramax to release it theatrically. Weinstein decided to screen the film at the festival only after he was lobbied by star [[Michael Caine]], who threatened to boycott publicity for another film he had made for Miramax. ''The Quiet American'' received mostly positive reviews at the festival, and Miramax eventually released the film theatrically, but it was alleged that Miramax did not make a major effort to promote the film for Academy Award consideration, though Caine was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].<ref name="biskind" />

Weinstein acquired a reputation for ruthlessness and fits of anger.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=O'Falt|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-producer-miramax-1201888349/|title=It's Time to Shatter the Harvey Myth: Weinstein Was Shitty at His Job|work=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=October 18, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140058/http://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-producer-miramax-1201888349/|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Biskind, Weinstein once put a ''[[New York Observer]]'' reporter in a headlock while throwing him out of a party. On another occasion, Weinstein excoriated director [[Julie Taymor]] and her husband during a disagreement over a test screening of her movie ''[[Frida]]''.<ref name=Mason/>

In a 2004 newspaper article, in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Weinstein appeared somewhat repentant for his often aggressive discussions with directors and producers.<ref name=Mnookin>{{cite news|first=Seth|last=Mnookin|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/9985/|title=How Harvey Weinstein Survived His Midlife Crisis (For Now)|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=October 4, 2004|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141454/http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/9985/|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, a ''[[Newsweek]]'' story on October 13, 2008, criticized Weinstein, who was accused of "hassling [[Sydney Pollack]] on his deathbed" about the release of the film ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]''. After Weinstein offered $1 million to charity if the accusation could be proven, journalist [[Nikki Finke]] published an email sent by [[Scott Rudin]] on August 22 asserting that Weinstein "harassed" [[Anthony Minghella]]'s widow and a bedridden Pollack until Pollack's family asked him to stop.<ref>{{cite web|first=Marlow|last=Stern|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-harvey-weinstein-tormented-a-legendary-director-on-his-death-bed|title=When Harvey Weinstein Tormented a Legendary Director on His Deathbed|website=[[Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]]|location=New York City|date=October 16, 2017|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181207100035/https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-harvey-weinstein-tormented-a-legendary-director-on-his-death-bed|archive-date=December 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Finke|author-link=Nikki Finke|url=https://www.deadline.com/2008/09/harvey-weinsteins-offer-i-cant-refuse/|title=Harvey Weinstein's Offer I Can't Refuse...|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 29, 2008|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202239/http://www.deadline.com/2008/09/harvey-weinsteins-offer-i-cant-refuse/|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2009, Weinstein publicly voiced opposition to efforts to extradite [[Roman Polanski]] from Switzerland to the U.S. regarding a 1977 charge that he had drugged and raped a 13-year-old, to which Polanski had pleaded guilty before fleeing the country.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jeremy|last=Kay|url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/other-festivals/thierry-fremaux-enlists-harvey-weinstein-in-polanski-petition/5006133.article|title=Thierry Fremaux enlists Harvey Weinstein in Polanski petition|website=[[Screen Daily]]|date=September 28, 2009|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612163112/https://www.screendaily.com/festivals/other-festivals/thierry-fremaux-enlists-harvey-weinstein-in-polanski-petition/5006133.article|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Weinstein, whose company had distributed ''[[Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired]]'', a film about the Polanski case, questioned whether Polanski committed any crime,<ref>{{cite news| first=Harvey | last=Weinstein|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/harvey-weinstein-polanski-has-served-his-time-and-must-be-freed-1794699.html | title=Polanski has served his time and must be freed | work=[[The Independent]] | publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|archive-date=October 7, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007025343/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/harvey-weinstein-polanski-has-served-his-time-and-must-be-freed-1794699.html | date=October 4, 2009 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> prompting [[Los Angeles County]] District Attorney [[Steve Cooley]] to insist that Polanski's guilty plea indicated that his action was a crime, and that several other serious charges were pending.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jack|last=Leonard|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/10/top-la-prosecutor-refutes-statements-of-weinstein-other-polanski-supporters.html|title=Top L.A. prosecutor disputes statements from Harvey Weinstein, other Roman Polanski supporters|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=October 6, 2009|access-date=June 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143237/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/10/top-la-prosecutor-refutes-statements-of-weinstein-other-polanski-supporters.html|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

An analysis of Academy Award acceptance speeches from 1966 to 2016 found that Weinstein had been thanked or praised in 34 speeches—as many times as God, and second only to [[Steven Spielberg]] (with 43 mentions).<ref>{{cite web|first1=Ashley|last1=Rodriguez|title=How powerful was Harvey Weinstein?

Both ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]'' have announced the completion by the playwright and dramatist [[David Mamet]] of the play titled ''Bitter Wheat'' which is to deal principally with the Weinstein controversy concerning his arrest in 2018. As stated in the ''New York Post'' in May 2018: "The plan is to open Mamet's new play in London...sources say Mamet is wary of another run at Broadway unless his Weinstein play gets a good reception in England. He's got a shot with [[Daniel Evans (actor)|Daniel Evans]], the young director who's in talks to do it".<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Riedel |date=May 24, 2018 |title=David Mamet is making a play about Harvey Weinstein |url=https://nypost.com/2018/05/24/david-mamet-is-making-a-play-about-harvey-weinstein/ |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |access-date=June 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140836/https://nypost.com/2018/05/24/david-mamet-is-making-a-play-about-harvey-weinstein/ |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
