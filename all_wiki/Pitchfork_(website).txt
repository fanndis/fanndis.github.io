'''''Pitchfork''''' is an American [[online magazine|online music publication]] launched in 1995 by Ryan Schreiber. It was first based in suburban [[Minneapolis]], then  [[Chicago]], later moved to [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]], is currently in [[One World Trade Center]], and is owned by [[Condé Nast]].<ref>{{Cite web | last=Steigrad| first=Alexandra| last2=Steigrad| first2=Alexandra| date=2016-04-11 |title=Pitchfork Media to Leave Hipster Digs for Condé Nast’s 1 WTC Headquarters |url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/pitchfork-media-move-to-conde-nast-offices-one-world-trade-center-from-brooklyn-10407060-10407060/ |access-date=2020-08-07| website=WWD | language=en}}</ref> 

It began as a blog that developed during Schreiber's teenage years working at a record store. It quickly earned a reputation for its extensive coverage of [[independent music|indie music]]. It has since expanded and covers all kinds of music, including [[popular music|pop]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Dan|date=November 13, 2014|url=http://ajr.org/2014/11/13/music-critics-role-changing/|title=Are Professional Music Critics an Endangered Species?|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|access-date=September 13, 2015}}</ref>

The site is best known for its daily output of music reviews but also regularly reviews [[reissue]]s and [[box set]]s. Since 2016, it has published retrospective reviews of classics, and other albums that weren't initially reviewed, each Sunday. The site publishes "best-of" lists—albums, songs—and annual features and retrospectives each year. During the '90s and '00s the site's reviews—favorable or otherwise—were considered widely influential in making or breaking careers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barshad|first=Amos|date=2018-05-01|title=What Was It Like When Critics Could Kill?

In late 1995, Ryan Schreiber, a recent high school graduate, created the magazine in [[Minneapolis]]. Influenced by local [[fanzine]]s and [[KUOM]], Schreiber, who had no previous writing experience, aimed to provide the Internet with a regularly updated resource for [[Indie (music)|independent music]]. Initially called ''Turntable'', the site was updated monthly with interviews and reviews. In May 1996, the site began publishing daily and was renamed ''Pitchfork'', alluding to [[Tony Montana]]'s tattoo in ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800457.html |title= Giving Indie Acts A Plug, or Pulling It |last= Freedom du Lac |first= J. |date= April 30, 2006 |website= [[The Washington Post]] |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>

In early 1999, Schreiber relocated ''Pitchfork'' to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. By then, the site had expanded to four full-length album reviews daily, as well as sporadic interviews, features, and columns. It had also begun garnering a following for its extensive coverage of [[underground music]] and its writing style, which was often unhindered by the conventions of [[journalism]]. In October, the site added a daily music news section.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Pitchfork'' has launched a variety of subsidiary websites. ''Pitchfork.tv'', a website displaying videos related to many independent music acts, launched in April 2008. It features bands that are typically found on ''Pitchfork'' .{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In July 2010, ''Pitchfork'' announced [http://alteredzones.com/ ''Altered Zones''], a blog aggregator devoted to underground and [[do it yourself]] music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/39381-pitchfork-launches-altered-zones/ |title=Pitchfork launches Altered Zones|work=Pitchfork Media|date=July 7, 2010|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> On May 21, 2011, ''Pitchfork'' announced a partnership with [[Kill Screen]], in which ''Pitchfork'' would publish some of their articles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/42385-pitchfork-announces-partnership-with-kill-screen/|title=Pitchfork Announces Partnership With ''Kill Screen''|date=May 21, 2011|work=Pitchfork|access-date=October 13, 2016|via=[[Condé Nast]]}}</ref> Altered Zones was closed on November 30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/11/altered_zones_r.html|title=Altered Zones RIP|publisher=The Brooklyn Vegan|date=November 30, 2011|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> On December 26, 2012, ''Pitchfork'' launched ''Nothing Major'', a website that covered visual arts such as fine art and photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/49011-welcome-to-nothing-major/|title=Welcome to Nothing Major|work=Pitchfork Media|date=December 26, 2012|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> Nothing Major closed in October 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nothingmajor.com/features/92-so-long-for-now/|title=So Long for Now|publisher=Nothing Major|date=October 16, 2013|access-date=September 29, 2014}}</ref> On October 13, 2015, [[Condé Nast]] announced that it had acquired ''Pitchfork''.<ref name=nyt-condenastpitchfork>{{cite news|title=Condé Nast Buys Pitchfork Media|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/business/media/conde-nast-buys-pitchfork-media.html?src=twr&_r=0|access-date=October 13, 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Following the sale, Schreiber remained as editor-in-chief.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/masthead/ |title=Pitchfork Masthead |publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref>

On March 13, 2016, ''Pitchfork'' was redesigned. According to an announcement post during the redesign, they said:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/64116-introducing-pitchforks-new-website/ |title=Introducing Pitchfork's New Website: Our first full redesign since 2011 |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=March 13, 2016 |access-date=March 15, 2016}}</ref> {{cquote|We last redesigned in the fall of 2011.

==Influence==
===Publicity and artist popularity===
''Pitchfork''{{'}}s opinions have gained increased cultural currency; some in the mainstream media view the site as a barometer of the independent music scene, and positive quotes from its reviews are increasingly used in press releases and affixed to the front of CDs. Some publications have cited ''Pitchfork'' in having played a part in "breaking" artists such as [[Arcade Fire]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], [[The Go! Team]], [[Junior Boys]], [[The Books]], [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Cold War Kids]], [[Wolf Parade]], [[Tapes 'n Tapes]], and [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]] although the site's true impact on their popularity remains a source of frequent debate.<ref name="Washington Post" />

Conversely, ''Pitchfork'' has also been seen as being a negative influence on some indie artists. As suggested in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article in April 2006, ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s reviews can have a significant influence on an album's popularity, especially if it had only been available to a limited audience or had been released on an [[independent record label]]. A dismissive 0.0 review of former Dismemberment Plan frontman [[Travis Morrison]]'s ''[[Travistan]]'' album led to a large sales drop and a virtual college radio blacklist.<ref name="Washington Post"/> On the other hand, "an endorsement from Pitchfork—which dispenses its approval one-tenth of a point at a time, up to a maximum of 10 points—is very valuable, indeed."<ref name="Washington Post"/>

Examples of ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s impact include:
*[[Arcade Fire]] is among the bands most commonly cited to have benefited from a ''Pitchfork'' review. In a 2005 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article, a [[Merge Records]] employee states, "After the Pitchfork review, [''[[Funeral (Arcade Fire album)|Funeral]]''] went out of print for about a week because we got so many orders for the record."<ref>{{cite news

In the summer of 2011, ''Pitchfork'' noted Bon Iver's [[Bon Iver, Bon Iver|self-titled release]] as "Best New Music", and later chose the release as the best album of 2011. ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s critical acclamation of Bon Iver is widely seen as lifting the artist to commercial mainstream success, which culminated with his [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' nominated Bon Iver as [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] in 2012, noting the 2007 ''Pitchfork'' review as the "indie cred" that "led to mainstream success".<ref>{{cite news

*[[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]] member Lee Sargent has discussed the impact of ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s influence on their [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah (album)|self-titled debut album]], saying, "The thing about a publication like ''Pitchfork'' is that they can decide when that happens. You know what I mean? They can say, 'We're going to speed up the process and this is going to happen...now!' And it was a kick in the pants for us, because we lost control of everything."<ref>{{cite web

===Size, readership and site traffic===
''Pitchfork'' now receives an audience of more than 240,000 readers per day, and more than 1.5&nbsp;million unique visitors per month, making it the most popular independent-focused music publication online.<ref>{{cite web | last = Itzkoff | first = Dave | title = The Pitchfork Effect | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=September 2006 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.09/pitchfork.html?pg=2&topic=pitchfork&topic_set=}}</ref> On October 24, 2003, the author of Pitchformula.com reported that ''Pitchfork'' had published 5,575 reviews from 158 different authors, with an average length of just over 520 words. Together, the reviews featured a total of 2,901,650 words.<ref name="Pitchformula">{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Loren Jan | title=Statistics for the reviews database |publisher=pitchformula.com | url=http://www.pitchformula.com/stats.html  |url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109203246/http://www.pitchformula.com/stats.html | archive-date=November 9, 2006}}</ref>

==Criticism==
In the 2000s the website's journalism favored independent music, favoring [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] and often obscure [[indie rock]] and giving only cursory treatment to other [[music genre|genre]]s.<ref name="City Pages">{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Lindsey |title=The Pitchfork Effect | publisher=City Pages |date=June 14, 2006 | url=http://www.citypages.com/news/the-pitchfork-effect-6690578 | access-date=October 30, 2006}}</ref> The website had a reputation for publishing reviews early and for being unpredictable, often strongly dependent on which reviewer was writing. In a 2006 article in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Matthew Shaer accused ''Pitchfork'' of deliberately writing provocative and contrarian reviews in order to attract attention.<ref name="slate"/>

The website was sometimes criticized in those years for the quality of its writing. A 2006 article in ''[[City Pages]]'' noted the large discretion the site gave to its writers, arguing it was "under-edited" and that the prose was often "overly florid".<ref name="City Pages"/> Shaer singled out some examples of "verbose and unreadable writing".<ref name="slate">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2154469|title=The indie music site that everyone loves to hate.|author=Matthew Shaer|date=November 28, 2006|work=Slate Magazine}}</ref> In response, Schreiber told ''City Pages'' that "I trust the writers to their opinions and to their own style and presentation. The most important thing to me is they know what they're talking about and are insightful."<ref name="City Pages"/>

A 2007 review of the album ''[[Kala (album)|Kala]]'' by [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] inaccurately said that [[Diplo]] had produced the tracks, when he had produced 3 out of 11 tracks and M.I.A. had produced the rest. Another ''Pitchfork'' writer described the error as "perpetuating the male-led [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] myth".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10564-kala/ |title=Album Reviews: M.I.A.: Kala |work=Pitchfork Media |date=August 21, 2007 |access-date=January 30, 2011}}</ref> M.I.A. and later [[Björk]] argued that this was part of a wider problem of music journalists making the assumption that female singers do not write or produce their own music.<ref name="mia07confronts">{{cite web | author=Thomson, Paul|title= M.I.A.

===Leaked music===
In August 2006, a directory on ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s servers containing over 300 albums was compromised. A web surfer managed to discover and download the collection, which included [[The Decemberists]]' ''[[The Crane Wife]]'' and [[TV on the Radio]]'s ''[[Return to Cookie Mountain]]'', both of which had been leaked to peer-to-peer networks. Allegedly, one of the albums on the server, [[Joanna Newsom]]'s ''[[Ys (Joanna Newsom album)|Ys]]'', had not been available on file-sharing networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thephoenix.com/article_ektid22637.aspx|title=The Joanna Newsom leak - Music - The Phoenix<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=thephoenix.com|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref>

==Parodies==
* When ''Pitchfork'' asked comedian [[David Cross]] to compile a list of his favorite albums, he instead provided them with a list of "Albums to Listen to While Reading Overwrought Pitchfork Reviews". In it, he [[satire|satirically]] piled over-the-top praise on fictional indie rock records, mocking ''Pitchfork''<nowiki/>'s reviewing style.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cross |first=David |author-link=David Cross |title=Albums to Listen to While Reading Overwrought Pitchfork Reviews | work=Pitchfork Media |date=May 5, 2005 |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/6044-david-cross-albums-to-listen-to-while-reading-overwrought-pitchfork-reviews/ |access-date=October 30, 2006 }}</ref>
* In 2004, comedy website [[Something Awful]] created a parody of ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s front page.

The Pitchfork Music Festival was held again in 2007. It was expanded to three days (Friday, July 13 – Sunday, July 15), with the first day being a collaboration between ''Pitchfork'' and the British music festival [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] as part of the latter's "Don't Look Back" series, in which seminal artists perform their most legendary albums in their entirety. Performers that evening included [[Sonic Youth]] playing ''[[Daydream Nation]]'', [[Slint]] playing ''[[Spiderland]]'', and [[GZA (musician)|GZA/Genius]] playing ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. Some of the other artists who performed over the weekend included [[Yoko Ono]], [[De La Soul]], [[Cat Power]], [[The New Pornographers]], [[Stephen Malkmus]], [[Clipse]], [[Iron & Wine]], [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], [[of Montreal]], [[Deerhunter]], [[Dan Deacon]], [[The Ponys]], and [[The Sea and Cake]]. Since 2011, a European winter edition of the festival takes place in Paris.

===All Tomorrow's Parties===
In 2008 ''Pitchfork'' collaborated with [[All Tomorrow's Parties (festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] to curate half of the bill for one of their May festival weekends. This was the first event that ''Pitchfork'' has been involved in outside of the United States.

==Rating system==
''Pitchfork''{{'}}s music reviews use two different rating systems:
* Individual track reviews were formerly ranked from 1 to 5 stars, but on January 15, 2007, the site introduced a new system called "Forkcast". In it, instead of assigning tracks a particular rating, reviewers simply label them one of the following categories: "New Music", "Old Music", "Video", "Advanced Music", "Rising", "[[What the fuck?#Modern usage|WTF]]", "On Repeat" (the category of their most favorably regarded songs), and "Delete" (for the least favored songs). {{As of|2009}}, the site had officially removed this system, opting to instead simply review tracks, while giving some a label of "Best New Track".
* Album reviews are given a rating from 0 to 10, specific to one decimal point.

On October 24, 2003, Pitchformula.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchformula.com|title=Pitchformula.com|website=pitchformula.com|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref> made a survey of the 5,575 reviews available on ''Pitchfork'' at that time, showing that:
* 6.7 was the average rating
* 2,339 reviews had been awarded a rating of 7.4 or higher
* 2,362 reviews had been awarded a rating of between 5.0 and 7.3
* 873 reviews had been awarded a rating of less than 5.0<ref name="Pitchformula"/>

British Sea Power's 2008 album ''[[Do You Like Rock Music?]]'' was initially awarded a tongue-in-cheek rating of "U.2", however the page now gives a rating of 8.2, seemingly at odds with the critical review.<ref>{{Cite web|title = British Sea Power: Do You Like Rock Music?|url = https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11152-do-you-like-rock-music/|website = Pitchfork|access-date = February 5, 2016|language = en-US}}</ref> Their rating of [[Run the Jewels]]' remix album ''Meow the Jewels'' (2015) was a pictogram of a cat's head with hearts for eyes – highlighting the pictogram and right-clicking on it reveals that the actual score is 7.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21145-meow-the-jewels/|title=Run the Jewels|work=Pitchfork}}</ref> Their review of [[Pope Francis]]' album ''[[Wake Up! (Pope Francis album)|Wake Up!]]'' featured the rating "[[3:16]]", though using the same method of revealing ''Meow the Jewels''{{'}} actual score reveals the score to be 5.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21235-wake-up/|title=Pope Francis|work=Pitchfork}}</ref> Rather than give a traditional review to [[Jet (band)|Jet]]'s ''[[Shine On (Jet album)|Shine On]]'', the site simply posted an embedded video of a monkey urinating into its own mouth and a 0.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9464-shine-on/ |title=Jet: ''Shine On'' |publisher=Pitchfork}}</ref>

===Initial release 10.0 rated albums===
The following is a list of albums given Pitchfork's highest possible rating, on initial release. The score is rare and has only been given to twelve albums since the site was launched in 1995. Many more albums have been given a 10.0 following a reissue or the publication of a retrospective review. Pitchfork has since deleted the reviews for 12 Rods, Amon Tobin, Walt Mink, The Flaming Lips, and Bob Dylan without replacing them with newer reviews, meaning that only seven albums continue to be listed with a 10.0 rating that was given on initial release.

''[[Relaxation of the Asshole]]'', a comedy album by [[Guided by Voices]] singer [[Robert Pollard]], was awarded a dual 0 and 10 on initial release. A later site redesign changed the rating to 0 only, although the explanation for the unusual rating remains in the text of the review.<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6383-relaxation-of-the-asshole/ Robert Pollard - ''Relaxation of the Asshole'' review] – Pitchfork</ref>
