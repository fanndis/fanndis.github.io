Formal negotiations toward JCPOA began with the adoption of the [[Joint Plan of Action]], an interim agreement signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in November 2013. Iran and the P5+1 countries engaged in negotiations for the next 20 months and in April 2015 agreed on a [[Iran nuclear deal framework|framework]] for the final agreement. In July 2015 Iran and the P5+1 confirmed agreement on the plan along with the "Roadmap Agreement" between Iran and the IAEA.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iran's nuclear program and international law : from confrontation to accord|last=Daniel|first=Joyner|isbn=9780190635718|edition=First|location=New York, NY|oclc=945169931|year=2016}}</ref>

==Timeline==
Under the JCPOA, Iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium-[[enriched uranium]], cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its [[gas centrifuge]]s for 13 years. For the next 15 years Iran will only enrich uranium up to 3.67%. Iran also agreed not to build any new [[pressurized heavy-water reactor|heavy-water facilities]] for the same period of time. Uranium-enrichment activities will be limited to a single facility using first-generation centrifuges for 10 years. Other facilities will be converted to avoid [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] risks. To monitor and verify Iran's compliance with the agreement, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) will have regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities. The agreement provides that in return for verifiably abiding by its commitments, Iran will receive relief from the U.S., European Union, and [[United Nations Security Council]] [[Sanctions against Iran|nuclear-related sanctions]].

On 12 October 2017, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] announced that the United States would not make the certification provided for under [[Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015|U.S. domestic law]], but stopped short of terminating the deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/10/trump-iran-live-stream-strategy-nuclear-deal/|title=LIVE STREAM: President Trump Announces Iran Nuclear Deal Strategy|first=Chris|last=Bucher|date=13 October 2017|publisher=Heavy.com|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2018, IAEA inspectors spent an aggregate of 3,000 calendar days in Iran, installing tamper-proof seals and collecting surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents for further analysis.

==Background==
{{see also|Nuclear program of Iran|Nuclear proliferation}}

===Nuclear technology===
A [[nuclear weapon]] uses a [[fissile material]] to cause a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. The most commonly used materials have been [[uranium 235]] (U-235) and [[plutonium 239]] (Pu-239). Both [[uranium 233]] (U-233) and [[reactor-grade plutonium]] have also been used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holdren |first1=John |first2=Matthew |last2=Bunn |title=Managing Military Uranium and Plutonium in the United States and the Former Soviet Union |journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment |year=1997 |volume=22 |pages=403–496 |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.22.1.403 |url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/files/mmup.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynUBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 |last=Barnaby |first=Frank |editor=Barnaby |editor-first2=Douglas |editor-last2=Holdstock |title=Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Retrospect and Prospect |page=25 |isbn=9781135209933 |date=5 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=BelferManaging>{{cite web |url=http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/files/mmup.pdf |title=Managing military uranium and plutonium in the United States and the Former Soviet Union |first1=Matthew |last1=Bunn |first2=John P. |last2=Holdren |pages=403–409}}</ref> The amount of uranium or plutonium needed depends on the sophistication of the design, with a simple design requiring approximately 15&nbsp;kg of uranium or 6&nbsp;kg of plutonium, and a sophisticated design requiring as little as 9&nbsp;kg of uranium or 2&nbsp;kg of plutonium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/nuclear-terrorism/fissile-materials-basics |title=Weapon Materials Basics (2009) |author=Union of Concerned Scientists}}</ref> Plutonium is almost nonexistent in nature, and natural uranium is about 99.3% [[uranium 238]] (U-238) and 0.7% U-235. Therefore, to make a weapon, either uranium must be [[uranium enrichment|enriched]], or plutonium must be produced. Uranium enrichment is also frequently necessary for [[nuclear power]]. For this reason, uranium enrichment is a [[dual-use technology]], a technology which "can be used both for civilian and for military purposes".<ref name="Schneider & Thränert">{{cite web | first1=Jonas | last1=Schneider | first2=Oliver | last2=Thränert | url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CSSAnalyse151-EN.pdf | title=Dual Use: Dealing with Uranium Enrichment | work=CSS Analyses in Security Policy | issue=151 | date=April 2014}}</ref> Key strategies to prevent [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation of nuclear arms]] include limiting the number of operating uranium enrichment plants and controlling the export of [[nuclear technology]] and [[fissile material]].<ref name=BelferManaging/><ref name="Schneider & Thränert"/>

===Iranian nuclear activity, conflict with IAEA and Western countries, 1970–2006===
{{See also|Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons#Iran}}
Iranian development of [[nuclear technology]] began in the 1970s, when the U.S. [[Atoms for Peace]] program began providing assistance to Iran, which was then led by the [[Shah of Iran|Shah]].<ref name="NTI">[http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/iran/nuclear/ "Country Profiles: Iran: Nuclear"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807104143/http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/iran/nuclear/ |date=7 August 2014 }}, [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] (last updated July 2015).</ref> Iran signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT) in 1968 as a non-nuclear weapons state and ratified the NPT in 1970.<ref name="NTI"/>

In 1979 the [[Iranian Revolution]] took place, and Iran's nuclear program, which had developed some baseline capacity, fell to disarray as "much of Iran's nuclear talent fled the country in the wake of the Revolution."<ref name="NTI"/> Furthermore, Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] was initially opposed to nuclear technology, and Iran engaged in a [[Iran–Iraq War|costly war with Iraq]] from 1980 to 1988.<ref name="NTI"/>

In the late 1980s Iran reinstated its nuclear program, with [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|assistance from Pakistan]] (which entered into a [[Iran–Pakistan relations|bilateral agreement with Iran]] in 1992), [[China]] (which did the same in 1990), and Russia (which did the same in 1992 and 1995), and from the [[Abdul Qadeer Khan|A.Q. Khan]] network.<ref name="NTI"/> Iran "began pursuing an indigenous [[nuclear fuel cycle]] capability by developing a uranium mining infrastructure and experimenting with uranium conversion and enrichment".<ref name="NTI"/>

In August 2002 the Paris-based [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]], an Iranian dissident group, publicly revealed the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities, the [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] heavy-water production facility and the [[Natanz]] enrichment facility.<ref name="NTI"/><ref name="GuardianTimeline">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/iran-nuclear-talks-timeline "Iran nuclear talks: timeline"], ''The Guardian'' (14 July 2015).</ref> In February 2003 Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]] acknowledged the existence of the facilities and asserted that Iran had undertaken "small-scale enrichment experiments" to produce low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants.<ref name="NTI"/> In late February [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspectors visited Natanz.<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> In May 2003 Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Kalaye Electric Company but refused to allow them to take samples.<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/>

In June 2003, an IAEA report concluded that Iran had failed to meet its obligations under the safeguards agreement,<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> and Iran, faced with the prospect of being referred to the [[UN Security Council]], entered into diplomatic negotiations with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (the EU 3).<ref name="NTI"/><ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> The United States refused to be involved in these negotiations.<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> In October 2003 the Tehran Declaration was reached between Iran and the EU 3; under this declaration Iran agreed to cooperate fully with the IAEA, sign the Additional Protocol, and temporarily suspend all uranium enrichment.<ref name="NTI"/><ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> In September and October 2003 the IAEA conducted several facility inspections.<ref name="NTI"/> This was followed by the Paris Agreement in November 2004, in which Iran agreed to temporarily suspend enrichment and conversion activities, "including the manufacture, installation, testing, and operation of centrifuges, and committed to working with the EU-3 to find a mutually beneficial long-term diplomatic solution".<ref name="NTI"/>

In August 2005, the newly elected [[president of Iran]], [[2005 Iranian presidential election|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], promptly accused Iranian negotiators who had negotiated the Paris Accords of treason.<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/><ref name=Hadley>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/11/iran-primer-the-george-w-bush-administration.html |title=Iran Primer: The George W.

In February 2006 Iran ended its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and resumed enrichment at Natanz, prompting the IAEA Board of Governors to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.<ref name="NTI"/><ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> After the vote, Iran announced it would resume enrichment of uranium.<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> In April 2006 Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had nuclear technology but said that it was purely for power generation, not weapons.<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> In June 2006 the EU 3 joined China, Russia, and the United States, to form the P5+1.<ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> The following month, July 2006, the UN Security Council passed its first [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696|resolution (nr. 1696)]], demanding Iran stop uranium enrichment and processing, because of "serious concern" about "a number of outstanding issues and concerns on Iran's nuclear programme, including topics which could have a military nuclear dimension".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/1696(2006)|title=S/RES/1696(2006) - E - S/RES/1696(2006)|website=undocs.org}}</ref><ref name="GuardianTimeline"/> Another UN Security Council resolution followed in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737|December 2006 (nr. 1737)]]; others followed later.<ref name="CRS2015report"/> The legal authority for the IAEA Board of Governors referral and the Security Council resolutions derived from the IAEA Statute and the [[United Nations Charter]].<ref name="CRS2015report"/> The resolutions demanded that Iran cease enrichment activities, and the second resolution (Dec. 2006) also imposed sanctions on Iran, including bans on the transfer of nuclear and missile technology to the country and freezes on the assets of certain Iranian individuals and entities, in order to pressure the country.<ref name="NTI"/><ref name="GuardianTimeline"/>

In July 2006 Iran opened the Arak heavy water production plant, which led to one of the Security Council resolutions.<ref name="NTI"/>

===Prolonged conflict Iran with U.S. and European countries, 2007–present===
Four more UN Security Council resolutions concerning Iran's nuclear program followed: 1747 (March 2007), 1803 (March 2008), 1835 (September 2008), and 1929 (June 2010).<ref name="CRS2015report"/> In Resolution 1803 and elsewhere the Security Council acknowledged Iran's rights under Article IV of the NPT, which provides for "the inalienable right ... to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes".<ref name="CRS2015report">Paul K.

In a February 2007 interview with the ''[[Financial Times]]'', IAEA director general [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] said that military action against Iran "would be catastrophic, counterproductive" and called for negotiations between the international community and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program.<ref name="Dombey">Daniel Dombey, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140904220229/http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/transcripts/2007/ft190207.html Transcript of the Director General's Interview on Iran and DPRK], ''Financial Times'' (19 February 2007).</ref> ElBaradei specifically proposed a "double, simultaneous suspension, a time out" as "a confidence-building measure", under which the international sanctions would be suspended and Iran would suspend enrichment.<ref name="Dombey"/> ElBaradei also said, "if I look at it from a weapons perspective there are much more important issues to me than the suspension of [enrichment]," naming his top priorities as preventing Iran from "go[ing] to industrial capacity until the issues are settled"; building confidence, with "full inspection" involving Iranian adoption of the [[Additional Protocol]]; and "at all costs" preventing Iran from "moving out of the [treaty-based non-proliferation] system".<ref name="Dombey"/>

A November 2007 U.S. [[National Intelligence Estimate]] assessed that Iran "halted its nuclear weapons program" in 2003; that estimate and subsequent U.S. Intelligence Community statements also assessed that the Iranian government at the time had was "keeping open the 'option' to develop nuclear weapons" in the future.<ref name="CRS Report">Kenneth Katzman & Paul K.

An [[Iran nuclear deal framework]] was reached on 2 April 2015. Under this framework Iran agreed tentatively to accept restrictions on its nuclear program, all of which would last for at least a decade and some longer, and to submit to an increased intensity of [[Nuclear program of Iran#International Atomic Energy Agency|international inspections]] under a framework deal. These details were to be negotiated by the end of June 2015.

===15-year term===
After the 15 years, many provisions of the JCPOA will expire, including most restrictions on Iran's enrichment program. At that time, in 2030, most people involved in the 1979 revolution will no longer be politically active. Some critics of the treaty consider it plausible that Iran could then make a nuclear bomb. But Iran should also have ratified the Additional Protocol and will thus be subject to enhanced inspection and oversight by the IAEA.<ref name="foreignaffairs">{{cite journal|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2015-09-07/iran-after-deal|title=Iran After the Deal - What to Do When the JCPOA Expires |first=Gary G.|last=Sick|date=7 September 2015|journal=Foreign Affairs}}</ref>

Legal scholars [[Bruce Ackerman]] of [[Yale Law School]] and David Golove of the [[New York University School of Law]] argue that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 had the effect of making the agreement (once implemented) into a [[congressional-executive agreement]].<ref name="Nelson">Steven Nelson, [https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/07/15/iran-deal-may-bind-next-president "Iran Deal May Bind Next President: Scholars say the nuclear agreement could be binding under domestic and international law"], ''U.S. News & World Report'' (15 July 2015).</ref> Golove states that the president cannot "ignore commitments [made by him or by a past president] in congressional-executive agreements without congressional authority to do so", and believes that the agreement is binding under international law, irrespective of any White House declaration, because it contains no provision saying otherwise.<ref name="Nelson"/><ref>David Golove, [https://www.justsecurity.org/14154/presidential-authority-conclude-iran-nuclear-agreement-and-senates-self-defeating-bill/ "Presidential Authority to Conclude an Iran Nuclear Agreement—and the Senate's Self-Defeating Bill"], Just Security (20 August 2014).</ref> Ackerman agrees, arguing, "Presidents do not have the power to repudiate congressional-executive agreements without strictly following the procedures laid out by Congress in its original authorizing legislation."<ref name="Nelson"/> Others, such as Michael Ramsey of the [[University of San Diego School of Law]], argue that unless Congress expressly approves of the agreement via a resolution of approval (which is unlikely), the agreement is nonbinding under domestic law, so that "this president can implement to the extent of his statutory and constitutional authority [and] future presidents can refuse to follow."<ref name="Nelson"/> Ramsey points out, however, that even if the agreement is a nonbinding executive agreement under domestic law, it may still be binding under international law, since domestic invalidity is not a defense to failure to follow an international agreement.<ref name="Nelson"/><br />The position of the U.S. government is different. Secretary of State Kerry stated in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, "with respect to the talks, we've been clear from the beginning. We're not negotiating a, quote, 'legally binding plan.' We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement."<ref>Michael J.

{{quote|With respect to Iran, it is a [[Iranian civilization|great civilization]], but it also has an authoritarian theocracy in charge that is anti-American, anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic, sponsors terrorism, and there are a whole host of real profound differences that we [have with] them ...

I had a lot of disagreements with [[Richard Nixon]], but he understood there was the prospect, the possibility, that [[1972 Nixon visit to China|China could take a different path]]. You test these things, and as long as we are preserving our security capacity—as long as we are not giving away our ability to respond forcefully, militarily, where necessary to protect our friends and our allies—that is a risk we have to take.

It's not naïve; it's a recognition that if we can in fact resolve some of these differences, without resort to force, that will be a lot better for us and the people of that region.<ref name="Friedman"/>}}

Also on 15 July, Vice President Joe Biden met with Senate Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill, where he made a presentation on the agreement.<ref>Deirdre Walsh & Ted Barrett, [http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/15/politics/iran-deal-white-house-democrats-congress/ "WH dispatches Joe Biden to lock down Iran deal on Capitol Hill"], CNN (16 July 2015).</ref>

On 18 July Obama devoted his [[Weekly Radio Address of the President of the United States|weekly radio address]] to the agreement, saying, "this deal will make America and the world safer and more secure" and rebutting "a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments about it";<ref name="WeeklyRadio">[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/18/weekly-address-comprehensive-long-term-deal-iran "Weekly Address: A Comprehensive, Long-Term Deal with Iran"], White House Office of the Press Secretary (18 July 2015).</ref> Obama said, "as [[commander-in-chief]], I make no apology for keeping this country safe and secure through the hard work of diplomacy over the easy rush to war."<ref name="WeeklyRadio"/> On 23 July Obama met in the [[White House Cabinet Room]] with about a dozen undecided House Democrats to speak about the agreement and seek their support.<ref name="July23Hrg"/>

"This is a deal that has been endorsed by people like [[Brent Scowcroft]] and [[Sam Nunn]] ... historic Democratic and Republican leaders on arms control and on keeping America safe.

On 5 August Obama gave a speech before an audience of around 200 at [[American University]], marking a new phase in the administration's campaign for the agreement.<ref name="AmericanSpeech">Julie Hirschfeld Davis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/us/politics/obama-urges-critics-of-iran-deal-to-ignore-drumbeat-of-war.html "It's Either Iran Nuclear Deal or 'Some Form of War,' Obama Warns"], ''The New York Times'' (5 August 2015).</ref><ref name="AmericanSpeechTranscript">[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/05/remarks-president-iran-nuclear-deal Remarks by the President on the Iran Nuclear Deal, American University, Washington, D.C.], White House Office of the Press Secretary (5 August 2015).

How can we in good conscience justify war before we've tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives?"<ref name="AmericanSpeech"/> In his speech, Obama also invoked a speech made by [[John F. Kennedy]] at American University in 1963 in favor of the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].<ref name="AmericanSpeech"/> Obama also said the opponents of the agreement were the same people who created the "drumbeat of war" that led to the [[Iraq War]] and criticized "knee-jerk partisanship that has become all too familiar, rhetoric that renders every decision made to be a disaster, a surrender".<ref name="AmericanSpeech"/>

New York Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], a senior Democrat, made a different assessment of prospects for war by distinguishing between nuclear and non-nuclear aspects of the agreement. In each case he asked whether we are better off with the agreement or without it, and his conclusion was: "when it comes to the nuclear aspects of the agreement within ten years, we might be slightly better off with it. However, when it comes to the nuclear aspects after ten years and the non-nuclear aspects, we would be better off without it." Then Schumer assessed the Iranian government, saying, "Who's to say this dictatorship will not prevail for another ten, twenty, or thirty years? To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great." Finally, Schumer concluded: "I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power."<ref name="schumer"/>

In the same 5 August speech, Obama said, "Just because Iranian hard-liners chant '[[Death to America]]' does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe. In fact, it's those hard-liners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hard-liners chanting 'Death to America' who have been most opposed to the deal.

Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] called it "crass political rhetoric" that was a strategy to "Demonize your opponents, gin up the base, get the Democrats all angry, and rally around the president."

In comments made at the Aspen Security Forum in [[Aspen, Colorado]] in July 2015, [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James Clapper]] said the JCPOA would improve the U.S.'s ability to monitor Iran: "[The agreement] puts us in a far better place in terms of insight and access" than no agreement.<ref name="ClapperAspen">Eliza Collins, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/clapper-iran-deal-gives-us-access-insight-120616.html "Clapper: Iran deal gives U.S. access, insight"], ''Politico'' (24 July 2015).</ref> Clapper remained "concerned about compliance and deceit" but "pointed out that during the negotiation period [Iran] complied with rules" negotiated under the interim agreement (the Joint Plan of Action).<ref name="ClapperAspen"/>

One area of disagreement between supporters and opponents of the JCPOA is the consequences of walking away from an agreement, and whether renegotiation of the agreement is a realistic option.<ref name="Areas of Dispute"/> Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Democrat of New York, an opponent of the agreement, called for the U.S. government to keep sanctions in place, strengthen them, and "pursue the hard-trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be".<ref name="schumer"/> Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said that he believed that it was "hyperbole" to say that the agreement was the only alternative to war.<ref name="Areas of Dispute"/> President Obama, by contrast, argued that renegotiation of the deal is unrealistic, stating in his American University speech, "the notion that there is a better deal to be had. ... relies on vague promises of toughness" and stated, "Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society, or they are not being straight with the American people. ... Neither the Iranian government, or the Iranian opposition, or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty."<ref name="AmericanSpeechTranscript"/> Obama also argued, "those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position, as some have suggested, Congress' rejection would almost certainly result in multi-lateral sanctions unraveling," because "our closest allies in Europe or in Asia, much less China or Russia, certainly are not going to enforce existing sanctions for another five, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power."<ref name="AmericanSpeechTranscript"/> Secretary of State Kerry echoed these remarks, saying in July 2015 that the idea of a "'better deal,' some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation . ... is a fantasy, plain and simple, and our intelligence community will tell you that".<ref name="Areas of Dispute"/><ref>See also Lucy Westcott, [http://www.newsweek.com/john-kerry-congress-there-no-better-iran-deal-362124 "With an Eye on Congress, Kerry Says There Is No Better Iran Deal"], ''Newsweek'' (11 August 2015) (Kerry: "When I hear a senator or a congressman stand up and say, 'Well, we should get a better deal,' that is not going to happen.

==Deterring Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons==
Some argue that deterrence is the key to ensuring not just that Iran is in compliance with the agreement but also to preventing them from developing nuclear weapons.<ref name="wpost08282015">{{cite news |author=[[Dennis Ross]] and [[David Petraeus]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-put-some-teeth-into-the-nuclear-deal-with-iran/2015/08/25/6f3db43c-4b35-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html |title=How to put some teeth into the nuclear deal with Iran |date=25 August 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> Former Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation [[Robert Einhorn]], a supporter of the agreement, wrote it would be better to have permanent or longer-term restrictions on Iran's enrichment program, but preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is possible, "provided the United States and key partners maintain a strong and credible deterrent against a future Iranian decision to go for the bomb".<ref name="Brookings082015">{{cite web |first=Robert J. |last=Einhorn |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports2/2015/08/iran-nuclear-deal-battleground-issues-einhorn |title=The battleground-issues |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |date=August 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> According to [[Michael Eisenstadt]], Director of the Military and Security Studies Program at the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], "deterring Iran from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons will remain the core imperative driving U.S. policy in the coming years".<ref name="winep07292015">{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Eisenstadt |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-nuclear-deal-with-iran-regional-implications |title=The Nuclear Deal with Iran: Regional Implications |publisher=[[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref>

Four days after the JCPOA was adopted, Khamenei delivered a speech, highlighting his [[Khamenei's fatwa against nuclear weapons|fatwa]] and rejecting the claim that the nuclear talks rather than Iran's religious abstinence prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He said:

{{quote|The Americans say they stopped Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They know it's not true.

{{quote|The JCPOA, moreover, does not remove any of our options when it comes to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. As I have repeatedly emphasized, my Administration will take whatever means are necessary to achieve that goal, including military means. Should Iran seek to dash toward a nuclear weapon, all of the options available to the United States—including the military option—will remain available through the life of the deal and beyond.<ref name="nytimes08202015"/>}}

Ambassador [[Dennis Ross]], former top Mideast official, and General [[David Petraeus]], former CIA director, wrote in a ''Washington Post'' op-ed, "Bolstering deterrence is essential in addressing key vulnerabilities" of the agreement. Petraeus and Ross asserted that if Iran decide to race toward a nuclear weapon "there is a need not to speak of our options but of our readiness to use force", since the threat of force is far more likely to deter the Iranians. They said the president could resolve their concerns by stating that he would use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including producing highly enriched uranium, even after the deal ends in 15 years. It is "critically important for the president to state this clearly, particularly given his perceived hesitancy to use force", they said.<ref name="wpost08282015"/><ref name="thehill08272015">{{cite news |first=Kristina |last=Wong |url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252135-petraeus-still-making-up-mind-on-iran-deal |title=Petraeus still making up his mind on Iran deal |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=27 August 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref>

In the same letter, Obama detailed the possible non-military unilateral and multilateral responses to be employed should Iran violate the agreement, however, the president made it clear: "Ultimately, it is essential that we retain the flexibility to decide what responsive measures we and our allies deem appropriate for any non-compliance."<ref name="nytimes08202015"/> Flexibility meant that Obama rejected specifying "the penalties for smaller violations of the accord" in advance.<ref name="nytimes08232015">{{cite news |author=[[David E.

The open letter, which was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials endorsing the agreement, begins with the words: "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran stands as a landmark agreement in deterring the proliferation of nuclear weapons."<ref name="DiplomatsLetter"/><ref name="Fallows"/> In contrast, [[Michael Mandelbaum]], the Christian A.

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Aftermath of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action}}
In May 2019 the IAEA certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the deal, although questions were raised on certified that how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the deal.<ref name=ReutersMay19>{{cite web |title=Iran Stays Within Nuclear Deal's Main Limits While Testing Another |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-iaea/iran-stays-within-nuclear-deals-main-limits-while-testing-another-idUSKCN1T11PW |website=[[Reuters]] |last=Murphy |first=Francois |accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref>

==Legal status==
In a letter sent to then U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, the U.S. State Department said that the JCPOA "is not a [[treaty]] or an [[executive agreement]], and is not a signed document".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/iran-nuclear-deal-not-signed-document-not-binding/|title=A Trip Down Memory Lane: In 2015 the Obama Administration Said the Iran Deal Wasn't Even a 'Signed Document'|last=French|first=David|date=10 May 2018|website=National Review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513074547/https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/iran-nuclear-deal-not-signed-document-not-binding/|archive-date=13 May 2018|url-status=live|access-date=14 May 2014}}</ref>

According to the Congressional Research Service, different definitions of "treaty" are used in international law and in domestic U.S. law. Under the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], "The term '[[treaty]]' has a broader meaning under international law than under domestic law. Under international law, 'treaty' refers to any binding international agreement.<ref>"[http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]". ''United Nations''. Article 1(a). May 23, 1969.</ref> Under domestic U.S. law, 'treaty' signifies only those binding international agreements that have received the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44761.pdf|title=Withdrawal from International Agreements: Legal Framework, the Paris Agreement, and the Iran Nuclear Agreement|publisher=}}</ref>

==Denial of recertification==
{{see also|Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act|Iran's 2018 lawsuit at ICJ against the United States}}
The United States certified in April 2017 and in July 2017 that Iran was complying with the deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/19/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-administration-approves-agreement-but-review-looms|title=Iran nuclear deal: Trump administration approves agreement but review looms|date=19 April 2017|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Peter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-recertify.html |title= Trump Recertifies Iran Nuclear Deal, but Only Reluctantly |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 July 2017 |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>

On 13 October 2017 President Trump announced that he would not make the certification required under the [[Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015|Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act]], accusing Iran of violating the "spirit" of the deal and calling on the U.S. Congress and international partners to "address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-announcement-live-updates/|title= Trump: W.H. "cannot and will not" certify Iran's compliance| work =CBS News |accessdate= 6 January 2018}}</ref>

Declaring that he would not certify the deal, Trump left it up to Congress whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and "blow up" the deal. But Trump's aides sought to enact rules indicating how the United States could "reimpose sanctions", and Trump listed three items that could provide such a "trigger" for leaving the deal: Iran's intercontinental ballistic missile, Iranian rejection of "an extension of the deal's existing constraint on its nuclear activities", and "evidence that Iran could manufacture a bomb in less than 12 months". Trump described the deal as "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into".<ref>{{cite news |last1= Landler |first1=Mark |last2=E.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that getting out from the Iran nuclear deal would "carry a high cost" for the United States,<ref>{{cite news |last1= Millward|first1=David|title=Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warns US would pay "high cost" for scrapping nuclear deal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/18/iranian-president-hassan-rouhani-warns-us-would-pay-high-cost/|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> and that no president was allowed to "single-handedly revoke" the deal signed by the UN.<ref name="independent">{{cite news |last1= Shugerman|first1=Emily|title= ran nuclear deal: EU condemns Donald Trump's decision to decertify agreement |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-eu-federica-mogherini-netanyahu-israel-a7999556.html|newspaper= The Independent}}</ref>

After Trump said that he "cannot and will not" recertify the nuclear deal with Iran, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel supported the deal in a joint statement. Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said that the agreement was working well and that no one country could break the deal made by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union. She suggested a "collective process" for keeping the deal. Russia's foreign minister confirmed that Iran was abiding by the deal.<ref name="independent" />

===US withdrawal===

[[File:Trump Withdraw Iran Deal (cropped 2).jpg|400px|thumb|Trump announces US withdrawal on 8 May.]]
On 8 May 2018 the United States officially withdrew from the agreement after US President [[Donald Trump]] signed a Presidential Memorandum ordering the reinstatement of harsher sanctions.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = CNN | url = https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-iran-nuclear-deal/ | title = Trump, Iran nuclear deal}}.</ref> In his 8 May speech President Trump called the Iran deal "horrible" and said the United States would "work with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution" to prevent Iran from developing nuclear arms.<ref>{{cite news|title=FULL TRANSCRIPT OF TRUMP'S SPEECH PULLING U.S. OUT OF IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL|url=https://www.wsbradio.com/news/national/full-transcript-trump-speech-pulling-out-iran-nuclear-deal/htdRdreVy4HqnREDhO8n3O/|accessdate=10 May 2018|agency=Cox Media Group|publisher=WSB Radio|date=8 May 2018}}</ref> The IAEA has continued to assess that Iran has been in compliance with JCPOA and that it had "no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/statement-on-iran-by-the-iaea-spokesperson|title=Statement on Iran by the IAEA Spokesperson|date=1 May 2018|website=www.iaea.org}}</ref> Other parties to the deal stated that they will work to preserve the deal even after the US withdrawal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear/europeans-work-to-save-iran-deal-and-business-after-trump-pulls-out-idUSKBN1I90D6|title=Europeans work to save Iran deal, and business, after Trump pulls out|first=Yara|last=Bayoumy|publisher=}}</ref>

Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East [[Mick Mulroy]] said the U.S. Department of Defense opposed withdrawal from the JCPOA, because although it wasn't perfect, it was the best they could expect. He also said the U.S. should have kept the agreement on nuclear activity and come up with another agreement on malign activity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/20/michael-mulroy-interview-pentagon-middle-east-iran-syria/|title=We Just Capitulated|first=Lara|last=Seligman}}</ref>

===Consequences of US withdrawal===
{{also|Snapback (sanctions)}}
The Iranian currency dropped significantly right after Trump announced the US withdrawal. The leader of Iran, [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]], stated: "I said from the first day: don't trust America".<ref>{{cite news|title=Iran warns Trump: 'You've made a mistake'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44057306|work=BBC News|date=9 May 2018}}</ref> The American flag was set on fire in Iran's Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/headlines/44055625/iranian-politicians-set-fire-to-us-flag-in-parliament|title=Video experience headlines|website=BBC News}}</ref> The next evening, 9 May, according to [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] sources, Iranian Revolutionary Guard [[Quds Force]]s based in Syria launched rockets at Israeli military targets. Reporters for CNN said that, "if confirmed," it appears to be "the first time Iranian forces have fired rockets directly at Israeli forces."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Liebermann|first1=Oren|last2=Abdelaziz|first2=Salma|title=Netanyahu says Iran 'crossed a red line' after Israel pounds Iranian targets in Syria|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/09/middleeast/israel-rockets-syria/index.html|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=CNN|date=10 May 2018}}</ref>

In 2020, Trump and Pompeo asserted that the United States remained a "participant" in the agreement, despite having formally withdrawn in 2018, in an effort to persuade the [[United Nations Security Council]] to reimpose pre-agreement sanctions on Iran for its breaches of the deal after the United States' withdrawal. The agreement provided for a resolution process among signatories in the event of a breach, but that process had not yet played out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/world/middleeast/us-iran-nuclear-deal-pompeo.html|title=To Pressure Iran, Pompeo Turns to the Deal Trump Renounced|first=David E.|last=Sanger|date=26 April 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

===Ali Khamenei's conditions for Europe to preserve the JCPOA===
Following the U.S. withdrawal from JCPOA, Iran supreme leader [[Ali Khamenei]] presented seven conditions for Europe to meet its commitments. Among them was that European powers must take steps to preserve business relations with Iranian banks and purchase Iranian oil despite U.S. pressure. He also said there was no need to hold new discussions about Iran's [[ballistic missile]] program and regional activities.<ref>{{cite news|author=Reuters Staff|title=Iran's top leader sets 7 conditions to remain in nuclear deal -official website|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-khamenei-conditions/irans-top-leader-sets-7-conditions-to-remain-in-nuclear-deal-official-website-idUSL5N1SU6LJ|accessdate=10 May 2018|publisher=Reuters|date=23 May 2018}}</ref>

===Iran's response ===
One year after the United States withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed several unilateral sanctions on Iran, Iran took countermeasures. As a first step, according to Rouhani, Iran halted sales of excess enriched uranium and heavy water to other countries. Rouhani also said that Iran would resume enrichment of uranium beyond 3.67 percent if other parties could not fulfill their duties to let Iran benefit from the economic advantages of the JCPOA. Iran made this decision after all major European companies abandoned doing business with Iran out of fear of US punishment.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sharafedin|first1=Bozorgmehr|title=Iran rolls back pledges under nuclear pact abandoned by Washington|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-rouhani-idUSKCN1SE0I5|accessdate=8 May 2019|publisher=Reuters|date=8 May 2019}}</ref>

On 14 May 2019, in a meeting with senior officials, Iran's Supreme Leader, [[Ali Khamenei]], described negotiations with the United States on another nuclear deal as "poison" and said, "We don’t seek a war, and they don’t either. They know it’s not in their interests".<ref name="14 May">{{cite web|title=Iran's Supreme Leader says there will be no war with U.S.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-khamenei/irans-supreme-leader-says-there-will-be-no-war-with-us-idUSKCN1SK23T|accessdate=14 May 2019|website=reuters}}</ref>

After the Iranian regime's arrest of human rights activist [[Farhad Meysami]], the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] supported him in a statement. Meysami then wrote a letter sharply criticizing US Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] and the [[Donald Trump]] administration, writing, "I would much rather spend all my life imprisoned by a group of my oppressive and ignorant compatriots and try to correct their wrongdoing through reformist action, than to spend a second submitting to the shame and disgrace of support from those who did not follow through with their obligations and withdrew from the rational and peaceful Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA) against all principles of morality and international law, and re-imposed inhumane sanctions which have thrown millions of my fellow Iranians into poverty".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Iranian Activist Farhad Meysami Denounces Trump’s Sanctions in a Letter From Evin Prison|language=en|work=Iranian Candadian Journal|url=https://icjournal.ca/en/post/iranian-activist-dr-farhad-meysami-denounces-trump-s-sanctions-in-a-letter-from-evin-prison/|access-date=2020-11-22}}</ref>
