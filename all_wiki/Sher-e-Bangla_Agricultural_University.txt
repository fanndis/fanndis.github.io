==History==
[[File:Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University.jpg|thumb|Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Dhaka, Bangladesh]]
SAU was established as Bengal Agricultural Institute (BAI) on 11 December 1938 by Sher-e-Bangla [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]], the chief minister of undivided Bengal. The Bengal Agricultural Institute was renamed East Pakistan Agricultural Institute in 1947. After the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country in 1971, the name of the institute was spontaneously changed to Bangladesh Agricultural Institute (BAI).

Since its inception in 1938, the BAI had been functioning as a Faculty of Agriculture under [[Dhaka University]]. After the establishment of [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] (BAU) at [[Mymensingh]] in 1961 its academic function was transferred to BAU in 1964 until its upgrade to Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University in 2001.

SAU became the 17th [[public university]] of the country in 2001. The Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University Act 2001 was passed in the [[Parliament of Bangladesh]] on 9 July. The foundation stone was laid by the then Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] on 15 July 2001 and inaugurated the university activities through the appointment of the first vice-chancellor: Professor Md. Shadat Ulla.
