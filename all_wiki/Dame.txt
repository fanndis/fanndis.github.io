'''Dame''' is an [[honorific]] title and the feminine [[form of address]] for the honour of '''damehood''' in many Christian [[chivalric order]]s, as well as the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours system]] and those of several other Commonwealth countries, such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], with the masculine form of address being [[sir]]. It is the female equivalent for [[knighthood]], which is traditionally granted to males.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awardsintelligence.co.uk/queens-honours/knighthood-damehood|title=How to get a Knighthood or Damehood|year=2016|publisher=Awards Intelligence|language=English|accessdate=25 October 2018|quote=A knighthood, and the female equivalent, a damehood, is an award given by The Queen to an individual for a major, long-term, contribution in any activity, usually at a national or international level.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025190151/https://www.awardsintelligence.co.uk/queens-honours/knighthood-damehood|archive-date=25 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dame is also style used by baronetesses [[Suo jure|in their own right]].

==History==
The [[Order of the Ermine (France)|Order of the Ermine]], founded by [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] in 1381, was the first order of chivalry to accept women; however, female knights existed for centuries in many places in the world prior to this.<ref>Ackermann, G. A. (1855). Ordensbuch sämmtlicher in Europa blühender und erloschener Orden und Ehrenzeichen. Rudolph & Dieterici.</ref> Like their male counterparts, they were distinguished by the flying of coloured banners and generally bore a coat of arms.

One woman who participated in tournaments was [[Agnes Hotot|Joane Agnes Hotot]] (born 1378), but she was not the only one.<ref>F.S.W. (1886) Dame Heraldry. Boston, MA: D. Lothrop and Company.</ref><ref>Starling, E. (1856). Noble Deeds of Woman. Phillips, Sampson.</ref> Additionally, women adopted certain forms of regalia which became closely associated with the status of knighthood.<ref name="de Marly">De Marly, D. (1986). Working dress: a history of occupational clothing. Holmes & Meier.</ref>

Unlike the male knights, it was virtually unimaginable to see women taking part in medieval battles or commanding battalions of soldiers, but there are exceptions. [[Joan of Arc]] is the most famous.  Some wore armour, others commanded troops, and some were members of an official order of chivalry. One woman to wear full armour into battle was the Duchess [[Sikelgaita|Gaita of Lombardy]] (also called Sikelgaita), who rode beside her Norman mercenary husband, [[Robert Guiscard]].<ref name="de Marly"/> She was a knight in her own right.<ref name="de Marly"/><ref name="Kasparek">Kasparek, R. (2014). Knight of the Grail Code. WestBow Press.</ref> Another was [[Petronilla de Grandmesnil, Countess of Leicester]]; wearing a mail hauberk with a sword and a shield, she defended her lands from Henry II of England. She and her husband participated in the rebellion in 1173 against [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]].<ref name="Kasparek"/> However this does not mean that they were officially knighted the way men were.

Formerly, a knight's wife was given the title of "Dame" before her name, but this usage was replaced by "Lady" during the 17th century.

The title of dame as the official equivalent of knight was introduced in 1917 with the introduction of the Order of the British Empire, and was subsequently extended to the Royal Victorian Order in 1936, the Order of St Michael and St George, and finally the Order of the Bath in 1971.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

The youngest person to be appointed a dame was [[Ellen MacArthur]]<ref name=LG>{{London Gazette |issue=57557 |page=1713 |date=2005-02-11 }}</ref> at the age of 28.
The oldest had been [[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies]] at the age of 100,<ref name=movies.yahoo.com>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/gwen-ffrangcondavies/biography.html |title=Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies |website=movies.yahoo.com |accessdate=March 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403024654/https://movies.yahoo.com/person/gwen-ffrangcondavies/biography.html |archivedate=April 3, 2015 }}</ref> until [[Olivia de Havilland]] was appointed two weeks before her 101st birthday.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/royals/olivia-de-havilland-oldest-to-be-named-a-dame/|title=Olivia de Havilland on Becoming the Oldest Person to Be Named a Dame: I'm 'Extremely Proud'|date=2017-06-17|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-US}}</ref>

Several high-profile figures, including actresses [[Geraldine McEwan]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]], have [[Declining a British honour#As a Dame Commander (DBE)|declined the honour]] (however Redgrave does hold the lower grade of [[CBE]]).

The prefix is used with the holder's given name or full name, but never with the surname alone; this follows the same usage customs as '[[Sir]]'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/baronetess|title=Baronetess|publisher=[[Debretts]]|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=n.d.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204031739/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/baronetess|archivedate=4 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
