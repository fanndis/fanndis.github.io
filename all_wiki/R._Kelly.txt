Kelly was eight when he had his first girlfriend, Lulu.

Also in December 1995, Professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] critiqued Kelly's self-titled album "R. Kelly" for ''[[Vibe (magazine)|VIBE]]''. Dyson described Kelly's growth from the ''[[12 Play]]'' album: "Kelly reshapes his personal turmoil to artistic benefit" and noted that Kelly is "reborn before our very own ears."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA138|title=R. Kelly (album) Review|date=December 1995}}</ref>

The album reached number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, becoming Kelly's first number one album on the chart, and reached number one on the R&B album charts; his second. The ''R. Kelly'' album spawned three platinum hit singles: "[[You Remind Me of Something]]" (U.S. Hot 100: #4, U.S. R&B: #1), "I Can't Sleep (Baby If I)" (U.S. Hot 100: #5, U.S. R&B: #1), and "[[Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)]]" (U.S. Hot 100: #4, U.S. R&B: #1); a duet with [[Ronald Isley]]. Kelly's self-titled album sold four million copies, receiving 4× platinum certification from the RIAA.<ref name="RIAA albums"/> Kelly promoted the album with a 50-city "Down Low Top Secret Tour" with [[LL Cool J]], [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]], and Solo.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/13/arts/music-review-invitations-to-passion-of-a-certain-kind.html?ref=rkelly|location=New York|work=The New York Times|title=MUSIC REVIEW;Invitations to Passion of a Certain Kind|date=April 13, 1996|first=Jon|last=Pareles}}</ref>

===1997–2001: Basketball, ''R.'' and ''TP-2.COM''===
In 1997, Kelly signed a contract to play professional basketball with the Atlantic City Seagulls of the [[USBL]].<ref name="pro basketball"/> Kelly wore the number 12 in honor of his album ''[[12 Play]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b34429_kelly_play_pro_basketball.html|title=R.

Kelly's USBL contract contained a clause that would allow him to fulfill a music obligation when necessary. "If Whitney Houston needs a song written", said Ken Gross, the Seagulls owner who signed Kelly, "he would be able to leave the team to do that and come back". "It wasn't a gimmick," Gross continued, "he's a ballplayer. He can play."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/entertainment/ca-48624/3|location=Chicago|work=Los Angeles Times|title=The Righteous Brother: R.

As the year 2000 commenced, Kelly racked up a slew of new awards reflecting his status as an established R&B superstar. In January 2000, Kelly had won Favorite Male Soul/R&B Artist at the [[American Music Awards]] and, in February, was nominated for several [[Grammy Award]]s, including Best Male R&B Vocal Performance ("When a Woman's Fed Up"), Best R&B Album (''R.''), and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group ("[[Satisfy You (Puff Daddy song)|Satisfy You]]") with [[P.

On November 7, 2000, Kelly released his fifth studio album ''[[TP-2.com]]'', a project harking back to his breakthrough album, ''[[12 Play]]''. Unlike Kelly's previous effort, ''[[R.]]'', all songs on ''TP-2.com'' was written, arranged, and produced entirely by Kelly. [[AllMusic]]'s Jason Birchmeier gave ''TP-2.com'' 4 stars and described Kelly's style: "Kelly knows how to take proven formulas and funnel them through his own stylistic aesthetic, which usually means slowing down the tempo, laying on lush choruses of strings and background vocals, taming down the lyrics for radio, and catering his pitch primarily to wistful women.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o552g5xRRiwC&pg=PA386|title=All Music Guide to Soul: The Definitive Guide to R&B and Soul|isbn=9780879307448|accessdate=September 10, 2012|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Vladimir|year=2003}}</ref>

===2004–2005: ''Happy People/U Saved Me'' and ''TP.3 Reloaded''===
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2019}}

The ''Unfinished Business'' tour was plagued by a rivalry between the two stars and Kelly reportedly showing up late or not at all to gigs. The singer, according to Jay-Z, often complained that the touring lights were not directed towards him and often left during the middle of sets. Another night during the concert, Kelly stayed on his tour bus for two hours before finally coming out to perform an uninspired set. Jay-Z eventually removed R. Kelly halfway through the tour, after a member of Jay-Z's entourage attacked R. Kelly with [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] or [[pepper spray]]. On April 25, 2006, it was confirmed that Jay-Z's younger cousin, Tyran (Ty-Ty) Smith confessed in a Manhattan Criminal Court to pepper-spraying R. Kelly and four of his bodyguards at Madison Square Garden in October 2004. Smith had been charged with assault, but was allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct for four days of community service. After the original incident, Jay-Z made Smith an executive of [[Def Jam Records]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1529414/20060425/jay_z.jhtml|title=Jay-Z Associate Pleads Guilty In R.

=== 2006–2008: ''Double Up'', Studio work and "I Believe" ===
Kelly's other single from ''Double Up'' titled "Rise Up" was a tribute to the victims of the [[Virginia Tech shooting]]. The song was officially released as a digital download May 15, 2007. Proceeds were donated to the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund, a fund that helped family members of the victims of the shootings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lamb|first=Bill|url=http://top40.about.com/b/a/209075.htm|title=R.

Kelly began his ''Double Up'' tour with [[Ne-Yo]], [[Keyshia Cole]] and [[J. Holiday]] opening for him. After two shows, promoter Leonard Rowe had Ne-Yo removed from the tour because of a contract dispute. However, Ne-Yo alleges that the reason for the dropout was because Ne-Yo believes he received a better response from critics and fans, even though he performed at just two shows. Ne-Yo filed a lawsuit against Rowe Entertainment. Kelly was not mentioned in the lawsuit. In December 2007, Kelly failed to appear at another preliminary court hearing on his case due to his tour bus being held up in Utah.<ref>{{cite web|last=Orzeck|first=Kurt|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1576840/r-kelly-arrest-warrant-issued-over-missed-court-date.jhtml|title=R.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===
Kelly's music took root in [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[soul music|soul]]. One of Kelly's earliest musical memories is listening to his mother, Joanne Kelly, sing. He and his mother used to play records by [[Donny Hathaway]] and [[Marvin Gaye]] who became inspirations for young Robert. In reference to Hathaway, Kelly declared: "A guy like Donny Hathaway had a focused, sexual texture in his voice that I always wanted in mine. He had smooth, soulful tones, but he was spiritual at the same time."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/entertainment/ca-48624/2|title=The Righteous Brother: R. Kelly's ambitious album of genre- spanning songs finds him updating the spiritually grounded R&B of such greats as Al Green and Donny Hathaway.|publisher=[[E!]]|date=November 29, 1998|accessdate=October 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014164357/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/entertainment/ca-48624/2|archive-date=October 14, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kelly was heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye's R&B Lothario image. "I had to make a 'baby-makin{{'}}' album. If Marvin Gaye did it, I wanted to do it," Kelly said.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMOfpYb4_PEC&q=Marvin+|title=Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me|publisher=Hay House, Inc|date=2012|isbn=9781401931773|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

While Kelly has created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soulman crooning and funk, from the beginning of his career the most distinctive element of his music is its explicit sensuality. "[[Sex Me]]", "[[Bump n' Grind (R. Kelly song)|Bump n' Grind]]", "[[Your Body's Callin']]", and "[[Feelin' on Yo Booty]]" are considered to be examples, as their productions were seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. Kelly's crossover appeal was also sustained by his development of a flair for pop balladry.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===Vocal style and lyrical themes===
Kelly's voice easily shifts from booming [[baritone]] to seductive [[alto]].<ref name="shooting star"/> Love and sex are the topics of the majority of Kelly's lyrical content, although he has written about a wide variety of themes such as inspiration and [[spirituality]]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reporters [[Jim DeRogatis]] and Abdon Pallasch observed about the contrasting themes: "...the image he liked to project was that of the "R&B Thug"...bringing the streetwise persona of the gangsta rapper into the more polite world of R&B."<ref name="singer swinger">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020609224145/http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-kelly09.html|archive-date=June 9, 2002|last1=DeRogatis|first1=Jim|last2=Pallasch|first2=Abdon|title=Inspirational singer or perverted swinger?|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=June 9, 2002|accessdate=March 15, 2020|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-kelly09.html}}</ref> Kelly has said that he writes from everyday experiences and prides himself in being versatile.

The expungement request was in the middle of a lawsuit filed by Tiffany Hawkins, who was seeking to use the marriage documents in her case against Kelly.

Kelly was again accused of misconduct on April 17, 2018, by a former partner of his who claimed that Kelly "intentionally" infected her with a [[sexually transmitted disease]].

===Boycott and industry response===
In May 2018, the [[Women of color|Women of Color]] branch of the [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]] movement called for a boycott of Kelly's music and performances over the many allegations against him. The boycott was accompanied by a [[social media]] campaign called [[Mute R. Kelly]]. In response, his management said that Kelly supports the movement in principle, but targeting him was "the attempted lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/r-kelly-times-up-muterkelly|title=R Kelly: Time's Up campaign against me is 'attempted lynching of a black man'|first=Laura|last=Snapes|date=May 1, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>

The music streaming service [[Spotify]] announced on May 10 that it was going to stop promoting or recommending music by both R. Kelly and [[XXXTentacion]].

===Allegations of music industry complicity===
''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran a lengthy article in May 2018 alleging that music industry executives had been aware of Kelly's sexually abusive behavior toward young women for years but did little or nothing about them due to his success as a performer and songwriter. As early as 1994, the newspaper reported, his tour manager had urged [[Jive Records]]' founder [[Clive Calder]] to tell Kelly he would not release the singer's records if he continued to have "incidents" with women after every concert he gave. Calder told the ''Post'' that he regretted not having done more at the time, saying "Clearly, we missed something."<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />

Former Jive president [[Barry Weiss]] told the newspaper that during 20 years with the label he never concerned himself with Kelly's private life and was unaware of two lawsuits filed against Kelly and the label by women alleging sexual misconduct, suits in which the label had successfully argued it was not [[Legal liability|liable]]. Larry Khan, another Jive executive who worked closely with the singer even after viewing the sex tape, likewise implied it was not the label's responsibility, and pointed to [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] as musicians whose labels continued to release and promote their records despite public awareness that they were involved with young women.<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />

Executives at [[Epic Records]] also took a similarly relaxed attitude towards allegations of Kelly's sexual misconduct, the ''Post'' claimed. In 2002, after he signed with the label, executive David McPherson allegedly avoided viewing a copy of a tape purportedly showing the singer having sex with an underage girl, even as he had warned Kelly's assistant that if it turned out to be Kelly on that tape, the label would drop him. McPherson did not respond to the ''Post''{{'}}s requests for comment. An [[internship|intern]] with the label whose work suffered after she began a relationship with Kelly, ultimately costing her the position, settled with Epic for $250,000; Cathy Carroll, the executive she worked for, regularly rebuked her former subordinate for having an affair with a married man whenever the two met at social functions for years afterwards, and the damage to the woman's reputation led her to abandon her career in the music industry. Carroll told the newspaper the woman was "starstruck ... A lot of times it's not really the men."<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />

''The Washington Post'' also suggested the labels were complicit in the sex-cult allegations from the previous summer's ''BuzzFeed'' piece. Employees at the studios where Kelly recorded were required to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s and not enter certain rooms, which they said they believed were where Kelly made the women stay while he worked. Despite the agreements, the newspaper was able to publish screenshots of text exchanges where women in the rooms asked Kelly's assistants to let them out so they could go to the bathroom or get food. The newspaper also published pictures taken after Kelly had concluded a six-week session at a [[Los Angeles]] studio, paid for by his then-current label, [[RCA Records]], showing a cup of urine sitting on a piano and urine stains on the wooden floor of another room.<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />
