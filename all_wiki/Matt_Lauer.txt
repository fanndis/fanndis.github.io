Lauer earned his undergraduate degree from [[Ohio University]] at age 39 in 1997; he had studied at the school's Scripps College of Communication, School of Media Arts and Studies.

By 1980, he had become an on-air reporter for the station's 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts.

He then started to move around the East Coast, hosting a number of daily information and talk programs.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nbcnews.com/id/44961883/ns/rock_center_with_brian_williams/t/matt-lauer/ |title = Matt Lauer – Rock Center with Brian Williams |date = 2013 |publisher = [[NBC News]] }}</ref> He was a co-host of ''[[PM Magazine]]'' in several cities, beginning in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] (1980–1981), then [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] (1981–1984),<ref>{{cite web|title=Fates & Fortunes–Programing |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/81-OCR/1981-11-09-BC-OCR-Page-0093.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting |page=93 |date=November 9, 1981 |access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref> and then New York City (1984–1986).

The program was retitled ''Trial Watch'' when it went to series, and ran on the NBC network for two seasons. NBC hired [[Robb Weller]] as host over Lauer when the program was picked up as a daily series.

The same year, he filmed a pilot for the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]'s [[bodybuilding]] spinoff, the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]] for [[USA Network]] known as ''WBF BodyStars'', though WWF owner/chairman [[Vince McMahon]] later decided to host the program himself.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Assael |first1 = Shaun |last2 = Mooneyham |first2 = Mike |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xi1-scyOfaEC |title = Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment |publisher = Crown/Archetype |page = 117 |isbn = 978-0307758132 |accessdate = November 29, 2017 |date = 2010-11-03 }}</ref> In 1991 Lauer appeared as the co-host (along with [[Willow Bay]]) of ''Etc., Etc.'', a show on the [[Travel Channel]].

Lauer joined [[NBC]] in 1992, when he became co-anchor of the early weekday news show ''[[Today in New York]]'' on the network's New York flagship station [[WNBC]]. After a year, he also filled the role of ''[[Live at Five (WNBC TV series)|Live at Five]]'' co-anchor with [[Sue Simmons]], eventually taking the role permanently and giving up the morning shift by 1994; he was replaced on ''Today in New York'' by [[Maurice DuBois]].<ref name="today.com" /> Lauer remained on ''Live at Five'' until 1996.

Lauer's on-camera presence would soon provide him many opportunities with [[NBC News]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/in-her-final-newscast-sue-simmons-makes-it-clear-she-doesnt-want-to-leave_b52079 |title = In Her Final Newscast, Sue Simmons Makes It Clear She Doesn't Want to Leave |work = Media Bistro }}</ref> Lauer filled in as the newsreader on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' for [[Margaret Larson]] when needed from 1992 to 1993.<ref name="today.com" /> This "audition" period allowed him to join ''The Today Show'' full-time in January 1994 as news anchor, while still co-anchoring ''Today in New York'' and ''Live at Five''.<ref>[[Live at Five (WNBC TV series)]]{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}<!--we can't cite another Wikipedia article.--></ref>

The segment was named after the [[PBS]] game show ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (game show)|Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'' from which it borrowed the [[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego (song)|theme song]]. This segment sent Lauer to various locations around the world, from where he reported on the importance of each location.

On the April 5, 2012, program, Lauer announced that he had signed a new contract with NBC News through 2017.

During the 2014 Winter Olympics, prime-time host [[Bob Costas]] suffered a major eye infection over the first five days of prime-time coverage. As a result, Lauer replaced him for the sixth day of coverage, and hosted from February 11 until February 14.

In November 2015, Lauer hosted an interview with [[Charlie Sheen]], during which Sheen revealed that he was [[HIV-positive]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.today.com/health/charlie-sheen-reveals-hes-hiv-positive-today-show-exclusive-t56391 |website = [[Today (American TV program)|Today]] |date = November 17, 2015 |title = Charlie Sheen reveals he's HIV positive in TODAY Show exclusive |first = Eun Kyung |last = Kim }}</ref>

On September 8, 2016, Lauer conducted separate 30-minute interviews with presidential candidates [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the reaction to Lauer's performance was "not kind". Lauer devoted much of the Clinton interview to questions about her e-mail server, and according to critics appeared to rush through audience-led topics such as domestic terror attacks and veterans' affairs, implying that there was not enough time to cover these in detail. Many also felt that Lauer failed to challenge Trump on alleged inaccuracies, such as his statement that he was "totally against the war in Iraq", which other sources called "lies".<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/matt-lauer-forum.html |title = Matt Lauer Fields Storm of Criticism Over Clinton-Trump Forum |last = Grynbaum |first = Michael M. |work = The New York Times |date = September 8, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/arts/television/matt-lauer-presidential-election-hillary-clinton-donald-trump.html |title = Critic's Notebook: Matt Lauer Loses the War in a Battle Between the Candidates |last = Poniewozik |first = James |work = The New York Times |date = September 8, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/lauers-pathetic-interview-made-me-think-trump-can-win.html |title = Matt Lauer's Pathetic Interview of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Is the Scariest Thing I've Seen in This Campaign |last = Chait |first = Jonathan |work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = September 7, 2016 |authorlink = Jonathan Chait }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37305655 |department = US election 2016 |title = Forum moderator Lauer suffers media backlash |publisher = BBC |date = September 8, 2016 }}</ref> CNN reported that the short amount of time for the interviews, the short notice with which they were conducted, and the small amount of audience questions were a major reason for the poor reviews.<ref>{{cite web |last = Stelter |first = Brian |url = https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/08/media/nbc-news-forum-trump-clinton-postmortem/ |title = Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was "disaster" |publisher = CNN |date = September 8, 2016 |accessdate = November 29, 2017 }}</ref>

Two weeks after Lauer's firing, Addie Zinone, a former ''Today'' production assistant, made an additional accusation, saying that she had a consensual sexual relationship with Lauer in June 2000.

According to Farrow,  ''Today'' show booker Melissa Lonner claims that Lauer exposed himself to her in 2010 at an NBC cocktail party.
