'''''Drop Dead Diva''''' is an American [[Legal Drama|legal]] [[comedy-drama]]/[[fantasy]] [[television series]] that aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] from July 12, 2009, to June 22, 2014. The series was created by [[Josh Berman]] and produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]]. It stars [[Brooke Elliott]] as Jane, a plus-sized lawyer whose body is inhabited by the soul of a fashion model.

On October 25, 2013, Lifetime renewed the series for a sixth season,<ref name="renewal">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/10/25/lifetime-renews-drop-dead-diva-exclusive/|title=Lifetime renews 'Drop Dead Diva'|last=Rice|first=Lynette|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lifetimes-drop-dead-diva-end-679973|title=Lifetime's 'Drop Dead Diva' to End After Sixth Season (Exclusive)|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=February 13, 2014|date=February 13, 2014}}</ref> which premiered on March 23, 2014, and concluded on June 22, 2014.

==Plot==
The series revolves around vapid aspiring model Deborah "Deb" Dobkins (played by [[Brooke D'Orsay]]), who is killed in a car crash on the way to an audition for ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. As her soul enters the gates of Heaven, she finds herself being judged by a gatekeeper named Fred ([[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]]). As a result of her shallowness, Fred declares her a "zero-zero", since she has performed zero good deeds and zero bad deeds during her time on Earth. While he is distracted, Deb presses the "return" key before Fred can stop her, and is brought back to life in the body of a recently deceased lawyer named Jane Bingum (Elliott), who died protecting her boss, Jay Parker ([[Josh Stamberg]]).

Jane is the complete opposite of Deb; she is brilliant, hard-working, charitable, and plus-sized. Deb finds that Jane also works in the same law firm, Harrison-Parker, as Deb's fiancé Grayson Kent ([[Jackson Hurst]]). After immediately telling her best friend, Stacy Barrett ([[April Bowlby]]), of her predicament, Deb prepares herself to tell Grayson the truth about her new body. However, Fred's assignment as Deb's guardian angel serves as punishment for letting her leave heaven. His purpose on Earth is to prevent Deb from telling Grayson the truth and insisting that no one else can know that she is really Deb in Jane's body.

Deb struggles to learn more about her inherited life, learning lessons about self-esteem and personal acceptance. Eventually, the real Jane Bingum (played by [[Natalie Hall]]) reappears in another person's body after having pressed the return key, leading Deb to finally reveal the truth to Grayson, now one of Jane's closest friends. Grayson, after grieving and moving on from Deb's passing, becomes conflicted, but finally accepts Deb in her new body, saying that he wants her to be her and no one else.

In addition to working with Grayson at the law firm, Deb (as Jane) also contends with her professional rival, Kim Kaswell ([[Kate Levering]]), who briefly dates Grayson after Deb's passing.

==Development and production==

===Conception===
''Drop Dead Diva'' was originally planned for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], but the studio passed after seeing the script. Afterward, Lifetime stepped in and ordered the script to pilot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2008/04/14/development-update-monday-april-14-27259/7608/ |title=Development Update: Monday, April 14 |work=The Futon Critic |date=April 14, 2008}}</ref> According to Berman, "It's a cross between ''[[Freaky Friday]]'' and ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]''," calling it a "life-affirming [[Comedy-drama|dramedy]]." He adds that in Hollywood, "beauty has been defined as size 2 and under 25; hopefully we can help redefine the paradigm."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-05-07-drop-dead-diva_N.htm |title=Lifetime's 'Drop Dead Diva' redefines beauty |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Gary |last=Levin |date=May 11, 2009}}</ref>

===Filming===
Though the background setting for ''Drop Dead Diva'' is [[Los Angeles]], the series is filmed in [[Peachtree City, Georgia]], and [[Senoia, Georgia]], with principal photography taking place in a studio contained in a large hangar at [[Atlanta Regional Airport]], and outdoor locations shot around the town.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecitizen.com/articles/03-07-2013/ptc-filmed-%E2%80%98drop-dead-diva%E2%80%99-comes-back-life |title=PTC-filmed 'Drop Dead Diva' comes back to life |work=TheCitizen.com |first=John |last=Munford |date=March 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023011903/http://thecitizen.com/articles/03-07-2013/ptc-filmed-%E2%80%98drop-dead-diva%E2%80%99-comes-back-life |archivedate=October 23, 2013 }}</ref> Filming originally took place in Georgia for tax incentives.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/agenda/2011/06/01/drop-dead-diva |title=Peachtree City doubles as L.A. for another season |work=Atlanta Magazine |first=Rich |last=Eldredge |date=June 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112062325/http://www.atlantamagazine.com/agenda/2011/06/01/drop-dead-diva |archivedate=January 12, 2014 }}</ref>

===Cancellation and revival===
On January 15, 2013, Lifetime announced that despite the cliffhanger at the end of season four, that would be the final season of ''Drop Dead Diva''. Lifetime's decision to cancel the expensive drama came after the cable network approached producer Sony Pictures Television for cost-cutting options to continue with the series. Despite the cancellation, ratings for the season-four finale marked a season high, with 2.76 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lifetimes-drop-dead-diva-canceled-412859|title=Lifetime's 'Drop Dead Diva' Canceled|last=Ng|first=Philiana|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>  However, a month and a half after Lifetime cancelled the dramedy series, the cable network inked a deal with producer Sony Pictures TV to bring the show back for a fifth season.<ref name="renewal"/>  The decision to bring back the series suggests that the two sides had reached a new, more cost-effective agreement.<ref name="renewal2">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lifetimes-drop-dead-diva-back-425660|title=Lifetime Bringing Back 'Drop Dead Diva' for Season 5|last=Ng|first=Philiana|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 1, 2013|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Drop Dead Diva'' holds a score of 68 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 12 reviews by critics for the first season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drop Dead Diva: Season 1|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/drop-dead-diva|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Mary McNamara praised [[Josh Berman]] for the series, saying: "Berman produces a deft juggling trick of heart and humor, balancing Deb's shallowness with some solid common sense and Jane's inadequate self esteem with kindness and legal brilliance." She added describing the series itself as "a lot of fun to watch".<ref>{{cite web|last=West|first=Kelly|title=TV Review: Army Wives - Season 2|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/10/entertainment/et-dropdeaddiva10|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=July 10, 2009}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' Alessandra Stanley commented: "while the presumption that a woman can be either brainy or beautiful, or in this case, good or thin, but not both, is a bit primitive, the series has humor and charm beneath its facile message, in large part (no disrespect intended) to a subtle, winning performance by Ms. Elliott."<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanley|first=Alessandra|title=Chubby Legal Beagle, Meet Your Inner Skinny Siren|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/arts/television/10fat.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=July 9, 2009}}</ref> Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was less enthusiastic about the series, commenting: "Granted, there's much to be said for a program featuring a smart, plus-sized heroine in today's rail-thin TV world, but "Diva" under nourishes its premise amid a sea of legal-procedural banalities." He went on to state that "the epiphanies come a little too easily, and the legal triumphs predicated on knowledge of posing are a little too "Legally Blonde.""<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=Review: "Drop Dead Diva"|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/reviews/drop-dead-diva-1200475418/|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> ''[[New York Daily News]]'' David Hinckley, gave the premiere two out of five stars, describing ''Drop Dead Diva'' as "still feeling like a pasted-together assortment of ideas and plot lines from productions past." However, on a more positive note he stated that "this could turn out to be the TV equivalent of a good old-fashioned summer beach read."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hinckley|first=David|title=Thin line for 'Drop Dead Diva' as ditz lands in plus-size bod|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/thin-line-drop-dead-diva-ditz-lands-plus-size-bod-article-1.429262|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=July 10, 2009}}</ref>

''[[USA Today]]'' called Brooke Elliott "a full-blown instant star and delight who makes you wonder where she has been hiding herself." Adding: "one of the many wonderful things about Elliott's performance is that they are two people. Her transitions — like scrunching up her eyes when "Jane" is thinking, then opening them in wide, thrilled shock when "Deb" realizes that "Jane" has had a thought — are clear without seeming forced. There's pain and pleasure in the situation for both women, and Elliott makes each emotion ring true."<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianco|first=Robert|title=Head diva Brooke Elliott is 'Drop Dead' terrific|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2009-07-08-drop-dead-review_N.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=July 8, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Boston Globe]]'' also praised Elliott's performance as Jane Bingum, stating that "As Deb-inside-Jane, Elliott does a great job portraying pathos, absurd disappointment, and wide-eyed discovery."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weiss|first=Joanna|title=Weighty topics in three shows|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2009-07-08-drop-dead-review_N.htm|publisher=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=July 11, 2009}}</ref>
