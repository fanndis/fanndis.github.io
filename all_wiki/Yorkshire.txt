Yorkshire is covered by different [[Regions of England|Government Office Regions]]. Most of the county falls within [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] while the extreme northern part, such as south [[Tees Valley]], [[Holwick]] in addition to [[Startforth]], falls within [[North East England]] and extreme western part of the county are covered by the [[North West England]] region.

==Toponymy==
Yorkshire or the County of York was so named as it is the [[shire]] (administrative area or county) of the city of [[York]] or York's Shire. "York" comes from the Viking name for the city, [[Jórvík]]. The word "[[Shire]]" is either from the [[Old Norse]] word ''skyr'' or from [[Old English]] ''scir'' meaning share, care or official charge.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Shire|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shire|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> The "shire" suffix is locally pronounced {{IPA|/-ʃə/}} "shuh", or occasionally {{IPA|/-ʃiə/}}, a homophone of "sheer".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mills|first=A.D.|title=Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-852758-9}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Yorkshire}}
===Ancient-500 Brythonic and Latin: Hen Ogledd===
'''Early: Celtic Brigantes and Parisi'''

Early inhabitants of, what is now, Yorkshire were [[Hen Ogledd]] [[Celtic Britons|Brythonic]] [[Celts]] (old north British Celts), who formed separate tribes, the [[Brigantes]] (known to be in the [[North Riding|north]] and [[West Riding|west]] ridings of now Yorkshire) and the [[Parisi (Yorkshire)|Parisi]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]]. The Brigantes controlled territory which later became all of [[Northern England]] and more territory than most Celtic tribe on the isle of [[Great Britain]]. Six of the nine Brigantian ''[[Polis|poleis]]'' described by [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]] in the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' fall within the historic county.<ref name="brigantes">{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/brigantes.htm |publisher=Roman-Britain.org |title=The Brigantes |accessdate=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231090447/http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/brigantes.htm |archive-date=31 December 2006 }}</ref><ref name="ptolemy">[[Ptolemy]], ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/1*.html 2.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/2*.html 2.2]</ref>

The Parisi, who controlled the area that would become the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], might have been related to the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] of ''[[Lutetia]] Parisiorum'', [[Gaul]] (known today as Paris, France).<ref name="parisii">{{cite web |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/parisi.htm|publisher=Roman-Britain.org |title=The Parisii|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> Their capital was at [[Petuaria]], close to the Humber Estuary.

[[File:Constantine York Minster.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Constantine I]] outside [[York Minster]].]]
Although the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] began in 43&nbsp;AD, the Brigantes remained in control of their kingdom as a [[client state]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] for an extended period, reigned over by the Brigantian monarchs [[Cartimandua]] and her husband [[Venutius]]. The capital was inbeween the north and west ridings ''[[Isurium Brigantum]]'' (near [[Aldborough, North Yorkshire|Aldborough]]) ''[[civitas]]'' under Roman rule.  Initially, this situation suited both the Romans and the Brigantes, who were known as the most [[Military|militant]] tribe in Britain.<ref name="rib">{{cite web|url=http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/his_brigantian_uprising.htm|publisher=Romans-In-Britain.org.uk|title=Romans in Britain|accessdate=25 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017195232/http://romans-in-britain.org.uk/his_brigantian_uprising.htm|archive-date=17 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Queen Cartimandua left her husband [[Venutius]] for his armour bearer, [[Vellocatus]], setting off a chain of events which changed control of the region. Cartimandua, due to her good relationship with the Romans, was able to keep control of the kingdom; however, her former husband staged [[rebellion]]s against her and her Roman allies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.arch.wyjs.org.uk/AdvSrv/indexRoman.asp?pg=Romanweb/Cartimandua.htm |publisher=West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service |title=Cartimandua |year=2007 |accessdate=3 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009031721/http://www.arch.wyjs.org.uk/AdvSrv/indexRoman.asp?pg=Romanweb%2FCartimandua.htm |archive-date=9 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the second attempt, Venutius seized the kingdom, but the Romans, under general [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis|Petillius Cerialis]], conquered the Brigantes in 71&nbsp;AD.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.shadowdrake.com/brigit5.html| publisher=House Shadow Drake| title=The Brigantes| accessdate=25 October 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021090013/http://www.shadowdrake.com/brigit5.html| archive-date=21 October 2006| url-status=dead }}</ref>

The fortified city of [[Eboracum]] (now known as [[York]]) was named as capital of ''[[Britannia Inferior]]'' and joint capital of all [[Roman Britain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Classics/roman_provinces/britain/image21.htm| publisher=VanderBilt.edu| title=Lower (Britannia Inferior) and Upper Britain (Britannia Superior)| accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The emperor [[Septimius Severus]] ruled the [[Roman Empire]] from Eboracum for the two years before his death.<ref name="romanfest">{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkromanfestival.com/history.htm| publisher=York Roman Festival| title=Roman York – a brief introduction to York's Roman History| accessdate=25 October 2007 |archive-url = https://archive.today/20071002084623/http://www.yorkromanfestival.com/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2 October 2007}}</ref>

Another emperor, [[Constantius Chlorus]], died in Eboracum during a visit in 306&nbsp;AD. This saw his son [[Constantine the Great]], who became renowned for his contributions to Christianity, proclaimed emperor in the city.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.britainexpress.com/cities/york/roman.htm| publisher=Britain Express| title=Roman York| accessdate=25 October 2007}}</ref> In the early 5th century, the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman rule ceased]] with the withdrawal of the last active Roman troops.

'''500s-800s: Celtic-Anglo kingdoms of Ebrauc, Elmet, Deira and Northumbria'''

After the Romans left, small Celtic kingdoms arose in the region, including kingdoms of [[Deira]] to the east (domain of a settlements near [[Malton, North Yorkshire|Malton]] on Derwent), [[Ebrauc|Ebrauc]] (domain of York) around the north and [[Elmet]] to the west. The latter two were successors of land south west and north east of the former [[Brigantia (ancient region)|Brigantia]] capital.

[[Angles]] consolidated (merging Ebrauc) under Deira, York as capital. This was in turn was grouped with [[Bernicia]], another former Celtic-Brigantes kingdom that was north of the [[River Tees]] and had come to be headed by [[Bamburgh]], to form [[Northumbria]] .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainEbrauc.htm|publisher=HistoryFiles.co.uk|title=Ebrauc|accessdate=25 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/BritishElmet.htm|publisher=HistoryFiles.co.uk|title=Elmet|accessdate=25 October 2007 }}</ref> Elmet had remained independent from the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] Angles until some time in the early 7th century, when King [[Edwin of Northumbria]] expelled its last king, Certic, and annexed the region to his Deira region.

At its greatest extent, Northumbria stretched from the [[Irish Sea]] to the [[North Sea]] and from [[Edinburgh]] down to [[Hallamshire]] in the south.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/anglosaxons/invasion/invind3.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=The Anglo-Saxons|accessdate=25 October 2007}}</ref>

'''800s-900s: Anglo-Norse Jórvík'''
{{Main|Jórvík|l1=Kingdom of Jórvík}}'''Scandinavian York''' (also referred to as '''Jórvík''') or '''Danish/Norwegian York''' is a term used by historians for the south of [[Northumbria]] (modern day Yorkshire) during the period of the late 9th century and first half of the 10th century, when it was dominated by Norse warrior-kings; in particular, used to refer to [[York]], the city controlled by these kings.

Norse monarchy controlled varying amounts of Northumbria from 875 to 954, however the area was invaded and conquered for short periods by [[England]] between 927 and 954 before eventually being annexed into England in 954. It was closely associated with the much longer-lived [[Kingdom of Dublin]] throughout this period.[[File:EricBloodaxeCoin.png|thumb|right|Coin from Eric Bloodaxe's reign]]

The Danes conquered and assumed what is now York and renamed it [[Jórvík]], making it the capital city of a new Danish kingdom under the same name.

The Danes went on to conquer an even larger area of England that afterwards became known as the [[Danelaw]]; but whereas most of the Danelaw was still English land, albeit in submission to Viking overlords, it was in the [[Jórvík|Kingdom of Jórvík]] that the only truly Viking territory on mainland Britain was ever established. The Kingdom prospered, taking advantage of the vast trading network of the Viking nations, and established commercial ties with the [[British Isles]], North-West Europe, the [[Mediterranean]] and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/york/yorkhist4.html|publisher=Britannia.com|title=Narrative History of York: Viking Times|accessdate=25 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818202555/http://www.britannia.com/history/york/yorkhist4.html|archive-date=18 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

'''800s-1000s: Anglo-Saxon Yorkshire'''
After around 100 years of its volatile existence, the Kingdom of Jorvik finally came to an end. The [[Kingdom of Wessex]] was now in its ascendant and established its dominance over the North in general, placing Yorkshire again within [[Northumbria]], which retained a certain amount of autonomy as an almost-independent [[earl]]dom rather than a separate kingdom. The Wessex [[Kings of England]] were reputed to have respected the Norse customs in Yorkshire and left law-making in the hands of the local aristocracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/york/yorkhist5.html|publisher=Britannia.com|title=Narrative History of York: Late Saxon Times|accessdate=25 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623102237/http://www.britannia.com/history/york/yorkhist5.html|archive-date=23 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the weeks leading up to the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066&nbsp;AD, [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II of England]] was distracted by pushing back efforts to reinstated the kingdom of Jorvik and Danelaw. His brother [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] and [[Harald Hardrada]], [[King of Norway]], having won the [[Battle of Fulford]]. The King of England marched north where the two armies met at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]. Tostig and Hardrada were both killed and their army was defeated decisively.

Harold Godwinson was forced immediately to march his army south, where [[William the Conqueror]] was landing. The King was defeated in what is now known as the [[Battle of Hastings]], which led to the [[Norman conquest of England]].

The people of the North rebelled against the Normans in September 1069&nbsp;AD, enlisting [[Sweyn II of Denmark]]. They tried to take back York, but the Normans burnt it before they could.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allabout1066.net/north_east_1069.htm| publisher=The Norman Conquest School Site| title=Resistance in the North East – 1069| accessdate=3 October 2008}}</ref> What followed was the [[Harrying of the North]] ordered by William. From York to [[Durham, England|Durham]], crops, domestic animals, and farming tools were [[Scorched earth|scorched]].

In the centuries following, many [[abbey]]s and [[priory|priories]] were built in Yorkshire. Norman landowners increase their revenues and established new towns such as [[Barnsley]], [[Doncaster]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and [[Sheffield]], among others. Of towns founded before the conquest, only [[Bridlington]], [[Pocklington]], and [[York]] continued at a prominent level.<ref name="rulocal">{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/yorkshire.html| publisher=LocalHistories.org| title=Yorkshire| accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The population of Yorkshire boomed until hit by the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in the years between 1315 and 1322.<ref name="rulocal" />

When King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] was overthrown in 1399, antagonism between the [[House of York]] and the [[House of Lancaster]], both branches of the royal [[House of Plantagenet]], began to emerge. Eventually the two houses fought for the throne of England in a series of civil wars, commonly known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Some of the battles took place in Yorkshire, such as those at [[Battle of Wakefield|Wakefield]] and [[Battle of Towton|Towton]], the latter of which is known as the bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil.<ref>{{cite book| last = Gravett | first = Christopher | author-link =Christopher Gravett| title =Towton 1461: England's Bloodiest Battle| publisher = [[Osprey Publishing]] | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-UlMBQYccEMC&q=towton+bloodiest | isbn = 978-0-415-09378-1| year = 1999}}</ref>
[[Richard III of England|Richard III]] was the last Yorkist king.

'''1500: Catholic-Protestant dissolution'''

The 19th century saw Yorkshire's continued growth, with the population growing and the [[Industrial Revolution]] continuing with prominent industries in coal, textile and steel (especially in [[Sheffield]], [[Rotherham]] and [[Middlesbrough]]). However, despite the booming industry, living conditions declined in the industrial towns due to overcrowding.

Canals and [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] roads were introduced in the late 18th century.

Near [[Great Ouseburn]] the Ure is joined by the small Ouse Gill Beck, and below the confluence the river is known as the Ouse.

====Geography and the historic divisions====
Historically, Yorkshire was divided into three ridings and the Ainsty of York. The term 'riding' is of Viking origin and derives from ''Threthingr'' meaning a third part. The three ridings in Yorkshire were named the East Riding, West Riding and North Riding.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/index.html |title=GENUKI: Yorkshire Genealogy |first=Colin |last=Hinson |work=genuki.org.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> The East and North Ridings of Yorkshire were separated by the River Derwent and the West and North Ridings were separated by the Ouse and the Ure/Nidd watershed. In 1974, the three ridings of Yorkshire were abolished and York, which had been independent of the three ridings, was incorporated into the new county called North Yorkshire. It later became part of York Unitary Authority.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lgbce.org.uk/records-and-resources/database-of-local-government-orders/yorkshire-and-the-humber |title=LGBCE – Yorkshire and the Humber |work=lgbce.org.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>

==Local government==
The form and makeup of local government administration has changed over time to address the perceived political challenges that public administration is in place to deal with. Legislation has created and abolished local authorities, has redrawn boundaries of administrative areas and has altered the names of such bodies over time. During these processes the geographical and traditional historic boundaries of Yorkshire outside of the local government layer has remained unchanged.

=== Regional and sub-regional administration ===
For statistical purposes, Yorkshire is divided, as of 2018, between three regions of England. Most of the county falls within [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. The extreme northern part of the county, such as [[Middlesbrough]], [[Redcar]], [[Holwick]] and [[Startforth]], fall within [[North East England]]. Small areas in the west of the historic county, like [[Saddleworth]], [[Barnoldswick]] and [[Sedbergh]], fall within [[North West England]]. 

The borough of Barnsley is also part of the wider Leeds City Region making it the only borough in Yorkshire to be part of two region deals, with both Leeds and Sheffield. The city of York, borough of Harrogate, Craven district and Selby district are also part of the Leeds City Region. Stockton on Tees is split between North Yorkshire and [[County Durham]]. West Yorkshire is the largest modern division of Yorkshire, with over 2.2 million residents, followed by South Yorkshire with 1.42 million.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

=== County and district administration ===
The last widespread local government reform took place 1974 and led to the creation of the new administrative areas which consisted of four new county council areas, [[North Yorkshire]], and [[Humberside]] (known as shire counties, the latter abolished in 1996), with [[West Yorkshire]], and [[South Yorkshire]] (known as metropolitan counties, themselves abolished in 1986). Whilst some councils have been abolished the post-1974 counties themselves still exist legally for certain functions (e.g. police) and for ceremonial purposes. Within the metropolitan counties, the nine metropolitan boroughs created were conferred city statuses.<ref name=":0">{{London Gazette |issue=46255 |date=4 April 1974 |page=4400}}</ref>

==Economy==

[[File:Bridgewater Place from Call Lane.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Bridgewater Place]], a symbol of Leeds' growing financial importance.]]
Yorkshire has a mixed economy, and accounts for about 8% of UK GDP. The [[City of Leeds]] is Yorkshire's largest city and the leading centre of trade and commerce. [[Leeds]] is also one of the UK's larger financial centres.  Leeds' traditional industries were mixed; service-based industries, textile manufacturing and coal mining being examples. Tourism is also significant. In 2015, the value of tourism was in excess of £7&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://studyyorkshire.com/economy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907044648/http://www.studyyorkshire.com/economy |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2014 |title=Economy |publisher=Yorkshire Universities |year=2012–2014 |accessdate=10 November 2017}}</ref>

[[Sheffield]] once had heavy industries, such as coal mining and the [[steel industry]]. Since the decline of such industries Sheffield has attracted tertiary and administrative businesses including more retail trade; [[Meadowhall Centre|Meadowhall]] being an example. However, while Sheffield's heavy industry has declined, the region has reinvented itself as a centre for specialist engineering companies such as Boeing and Maclaren. A cluster of hi-tech facilities including [[The Welding Institute]] and the Boeing partnered [[Advanced Manufacturing Park|Advanced Materials Research Centre]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amrc.co.uk/faq/index.php#1|publisher=amrc.co.uk|title=Advanced Materials Research Centre|accessdate=10 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426235602/http://www.amrc.co.uk/faq/index.php#1|archive-date=26 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> have all helped to raise the region's profile and to bring significant investment into Yorkshire.{{citation needed|reason=Says who?|date=November 2014}}

[[Bradford]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Keighley]] and [[Huddersfield]] once were centres of wool milling. Areas such as Bradford, [[Dewsbury]] and Keighley have suffered a decline in their economy since.

[[North Yorkshire]] has an established tourist industry, supported by the presence of two national parks ([[Yorkshire Dales National Park]], [[North York Moors National Park]]), [[Harrogate]], [[York]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and this industry is also growing in Leeds. [[Kingston upon Hull]] is Yorkshire's largest port and has a large manufacturing base, its fishing industry has however declined somewhat in recent years.  Harrogate and [[Knaresborough]] both have small legal and financial sectors. Harrogate is a European conference and exhibition destination with both the Great Yorkshire Showground and [[Harrogate International Centre]] in the town.

Coal mining was extremely active in the south of the county during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, particularly around [[Barnsley]] and [[Wakefield]]. As late as the 1970s, the number of miners working in the area was still in six figures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/sense_of_place/miners/miners_state_of_the_industry.shtml |title=BBC – Bradford and West Yorkshire – A Sense of Place – Coal mining in West Yorkshire: The end of an era |accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> The industry was placed under threat on 6 March 1984 when the [[National Coal Board]] announced the closure of 20 pits nationwide (some of them in South Yorkshire).

Yorkshire has been the focus of various industrial promotion and development initiatives, such as [[Yorkshire Forward]], and today various local enterprise partnerships. There are also a number of innovation centres belonging to leading companies, and a range of spin-off companies linked to major universities.

Many large British companies are based in Yorkshire or were founded there. These include [[HSBC]] (Sheffield), [[Morrisons]] (Bradford), [[Asda]] (Leeds), [[Jet2.com]] (Leeds), [[Ronseal]] (Sheffield), [[Optare]] (Leeds), [[Aunt Bessie's]] (Hull), [[Birds Eye]] (Hull), [[Wharfedale (company)|Wharfedale]] (Leeds), [[Plaxton]] (Scarborough), [[Seven Seas (company)|Seven Seas]] (Hull), [[Little Chef]] (Sheffield), [[Plusnet]] (Sheffield), Quidco (Sheffield), [[Fenner plc]] (Hull), [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax Bank]] (Halifax), [[Rank Organisation]] (Hull), [[Yorkshire Bank]] (Leeds), [[William Jackson Food Group]] (Hull), [[Yorkshire Building Society]] (Bradford), [[Ebuyer]] (Howden), [[Good Hair Day|GHD]] (Leeds), [[Marks and Spencer]] (Leeds), [[Burton (clothing)|Burton]]s (Leeds), [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]] (Ilkley), [[Magnet Kitchens]] (Keighley), [[Reckitt and Sons]] (Hull), [[McCains]] (Scarborough), [[First Direct]] (Leeds), [[KCOM Group]] (Hull), [[Tetley's Brewery]] (Leeds), [[Timothy Taylor Brewery]] (Keighley), [[Bradford and Bingley]] (Bingley), [[Skipton Building Society]] (Skipton), [[Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate]], SGS Europe (Hull) and [[Provident Financial]] (Bradford).

==Education==
Yorkshire has a large base of primary and secondary schools operated by both local authorities and private bodies, and a dozen universities, along with a wide range of colleges and further education facilities. Four universities are based in Leeds, two in Sheffield, two in York, and one each in Bradford, Hull, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield (the last with branches in Barnsley and Oldham). The largest universities by enrolment are [[Sheffield Hallam University]] and the [[University of Leeds]], each with over 31,000 students, followed by [[Leeds Beckett University]], and the most recent to attain university status is the [[Leeds Arts University]]. There are also branches of institutions headquartered in other parts of England, such as the [[Open University]] and Britain's first for-profit university (since 2012), the [[University of Law]]. The tertiary sector is in active cooperation with industry, and a number of spin-off companies have been launched.

==Transport==
[[File:A1(M) and M62 interchange.jpg|thumb|left|The A1(M) and M62 junction at [[Ferrybridge]], West Yorkshire]]

Before the advent of rail transport, the seaports of Hull and Whitby played an important role in transporting goods. Historically canals were used, including the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], which is the longest canal in England. Mainland Europe (the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]) can be reached from Hull via regular ferry services from [[P&O Ferries]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boozecruise.com/ferry_port/hull.asp|publisher=BoozeCruise.com|title=Hull Ferry Port Information|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> Yorkshire also has [[air transport]] services from [[Leeds Bradford Airport]]. This airport has experienced significant and rapid growth in both terminal size and passenger facilities since 1996, when improvements began, until the present day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/uk/uk_leeds.html |publisher=Airports-Worldwide.com |title=Leeds Bradford International Airport |accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> South Yorkshire is served by [[Doncaster Sheffield Airport]], based in [[Finningley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robinhoodairport.com/page_history_of_the_airport_5.html |publisher=RobinHoodAirport.com |title=History of the Airport |accessdate=24 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723010136/http://www.robinhoodairport.com/page_history_of_the_airport_5.html |archive-date=23 July 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Sheffield City Airport]] opened in 1997 after years of Sheffield having no airport, due to a council decision in the 1960s not to develop one because of the city's good rail links with London and the development of airports in other nearby areas.  The newly opened airport never managed to compete with larger airports such as Leeds Bradford Airport and [[East Midlands Airport]] and attracted only a few scheduled flights, while the runway was too short to support [[low cost carriers]]. The opening of Doncaster Sheffield Airport effectively made the airport redundant and it officially closed in April 2008.

===Public transport statistics===

From 1290, Yorkshire was represented by two members of parliament of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of England]]. After the union with Scotland, two members represented the county in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] from 1707 to 1800 and of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 to 1832. In 1832 the county benefited from the disfranchisement of [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]] by taking an additional two members.<ref name="mps">{{cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/prereform.html |publisher=Election.

After the [[Reform Act 1832]], Yorkshire's political representation in parliament was drawn from its subdivisions, with members of parliament representing each of the three historic Ridings of Yorkshire; [[East Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Riding]], [[North Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Riding]], and [[West Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Riding]] constituencies.<ref name="mps" />

For the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865 general elections]] and onwards, the West Riding was further divided into [[Northern West Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Northern]], [[Eastern West Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastern]] and [[Southern West Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Southern]] parliamentary constituencies, though these only lasted until the major [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revision-notes.co.uk/revision/820.html|publisher=Revision-Notes.co.uk|title= 1885 Redistribution Act|accessdate=25 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082430/http://www.revision-notes.co.uk/revision/820.html |archive-date = 12 October 2007}}</ref> This act saw more localisation of government in the United Kingdom, with the introduction of 26 [[List of UK Parliamentary constituencies (1885-1918)|new parliamentary constituencies]] within Yorkshire, while the [[Local Government Act 1888]] introduced some reforms for the [[county borough]]s, of which there were eight in Yorkshire by the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1888/cukpga_18880041_en_1|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|title=Local Government Act 1888|accessdate=25 October 2007}}</ref>

===Distinctive identity and devolution campaigns===

A number of claims have been made for the distinctiveness of Yorkshire, as a geographical, cultural and political entity, and these have been used to demand increased political autonomy. In the early twentieth century, [[F. W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[Leeds University]], claimed Yorkshire was not settled by [[Angles]] or [[Saxons]] following the end of Roman rule in Britain, but by a different Germanic tribe, the [[Geats]]. As a consequence, he claimed, it is possible the first work of English literature, ''[[Beowulf]]'', believed to have been composed by Geats, was written in Yorkshire, and this distinctive ethnic and cultural origin is the root of the unique status of Yorkshire today.<ref name="moorman" /> One of Moorman's students at Leeds University, [[Herbert Read]], was greatly influenced by Moorman's ideas on Yorkshire identity, and claimed that until recent times Yorkshire was effectively an island, cut off from the rest of England by rivers, fens, moors and mountains. This distancing of Yorkshire from England led Read to question whether Yorkshire people were really English at all.<ref name="Pearson">{{cite news |first=Herbert |last=Read |title=Review of Frederic Richard Pearson, ''Yorkshire'' |newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement |date=31 January 1929 |page=79}}</ref> Combined with the suggested ethnic difference to the rest of England, Read quoted Frederic Pearson, who wrote:

{{quote|There is something characteristic about the very physiognomy of the Yorkshireman. He is much more of a Dane or a Viking than a Saxon. He is usually a big upstanding man, who looks as if he could take care of himself and those who depend upon him in an emergency. This is indeed the character that his neighbours give him; the southerner may think him a little hard: but if ever our country is let down by its inhabitants, we may be sure that it will not be the fault of Yorkshire.<ref name="Pearson"/>}}

During the premiership of [[William Pitt the Younger]] the hypothetical idea of Yorkshire becoming independent was raised in the British parliament in relation to the question whether Ireland should become part of the [[Acts of Union 1800|United Kingdom]]. This resulted in an anonymous pamphlet being published in London in 1799 arguing at length that Yorkshire could never be an independent state as it would always be reliant on the rest of the United Kingdom to provide it with essential resources.<ref>Anonymous pamphlet, Thoughts on national independence, suggested by Mr. Pitt's speeches on the Irish union by a member of the honourable society of Lincoln's Inn, (London: Printed Privately, 1799), pp.25–27</ref>

Although in the devolution debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the late 1960s, which paved the way for the 1979 referendums on the creation of a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, parallel devolution for Yorkshire was suggested, this was opposed by the [[Scottish National Party]] Member of Parliament for Hamilton, [[Winifred Ewing]]. Ewing argued that it was offensive to Scots to argue that an English region had the same status as an 'ancient nation' such as Scotland.<ref>Hansard Parliamentary Papers, HC Deb, 14 February 1969, vol. 777, cc1725-76</ref>

The relationship between Yorkshire and Scottish devolution was again made in 1975 by Richard Wainwright, MP for Colne Valley, who claimed in a speech in the House of Commons:

{{quote|The nationalist movement in Scotland is associated with flags, strange costumes, weird music and extravagant ceremonial. When... people go to Yorkshire and find that we have no time for dressing up, waving flags and playing strange instruments—in other words, we are not a lot of Presbyterians in Yorkshire—they should not assume that we do not have the same feelings underneath the skin. Independence in Yorkshire expresses itself in a markedly increasing determination to establish self-reliance.<ref>Hansard Parliamentary Papers, HC Deb, 18 December 1975, vol. 902, cc1832-52</ref>}}

In more recent years, in 1998 the Campaign for Yorkshire was established to push for the creation of a Yorkshire regional assembly,<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Hazell |title=The State and the Nations: The First Year of Devolution in the United Kingdom |location=London |publisher=Imprint Academic |date=2000 |page=118}}</ref> sometimes dubbed the Yorkshire Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where there's muck |newspaper=The Independent |date=18 March 1999 |page=3}}</ref> In its defining statement, the Campaign for Yorkshire made reference to the historical notions that Yorkshire had a distinctive identity:

{{quote|Yorkshire and the Humber has distinctive characteristics which make it an ideal test bed for further reform. It has a strong popular identity. The region follows closely the historic boundaries of the three Ridings, and there is no serious debate about boundaries. It possesses strong existing regional partnerships including universities, voluntary and church associations. All this makes it realistic to regard Yorkshire and the Humber as the standard bearer for representative regional government.<ref>Campaign for Yorkshire literature, quoted in Robert Hazell, ''The State and the Nations: The First Year of Devolution in the United Kingdom'' (London: Imprint Academic, 2000) p.140</ref>}}

The Campaign for Yorkshire was led by Jane Thomas as Director<ref>{{cite news |title=New Director for Campaign Group |newspaper=Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph |date=13 October 1999 |page=5}}</ref> and Paul Jagger as chairman. Jagger claimed in 1999 that Yorkshire had as much right to a regional parliament or assembly as Scotland and Wales because Yorkshire 'has as clear a sense of identity as Scotland or Wales.'<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Wainwright|title=Revolutionary Yorkshiremen edge towards devolution |newspaper=The Guardian |date=18 March 1999 |page=11}}</ref> One of those brought into the Campaign for Yorkshire by Jane Thomas was Herbert Read scholar [[Michael Paraskos]], who organised a series of events in 2000 to highlight the distinctiveness of Yorkshire culture. This included a major exhibition of Yorkshire artists.<ref name="martin">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Martin |title=Arts: Where There's Muck, There's Art |newspaper=The Independent |date=4 August 2000 |page=9}}</ref> Paraskos also founded a Yorkshire Studies degree course at [[Hull University]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Yound |title=Ee by gum! Yorkshire gets its own degree |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=8 March 2001}}</ref> Interviewed by ''The Guardian'' newspaper, Paraskos linked the start of this course to the contemporary devolution debates in Yorkshire, Scotland and Wales, claiming:

{{quote|If Yorkshire is arguing for a parliament, there needs to be a cultural argument as well, otherwise why not have a parliament of the north? There is a rediscovery of political and social culture going on in a very similar way to the early assertions of a Scottish identity.<ref>{{cite news|first=Joseph |last=Plomin|title=Hull launches degree in Yorkshire studies|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date= 8 March 2001}}</ref>}}

In March 2013, the Yorkshire Devolution Movement was founded as an active campaign group by Nigel Sollitt, who had administrated the social media group by that name since 2011, Gareth Shanks, a member of the social media group, and Stewart Arnold, former Chair of the Campaign for Yorkshire. In September 2013, the Executive Committee was joined by Richard Honnoraty and Richard Carter (as an advisor), who had also been involved in the Campaign for Yorkshire. The Movement campaigns for a directly elected parliament for the whole of the traditional county of Yorkshire with powers second to no other devolved administration in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dean |last=Kirby |title=Campaigners want to ditch George Osborne's Yorkshire devolution plans and create Northern Powerhouse |newspaper=The Independent |date=26 August 2015|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/campaigners-want-to-ditch-george-osbornes-yorkshire-devolution-plans-and-create-northern-powerhouse-10473615.html|accessdate=19 June 2019}}</ref><ref name="ydm-what">{{cite web |title=What we Want |url=https://yorkshiredevolution.co.uk/what-we-want.html |publisher=Yorkshire Devolution Movement |accessdate=19 June 2019}}</ref>

Two [[Combined authority|Combined Authorities]], which serve to devolve certain powers, have been established in Yorkshire, the [[West Yorkshire Combined Authority]], and the [[Sheffield City Region Combined Authority|Sheffield Combined Authority]], in [[South Yorkshire]]. A [[Mayor of the Sheffield City Region|mayoralty]] has been established in the Sheffield City Region, and [[2021 West Yorkshire mayoral election|elections]] for the [[Mayor of West Yorkshire]] are due to take place in [[2021 United Kingdom local elections|2021]]. An alternative proposal was also made for a cross-Yorkshire Authority, dubbed "One Yorkshire", which was supported by 18 of the 20 Yorkshire councils, with Sheffield and Rotherham both preferring the South Yorkshire alternative. The government rejected the devolution deal,<ref>{{cite news|date=12 February 2019|title=Government rejects Yorkshire devolution|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-47214592|accessdate=8 August 2020}}</ref> and alongside the two existing authorities, further proposals have been made in North Yorkshire<ref>{{cite web|last=Services|first=Web|title=York and North Yorkshire devolution|url=https://www.york.gov.uk/devolution|accessdate=8 August 2020|website=City of York Council}}</ref> and the East Riding,<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Angus|date=12 March 2020|title=Hull and East Riding council leaders back diluted devolution deal|url=https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/devolution-deal-hull-east-riding-3944912|accessdate=8 August 2020|work=Hull Daily Mail}}</ref> although some support for the whole Yorkshire deal has continued.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hopes remain for 'One Yorkshire' devolution deal in long-term|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/18109802.hopes-remain-one-yorkshire-devolution-deal-long-term/|accessdate=8 August 2020|work=The Northern Echo}}</ref>

In 2014, Richard Carter, Stewart Arnold and Richard Honnoraty, founded Yorkshire First, a political party campaigning for the creation of a Yorkshire parliament by 2050 based on the Scottish Parliament. It was later renamed the [[Yorkshire Party]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Grant |last=Woodward |title=The grass roots party putting Yorkshire first |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |date=6 July 2015}}</ref> A Social democratic party, it has parish, town, district and county councillors, and stood in 28 constituencies in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]]. Yorkshire Party candidates have also ran for the position of [[Directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly-elected mayors]] in [[Mayor of Doncaster|Doncaster in 2017]] (receiving 3,235 votes, 5.04%) and the Sheffield City Region in [[2018 Sheffield City Region mayoral election|2018]] (receiving 22,318 votes, 8.6).

===Monarchy and peerage===
{{Main|Kings of Jórvík|Earl of York|Duke of York|House of York}}
[[File:TheSingleWhiteRose.jpg|thumb|The [[White Rose of York]] remains as the prime symbol of Yorkshire identity]]

When the territory of Yorkshire began to take shape as a result of the invasion of the Danish [[viking]]s, they instituted a monarchy based at the settlement of Jórvík, York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/york/rulers_of_jorvik.html|publisher=Viking.no|title=The Rulers of Jorvik (York)|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The reign of the Viking kings came to an end with the last king [[Eric Bloodaxe]] dying in battle in 954 after the invasion and conquest by the [[Kingdom of England]] from the south. Jórvík was the last of the independent kingdoms to be taken to form part of the Kingdom of England and thus the local monarchal title became defunct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/york/jorvik_who_ruled_it_and_when.html|publisher=Viking.no|title=Jorvik – who Ruled it and When?|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref>

Though the monarchal title became defunct, it was succeeded by the creation of the Earl of York title of nobility<ref name="northeasthiss">{{cite web|url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/page24.htm|publisher=NorthEastEngland.talktalk.net|title=Timeline of North East History|accessdate=24 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029173256/http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/page24.htm|archive-date=29 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> by king of England [[Edgar the Peaceful]] in 960. (The [[earl]]dom covered the general area of Yorkshire and is sometimes referred to as the ''Earl of Yorkshire''.)<ref name="northeasthiss"/> The title passed through the hands of various nobles, decided upon by the king of England. The last man to hold the title was [[William le Gros, 1st Earl of Albemarle|William le Gros]], however the earldom was abolished by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] as a result of a troubled period known as ''[[The Anarchy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/files_ccc/03miHistoryInt2.pdf|publisher=SQA.org.uk|title=Murder in the Cathedral: Crown, Church and People 1154–1173|accessdate=24 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527221320/http://www.sqa.org.uk/files_ccc/03miHistoryInt2.pdf|archive-date=27 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The peerage was recreated by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1385, this time in the form of the prestigious title of Duke of York which he gave to his son [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund of Langley]]. Edmund founded the House of York; later the title was merged with that of the [[King of England]]. Much of the modern-day symbolism of Yorkshire, such as the [[White Rose of York]], is derived from the Yorkists,<ref name="whiterosehistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkshirehistory.com/yorkshirerose.htm|publisher=YorkshireHistory.com|title=The White Rose of Yorkshire|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> giving the house a special affinity within the [[culture of Yorkshire]]. Especially celebrated is the Yorkist king [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] who spent much of his life at [[Middleham Castle]] in Yorkshire.<ref name="middleham" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardiiiyorkshire.co.uk/|publisher=Richard III Society – Yorkshire Branch|title=Why a Yorkshire Branch Site?|accessdate=24 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124043401/http://www.richardiiiyorkshire.co.uk/|archive-date=24 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since that time the title has passed through the hands of many, being merged with the crown and then recreated several times. The title of Duke of York is given to the second son of the [[British monarch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukdukes.co.uk/the_dukes/the_duke_of_york/|publisher=UKDukes.co.uk|title=The Dukes of the Peerage of the United Kingdom: Duke of York|accessdate=24 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319081521/http://www.ukdukes.co.uk/the_dukes/the_duke_of_york/|archive-date=19 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Notes==
: {{note label|wars|a|a}} Though the [[Wars of the Roses]] were fought between royal houses bearing the names of York and Lancaster, the wars took place over a wide area of England. They were a dynastic clash between cadet branches of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The most prominent family in Yorkshire, below the monarchy, the Nevilles of [[Sheriff Hutton]] and [[Middleham]], fought for the Yorkists, as did the Scropes of [[Bolton, East Riding of Yorkshire|Bolton]], the Latimers of [[Danby, North Yorkshire|Danby]] and [[Snape, North Yorkshire|Snape]], as well as the Mowbrays of [[Thirsk]] and [[Burton in Lonsdale]]. Yet some fought for the Lancastrians, such as the Percies, the Cliffords of [[Skipton]], Ros of [[Helmsley]], Greystock of Henderskelfe, Stafford of [[Holderness]], and Talbot of [[Sheffield]].
