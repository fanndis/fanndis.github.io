Her success with ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' allowed Type A Films to expand and get more recognition in the industry. Before Jennifer Simpson became its president in 2002, she was the head of development and production for [[Barry Mendel]] Productions where she worked on films, such as ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goodridge |first1=Mike |title=Witherspoon hires Simpson at Type A |url=https://www.screendaily.com/witherspoon-hires-simpson-at-type-a/409685.article |website=[[Screen International]] |accessdate=February 27, 2020 |language=en |date=June 20, 2002}}</ref>
