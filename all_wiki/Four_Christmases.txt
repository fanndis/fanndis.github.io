==Plot==
Brad ([[Vince Vaughn]]) and Kate ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) are an upscale [[San Francisco]] couple. Both come from dysfunctional families, with divorced parents and obnoxious siblings with out-of-control kids, so they disdain the idea of getting married or having kids.  They try to avoid their families at Christmas by traveling abroad and pretending to be going there to do charity work. The third Christmas of their relationship, they plan to go to [[Fiji]], but get trapped at [[San Francisco International Airport]] by a fog bank that cancels every outbound flight; they're also interviewed by a news crew, alerting their families that they're stuck at home for the holidays.

Kate and Brad realize they can't get out of visiting their families: Brad's father ([[Robert Duvall]]) first, then Kate's mother ([[Mary Steenburgen]]), then Brad's mother ([[Sissy Spacek]]), and finally, Kate's father ([[Jon Voight]]): four Christmases in one day. Bracing themselves for a marathon of homecomings, Brad and Kate expect the worst, but are still unable to prepare themselves quite enough. They keep discovering new secrets about each other they had previously been too embarrassed to share with each other, such as Brad's real name being "Orlando" and Kate's fear of inflatable castles that stemmed from being ostracized as a child, and these things strain their relationship. As Brad counts down the minutes to freedom, Kate studies the lives of Brad's and her own siblings and comes to realize that she ''does'' want marriage and children with Brad, the prospect of which frightens Brad when she mentions it to him. When they finally reach Kate's father's house, she asks Brad to let her go in alone; she gets out of the car and tells her family that she and Brad have split up. Meanwhile, Brad returns to his father's house and the two have a quiet talk alone, and Brad realizes that he wants marriage and children, and with Kate—he loves her too much to leave her. He returns to her and they discuss marriage and children. Then they finally head to Fiji.

On New Year's Day a year later, Brad and Kate welcome their first child, a daughter, after spending nine months hiding from their families. As theirs is the first baby born in the New Year, a news crew comes to congratulate them—once again revealing them, and their new baby, to the whole city... and their families.

The film began production in December 2007, during the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], which meant that no changes could be made to the script.<ref name="lat"/>  During production, [[New Line Cinema]] became a "unit of [[Warner Bros.]]",<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSWNAS301020080228 "New Line Cinema to become unit of Warner Bros"].

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 24% based on 144 reviews, and an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Despite a strong cast, this sour holiday comedy suffers from a hackneyed script."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/four_christmases/ | title=Four Christmases (2008) | publisher= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate= 2008-11-30}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating to reviews, the film has a score of 41 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/fourchristmases | title=Four Christmases Reviews | publisher= [[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2008-11-30}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Find CinemaScore|format=Type "Four Christmases" in the search box|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=October 10, 2018}}</ref>

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "one of the most joyless Christmas movies ever" with "an unearned feel-good ending [that] adds insult to injury"; it criticized the film's script for "situat[ing] Hollywood [[cliché]]s about [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern]] [[redneck]]s incongruously within the tony [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=11985 |title=Bottom Line: A top-drawer cast in a bottom-drawer screenplay |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202183839/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}</ref>  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine called it an "oddly misanthropic, occasionally amusing but thoroughly cheerless holiday attraction that is in no way a family film".<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939094.html Review of ''Four Christmases''] from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine</ref>  The [[Associated Press]] said the film "began with some promise" then segued into "noisy joylessness [that] sets the tone for the whole movie"; the review noted that "Vaughn makes the movie tolerable here and there, but this kind of slapsticky [[physical comedy]] doesn't suit Witherspoon at all."<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Movie-review-Four-Christmases-zero-fun-3183975.php Review: ''Four Christmases'' is zero fun], an [[Associated Press]] review via the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''</ref> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' found "no core to their characters.
