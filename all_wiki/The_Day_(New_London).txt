==History==
[[File:Picturesque New London and its environs - Grofton, Mystic, Montville, Waterford, at the commencement of the twentieth century (1901) (14581144987).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Day Building (Former home of ''The Day'') Bank St. 1901]]

''The Day'' was founded in July 1881 as a mouthpiece of the local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in an era when many American newspapers served political parties.  It was owned by a wealthy mercantile family in New London.  In 1889, the original publisher, Maj. John A. Tibbits, left the paper to take a government post in England.  The paper struggled for a few years until the family convinced Theodore Bodenwein to purchase the paper.  He purchased it in 1891, agreeing to change his political affiliation to Republican in order to secure a loan to purchase the paper.  He remained the publisher until his death in 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/picturesquenew00newl/picturesquenew00newl#page/77/mode/1up|title=Picturesque New London and its environs : Groton, Mystic, Montville, Waterford, at the commencement of the twentieth century|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-05-02}}</ref> 

Pat Richardson served as publisher from 2018 until her departure less than a year later in early 2019. She was succeeded by Tim Dwyer, who previously was executive editor. In addition to ''The Day'', The Day Publishing Co. runs several weekly newspapers mostly along the shoreline in southern Connecticut.

The paper endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate Senator [[Barack Obama]] for President of the United States in the 2008 election cycle, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Ever since the death of Theodore Bodenwein, whose tenure started in 1888, ''The Day'' has been held in public trust, and is still independent. The Day Trust devotes its attention to operating the newspaper and supporting a charitable foundation, the Bodenwein Public Benevolent Foundation. This arrangement ensures that the newspaper will remain independent and locally owned and that profits from the newspaper will be distributed to non-profit organizations within ''The Day'''s primary circulation area.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/20/nyregion/new-london-s-feisty-newspaper-the-day.html |first=Andi |last=Rierden |title=New London's Feisty Newspaper, The Day |date=December 20, 1998 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>
