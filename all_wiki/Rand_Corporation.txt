RAND aims for interdisciplinary and quantitative problem solving by translating [[theory|theoretical]] concepts from formal [[economics]] and the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]] into novel applications in other areas, using [[applied science]] and [[operations research]].

==Overview==

RAND has approximately 1,850 employees. Its American locations include: [[Santa Monica, California]] (headquarters); [[Arlington, Virginia]]; [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]; and [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=RANDloc-usa>{{cite web|title=RAND Locations|url=https://www.rand.org/about/locations.html|website=RAND Corp|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref> The RAND Gulf States Policy Institute has an office in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].

RAND is home to the [[Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School]], one of eight original graduate programs in [[public policy]] and the first to offer a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. The program aims to provide practical experience for its students, who work with RAND analysts on real-world problems. The campus is at RAND's Santa Monica research facility. The Pardee RAND School is the world's largest PhD-granting program in policy analysis.<ref name=PardeeRAND>{{cite web|title=Pardee RAND History|url=http://www.prgs.edu/about/at-a-glance.html|website=Pardee RAND Graduate School|accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref> Unlike many other universities, all Pardee RAND Graduate School students receive fellowships to cover their education costs. This allows them to dedicate their time to engage in research projects and provides them on-the-job training.<ref name=PardeeRAND/> RAND also offers a number of internship and fellowship programs allowing students and outsiders to assist in conducting research for RAND projects. Most of these projects are short-term and are worked on independently with the mentoring of a RAND staff member.<ref name=RANDglance>{{cite web|title=RAND at a Glance|url=https://www.rand.org/about/glance.html|website=RAND Corp|accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

RAND publishes the ''[[RAND Journal of Economics]]'', a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal of economics.

Thirty-two recipients of the [[Nobel Prize]], primarily in the fields of economics and physics, have been associated with RAND at some point in their career.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sarabi|first1=Brigette|title=Oregon: The Rand Report on Measure 11 is Finally Available|url=http://www.safetyandjustice.org/story/oregon-rand-report-measure-11-finally-available|website=Partnership for Safety and Justice (PSJ)|accessdate=15 April 2008|date=1 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=[[Harvard University]] Institute of Politics | url=http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/iop/students_internships_db.php?action=id&id=551 | title=Guide for Political Internships | publisher=Harvard University | accessdate=18 April 2008}}</ref>

==History==
===Project RAND===
RAND was created after individuals in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], and industry  began to discuss the need for a private organization to connect [[operational research]] with [[research and development]] decisions.<ref name=RANDglance/> On 1 October 1945, Project RAND was set up under special contract to the Douglas Aircraft Company and began operations in December 1945.<ref name=RANDglance/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson|first1=Stephen B |title=The United States Air Force and the Culture of Innovation 1945-1965 |date=2002|publisher=Diane Publishing |isbn=9781428990272 |page=32 |url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100526-019.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> In May 1946, the ''[[Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship]]'' was released.

===RAND Corp===
By late 1947, Douglas had expressed their concerns that their close relationship with RAND might create [[conflict of interest]] problems on future hardware contracts. In February 1948, the chief of staff of the newly created United States Air Force approved the evolution of Project RAND into a nonprofit corporation, independent of Douglas.<ref name=RANDglance/>

On 14 May 1948, RAND was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of the State of California and on 1 November 1948, the Project RAND contract was formally transferred from the Douglas to the RAND Corporation.<ref name=RANDglance/> Initial capital for the spin-off was provided by the [[Ford Foundation]].

Since the 1950s, RAND research has helped inform United States policy decisions on a wide variety of issues, including the space race, the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms confrontation, the creation of the [[Great Society]] social welfare programs, the digital revolution, and national health care.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jardini|first=David R. |title=Thinking Through the Cold War: RAND, National Security and Domestic Policy, 1945-1975|year=2013|page=10|url=https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/352765}}</ref> Its most visible contribution may be the doctrine of [[nuclear deterrence]] by [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD), developed under the guidance of then-Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] and based upon their work with [[game theory]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Twing|first=Steven W.|title=Myths, models & U.S. foreign policy|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1998|isbn=1-55587-766-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wS4A2jJph_cC&pg=PA163}}</ref> Chief strategist [[Herman Kahn]] also posited the idea of a "winnable" nuclear exchange in his 1960 book ''[[On Thermonuclear War]]''. This led to Kahn being one of the models for the titular character of the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove]]'', in which RAND is spoofed as the "BLAND Corporation".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-week-in-radio-the-think-tank-for-unthinkable-thoughts-765975.html |title=The Week In Radio: The think tank for unthinkable thoughts |last=Hanks |first=Robert |date=19 December 2007 |work=The Independent |location= London |accessdate=24 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/movies/10kapl.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1 |title=Truth Stranger Than 'Strangelove' |last=Kaplan |first=Fred |authorlink=Fred Kaplan (journalist) |date=10 October 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=24 June 2009}}</ref>

==Mission==
RAND was incorporated as a non-profit organization to "further promote scientific, educational, and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare and security of the United States of America". Its self-declared mission is "to help improve policy and decision making through research and analysis", using its "core values of quality and objectivity".<ref name=RANDvision>{{cite web|title=About RAND - Vision|url=https://www.rand.org/about/vision.html|website=RAND|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>

==Achievements==
[[Image:RANDPittsburgh.jpg|thumb|left|RAND Corporation, [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]]]
The achievements of RAND stem from its development of [[systems analysis]]. Important contributions are claimed in space systems and the United States' [[space program]],<ref name=RANDspacebook>{{cite book |last1=Davies|first1=Merton E.|last2=Hams|first2=William R.|title=RAND's Role in the Evolution of Balloon and Satellite Observation Systems and Related U.S. Space Technology|date=September 1988|publisher=RAND Corp|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a216963.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> in computing and in [[artificial intelligence]].

Current areas of expertise include: child policy, [[civil justice|civil]] and [[criminal justice]], education, health, international policy, [[labor market]]s, national security, infrastructure, energy, environment, corporate governance, economic development, intelligence policy, long-range planning, crisis management and disaster preparation, [[World population|population]] and [[regional studies]], science and technology, [[social welfare]], terrorism, arts policy, and transportation.<ref name=RANDpolicyexperts>{{cite web|title=Policy Experts|url=https://www.rand.org/about/people.html|website=RAND Corp|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>

RAND designed and conducted one of the largest and most important studies of health insurance between 1974 and 1982. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]], funded by the then–U.S. [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], established an insurance corporation to compare demand for health services with their cost to the patient.<ref name=RANDhie>{{cite web |title=RAND's Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)|url=https://www.rand.org/health/projects/hie.html|website=RAND Corp|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Herdman|first1=Roger C.|last2=Behney|first2=Clyde J.|title=Chapter 3: The Lessons and Limitations of the Rand Health Insurance Experiment |journal=Benefit Design in Health Care Reform: Patient Cost-Sharing|date=September 1993|issue=[[Princeton University]]|pages=23–38|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk1/1993/9310/9310.PDF |accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>

According to the 2005 annual report, "about one-half of RAND's research involves national security issues". Many of the events in which RAND plays a part are based on assumptions which are hard to verify because of the lack of detail on RAND's highly classified work for defense and intelligence agencies. The RAND Corporation posts all of its unclassified reports in full on its website.{{cn|date=September 2020}}
