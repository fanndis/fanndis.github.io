It was rediscovered by [[Keith Stroup]], founder of [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]], who circulated prints of the film around college film festivals in the 1970s. The company who produced the prints, [[New Line Cinema]], was so successful they began producing their own films.<ref name="viral before internet" /> The most controversial was perhaps a clip from a newscast from Portland, Oregon in November 1970.

== Qualification ==

There are several ways to gauge whether a video has "gone viral". The statistic perhaps most mentioned is number of views, and as sharing has become easier, the threshold requirement of sheer number of views has increased. YouTube personality [[Kevin Nalty]] (known as Nalts) recalls on his blog: "A few years ago, a video could be considered 'viral' if it hit a million views", but says as of 2011, only "if it gets more than 5 million views in a 3–7-day period" can it be considered "viral".<ref name="Megan">O'Neill, Megan (9 May 2011). "[http://socialtimes.com/what-makes-a-video-viral_b61409 What Makes A Video 'Viral'?]" AdWeek. Retrieved 20 December 2013.</ref><ref name="Nalts">Nalts (pseudonym) (6 May 2011). "[http://willvideoforfood.com/2011/05/06/how-many-views-do-you-need-to-be-viral/ How many views do you need to be viral?]" Will Video for Food (blog). Retrieved 28 December 2015.</ref> To compare, 2004's ''[[Numa Numa (video)|Numa Numa]]'' received two million hits on Newgrounds in its first three months (a figure explained in a 2015 article as "a staggering number for the time").<ref name="here's how" />

Nalts also posits three other considerations: buzz, parody, and longevity,<ref name="Megan" /> which are more complex ways of judging a viral video's views. Buzz addresses the heart of the issue; the more a video is shared, the more discussion the video creates both online and offline. What he emphasizes is notable is that the more buzz a video gets, the more views it gets. A study on viral videos by Carnegie Mellon University found that the popularity of the uploader affected whether a video would become viral,<ref name="CMU">{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/cmuviralvideos/characteristics|title=Characteristics – CMU Viral Videos|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref> and having the video shared by a popular source such as a celebrity or a news channel also increases buzz.<ref name="Megan" /> It is also part of the algorithm YouTube uses to predict popular videos.<ref name="trending tab">Southern, Matt (10 December 2015). "[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/youtube-introduces-a-trending-tab-surfacing-viral-videos-in-real-time/146747/ YouTube Introduces a 'Trending' Tab, Surfacing Viral Videos in Real Time]". Search Engine Journal. Retrieved 27 December 2015.</ref> Parodies, spoofs and spin-offs often indicate a popular video, with long-popular video view counts given with original video view counts as well as additional view counts given for the parodies. Longevity indicates if a video has remained part of the [[Zeitgeist]].

== Reasons for popularity ==
Due to their societal impact and marketability, viral videos attract attention in both advertising and academia, which try to account for the reason viral videos are spread and what will make a video go viral. Several theories exist.

A viral video's longevity often relies on a [[Hook (filmmaking)|hook]] which draws the audience to watch it. The hook is able to become a part of the viral video culture after being shown repeatedly. The hooks, or key signifiers, are not able to be predicted before the videos become viral.<ref>Burgess, Jean (2008).[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/18431/1/18431.pdf 'All Your Chocolate Rain Are Belong to Us?'

Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, pp. 101–109.</ref> The early view pattern of a viral video can be used to forecast its peak day in future.<ref name=jiangicmr2014/> Notable examples include "[[All your base are belong to us]]", based on the poorly translated video game ''Zero Wing'', which was first distributed in 2000 as a [[GIF]] animation and became popular for the grammatically incorrect hook of its title, and Don Hertzfeldt's 2000 Academy Awards Best Animated Short Film nomination "Rejected" with the quotable hooks "I am a banana" and "My spoon is too big!"<ref name="10 videos">Moreau, Elise (30 October 2014).

Retrieved 28 December 2015.</ref> Another early video was the Flash animation "The End of the World", created by Jason Windsor and uploaded to Albino Blacksheep in 2003, with quotable hooks such as "but I'm le tired" and "WTF, mates?"<ref name="10 videos" /><ref>Peters, Lucia.

Bustle. Retrieved 28 December 2015.</ref>

Rosanna Guadagno, a social psychologist at the University of Texas at Dallas, found in a study that people preferred to share a funny video rather than one of a man treating his own spider bite, and overall they were more likely to share any video that evoked an intense emotional response.<ref name="why">Kitroeff, Natalie (19 May 2014). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/science/why-that-video-went-viral.html Why That Video Went Viral]". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 27 December 2015.</ref> Two professors at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania also found that uplifting stories were more likely to be shared on the New York Times' web site than disheartening ones.<ref name="why" />

Others postulate that sharing is driven by ego in order to build up an online persona for oneself. Chartbeat, a company that measures online traffic, compiled data comparing the amount of time spent reading an article and the number of times it was shared and found that people often post articles on Twitter they haven't even read.<ref name="why" />

== Political implications ==
The [[2008 United States presidential election]] showcased the impact of political viral videos. For the first time, YouTube hosted the [[CNN-YouTube presidential debates]], calling on YouTube users to pose questions. In this debate, the opinions of viral video creators and users were taken seriously. There were several memorable viral videos that appeared during the campaign. In June 2007, "[[I Got a Crush... on Obama]]", a music video featuring a girl claiming to have a crush on presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]], appeared. Unlike previously popular political videos, it did not feature any celebrities and was purely [[user-generated content|user-generated]]. The video garnered many viewers and gained attention in the mainstream media.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/us/politics/15obama.html?_r=1&ex=1190260800&en=3b68401305c074fe&ei=5070|title= A Hit Shows Big Interest in Racy Material – and Obama|first=Katharine|last=Seelye|date=15 June 2007|accessdate=20 October 2009|work=The New York Times |format=Web}}</ref>

YouTube became a powerful source of campaigning for the 2008 Presidential Election. Every major party candidate had their own YouTube channel in order to communicate with the voters, with John McCain posting over 300 videos and Barack Obama posting over 1,800 videos. The music video "Yes We Can" by will.i.am demonstrates user-generated publicity for the 2008 Presidential Campaign.  The video depicts many celebrities as well as black and white clips of Barack Obama. This music video inspired many parodies and won an Emmy for Best New Approaches in Daytime Entertainment.<ref>Wallsten, Kevin (2010).

The proliferation of viral videos in the 2008 campaign highlights the fact that people increasingly turn to the internet to receive their news. In a study for the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2008, approximately 2% of the participants said that they received their news from non-traditional sources such as MySpace or YouTube.<ref>{{cite news| last=Kohut |first=Andrew |url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/689/the-internets-broader-role-in-campaign-2008|title= The Internet's Broader Role in Campaign 2008|date=11 January 2008|accessdate=25 November 2009|publisher=Pew Research Center|format=Web}}</ref> The campaign was widely seen as an example of the growing influence of the internet on United States politics, a point further evidenced by the founding of viral video producers like [[Brave New Films]].<ref name="nyt">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/us/politics/29opposition.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogint&oref=slogin |work=The New York Times| last=Rutenberg | first=Jim | date=29 June 2008 | accessdate=2008-10-25 | title=Political Freelancers Use Web to Join the Attack}}</ref>

During the [[2012 United States presidential election]], "Obama Style" and "[[Mitt Romney]] Style", the parodies of [[Gangnam Style]], both peaked on Election Day and received approximately 30&nbsp;million views within one month before [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].<ref name=jiangicmr2014/> "Mitt Romney Style", which negatively portrays Mitt as an affluent, extravagant, and arrogant businessman, received an order of magnitude views more than "Obama Style".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Financial implications ==
The [[web traffic]] gained by viral videos allows for advertising revenue. The YouTube website is monetized by selling and showing advertising. According to the ''New York Times'', YouTube uses an algorithm called "reference rank" to evaluate the viral potential of videos posted to the site. Using evidence from as few as 10,000 views, it can assess the probability that the video will go viral. If it deems the video a viable candidate for advertising, it contacts the original poster by e-mail and offers a profit-sharing contract. By this means, such videos as "[[David After Dentist]]" have earned more than $100,000 for their owners.<ref name=NYTMiller>{{cite news|last=Cain Miller|first=Claire|title=Cashing in on Your Hit YouTube Video|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/technology/personaltech/cashing-in-on-your-hit-youtube-video.html?ref=technology|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 October 2011}}</ref> One successful YouTube video creator, Andrew Grantham, whose "Ultimate Dog Tease" had been viewed more than 170,000,000 times (as of June 2015), entered an agreement with Paramount Pictures in February 2012 for the development of a feature film. The film was to be written by Alec Berg and David Mandel.<ref>McNary, Dave (13 February 2012).

''Variety''. Retrieved 21 November 2012.</ref> Pop stars such as [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Esmée Denters]] also started their careers via YouTube videos which ultimately went viral. By 2014, pop stars such as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Eminem]], and [[Katy Perry]] were regularly obtaining web traffic in the order of 120 to 150&nbsp;million hits a month, numbers far in excess of what many viral videos receive.

Companies also use viral videos as a type of marketing strategy. The Dove Campaign for Real Beauty is considered to have been one of the first viral marketing strategies to hit the world when Dove released their ''Evolution'' video in 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|title = How Dove Tried To Change The Conversation About Female Beauty| last=Bahadur |first=Nina |date=21 January 2014 |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/21/dove-real-beauty-campaign-turns-10_n_4575940.html|newspaper =HuffPost|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}
