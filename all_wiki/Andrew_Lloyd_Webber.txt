==Early life==
[[File:Royal College of Music - April 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Lloyd Webber studied at the [[Royal College of Music]] in London. In 2014 he was honoured for his "contribution to musical life" with an honorary doctorate from the college.<ref>{{cite news |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber honoured by Royal College of Music |url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/andrew-lloyd-webber-honoured-royal-college-music/ |access-date=29 June 2019 |work=The stage}}</ref>]]
Andrew Lloyd Webber was born in [[Kensington]], London, the elder son of [[William Lloyd Webber]] (1914–1982), a composer and organist, and Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921–1993), a violinist and pianist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3633292/Family-detective.html |title=Family detective |first=Nick |last=Barratt |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date= 7 July 2007}}</ref> His younger brother, [[Julian Lloyd Webber]], is a world-renowned solo cellist.<ref>{{cite web |last=Barnett |first=Laura |title=Julian Lloyd Webber, cellist – portrait of the artist |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jan/08/julian-lloyd-webber-cellist-portrait-artist |work=The Guardian |date=8 January 2014 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref>

Lloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age, a [[suite (music)|suite]] of six pieces at the age of nine.<ref>Otis L. Guernsey, Jeffrey Sweet (1995). ''The Best Plays of 1994-1995''. p. 109. Limelight Editions</ref> He also put on "productions" with Julian and his Aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola's suggestion). His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre. His father enrolled him as a part-time student at the [[Eric Gilder|Eric Gilder School of Music]] in the spring of 1963.<ref>Lloyd Webber, Andrew (2018).

London: Harper Collins.</ref> At this time he was working on a [[Genghis Khan]] musical called ''Westonia!'', and he had also set music to ''[[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]]''.

In 1965, Lloyd Webber was a [[Queen's Scholar]] at [[Westminster School]] and studied history for a term at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], although he abandoned the course in the winter of 1965 to study at the [[Royal College of Music]] and pursue his interest in [[musical theatre]].<ref>Katie Marsico (2010).

==Professional career==

===Early years===
In 1965, when Lloyd Webber was a 17-year-old budding musical-theatre composer, he was introduced to the 20-year-old aspiring pop-song<!--please do not join the words "song" and "writer"; "aspiring pop-song writer" is correct as is and joining the the words "song" and "writer" here is incorrect and inaccurate--> writer [[Tim Rice]].<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/> Their first collaboration was ''[[The Likes of Us]]'', a musical based on the true story of [[Thomas John Barnardo]]. They produced a demo tape of that work in 1966,<ref name=chandler>{{cite journal |last=Chandler |first=David |title='Everyone should have the opportunity': Alan Doggett and the modern British musical |journal=Studies in Musical Theatre |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=275–289 |date=2012 |doi=10.1386/smt.6.3.275_1}}</ref> but the project failed to gain a backer.<ref name=ellis>Ellis, Samantha. [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/sep/24/theatre "Joseph, London, February 1973"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 24 September 2003.</ref>

Although composed in 1965, ''The Likes of Us'' was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]]. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called "Kidz R Us". Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.

In the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on ''The Likes of Us'' and who was the music teacher at the [[Colet Court]] school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir.<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g-DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA564|title=The Oxford Handbook of the British Musical|first1=Robert|last1=Gordon|first2=Olaf|last2=Jubin|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199988754}}</ref> Doggett requested a "pop cantata" along the lines of [[Herbert Chappell]]'s ''The Daniel Jazz'' (1963) and [[Michael Hurd (composer)|Michael Hurd]]'s ''Jonah-Man Jazz'' (1966), both of which had been published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] and were based on the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=chandler/> The request for the new piece came with a 100-[[guinea (coin)|guinea]] advance from Novello.<ref name=chandler/> This resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]. ''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Bradley |url=http://www.springfieldcontemporarytheatre.org/blog/andrew-lloyd-webber-and-jesus-christ-superstar |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber and "Jesus Christ Superstar" |work=Springfield Contemporary Theatre |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>

In 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called "Try It and See", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became "King Herod's Song" in their third musical, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970). The planned follow-up to ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' was a musical comedy based on the [[Jeeves and Wooster]] novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.<ref>(Rice, 1999)</ref> Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical ''Jeeves'' with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], who provided the book and lyrics.<ref>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works – Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997). p. 82, Abrams: New York</ref> ''Jeeves'' failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |title=By Jeeves - Review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/21/by-jeeves-review |accessdate=29 June 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (1996).

===Mid-1970s===
[[File:Evita at the Adelphi.jpg|thumb|''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' at the West End's [[Adelphi Theatre]]. Lloyd Webber purchased the theatre in 1993. The 1998 video of Lloyd Webber's ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' was filmed at the venue.]]
Lloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' (1978 in London/1979 in U.S.), a musical based on the life of [[Eva Perón]]. As with ''Jesus Christ Superstar'', Evita was released first as a concept album (1976) and featured [[Julie Covington]] singing the part of Eva Perón. The song "[[Don't Cry for Me Argentina]]" became a hit single and the musical was staged at the West End's [[Prince Edward Theatre]] in a production directed by [[Harold Prince]] and starring [[Elaine Paige]] in the title role.<ref>Qiao, Michelle.

[[Patti LuPone]] created the role of Eva on Broadway for which she won a Tony.  ''Evita'' was a highly successful show that ran for ten years in the West End. It transferred to Broadway in 1979. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after ''Evita'', although they have sporadically worked together in the years that followed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Propst |first1=Andy |title=The 100 Most Important People in Musical Theatre |date=2019 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=155}}</ref>

In 1978, Lloyd Webber embarked on a solo project, the ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'', with his cellist brother [[Julian Lloyd Webber|Julian]] based on the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|24th Caprice by Paganini]], which reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom. The main theme was used as the theme tune for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s long-running ''[[South Bank Show]]'' throughout its 32-year run. The same year, Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long-running documentary series ''[[Whicker's World]]'', which was used from 1978 to 1980.

===1980s===
Lloyd Webber was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in November 1980 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] in the foyer of [[Thames Television]]'s Euston Road Studios in London.<ref>Michael Coveney (1999). ''Cats on a Chandelier: The Andrew Lloyd Webber Story''. p. 89. Hutchinson</ref> He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised him at the West End's [[Adelphi Theatre]].
[[File:Palladium Theatre (16427934069).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' at the [[London Palladium]]]]
Lloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]]. ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' (1981) was to become the longest running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years before closing. On Broadway, ''Cats'' ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, ''The Phantom of the Opera''.<ref>{{ibdb title|4186|Cats}}</ref><ref name=BroadwayLength>{{ibdb title|4491|The Phantom of the Opera}}</ref> Elaine Paige collaborated again with Lloyd Webber, originating the role of [[Grizabella]] in ''Cats'', and had a Top&nbsp;10 UK hit with "[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Elaine Paige – Full Official Chart History|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17213/elaine-paige/|website=Official Charts Company|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>

''[[Starlight Express]]'' (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics. It ran for 7,409 performances in London, making it the [[List of the longest-running West End shows|ninth longest-running West End show]]. It ran for less than two years on Broadway. The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009. The show also runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in [[Bochum]], Germany, where it has been running since 1988.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2016/international-how-lloyd-webbers-starlight-express-keeps-on-track-in-germany/|title=International: How Lloyd Webber's Starlight Express keeps on track in Germany {{!}} Features {{!}} The Stage|date=19 May 2016|work=The Stage|access-date=3 July 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Lloyd Webber wrote a [[Requiem Mass]] dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had been a part of the composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual [[Sydmonton Festival]].<ref>Snelson, 2004</ref> Lloyd Webber received a [[Grammy Award]] in 1986 for ''Requiem'' in the category of best classical composition. ''[[Pie Jesu]]'' from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.

Lloyd Webber also premiered ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in the West End in 1986, inspired by the [[The Phantom of the Opera|1911 Gaston Leroux novel]]. He wrote the part of Christine for his then-wife, [[Sarah Brightman]], who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside [[Michael Crawford]] as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed ''Evita.'' [[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]] wrote the lyrics for ''Phantom'' with some additional material provided by [[Richard Stilgoe]], with whom Lloyd Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in both the West End and on Broadway; in January 2006 it overtook Lloyd Webber's ''Cats'' as the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|longest running show on Broadway]].

''[[Aspects of Love]]'' followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by [[David Garnett]]. The lyrics were by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn. ''Aspects'' had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway. It has since gone on a tour of the UK. It is famous for the song "[[Love Changes Everything (song)|Love Changes Everything]]", which was performed by [[Michael Ball]] in both the West End and Broadway casts. It stayed in the UK singles chart for 14 weeks, peaking at number 2 and becoming Ball's signature tune.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/michael%20ball/ |title=Michael Ball &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>

===1990s===
Lloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Olympics]] and composed "[[Amigos Para Siempre]]&nbsp;— Friends for Life" with Don Black providing the lyrics. This song was performed by [[Sarah Brightman]] and [[José Carreras]].

Lloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on [[Billy Wilder]]'s critically acclaimed movie, ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', since the early 1970s when he saw the film, but the project didn't come to fruition until after the completion of ''Aspects of Love'' when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from [[Paramount Pictures]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Lloyd Webber, Andrew: ''Inspired By Sunset Boulevard'' Really Useful Group |url=http://reallyuseful.com/rug/shows/sunset/show.htm |accessdate=11 June 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918101137/http://www.reallyuseful.com/rug/shows/sunset/show.htm |archivedate=18 September 2008 }}</ref> The composer worked with two collaborators, as he had done on ''Aspects of Love''; this time Christopher Hampton and [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] shared equal credit for the book and lyrics.

In 1994, ''Sunset Boulevard'' became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year. Even so, by its closing in 1997, "it had not recouped its reported $13&nbsp;million investment."<ref>Singer, Barry.

In 1998, ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (1996 musical)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'' made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by [[Jim Steinman]]. Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince's production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards. The production included the [[Boyzone]] number-one hit "[[No Matter What (Boyzone song)|No Matter What]]", which remained at the top of the UK charts for three weeks. His ''[[The Beautiful Game (musical)|The Beautiful Game]]'' opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway. The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London. The show has been re-worked into a new musical, ''The Boys in the Photograph'', which had its world première at [[The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]] in April 2008.<ref>The Boys in the Photograph Marketing Information {{cite web |url=http://www.lipa.ac.uk/publicperformances/theboys.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 November 2019|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414015827/http://www.lipa.ac.uk/publicperformances/theboys.asp |archivedate=14 April 2008 }}, [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts|LIPA]]'s Performance season website</ref><ref>Gans, Andrew.

===2000s===
Having achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2001 as "the most commercially successful composer in history".<ref name="NY Times">{{cite book |last=Citron |first=Stephen |year=2001 |title=Sondheim and Lloyd-Webber: the new musical |url=https://archive.org/details/sondheimlloydweb0000citr |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780195357271}}</ref> In 2002 he turned producer, bringing the musical ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'' to London. With music by [[Indian Music]] composer [[A.R. Rahman]] and lyrics by Don Black, it ran for two years at the [[Apollo Victoria Theatre]]. A revised Broadway production at the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theatre]] two years later ran for only 284 performances.

On 16 September 2004, his production of ''[[The Woman in White (musical)|The Woman in White]]'' opened at the Palace Theatre in London. It ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show's star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.<ref>Jones, Kenneth.

Lloyd Webber produced a staging of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', which débuted November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the [[BBC]]'s reality television show ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?]]'', in which he was a judge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/06_june/06/maria.shtml|title=How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?, Panel Chosen|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The winner of the show was [[Connie Fisher]].

It was announced on 25 August 2006, on his personal website, that his next project would be ''[[The Master and Margarita]]''; however, it was announced in late March 2007 that he had abandoned the project.<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/03/27/andrew_lloyd_webber_abandons_the_master_]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125235355/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/03/27/andrew_lloyd_webber_abandons_the_master_|date=25 November 2013}}</ref>

In September 2006, Lloyd Webber was named to be a recipient of the prestigious [[Kennedy Center Honors]] with [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Steven Spielberg]], and [[Smokey Robinson]]. He was recognised for his outstanding contribution to American performing arts.<ref>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/home.html The Kennedy Center Honors<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923155858/http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/home.html |date=23 September 2006 }}</ref> He attended the ceremony on 3 December 2006; it aired on 26 December 2006.

Between April and June 2007, he appeared in BBC One's ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do!]]'', which followed the same format as ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?]]''. Its aim was to find a new Joseph for his revival of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''. [[Lee Mead]] won the contest after quitting his part in the ensemble – and as understudy in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' – to compete for the role. Viewers' telephone voting during the series raised more than [[pound sterling|£]]500,000 for the BBC's annual ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity appeal, according to host [[Graham Norton]] on air during the final.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee wins Any Dream Will Do, will become Joseph|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2007/06/09/lee-wins-any-dream-will-do-will-become-joseph/ |accessdate=24 November 2019 |work=Pink News}}</ref>

In 2007, Lloyd Webber's cat, Otto, leaped onto his [[Clavinova]] piano and "destroyed the entire score for the new 'Phantom' in one fell swoop". The Phantom in question was ''The Phantom of Manhattan'', a planned sequel to ''The Phantom of the Opera''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/cat-destroys-lloyd-webbers-phantom-sequel-score-com-141523|title=Cat Destroys Lloyd Webber's Phantom Sequel Score {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|access-date=11 December 2016|date=14 June 2007}}</ref>

In April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show ''[[I'd Do Anything (BBC TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]''. The show followed a similar format to its ''Maria'' and ''Joseph'' predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in a West End production of [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]'', a musical based on the [[Charles Dickens]]’ novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Darvell |first=Michael |title=Andrew to help BBC find Oliver! |publisher=Andrew Lloyd Webber |date=21 December 2008 |url=http://www.andrewlloydwebber.com/sections/news/newsdb.php?article=118 |accessdate=29 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125062007/http://www.andrewlloydwebber.com/sections/news/newsdb.php?article=118 |archivedate=25 January 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by [[Jodie Prenger]] despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008, Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show ''[[American Idol]]'', acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/04/american-idol-3.html|title=American Idol Tracker: What's new, Andrew Lloyd Webber?|publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com|accessdate=27 September 2014|date=18 April 2008}}</ref>

Lloyd Webber accepted the challenge of managing the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|UK's entry]] for the [[2009 Eurovision Song Contest]], to be held in Moscow. In early 2009 a series, called ''[[Eurovision: Your Country Needs You]]'', was broadcast to find a performer for a song that he would compose for the competition. [[Jade Ewen]] won the right to represent Britain, winning with "[[It's My Time (Eurovision song)|It's My Time]]", by Lloyd Webber and [[Diane Warren]]. At the contest, Lloyd Webber accompanied her on the piano during the performance. The United Kingdom finished fifth in the contest.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nikkhah |first=Roya |title=No more nul points at Eurovision? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4415361/No-more-nul-points-at-Eurovision.html |url-status=live |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203184903/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4415361/No-more-nul-points-at-Eurovision.html |archivedate=3 February 2009}}</ref>

===2010s===
Following the opening of ''Love Never Dies'', Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series ''[[Over the Rainbow (2010 TV series)|Over the Rainbow]]''. He cast the winner, [[Danielle Hope]], in the role of [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], and a dog to play [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] in his forthcoming stage production of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (2011 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. He and lyricist and composer [[Tim Rice]] wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/6168531/Andrew-Lloyd-Webber-to-audition-dogs-for-The-Wizard-of-Ozs-Toto.html|title=Andrew Lloyd Webber to audition dogs for ''The Wizard of Oz''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Toto |last=Midgley|first=Neil|date=11 September 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>

==Accusations of plagiarism==

Lloyd Webber has been accused of [[plagiarism]] in his works. The Dutch composer [[Louis Andriessen]] commented that: "Andrew Lloyd Webber has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy's never invented one note by himself. That's rather poor".<ref name="Moutby"/>

Lloyd Webber's biographer, John Snelson, countered such accusations. He acknowledged a similarity between the Andante movement of [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor]] and the ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' song "[[I Don't Know How to Love Him]]", but wrote that Lloyd Webber:
{{quote|
...brings a new dramatic tension to Mendelssohn's original melody through the confused emotions of Mary Magdalene. The opening theme may be Mendelssohn, but the rhythmic and harmonic treatment along with new lines of highly effective melodic development are Lloyd Webber's.

The songwriter [[Ray Repp]] claimed in a court case that Lloyd Webber had stolen a melody from his own song "Till You", but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber's favour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/235906.stm|title=Lloyd Webber wins Phantom battle|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014|date=16 December 1998}}</ref>

There was another accusation of plagiarism regarding [[Pink Floyd]]. The band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Meddle]]'', in 1971, and the sixth track of the album, "[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]", has a riff on which Lloyd Webber allegedly based the opening organ riff in "[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]". The two riffs share very similar notes and the order of the notes played. Lloyd Webber's pipe organ riff from "Phantom of the Opera" plays D, C#, C, B, A#, then ascending A#, B, C, C#, D. Pink Floyd's "Echoes" plays C#, C, B, A#, A, then ascending A, A#, B, C, C#. Pink Floyd bassist and co-lead vocalist [[Roger Waters]] pointed this out and said it was "probably actionable", but stated he did not care to take it to court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who the hell does Roger Waters think he is? |url=http://utopia.knoware.no/users/ptr/pfloyd/interview/roger2.html |publisher=Q Magazine |date=November 1992 |accessdate=20 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981205160956/http://utopia.knoware.nl/users/ptr/pfloyd/interview/roger2.html |archivedate=5 December 1998 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

Due to similarities between Lloyd Webber's "[[The Music of the Night]]" and a recurring melody in [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s 1910 opera, ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' (''The Girl of the Golden West''), in 1987 the Puccini estate filed a lawsuit against Lloyd Webber, accusing him of plagiarism. An agreement was [[settled out of court]] and details were not released to the public.<ref>{{cite news |first= Richard |last= Ouzounian |title= Aspects of Andrew |newspaper= [[Toronto Star]] |date= 2 January 2006 |via= EBSCOHost Research Database }}</ref>

A special performance of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall]]'' for the 25th anniversary was broadcast live to cinemas in early October 2011 and later released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2012. The same was also done with a reworked version of ''Love Never Dies''. Filmed in [[Melbourne, Australia]], it received a [[limited release|limited cinema release]] in the US and Canada in 2012, to see if it would be viable to bring the show to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

==Other works==
*''[[The Odessa File (film)|The Odessa File]]'' (1974) – Film score.
*''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]'' (1978) – A set of musical variations on [[Niccolò Paganini]]'s Caprice in A&nbsp;minor that Lloyd Webber composed for his brother, cellist Julian. This album featured fifteen rock musicians including guitarist [[Gary Moore]] and pianist [[Rod Argent]] and reached number 2 in the UK album chart upon its release. It was later combined with ''[[Tell Me on a Sunday]]'' to form one show, ''[[Song and Dance]]''. Lloyd Webber also used variation five as the basis for ''[[Unexpected Song]]'' in Song and Dance. The main theme is used as the theme music to ''[[The South Bank Show]]''.
