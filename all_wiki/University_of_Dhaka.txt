Before Dhaka University was established, near its grounds were the former buildings of [[Dhaka College]]. In 1873 the college was relocated to [[Bahadur Shah Park]]. Later it shifted to Curzon Hall, which would become the first institute of the university.<ref name=Banglapedia>{{cite book |year=2012 |edition=Second |author=Sajahan Miah |chapter=University of Dhaka |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=University_of_Dhaka |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |editor=Sirajul Islam and Ahmed A. Jamal |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>

The establishment of the university was a compensation of the annulment of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|1905 Partition of Bengal]]. The partition had established Muslim majority [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] as a separate province, with Dhaka as its capital. All India Muslim League, newly formed in Dhaka, wholeheartedly supported the move. However, the partition was abolished in 1911 due to severe opposition from [[Indian National Congress]] and Bengali Hindus. Deeply hurt by the decision of annulment of Bengal partition, a Muslim delegation led by Nawab Sir [[Khwaja Salimullah]] Bahadur, the then Nawab of Dhaka demanded a University be set up in Dhaka. To appease the majority Muslim masses of East Bengal, Lord Curzon agreed and declared that a university as a center of excellence would be established in Dhaka. Nawab Sir [[Khwaja Salimullah]], the Nawab of Dhaka, who played a pioneering role in establishing the university in Dhaka donated 600 acres of land from his estate for this purpose.<ref name=Worldh>{{cite web|url=http://www.bdlifeline.com/khwaja-salimullah/|title=Khwaja Salimullah|publisher=World History|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

In 1913, public opinion was invited before the university scheme was given its final shape. The secretary of state approved it in December 1913.<ref name=Banglapedia/> The first vice-chancellor of the university, Dr. [[Philip Joseph Hartog]], formerly academic registrar of the University of London for 17 years was appointed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangla2000.com/education/study_in_bangladesh/universities/History_DU.shtm |title=History of the Formation of Dhaka University |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731074803/http://www.bangla2000.com/Education/Study_in_Bangladesh/Universities/History_DU.shtm |archivedate=31 July 2015 |accessdate=10 February 2016 }}</ref>

In 1936, the university awarded honorary doctorate degrees to [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], [[Jadunath Sarkar]], [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Allama Iqbal]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-199342|title=Prof. Razzak: Anti-hero, mentor|date=20 August 2011|work=The Daily Star|access-date=19 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The university played a significant role in the [[Bengali Language Movement]], when Bengalis joined together to fight against Urdu being the official language in [[East Pakistan]]. Dhaka University was the main place where the movement started with the students joining together and protesting against the Pakistan government. Later countless students were massacred in where the [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] stands today. After the incident, Bengali was restored as official language.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url = http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement | title = Language Movement | encyclopedia = Banglapedia – The National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh | publisher = Asiatic Society of Bangladesh | accessdate = 10 February 2016 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307033428/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement | archivedate = 7 March 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>
