Where an immediate effect is required, [[heparin]] must be given concomitantly. These anticoagulants are used to treat patients with [[deep-vein thrombosis]] (DVT), [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE) and to prevent emboli in patients with [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF), and mechanical [[prosthetic heart valve]]s. Other examples are [[acenocoumarol]], [[phenprocoumon]], [[atromentin]], and [[phenindione]].

The coumarins [[brodifacoum]] and [[difenacoum]] are used as rodenticides but are not used medically.

====Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)====
[[Low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH), is produced through a controlled depolymerization of unfractionated heparin.<ref name="Heparin and anticoagulation"/> LMWH exhibits higher anti-Xa/anti-IIa activity ratio and is useful as it does not require monitoring of the [[APTT]] [[coagulation]] parameter and has fewer side effects.<ref name="Heparin and anticoagulation"/>

===Synthetic pentasaccharide inhibitors of factor Xa===
* [[Fondaparinux]] is a synthetic sugar composed of the five sugars (pentasaccharide) in heparin that bind to antithrombin. It is a smaller molecule than low molecular weight heparin.

A reversal agent for dabigatran, [[idarucizumab]], is currently available and approved for use by the FDA. Rates of adherence to DOACs are only modestly higher than adherence to warfarin among patients prescribed these drugs, and thus adherence to anticoagulation is universally poor, despite hopes that DOACs would lead to higher adherence rates.

DOACs are a lot more expensive than warfarin, after having taken into consideration the cost of frequent blood testing associated with warfarin.

====Direct factor Xa inhibitors====

Drugs such as [[rivaroxaban]], [[apixaban]] and [[edoxaban]] work by inhibiting factor Xa directly (unlike the heparins and fondaparinux, which work via antithrombin activation).
Also [[betrixaban]] from Portola Pharmaceuticals, [[darexaban]] (YM150) from Astellas, and more recently [[letaxaban]] (TAK-442) from Takeda and [[eribaxaban]] (PD0348292) from Pfizer.

==Laboratory use==
[[Medical laboratory|Laboratory]] instruments, blood transfusion bags, and medical and surgical equipment will get clogged up and become non-operational if blood is allowed to clot. In addition, test tubes used for laboratory blood tests will have chemicals added to stop blood clotting. Apart from [[heparin]], most of these chemicals work by [[chelation|binding]] [[calcium]] ions, preventing the [[coagulation]] proteins from using them.
* [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (EDTA) strongly and irreversibly chelates (binds) calcium ions, preventing blood from clotting.
* [[Citrate]] is in liquid form in the tube and is used for coagulation tests, as well as in blood transfusion bags. It binds the calcium, but not as strongly as EDTA. Correct proportion of this anticoagulant to blood is crucial because of the dilution, and it can be reversed with the addition of calcium. It can be in the form of [[Monosodium citrate|sodium citrate]] or [[acid-citrate-dextrose]].
* [[Oxalate]] has a mechanism similar to that of citrate. It is the anticoagulant used in fluoride oxalate tubes used to determine glucose and lactate levels.

== Dental considerations for long-term users==
Dental practitioners play an important role in the early detection of anticoagulant overdose through oral manifestations as the patient doesn't show any symptoms. Dental treatment of patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication raises safety concerns in terms of the potential risk of bleeding complications following invasive dental procedures. Therefore, there comes the need for certain guidelines for the dental care of patients taking these drugs.

<big>'''Detecting overdose'''</big>

An overdose in anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in a long term, in order to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure.

An [[Prothrombin time|International Normalised Ratio (INR)]] test would be recommended, to confirm the overdose so that the dosage can be adjusted to an acceptable standard. The INR test measures the time taken for a clot to form in a blood sample, relative to a standard.

An INR value of 1 indicates a level of coagulation equivalent to that of an average patient not taking warfarin and values greater than 1 indicate a longer clotting time and thus a longer bleeding time.

<big>'''Assessing bleeding risk'''</big>

There are 2 main parts to the assessment of bleeding risk:

* Assessment of the likely risk of bleeding associated with the required dental procedure
* Assessment of the patient's individual level bleeding risk

<big>'''Managing bleeding risk'''</big>

A patient who is on anticoagulants or [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] medications may undergo dental treatments which are unlikely to cause bleeding such as local anaesthesia injection, basic gum charting, removal of plaque, calculus and stain above the gum level, direct or indirect fillings which are above the gingiva, [[root canal treatment]], taking impression for denture or crown and fitting or adjustment of [[Orthodontics|orthodontic appliances]].&nbsp; For all these procedures, it is recommended for the dentist to treat the patient following the normal standard procedure and taking care to avoid any bleeding.

For a patient who needs to undergo dental treatments which is more likely to cause bleeding such as simple tooth extractions (1-3 teeth with small wound size), drainage of swelling inside the mouth, periodontal charting, [[Scaling and root planing|root planing]], &nbsp;direct or indirect filling which extends below the gingiva, complex filling, flap raising procedure, gingival recontouring and biopsies, the dentist needs to take extra precautions apart from the standard procedure. The recommendations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottishdental.org/management-of-dental-patients-taking-anticoagulants-or-antiplatelet-drugs-new-guidance-from-sdcep/|title=Management of Dental Patients Taking Anticoagulants or Antiplatelet Drugs – New guidance from SDCEP {{!}} Scottish Dental|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> are as follows:

* if the patient has another medical condition or taking other medication that may increase bleeding risk, consult the patient's general medical practitioner or specialist
* if the patient is on a short course anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, delay non-urgent, invasive procedure, until the medication has been discontinued
* plan treatment for early in the day and week, where possible, to allow time for the management of prolonged bleeding or re-bleeding, if it occurs
* perform the procedure as atraumatically as possible, use appropriate local measures and only discharge patient once [[Hemostasis|haemostasis]] has been confirmed
* if travel time to emergency care is a concern, place particular emphasis at the time of the initial treatment on the use of measures to avoid complications
* advise     the patient to take [[paracetamol]], unless contraindicated, for pain relief rather than [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] such as [[aspirin]], [[ibuprofen]], [[diclofenac]] or [[naproxen]]
* provide the patient with written post-treatment advice and emergency contact details
* follow the specific recommendations and advice given for the management of patients taking the different anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs

There is general agreement that in most cases, treatment regimens with older anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (e.g., [[clopidogrel]], [[ticlopidine]], [[prasugrel]], [[ticagrelor]], and/or aspirin) should not be altered before dental procedures. The risks of stopping or reducing these medication regimens (i.e., [[Venous thrombosis|thromboembolism]], [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]]) far outweigh the consequences of prolonged bleeding, which can be controlled with local measures. In patients with other existing medical conditions that can increase the risk of prolonged bleeding after dental treatment or who are receiving other therapy that can increase bleeding risk, dental practitioners may wish to consult the patient's physician to determine whether care can safely be delivered in a primary care office. Any suggested modification to the medication regimen prior to dental surgery should be done in consultation and on advice of the patient's physician.

On the basis of limited evidence, general consensus appears to be that in most patients who are receiving the newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) and undergoing dental treatment (in conjunction with usual local measures to control bleeding), no change to the anticoagulant regimen is required. In patients deemed to be at higher risk of bleeding (e.g., patients with other medical conditions or undergoing more extensive procedures associated with higher bleeding risk), consideration may be given, in consultation with and on advice of the patient's physician, to postponing the timing of the daily dose of the anticoagulant until after the procedure; timing the dental intervention as late as possible after last dose of anticoagulant; or temporarily interrupting drug therapy for 24 to 48 hours.

==Research==
A substantial number of compounds is being investigated for use as anticoagulants. The most promising ones act on the [[contact activation system]] ([[Factor XII]]a and [[Factor XI]]a); it is anticipated that this may provide agents that prevent thrombosis without conferring a risk of bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fredenburgh |first1=James C |last2=Weitz |first2=Jeffrey I |title=New Anticoagulants: Moving Beyond the Direct Oral Anticoagulants |journal=Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis |date=12 October 2020 |pages=jth.15126 |doi=10.1111/jth.15126|pmid=33047462 }}</ref>
