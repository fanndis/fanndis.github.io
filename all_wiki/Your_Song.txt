"'''Your Song'''" is a song by English musician [[Elton John]] from his [[Elton John (album)|self-titled second studio album]] (1970). It was written by John and his longtime collaborator [[Bernie Taupin]]. The song was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London in January 1970 and released in the United States in October 1970 as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to "[[Take Me to the Pilot]]". Both songs received airplay, but "Your Song" was preferred by disc jockeys and replaced "Take Me to the Pilot" as the A-side, eventually making it to number eight on the ''Billboard'' chart. The song also peaked at number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as charting in the top 10 in several other countries.

"Your Song" was first released by American rock band [[Three Dog Night]] in March 1970 on their third studio album, ''[[It Ain't Easy (Three Dog Night album)|It Ain't Easy]]''. John was an opening act for the band at the time and allowed them to record it. They did not release it as a single as they wanted to let John, then an upcoming artist, have a go with it.

In 1998, "Your Song" was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame#y "Grammy Hall of Fame Award"]. ''Grammy.org'' Retrieved 16 December 2012</ref> In 2004, the song was placed at number 137 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of "[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]", as well as in its 2010 list. The song is listed among the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.<ref name=":0">http://rockhall.com/exhibits/500-songs-that-shaped-rock-and/</ref> A demo version was included in John's 1990 box set album ''[[To Be Continued (Elton John album)|To Be Continued]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008H2Y/ |title=To Be Continued: Elton John |accessdate=27 September 2009}}</ref> 

The song has been covered by a number of artists, including [[Ellie Goulding]], whose version reached number two on the UK Singles Chart in late 2010, and [[Lady Gaga]]. The song was also covered by [[Ewan McGregor]] in the 2001 musical film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and by [[Taron Egerton]] in the 2019 film ''[[Rocketman (film)|Rocketman]]''. The song was eventually certified 2x Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=elton+john#search_section|title=Elton John RIAA certifications|work=RIAA|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>

==Composition and inspiration==
One widespread story is that Bernie Taupin wrote the song's lyrics after breakfast one morning on the roof of 20 Denmark Street, London, where John worked for a music publishing firm as an office boy, hence the line "I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss." However, Taupin has denied this, pointing out that John had stopped working there by the time they met. According to Taupin, "I scribbled the lyric down on a lined notepad at the kitchen table of Elton's mother's apartment in the London suburb of Northwood Hills, breakfast time sometime in 1969. That’s it. Plain and simple."<ref>{{cite web |last=Taupin |first=Bernie |url=http://www.berniejtaupin.com/taupin---his-blog---the-latest.html#top |title=No, I Didn't Sit on the Roof |accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>

The instrumental focus is on John's [[Leon Russell]]-influenced piano work, along with [[steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[Paul Buckmaster]]'s string accompaniment, and a shuffling rhythm section.

The lyrics express the romantic thoughts of an innocent person. John sings a straightforward love-song lyric at the beginning: "It's a little bit funny this feeling inside / I'm not one of those who can easily hide / I don't have much money, but boy, if I did / I'd buy a big house where we both could live." At times the self-deprecating narrator stumbles to get out his feelings, which despite being a melodramatic device, [[AllMusic]] calls "effective and sweet":<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |last=Janovitz |first=Bill |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/your-song-mt0010719430 |title=Your Song |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=16 July 2006}}</ref>

"Your Song" was the inspiration for the song "We All Fall in Love Sometimes" on John's 1975 album ''[[Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy]]''.<ref>We All Fall in Love Sometimes, Iconic Songs with Glenn A. Baker, Afternoons with Tim Webster, Radio 2UE, 20 November 2008</ref>

The song is performed in the key of [[E-flat major|Eb Major.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0170366|title=Your Song|last1=Elton|first1=John|last2=Bernie|first2=Taupin|date=2016-12-26|website=Musicnotes.com|access-date=2020-03-07|last3=Elton|first3=John}}</ref>

This song was used as a background music for [[Honda Taiwan]]'s [[CR-V]] second generation advertisement in 2003.

The song was used in a [[John_Lewis_(department_store_founder)|John Lewis]] Christmas advertisement in 2018.

==Reception==
"Your Song" was praised by critics upon its release and in subsequent years. Writing in ''[[NME]]'' on its release, Derek Johnson wrote, "The song itself is glowing and strangely haunting, the scoring is smooth and delicate and the performance is symptomatic of a new era in pop idols."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Derek|journal=New Musical Express|title=Critics acclaim Elton|publisher=IPC|date=16 January 1971|page=8}}</ref> [[Bill Janovitz]] from AllMusic described it as a "near-perfect song".<ref name="allmusic"/> 

In a 1975 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[John Lennon]] recalled, 
{{quote|I remember hearing Elton John's 'Your Song', heard it in America—it was one of Elton's first big hits—and remember thinking, 'Great, that's the first new thing that's happened since we ([[The Beatles]]) happened.' It was a step forward. There was something about his vocal that was an improvement on all of the English vocals until then. I was pleased with it."<ref>https://ultimateclassicrock.com/elton-john-your-song-history/</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

[[John Mendelsohn (musician)|John Mendelsohn]] from ''Rolling Stone'' called the song a "pretty [[Paul McCartney|McCartney-esque]] ballad".<ref>{{cite web |last=Mendelsohn |first=John |authorlink=John Mendelsohn (musician) |url=http://www.superseventies.com/johnelton1.html |title=Elton John |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=16 July 2006 |via=Super Seventies RockSite!}}</ref> In the 2019 book 'Elton John: Every Album, Every Song – 1969–1979', author Peter Kearns made the following quote in reference to 'Your Song'. "The words securely insulate themselves against possible criticism by admitting their ineptitude for the task at hand.".

==Commercial performance and impact==
"Your Song" rose to number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]] by January 1971. In 2002, John re-recorded the song as a duet with opera singer [[Alessandro Safina]] for the first [[Sport Relief]] charity telethon, and it reached number four in the UK. In the US it was certified Gold and Platinum on 13 December 2012 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales of over one million digital downloads. On 31 March 2017, it was certified Gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), denoting sales in excess of 400,000 digital downloads.In the US in April 2018 it was certified 2x Platinum for sales of two million digital downloads by the Recording Industry Association of America.

===Critical reception===
Nick Levine of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song four out of five stars, commenting that producer Lovett "shrouds her beautifully fluttery vocals in little but piano and strings, just adding a few harmonies towards the finish, allowing her to draw out the tenderness in Bernie Taupin's lyrics and the utter loveliness of one of Elton John's very best melodies. The result is a quiet, modest triumph, but a triumph nonetheless."<ref>{{cite web |last=Levine |first=Nick |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/single-reviews/review/a289176/ellie-goulding-your-song/ |title=Ellie Goulding: 'Your Song' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref> Caryn Ganz of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine opined that her cover is "everything Gaga's Grammy version wasn't—a tender, vulnerable gift".<ref>{{cite web |last=Ganz |first=Caryn |url=https://www.spin.com/2011/03/ellie-goulding-lights-cherrytreeinterscope/ |title=Ellie Goulding, 'Lights' |work=Spin |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] critic Jon O'Brien, in his review for ''Bright Lights'', called it "unimaginative" and felt that it "sounds out of place alongside the rest of her rather more adventurous material."<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Jon |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bright-lights-mw0002087325 |title=Bright Lights – Ellie Goulding |website=AllMusic |accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref>
