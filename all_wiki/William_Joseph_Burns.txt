In July 2002, Burns, along with [[Ryan Crocker]] and [[David D. Pearce|David Pearce]], sent a memo to Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] outlining the risks of regime change in Iraq: "an effort to overthrow the regime in [[Baghdad]] could unravel if we're not careful, intersecting to create a 'perfect storm' for American interests."<ref>https://carnegieendowment.org/pdf/back-channel/2002MemotoPowell6.pdf</ref> 

In 2013, Burns and [[Jake Sullivan]] led the secret bilateral channel with Iran that led to a historic [[Joint Plan of Action|interim agreement]] between Iran and the [[P5+1]] and ultimately the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Michael|title=Diplomat Who Led Secret Talks with Iran Plans to Retire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/world/official-who-led-secret-talks-with-iran-plans-to-retire.html|accessdate=30 June 2014|work=New York Times|date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Burns was reported to be "in the driver's seat" of the American negotiating team for the interim agreement.

=== Retirement ===
On April 11, the State Department announced Burns would step down as Deputy Secretary of State in October 2014, after he twice delayed his retirement first at the request of Secretary [[John Kerry]] and then at the request of Obama.

In a press statement announcing Burns's decision to retire, Kerry said, "Bill is a statesman cut from the same cloth, caliber, and contribution as [[George F. Kennan]] and [[Charles E. Bohlen|Chip Bohlen]], and he has more than earned his place on a very short list of American diplomatic legends."<ref>{{cite web|title=Deputy Secretary of State William J.

Obama, in his own statement, said that Burns "has been a skilled advisor, consummate diplomat, and inspiration to generations of public servants... the country is stronger for Bill's service."<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement by President Obama on the Retirement of Deputy Secretary of State William J.
