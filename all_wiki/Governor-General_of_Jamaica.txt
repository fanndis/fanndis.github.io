{{Politics of Jamaica}}

The '''Governor-General of Jamaica''' represents the [[Queen of Jamaica]], [[Elizabeth II]].

The monarch, on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|prime minister]], appoints a Governor-General as his or her representative in [[Jamaica]]. Both the monarch and the [[Governor-General]] hold much power, but rarely exercise it, usually only in emergencies and, in some cases,{{which?|date=February 2014}} war.

The Governor-General represents the monarch on ceremonial occasions such as the state opening of [[Parliament of Jamaica|Parliament]], the presentation of honours, and military parades. Under the [[Constitution of Jamaica|Constitution]], they are given authority to act in some matters, for example in appointing and disciplining officers of the civil service, proroguing Parliament, and so on, but only in a few cases do they have the power to act entirely at their own discretion.<ref>[http://www.jis.gov.jm/GovernmentOfJamaica.pdf "Government of Jamaica"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606194332/http://www.jis.gov.jm/GovernmentOfJamaica.pdf |date=6 June 2007 }}, Jamaica Information Service</ref>

[[Jamaican republicanism]], a position which is held by the current Jamaican government, generally advocates for the replacement of the Governor-General with a non-executive president.
