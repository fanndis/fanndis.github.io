'''Data retention''' defines the policies of [[persistent data]] and [[records management]] for meeting legal and business [[data archive|data archival]] requirements. Although sometimes interchangeable, it is not to be confused with the [[Data Protection Act 1998]].

The different data retention policies weigh legal and [[data privacy|privacy]] concerns against economics and [[need to know|need-to-know]] concerns to determine the retention time, archival rules, data formats, and the permissible means of [[computer data storage|storage]], [[data access|access]], and [[encryption]].

In the field of [[telecommunication]]s, '''data retention''' generally refers to the storage of [[call detail record]]s (CDRs) of [[telephony]] and [[internet]] [[traffic]] and [[database transaction|transaction]] data ([[Internet Protocol Detail Record|IPDRs]]) by governments and commercial organisations. In the case of government data retention, the data that is stored is usually of telephone calls made and received, [[email]]s sent and received, and [[website]]s visited. [[Telephone tapping#Location data|Location data]] is also collected.

The primary objective in government data retention is [[traffic analysis]] and [[mass surveillance]]. By analysing the retained data, governments can identify the locations of individuals, an individual's associates and the members of a group such as political opponents. These activities may or may not be lawful, depending on the constitutions and laws of each country. In many jurisdictions access to these databases may be made by a government with little or no judicial oversight.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the case of commercial data retention, the data retained will usually be on transactions and web sites visited.

Data retention also covers data collected by other means (e.g., by [[Automatic number-plate recognition]] systems) and held by government and commercial organisations.

==Data retention policy==
A data retention policy is a recognized and proven protocol within an organization for retaining information for operational use while ensuring adherence to the laws and regulations concerning them. The objectives of a data retention policy are to keep important information for future use or reference, to organize information so it can be searched and accessed at a later date and to dispose of information that is no longer needed.<ref name="Data retention policy">{{cite web |last1=Rouse |first1=Margaret |title=Data retention policy |url=http://searchdatabackup.techtarget.com/definition/data-retention-policy |publisher=TechTarget |accessdate=30 October 2014 }}</ref>

The data retention policies within an organization are a set of guidelines that describes which data will be archived, how long it will be kept, what happens to the data at the end of the retention period (archive or destroy) and other factors concerning the retention of the data.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rouse |first1=Margaret|title=Data retention |url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/data-retention |publisher=TechTarget |accessdate=30 October 2014 }}</ref>

A part of any effective data retention policy is the permanent deletion of the retained data; achieving secure deletion of data by encrypting the data when stored, and then deleting the encryption key after a specified retention period. Thus, effectively deleting the data object and its copies stored in online and offline locations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=J |last2=Singhal |first2=S |last3=Swaminathan |first3=R |last4=Karp |first4=AH |title=Managing Data Retention Policies at Scale |journal=  IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management|date=19 October 2012 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=393–406 |doi=10.1109/TNSM.2012.101612.110203 }}</ref>

== European Union ==
On 15 March 2006, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Retention Directive]], on "the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC".<ref>{{cite web |title=Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF |date=April 13, 2006 |work=Official Journal of the European Union }}

* Trace and identify the source of a communication;
* Trace and identify the destination of a communication;
* Identify the date, time, and duration of a communication;
* Identify the type of communication;
* Identify the communication device;
* Identify the location of mobile communication equipment.

The data is required to be available to "competent" national authorities in specific cases, "for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law".

The Directive covers [[fixed telephony]], [[mobile telephony]], Internet access, email, and [[VoIP]]. Member States were required to transpose it into national law within 18 months—no later than September 2007. However, they may if they wish postpone the application of the Directive to Internet access, email, and VoIP for a further 18 months after this date. A majority of Member States exercised this option. All 28 EU States have notified the European Commission about the transposition of the Directive into their national law. Of these, however, Germany and Belgium have only transposed the legislation partially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Data retention |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/police-cooperation/data-retention/index_en.htm |publisher=Directorate-General of the European Commission |accessdate=8 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311170440/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/police-cooperation/data-retention/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 March 2014 }}</ref>

A report evaluating the Directive was published by the European Commission in April 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0225:FIN:en:PDF |title=Evaluation report on the Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC) |format=PDF |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date=18 April 2011 }}</ref>

It concluded that data retention was a valuable tool for ensuring criminal justice and public protection, but that it had achieved only limited harmonisation. There were serious concerns from service providers about the compliance costs and from civil society organisations who claim that mandatory data retention was an unacceptable infringement of the fundamental right to privacy and the protection of personal data. The Commission is now reviewing the legislation.

In response to the report, on May 31, 2011, the [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] expressed some concerns on the European Data Retention Directive, underlining that the Directive "does not meet the requirements imposed by the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/site/mySite/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-05-30_Evaluation_Report_DRD_EN.pdf |title=Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on the Evaluation report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC) |publisher=European Data Protection Supervisor |date=31 May 2011 }}</ref>

On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights. The Council's Legal Services have been reported to have stated in closed session that paragraph 59 of the European Court of Justice's ruling "suggests that general and blanket data retention is no longer possible".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/content/view/745/79/lang,en/ |title=EU lawyers tell Member States: Blanket communications data retention "no longer possible" |publisher=Stoppt die Vorratsdatenspeicherung! |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014 }}</ref> A legal opinion funded by the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament finds that the blanket retention data of unsuspicious persons generally violates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, both in regard to national telecommunications data retention laws and to similar EU data retention schemes (PNR, TFTP, TFTS, LEA access to EES, Eurodac, VIS).<ref>{{cite web |author1=Franziska Boehm |author2=Mark D Cole |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/Jura.itm/hoeren/materialien/boehm/Boehm_Cole-Data_Retention_Study-June_2014.pdf |title=Data Retention after the Judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union |publisher=[[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] |date=30 June 2014 |access-date=11 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108102749/http://www.uni-muenster.de/Jura.itm/hoeren/materialien/boehm/Boehm_Cole-Data_Retention_Study-June_2014.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===

====Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014====
The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act came into force in 2014. It is the answer by the United Kingdom parliament after a declaration of invalidity was made by the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to Directive 2006/ 24/EC in order to make provision, about the retention of certain communications data.<ref name="DRIP">{{cite web |title=Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/27/pdfs/ukpga_20140027_en.pdf |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=31 October 2014 }}</ref>
In addition, the purpose of the act is to:

* Amend the grounds for issuing interception warrants, or granting or giving certain authorizations or notices.
* Make provision about the extraterritorial application of that Part and about the meaning of “telecommunications service” for the purposes of that Act;
* Make provision about a review of the operation and regulation of investigatory powers; and for connected purposes.<ref name="DRIP"/>

The act is also to ensure that communication companies in the UK retain communications data so that it continues to be available when it is needed by law enforcement agencies and others to investigate committed crimes and protect the public.<ref>{{cite web |title=Data Retention Legislation (Impact Assessment) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukia/2014/266/pdfs/ukia_20140266_en.pdf |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=31 October 2014 }}</ref> Data protection law requires data that isn't of use to be deleted. This means that the intention of this Act could be using data retention to acquire further policing powers using, as the Act make data retention mandatory.

An element of this Act is the provision of the investigatory powers to be reported by 1 May 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (Explanatory notes) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/27/pdfs/ukpgaen_20140027_en.pdf |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=31 October 2014 }}</ref>

====Controversy====
The [[Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014]] was referred to as the "snooper’s charter" communications data bill.<ref name="Guardian 30 Sept 2014">{{cite news |last1=Travis |first1=Alan |title=Theresa May vows Tory government would introduce 'snooper's charter' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/30/theresa-may-tory-government-snoopers-charter |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 September 2014 }}</ref> [[Theresa May]], a strong supporter of the Parliament Act, said in a speech that “If we (parliament) do not act, we risk sleepwalking into a society in which crime can no longer be investigated and terrorists can plot their murderous schemes undisrupted.”<ref name="Guardian 30 Sept 2014"/>

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom parliament]] its new laws increasing the power of data retention is essential to tackling crime and protecting the public.  However, not all agree and believe that the primary objective in the data retention by the government is [[mass surveillance]].

After Europe's highest court said the depth of data retention breaches citizens' fundamental [[right to privacy]] and the UK created its own Act, it has led to the British government being accused of breaking the law by forcing telecoms and internet providers to retain records of phone calls, texts and internet usage.<ref name="Guardian 24 June 2014">{{cite news |last1=Hern |first1=Alex |title=British government 'breaking law' in forcing data retention by companies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/british-government-breaking-law-in-forcing-data-retention-by-companies |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 June 2014 }}</ref>
From this information, governments can identify an individual's associates, location, group memberships, political affiliations and other personal information.

In a television interview, the EU [[Advocate General]] Pedro Cruz Villalón highlighted the risk that the retained data might be used illegally in ways that are "potentially detrimental to privacy or, more broadly, fraudulent or even malicious".<ref name="Guardian 24 June 2014"/>

==== Retention of other data ====
; Postal data – retention period unknown : Information written on the outside of a postal item (such as a letter or parcel), online tracking of postal items, records of special postal items (such as records of registered, recorded or special delivery postal items), records of parcel consignment, delivery and collection.
; Banking data – seven years : ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that UK banks are required to retain data on all financial transactions for seven years though this has not been verified.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is not clear whether data on credit card transactions is also retained for seven years.
; Vehicle movement data – two years : Documents leaked from the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) have revealed that the UK is planning to collect data from a nationwide network of automatic numberplate recognition cameras and store the data for two years in a controversial new centre being built at Hendon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1869818,00.html |title=Spy cameras to spot drivers' every move |author1=Emma Smith |author2=Dipesh Gadher |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=13 November 2005 |archivedate=6 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106064734/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0%2C%2C176-1869818%2C00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> This data could then be linked to other data held by the government and watchlists from the police and security services.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/15/vehicle_movement_database/ |title=Gatso 2: rollout of UK's '24×7 vehicle movement database' begins |author=John Lettice |work=[[The Register]] |date=15 November 2005 |accessdate=21 December 2011 }}</ref>

==== Access to retained data ====
The bodies that are able to access retained data in the United Kingdom are listed in the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] (RIPA). These are the following:

* Police forces, as defined in section 81(1) of RIPA
* National Criminal Intelligence Service
* Serious Organised Crime Agency, formerly the National Crime Squad
* HM Customs and Excise
* Inland Revenue (the latter two have been merged into [[HM Revenue and Customs]])
* Security Service
* Secret Intelligence Service
* [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ)

However, the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] (RIPA) also gives the [[Home Secretary]] powers to change the list of bodies with access to retained data through [[secondary legislation]]. The list of authorised bodies now includes:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2000/20002417.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 2000 № 2417 granting additional bodies access to retained telecoms data |publisher=[[The National Archives]] |date=7 September 2000 |accessdate=21 December 2011 }}
</ref>

* Food Standards Agency
* Local authorities
* [[National Health Service]]

==== Reasons for accessing retained data ====
The justifications for accessing retained data in the UK are set out in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). They include:

* Interests of national security;
* Preventing or detecting crime or of preventing disorder;
* Economic well-being of the United Kingdom;
* Public safety;
* Protecting public health;
* Assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or charge payable to a government department;
* Preventing death or injury in an emergency or any damage to a person's physical or mental health, or of mitigating any injury or damage to a person's physical or mental health;
* Any other purpose not listed above which is specified for the purposes of this subsection by an order made by the Secretary of State.

=== Czech Republic ===
Implementation of the directive was part of Act. No. 259/2010 Coll. on electronic communications as later amended. Under Art. 97 (3), telecommunication data are to be stored between 6 and 12 months. The [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitutional Court]] has deemed the law unconstitutional and found it to be infringing on the peoples right to privacy.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1103ap_eu_czech_data_retention.html Seattle PI] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

As of July 2012, new legislation was on its way.<ref>[http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.15/czech-republic-new-data-retention-law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010213833/http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.15/czech-republic-new-data-retention-law|date=October 10, 2012}}</ref>

</ref> on data retention came into force in Italy.

;Subscriber information : Internet cafés and public telephone shops with at least three terminals must seek a license permit within 30 days from the Ministry of Home Affairs. They must also store traffic data for a period which may be determined later by administrative decree. [[Wi-Fi hotspot]]s and locations that do not store traffic data have to secure ID information from users before allowing them to log on. For example, users may be required to enter a number from an ID card or driving license. It is not clear how this information is validated. Mobile telephony users must identify themselves before service activation, or before a [[SIM card]] may be obtained. Resellers of mobile subscriptions or pre-paid cards must verify the identity of purchasers and retain a photocopy of identity cards.
; Telephony data : Data, including location data, on fixed line and mobile telephony must be retained for 24 months. There is no requirement to store the content of calls. Telephony operators must retain a record of all unsuccessful dial attempts.
; ISP data : Internet service providers must retain all data for at least 12 months. The law does not specify exactly what traffic data must be retained.  There is no requirement to store the content of internet communications.
; Legality : The legislation of July 2005 enables data retention by outlawing all the relevant data protection provisions until 31 December 2007. Under the data protection provisions, service providers are obliged to store traffic data and user data for no less than 365 days, even if they no longer need it to process the communication or to send bills, policy requires user id information, location, tracking data be stored and kept on file for easy access by law enforcement and/or other authorities who request this information (permission must be asked to view sensitive user ID data on file). The traffic data which will now be retained can be used for anti-terrorism purposes and for general penal enforcement of criminal offences large and small.

Italy already required the retention of telephony traffic data for 48 months, but without location data. Italy has adopted the EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2002 but with an exemption to the requirement to erase traffic data.

* "2.2.1. Session logging (section 5(1) of the Executive Order) Providers of access to the internet must, in respect of the initiating and terminating package of an internet session, retain data that identifies the sending and receiving internet protocol address (in the following called IP address), the sending and receiving port number and the transmission protocol."
* "2.2.2. Sampling (section 5(4) of the Executive Order)  The obligation to retain data about the initiating and terminating package of an internet session does not apply to providers in case such retention is not technically feasible in their systems. In that case, data must instead be retained for every 500th package that is part of an end user’s communication on the internet."
* "2.2.5. Hot spots (section 5(3) of the Executive Order) In addition to the internet data that must otherwise be retained, the provider must retain data that identifies the precise geographic or physical location of a hot spot and the identity of the communication equipment used. This means that a provider of internet access via a hot spot must retain data on a user’s access to the internet and, at the same time, retain data that identifies the geographic location of the hot spot in question."

=== Slovakia ===

[[Slovakia]] has implemented the directive in Act No. 610/2003 Coll. on electronic communications as later amended. Telecommunication data are stored for six months in the case of data related to Internet, Internet email and Internet telephony (art. 59a (6) a), and for 12 months in the case of other types of communication (art. 59a (6) b).

== Switzerland ==
As from 7 July 2016, the [[Law of Switzerland|Swiss Federal Law]] about the Surveillance of the Post and Telecommunications entered into force, passed by the Swiss government on 18 March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Switzerland |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2016/1991.pdf|title=Bundesgesetz betreffend der Überwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs (BÜPF)|publisher=admin.ch |date=2016-03-18 |accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref>

=== Mobile phones ===
Swiss mobile phone operators have to retain the following data for six months according to the BÜPF:

# Phone numbers of incoming and outgoing calls
# SIM- (Subscriber Identity Module), IMSI- (International Mobile Subscribers Identity) and IMEI-numbers (International Mobile Equipment Identity)
# „the location and the electrical boresight of the antenna of the mobile phone with which the monitored person is connected to the communications system at the time of the communication“
# date, time and duration of the connection

=== Email ===
All Internet service providers must retain the following data for six months:

# type of the connections (telephone, xDSL, Cable, permanent line etc.) and if known login data, address information of the origin ([[MAC address]], telephone number), name, address and occupation of the user and duration of the connection from beginning to end
# time of the transmission or reception of an email, header information according to the SMTP-protocol and the IP addresses of the sending and receiving email application.

Email application refers to SMTP-, POP3-, IMAP4, webmail- and remail-server.<ref>{{cite web|author=Digitale Gesellschaft |url=https://www.digitale-gesellschaft.ch/ueberwachung/|title=Überwachung|publisher=digitale-gesellschaft.ch |date=2015-09-05 |accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref>

====Exemptions====
Switzerland only applies data retention to the largest Internet service providers with over 100 million CHF in annual Swiss-sourced revenue. This notably exempts derived communications providers such as ProtonMail, a popular encrypted email service based in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Swiss Federal Department of Justice |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20172173/index.html|title=Verordnung über die Überwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs|publisher=admin.ch |date=2019-12-03 |accessdate=2020-03-14}}</ref>

== United States ==
The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) commonly records Internet metadata for the whole planet for up to a year in its [[MARINA]] database, where it is used for [[pattern-of-life analysis]].

=== Leveraging commercial data retention ===
Various United States agencies leverage the (voluntary) data retention practised by many U.S. commercial organizations through programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and [[MUSCULAR]].

Amazon is known to retain extensive data on customer transactions. Google is also known to retain data on searches, and other transactions. If a company is based in the United States the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) can obtain access to such information by means of a [[National Security Letter]] (NSL). The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] states that "NSLs are secret subpoenas issued directly by the FBI without any judicial oversight. These secret subpoenas allow the FBI to demand that online service providers or [[ecommerce]] companies produce records of their customers' transactions. The FBI can issue NSLs for information about people who haven't committed any crimes.

NSLs are practically immune to judicial review. They are accompanied by gag orders that allow no exception for talking to lawyers and provide no effective opportunity for the recipients to challenge them in court. This secret subpoena authority, which was expanded by the controversial [[USA PATRIOT Act]], could be applied to nearly any online service provider for practically any type of record, without a court ever knowing". The ''[[Washington Post]]'' has published a well researched article on the FBI's use of [[National Security Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/05/AR2005110501366.html|title=The FBI's Secret Scrutiny|first=Barton|last=Gellman|date=6 November 2005|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

=== Failed mandatory ISP retention legislation attempts ===

The United States does not have any [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) mandatory data retention laws similar to the European [[Data Retention Directive]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Personal Data Privacy and Protection in a Surveillance Era: Technologies and Practices |first1=Christina |last1=Akrivopoulou |first2=Athanasios |last2=Psygkas |year=2010 |page=257 |publisher=Idea Group Inc |isbn=978-1-60960-083-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=We5iLoALDEEC&pg=PA257 |quote=These civil liberties organizations also highlighted the absence of such a data retention obligation for ISPs in the US... }}</ref> Some attempts to create mandatory retention legislation have failed:

* In 1999 two models of mandatory data retention were suggested for the United States: What [[IP address]] was assigned to a customer at a specific time. In the second model, "which is closer to what Europe adopted", telephone numbers dialed, contents of Web pages visited, and recipients of e-mail messages must be retained by the [[ISP]] for an unspecified amount of time.<ref>{{cite news |title=ISP snooping gaining support |url=http://news.cnet.com/ISP-snooping-gaining-support/2100-1028_3-6061187.html |work=[[CNET]] |date=April 14, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=FBI, politicos renew push for ISP data retention laws |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9926803-38.html |quote=Based on the statements at Wednesday's hearing and previous calls for new laws in this area, the scope of a mandatory data retention law remains fuzzy.

== Arguments against data retention ==
It is often argued that data retention is necessary to combat terrorism, and other crimes. Data retention may assist the police and security services to identify potential terrorists and their accomplices before or after an attack has taken place. For example, the authorities in Spain and the United Kingdom stated that retained telephony data made a significant contribution to police enquires into the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] and the [[2005 London bombings]].<ref>Kosta E, Coudert F, Dumortier J. Data Protection in the Third Pillar: In the Aftermath of the ECJ Decision on PNR Data and the Data Retention Directive. International Review of Law, Computers & Technology [Internet]. 2007 Nov [cited 2020 Oct 23];21(3):347–62. Available from: <nowiki>https://search-ebscohost-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=27665436&site=eds-live</nowiki></ref>

The opponents of data retention make the following arguments:

Some police officers in the EU are sceptical about the value of data retention. For example, Heinz Kiefer, president of Eurocop, the European Confederation of Police, issued a press statement saying "it remains easy for criminals to avoid detection through fairly simple means, for example mobile phone cards can be purchased from foreign providers and frequently switched. The result would be that a vast effort is made with little more effect on criminals and terrorists than to slightly irritate them. Activities like these are unlikely to boost citizens’ confidence in the EU's ability to deliver solutions to their demand for protection against serious crime and terrorism".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocop-police.org/pressreleases/2005/05-06-02%20PRESS%20JHA%20Council_E.pdf |title=Europe wide retention of telecommunications data unlikely to help law enforcement agencies in the fight against terrorism |publisher=[[Eurocop]] |date=2 June 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042329/http://www.eurocop-police.org/pressreleases/2005/05-06-02%20PRESS%20JHA%20Council_E.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}</ref>

== Protection against data retention ==
The current directive proposal (see above) would force ISPs to record the internet communications of its users. The basic assumption is that this information can be used to identify with whom someone, whether innocent citizen or terrorist, communicated throughout a specific timespan. Believing that such as mandate would be useful is ignoring that some very committed community of crypto professionals has been preparing for such legislation for decades. Below are some strategies available today to anyone to protect themselves, avoid such traces, and render such expensive and legally dubious logging operations useless.

=== Anonymizing proxy services: Web ===
There are [[Anonymizer|anonymizing proxies]] that provide slightly more private web access.  Proxies must use [[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]] encryption in order to provide any level of protection at all.  Unfortunately, proxies require the user to place a large amount of trust in the proxy operator (since they see everything the user does over HTTP), and may be subject to [[traffic analysis]].

=== P2P communications ===
Some P2P services like file transfer or voice over IP use other computers to allow communication between computers behind firewalls. This means that trying to follow a call between two citizens might, mistakenly, identify a third citizen unaware of the communication.

=== Privacy enhancing tools ===
For security conscious citizens with some basic technical knowledge, tools like [[I2P|I2P – The Anonymous Network]], [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], [[Mixmaster anonymous remailer|Mixmaster]] and the cryptography options integrated into any many modern mail clients can be employed.

I2P is an international peer-to-peer anonymizing network, which aims at not only evading data retention, but also at making spying by other parties impossible. The structure is similar to the one TOR (see next paragraph) uses, but there are substantial differences. It protects better against traffic analysis and offers strong anonymity and for net-internal traffic [[end-to-end encryption]]. Due to unidirectional tunnels it is less prone to timing attacks than Tor. In I2P, several services are available: anonymous browsing, anonymous e-mails, anonymous instant messenger, anonymous file-sharing, and anonymous hosting of websites, among others.

Tor is a project of the U.S. non-profit Tor Project<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.torproject.org/|title=Tor Project - Privacy Online|first=The Tor Project|last=Inc.|date=|website=www.torproject.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> to develop and improve an [[onion routing]] network to shield its users from traffic analysis. Mixmaster is a remailer service that allows anonymous email sending.

[[Java Anon Proxy|JAP]] is a project very similar to Tor. It is designed to route web requests through several proxies to hide the end user's Internet address. Tor support has been included into JAP.

== Initiative against extensive data retention ==
The Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung (German Working Group on Data Retention) is an association of civil rights campaigners, data protection activists and Internet users. The Arbeitskreis coordinates the campaign against the introduction of data retention in Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/content/view/13/37/lang,en/ |title=About us |publisher=Stoppt die Vorratsdatenspeicherung! |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>

An analysis of federal Crime Agency (BKA) statistics published on 27 January 2010 by civil liberties NGO AK Vorrat revealed that data retention did not make a prosecution of serious crime any more effective.<ref name="vorratsdatenspeicherung.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/content/view/426/79/lang,en/ |title=Study finds telecommunications data retention ineffective (27 Jan 2011) |publisher=Stoppt die Vorratsdatenspeicherung! |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref>

As the EU Commission is currently considering changes to the controversial EU data retention directive, a coalition of more than 100 civil liberties, data protection and human rights associations, jurists, trade unions and others are urging the Commission to propose the repeal of the EU requirements regarding data retention in favour of a system of expedited preservation and targeted collection of traffic data.<ref name="vorratsdatenspeicherung.de"/>

== Plans for extending data retention to social networks ==
In November 2012, answers to a parliamentary inquiry in the [[German Bundestag]] revealed plans of some EU countries including France to extend data retention to chats and social media. Furthermore, the German [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] (Germany's domestic intelligence agency) has confirmed that it has been working with the ETSI LI Technical Committee since 2003.<ref name="FM4-30-10-2012">[[FM4]] Online ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]): [http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1707197/ Vorratsspeicherung für Facebook-Daten] (in German). 2012-10-30.
