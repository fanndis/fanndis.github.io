'''Proposition 8''', known informally as '''Prop 8''',  was a [[California ballot proposition]] and a [[constitutional amendment|state constitutional amendment]] passed in the [[California state elections, November 2008|November 2008 California state elections]]. The proposition was created by opponents of [[Same-sex marriage in California|same-sex marriage]] in advance<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/pro-family-group-says-effort-to-ban-calif-gay-marriage-looks-strong-31814/ |title=Pro-Family Group Says Effort to Ban Calif. Gay 'Marriage' Looks 'Strong' |publisher=Christianpost.com |date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2013-11-01}}</ref> of the [[California Supreme Court]]'s May 2008 appeal ruling, ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', which followed the short-lived [[San Francisco 2004 same-sex weddings|2004 same-sex weddings controversy]] and found the previous ban on same-sex marriage ([[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]], 2000) [[unconstitutional]]. Proposition 8 was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by a federal court (on different grounds) in 2010, although the court decision did not go into effect until June 26, 2013, following the conclusion of proponents' appeals.

Proposition 8 countermanded the 2008 ruling by adding the same provision as in Proposition 22 to the [[California Constitution]], providing that "only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California", thereby superseding the 2008 ruling.<ref name="text" /><ref name="sos.ca.gov" /><ref name="Text of Proposition 8">[http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf#prop8 Text of Proposition 8] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418150058/http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf#prop8 |date=2013-04-18 }}, Official Voter Information Guide (draft copy). Retrieved July 28, 2008</ref> As an amendment, it was ruled constitutional by the [[California Supreme Court]] in ''[[Strauss v. Horton]]'', in 2009, on the grounds that it "carved out a limited [or 'narrow'] exception to the state equal protection clause"; in his dissent, Justice [[Carlos R. Moreno]] wrote that exceptions to the [[equal protection clause]] could not be made by any majority since its whole purpose was to protect minorities against the will of a majority.

Legal challenges to Proposition 8 were presented by opponents quickly after its approval. Following affirmation by the state courts, two same-sex couples filed a lawsuit against the initiative in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] in the case ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' (later ''Hollingsworth v. Perry''). In August 2010, Chief Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional under both the [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Judge strikes down Prop. 8, allows gay marriage in California |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref> since it purported to ''re-remove'' rights from a disfavored class only, with no [[Rational basis review|rational basis]]. The official proponents' justifications for the measure were analyzed in over fifty pages covering eighty [[Question of fact|findings of fact]].

On February 7, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], in a 2–1 decision, reached the same conclusion as the district court, but on narrower grounds. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for California to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples, only to take them away shortly after. The ruling was stayed pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court.<ref>http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf</ref>

On June 26, 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] issued its decision on the appeal in the case ''[[Hollingsworth v.

Therefore, the Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and remanded the case for further proceedings.

The passage of Proposition 8 received widespread media coverage over the amendment's effect on the concurrent [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential]] and [[2008 United States elections|congressional elections]], as well as the pre-election effects Proposition 8 had on California's reputation as a [[LGBT rights in California|historically LGBT-friendly state]] and the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage debate]] that had started after same-sex marriage [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|was legalized in Massachusetts through a 2004 court decision]]. After the results were certified and same-sex marriages ceased, supporters of the initiative were [[Protests against Proposition 8 supporters|targeted by opponents]] with actions ranging from some opponents [[public shaming|publicly shaming]] supporters by disclosing their names and addresses online, causing many individual supporters to lose their jobs, and [[boycott]]ing proponents' businesses and employers to others [[Protests against Proposition 8 supporters#Death threats and vandalism|threatening supporters with murder]] and [[vandalism|vandalizing]] their homes and property. The actions against supporters of Proposition 8 became the focus after the election due to a full page opinion ad paid for by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty appearing in ''[[The New York Times]]''. The piece accused the LGBT community of backlash, "[[Protests against Proposition 8 supporters#Claims of religious bigotry|mob veto]]", and urged violence against the supporters to cease. The opinion ad was signed by 13 men who represented various Christian and Jewish groups.<ref name="urlGay groups cry foul on New York Times No Mob Veto ad claims - The Colorado Independent">{{cite news|url=https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2008/12/11/gay-groups-cry-foul-on-new-york-times-no-mob-veto-ad-claims/ |title=Gay groups cry foul on New York Times 'No Mob Veto' ad claims - The Colorado Independent |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>

==Overview==
In 2000, the [[State of California]] adopted [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]] which, as an ordinary statute, forbade recognition or licensing of [[same-sex marriage]]s in the state. During February and March 2004, [[San Francisco]] [[Mayor of San Francisco|Mayor]] [[Gavin Newsom]] directed the licensing of same-sex marriages on the basis of the state's [[equal protection clause]], prompted also by recent events including [[George W. Bush]]'s [[State of the Union|proposed constitutional ban]], a possible legal case by Campaign for California Families (CCF), and a [[Supreme Court of Massachusetts]] ruling deeming same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional and permitting them from May 2004. While only lasting a month before being overruled, this was supported by other cities such as [[San Jose, California|San Jose]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-03-10/news/0403100284_1_gay-marriage-marriage-licenses-same-sex |title=San Jose recognizes gay marriage |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 10, 2004 |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> gained global attention, and led to the case ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', in which Proposition 22 was found ([[San Francisco County Superior Court]], March 14, 2005) and confirmed upon appeal ([[California Supreme Court]], May 15, 2008) to be unconstitutional.

Proposition 8 was created by opponents of same-sex marriage prior to the final ruling on ''In re Marriage Cases'' as a voter ballot initiative, and voted on at the time of the [[California state elections, November 2008|November 2008 elections]]. Its wording was precisely the same as Proposition 22, which as an ordinary statute, had been invalidated in 2008, but by re-positioning it as a State [[constitutional amendment]] rather than a legislative [[statute]], it was able to circumvent the ruling from ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_18|title=California Constitution Article XVIII|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210120948/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_18|archive-date=2008-12-10}}</ref> The proposition did not affect [[Domestic partnership in California|domestic partnerships]] in California,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/domestic-gay-marriage-2299598-couples-married|title=Gays would lose few legal rights with marriage ban|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|author=Wisckol, Martin|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> nor (following subsequent legal rulings) did it reverse [[same-sex marriage]]s that had been performed [[:Ex post facto#United States|during the interim period]] May to November 2008 (i.e. after ''In re Marriage Cases'' but before Proposition 8).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/us/27marriage.html|title=California High Court Upholds Gay Marriage Ban|work=The New York Times|author=John Schwartz|date=May 26, 2009|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/same_sex_marriage/index.shtml|title=Same-Sex Married Couples|publisher=California Franchise Tax Board|date=2009-05-26|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}</ref><ref name="wsj">{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=Geoffrey A.|title=Court Rejects State Ban On Gay Marriage|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 8, 2012|author2=Bravin, Jess|pages=A1, A4}}</ref>

Proposition 8 came into immediate effect on November 5, 2008, the day after the elections. Demonstrations and protests occurred across the state and nation.  Same-sex couples and government entities, including couples who had married before then, filed numerous [[lawsuit]]s with the [[California Supreme Court]] challenging the proposition's validity and effect on previously administered same-sex marriages. In ''[[Strauss v. Horton]]'', the California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 8, but allowed the existing same-sex marriages to stand (under the [[grandfather clause]] principle). (Justice [[Carlos R. Moreno]] dissented that exceptions to the [[equal protection clause]] could not be made by any majority since its whole purpose was to protect minorities against the will of a majority.)

Although upheld in State court, Proposition 8 was ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts. In ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', [[United States District Court]] Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] overturned Proposition 8 on August 4, 2010 ruling that it violated both the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Due Process]] and Equal Protection clauses of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ruling by United States District Court|url=http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2010/08/04/Prop-8-Ruling-FINAL.pdf | newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120307020106/http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2010/08/04/Prop-8-Ruling-FINAL.pdf |archive-date= 2012-03-07 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Walker issued a stay ([[injunction]]) against enforcing Proposition 8 and a [[Stay of execution|stay]] to determine suspension of his ruling pending appeal.<ref name="SFChron strikes down">{{cite news|last1=Egelko|first1=Bob|last2=Bulwa|first2=Demian|title=Judge strikes down ban on same-sex marriage|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/04/MNQS1EOR3D.DTL&tsp=1|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name="FOX40 article">{{cite news |last= Keys |first= Matthew |title= Federal Judge: Same Sex Marriage Ban Under Proposition 8 Violates Constitution |url= http://www.fox40.com/news/headlines/ktxl-news-prop8verdict0804,0,598175.story |work= FOX40.com |date= August 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120807063037/http://www.fox40.com/news/headlines/ktxl-news-prop8verdict0804%2C0%2C598175.story |archive-date= 2012-08-07 |url-status= dead }}</ref> The State of California did not appeal the ruling (with which it had agreed anyway) leaving the initiative proponents and one county to seek an appeal.

On appeal, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled the county had no right of appeal, and asked the California Supreme Court to rule whether the proponents of Prop 8 had the right to appeal (known as "[[standing (law)|standing]]") if the State did not do so. The California Supreme Court ruled that they did.

This left the original federal district court ruling against Proposition 8 as the final outcome, and same sex marriages resumed almost immediately afterwards.

===Pre-election legal challenges===

====Petition to remove proposition from ballot====
{{Further|California Constitution#Amendments and revisions}}
On July 16, 2008, the California Supreme Court denied a petition calling for the removal of Proposition 8 from the November ballot. The petition asserted the proposition should not be on the ballot on the grounds it was a constitutional revision that only the legislature or a constitutional convention could place before voters. Opponents also argued that the petitions circulated to qualify the measure for the ballot inaccurately summarized its effect. The court denied the petition without comment.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/politics/cal/la-me-gaymarriage17-2008jul17,0,4823383.story|title=Bid to ban gay marriage will stay on ballot, California Supreme Court rules|last=Dolan|first=Maura|date=July 17, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[David Hiller]]|accessdate=August 7, 2008}}</ref> As a general rule, it is improper for courts to adjudicate pre-election challenges to a measure's substantive validity.<ref name="Costa">Costa v.

====Challenge to title and summary====
The measure was titled: "Eliminates Rights of Same-Sex Couples to Marry. Initiative Constitutional Amendment." The ballot summary read that the measure "changes the California Constitution to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry in California."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i737_07-0068_title_and_summary.pdf |title=Initiative Measure Title and Summary (07-0068) |publisher=California Attorney General |date=November 29, 2007 |access-date=June 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624224338/http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i737_07-0068_title_and_summary.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm |format=PDF |title=Ballot Label (Proposition 8) |publisher=California Secretary of State |date=July 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430043558/http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm |archive-date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref>

Proponents of the measure objected to the wording of the ballot title and summary on the grounds that they were argumentative and prejudicial. The resulting legal petition ''Jansson v.

On July 22, 2008, Proposition 8 supporters mounted a legal challenge to the revised ballot title and summary, contending that Attorney General Brown inserted "language [...] so inflammatory that it will unduly prejudice voters against the measure".<ref name="CNS citation">{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=13415|title=Lawsuit filed to challenge California ballot's 'inflammatory' rewording of marriage amendment|date=August 1, 2008|work=CNA|publisher=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}</ref> Supporters claimed that research showed that an attorney general had never used an active verb like "eliminates" in the title of a [[Referendum|ballot measure]] in the past fifty years in which ballot measures have been used.<ref name="CNS citation" /> Representatives of the attorney general produced twelve examples of ballot measures using the word "eliminates" and vouched for the neutrality and accuracy of the ballot language.<ref name="azcentralsummary">{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/07/28/20080728gaymarriagecalif0728-ON.html|title=Gay marriage foes challenge ballot wording|last=Garrison|first=Jessica|date=July 28, 2008|work=AZ Central.com|accessdate=August 7, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogcabinca.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/A.G.%20RJN.pdf |title= Request for judicial notice in support of opposition to petition for writ of mandate |publisher= Attorney General of the State of California |date= August 4, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327045034/http://blogcabinca.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/A.G.%20RJN.pdf |archive-date= 2009-03-27 |url-status= dead}}</ref>

On August 8, 2008, the California Superior Court turned down the legal challenge, affirming the new title and summary, stating, "the title and summary is not false or misleading because it states that Proposition 8 would 'eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry' in California."  The Superior Court based their decision on the previous ''Marriages Cases'' ruling in which the California Supreme Court held that same-sex couples have a [[constitutional right]] to marry under the California Constitution.<ref name="superiorcourt" /><ref name="sfgatetitleupheld">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/08/BAE5127O2F.DTL&type=politics|title=Judge refuses to order change in Prop. 8 title|last=Egelko|first=Bob|date=August 8, 2008|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 8, 2008}}</ref> That same day, proponents of Prop. 8 filed an emergency appeal with the state [[Appeal|appeals court]].

While turning down the challenge to the title and summary, the California Superior Court also found that the Yes on 8 campaign had overstated its ballot argument on the measure's impact on public schools and ordered a minor change in wording. The original arguments included a claim that the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage requires teachers to tell their students, as young as kindergarten age, that same-sex marriage is the same as opposite-sex marriage. The court said the Yes on 8 argument was false because instruction on marriage is not required and parents can withdraw their children. The court said the ballot argument could be preserved by rewording it to state that teachers "may" or "could" be required to tell children there is no difference between same-sex and opposite-sex marriage.<ref name="sfgatetitleupheld" />

===Campaign funding and spending===
The pro- and anti-Prop 8 campaigns spent a combined $106 million on the campaign.<ref name="Wilson">Reid Wilson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/05/17/the-most-expensive-ballot-initiatives/ The most expensive ballot initiatives], ''Washington Post'' (May 17, 2014).</ref> This was not the most expensive California ballot proposition that year, however; the 2008 campaigns for and against [[California Propositions 94, 95, 96, and 97 (2008)|Propositions 94, 95, 96, and 97]], dealing with the expansion of [[Native American gaming|Native American gambling]], surpassed Prop 8, with combined expenditures of $172 million.<ref name="Wilson"/>

Both proponents and opponents of Proposition 8 made significant use of online tactics for campaigning. For example, over 800 videos were posted on YouTube, most consisting of original content and most taking a position against the Proposition. A greater proportion of 'Yes on 8' videos were scripted and professionally produced. Many 'No on 8' videos recorded demonstrations in the aftermath of the election.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thorson|first=Kjerstin|author2=Brian Ekdale |author3=Porismita Borah |author4=Kang Namkoong |author5=Chirag Shah |title=YouTube and Proposition 8: A case study in video activism|journal=Information, Communication & Society|year=2010|volume=13|issue=3|page=325 |doi=10.1080/13691180903497060|s2cid=142856714}}</ref>

Fresno-area supporters of gay marriage were also harassed; "No On 8" signs at the Clovis [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] were torn up, with Reverend Bryan Jessup alleging that his church experienced [[vandalism]] "every night".<ref name="KFSN1" /> [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] Deputy [[District attorney|District Attorney]] (DDA) Jay Boyarsky attributed a surge in [[Violence against LGBT people|anti-gay hate crimes]], from 3 in 2007 to 14 in 2008, to controversy over Proposition 8.<ref name="hcspike">{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:SJMB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=126FC8991C109DB8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|title=Surge in anti-gay hate crime cases|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=March 16, 2009|accessdate=March 16, 2009|first1=Tracey|last1=Kaplan}}</ref>

==Pre-decision opinion polls==
Various opinion polls were conducted to estimate the outcome of the proposition. Those margins with differences less than their margins of error are marked as "n.s.", meaning not significant (see [[Statistical significance]]). Those margins considered statistically significant are indicated with the percentage points and the side favored in the poll, as either "pro" for in favor of the proposition's passage (e.g., 1% pro), or "con" for against its passage (e.g., 1% con).

According to the director of the Field Poll, the discrepancy between the pre-election polls and ballot results is because "regular church-goers&nbsp;... were more prone than other voters to be influenced by last-minute appeals to conform to orthodox church positions when voting on a [[Social progressivism|progressive social]] issue like same-sex marriage."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/10/EDGQ140F5R.DTL |title=Why Prop. 8 confounded pre-election pollsters |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=November 12, 2008 | first=Mark | last=DiCamillo}}</ref>

Written by [[Reed Cowan]] and narrated by [[Dustin Lance Black]], the film divided critics over a perceived heavy-handed approach to the church's involvement; it won the 2011 [[GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary]].

In 2011, ''[[8 (play)|8]]'', a play re-enacting the proceedings of ''[[Perry v. Brown]]'' in a condensed manner of [[documentary theatre]], was premiered on Broadway.

==Controversies about campaign financing and donations==
On November 13, 2008, Fred Karger of the group Californians Against Hate filed a complaint with the [[California Fair Political Practices Commission]] that [[campaign finance]] reports filed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints under-reported its actual Proposition 8 campaign expenses as $2,078.97.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705258856,00.html | title=LDS Church donates to pro-Prop. 8 group | work=Deseret News | publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date=2008-10-29 | accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/us/politics/26marriage.html?_r=1&ref=us|title=Inquiry Set on Mormon Aid for California Marriage Vote|newspaper=The New York Times|author=McKinley, Jesse|date=2008-11-25|accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref> Karger charged that the Church's failure to report "non-monetary contributions" placed it in violation of California's Political [[Reform Act]]. Church spokesman Scott Trotter denied the charges, saying the church had "fully complied with the reporting requirements" and a "further report will be filed on or before <nowiki>[...the]</nowiki> due date, Jan. 30, 2009."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705262980,00.html?pg=1 | title=Prop 8 foes file complaint against LDS | work=Deseret News | publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date=2008-11-14 | accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>

In a report filed with the California Secretary of State's office January 30, 2009, the LDS Church reported its non-monetary expenditures as $189,903.58.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/Campaign/Committees/Detail.aspx?id=1311334&session=2007 | title=Campaign Finance Summary Information | author=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | publisher=California Secretary of State | date=2009-01-30 | accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> On January 31, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' stated, "While the deadline for the report, which covers the period from July 1 to Dec. 31, is <nowiki>[February 2]</nowiki>, many campaign contributions by major donors and independent committees must be reported within days after they're made."  The article further stated that the executive director of the FPPC stated that the LDS church was still under investigation, and "In general, however, 'cases like these hinge over what had to be reported and when it had to be reported.' A late report covering disputed filings 'wouldn't remove the obligation to file on time' but would be considered by investigators."<ref>{{cite news  |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/31/BA7615KLB9.DTL  |title=Mormon church reports $190,000 Prop. 8 expenses  |accessdate=2009-04-03  |last=Wildermuth|first=John  |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle  |date=2009-01-31}}</ref>

The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reported on February 2, 2009:
<blockquote>While many church members had donated directly to the Yes on 8 campaign—some estimates of Mormon giving range as high as $20&nbsp;million—the church itself had previously reported little direct campaign activity.

But in the filing made Friday, the Mormon church reported thousands in travel expenses, such as [[airline ticket]]s, hotel rooms and [[car rental]]s for the campaign. The church also reported $96,849.31 worth of 'compensated staff time'—hours that church employees spent working to pass the same-sex marriage ban.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/2009_02_02_Mormon_church_reveals_deeper_involvement_in_California_s_Proposition_8/ |title=Mormon church reveals deeper involvement in California's Proposition 8 |newspaper=Boston Herald |date=2 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214004712/http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/2009_02_02_Mormon_church_reveals_deeper_involvement_in_California_s_Proposition_8/ |archive-date=February 14, 2009 }}</ref></blockquote>

In a statement issued February 2, 2009, the LDS Church responded to "erroneous news reports", saying its subsequent disclosure was "in no way prompted by an investigation by the California Fair Political Practices Commission," that "We believe we have complied with California law," and that the report's [[filing date]] met the January 31, 2009 deadline.
<blockquote>The Church, like other organizations on both sides of the ballot issue, was required to publicly file these donations by the 31&nbsp;January deadline. The Church has been filing required contribution reports throughout the campaign. Those earlier donations 'initially stated' were filed for specific time periods prior to this last reporting period, as required by law. Other groups are also filing their final contribution reports to meet the same deadline.<ref>

On January 7, 2009, supporters of Proposition 8 filed a federal lawsuit to block public disclosure of their donations. Alleging threats against their lives as well as other forms of harassment, the lawsuit also requested a [[Injunction|preliminary injunction]] that ordered the California Secretary of State to remove information about donations posted on its website.

{{Main|Strauss v. Horton}}

After the passage of Proposition 8, a number of lawsuits were filed by against the state and state officials with the intent of overturning the measure and arguing that Proposition 8 should not have retroactive effect on existing same-sex marriages. On November 13, 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] asked California Attorney General [[Jerry Brown]] for an opinion on whether the Court should accept these cases for review and whether the measure should be suspended while they decide the case. On November 19, the Court accepted three lawsuits challenging Proposition 8 but denied the requests to stay its enforcement.<ref name=S168047>{{cite news|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/presscenter/newsreleases/NR66-08.PDF|title=California Supreme Court Takes Action on Proposition 8|date=2008-11-19|accessdate=2008-11-19|publisher=Judicial Council of California}}</ref> The Court asked for final briefs by January 5, 2009. [[Oral argument]]s were held on March 5, 2009.

On Tuesday May 26 the court ruled that "The Amendment to the State Constitution referred to as Proposition 8 is valid and enforceable from the moment it was passed."{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The court also held that "Proposition 8 must be understood as creating a limited exception to the state equal protection clause."<ref name="CSC-2009-05-26">{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S168047.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528012646/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S168047.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-05-28 |title=Ruling in ''Strauss, et al. v.

The Court did rule that their decision cannot be applied to retroactively annul marriages that were transacted while the practice was legal in the state of California.<ref name="courtrule"/>  Proposition 8 has no [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] effect. The [[California Supreme Court]] ruled unanimously on May 26, 2009, that the approximately 18,000 [[same-sex marriage]]s that had occurred prior to Proposition 8's passage would still be valid and must continue to be recognized in the state, since the amendment does not state explicitly that it would nullify the [[same-sex marriage]]s performed before it took effect.<ref name="courtrule">{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S168047.PDF |title=Strauss v.

Later legislation clarified that same-sex couples who married out-of-state within the window of legality would also retain their legal marriage rights. The bill was signed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on October 11, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sacramento.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2009/10/12/daily8.html|title=California to recognize some out-of-state gay marriages|publisher=Sacramento Biz Journal|author=Robertson, Kathy|date=2009-10-12|accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref>

==Ballot repeal effort==
On April 30, 2009, the members of 'Yes! on Equality' submitted a ballot initiative dubbed "California Marriage Equality Act" to the [[California Attorney General|Attorney General]]'s office, requesting a title and summary. The text of the ballot would repeal Article I; Section 7.5 of the Californian Constitution as well as clarifying that no school curriculum will be changed and no [[clergy]] will be forced to perform any "service or duty incongruent with their faith". Yes! on Equality had until August 17, 2009, to gather 694,354 signatures in order to qualify for the [[List of California ballot propositions 2010–2019#June 2010|June 2010 ballot]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_j.htm|title=2009 Ballot Measure Update|publisher=[[California Secretary of State]]|accessdate=2009-06-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605022341/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_j.htm|archive-date=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i808_initiative_09-0011.pdf|title=California Marriage Equality Act|publisher=[[California Secretary of State]]|date=2009-05-30|accessdate=2009-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710182402/http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i808_initiative_09-0011.pdf|archive-date=2009-07-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> A petition for initiative for the [[List of California ballot propositions 2010–2019#November 2010|November 2010 ballot]] also failed to obtain enough signatures.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63B5N620100412 | title=Gay marriage fails to get on California ballot | first=Peter | last=Henderson | date=2010-04-12 | work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/13/local/la-me-gay-marriage13-2010apr13 | title=Prop. 8 repeal fails to qualify for November ballot | first=Maura | last=Dolan | work=Los Angeles Times | date=2010-04-13}}</ref>

==Legal challenges==

Following the passing of Proposition 8 in 2008, and the subsequent mass protests, several lawsuits were filed in both the [[California Supreme Court|State Supreme Court]] and in the [[Federal District Court]].

=== State court: ''Strauss v. Horton'' ===
{{main|Strauss v. Horton}}
In considering the cases within the state courts, on November 13, 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] asked California Attorney General [[Jerry Brown]] for an opinion on whether the Court should accept these cases for review and whether the measure should be suspended while they decide the case. On November 19, the Court accepted three lawsuits challenging Proposition 8, which consolidated into ''[[Strauss v. Horton]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/presscenter/newsreleases/NR66-08.PDF |title=California Supreme Court Takes Action on Proposition 8 |date=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=November 19, 2008 |publisher=Judicial Council of California}}</ref> The Court rendered its decision on May 26, 2009. The majority decision was that Proposition 8 "carved out a limited [or 'narrow'] exception to the state equal protection clause"; [[Carlos R. Moreno|Justice Moreno]] dissented that exceptions to the [[equal protection clause]] could not be made by any majority since its whole purpose was to protect minorities against the will of a majority. Until overturned by ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' (below), the ruling established that Proposition 8 was valid as voted, but that marriages performed before it went into effect would remain valid.

On August 4, 2010, U.S. District Chief Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] overturned Proposition 8, stating it is "...unconstitutional under the [[Due Process Clause]] because no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry."<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry v Schwarzeneggar (pg 113–114)|url=https://www.scribd.com/goodasyou/d/35374462-California-Prop-8-Ruling-August-2010|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> The court also determined that "Proposition 8 violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] because there is no rational basis for limiting the designation of 'marriage' to opposite-sex couples."<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry v Schwarzeneggar (pp. 119–122)|url=https://www.scribd.com/goodasyou/d/35374462-California-Prop-8-Ruling-August-2010|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>  The court also [[stay of execution|stayed]] the ruling; the voter initiative was to remain in effect pending appeal.<ref name="SFChron strikes down" /> On August 12, Walker announced his decision to lift the [[stay of execution|stay]] (which would have allowed same-sex marriages to be performed) {{as of|2010|August|18|lc=y|df=US}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judge Sets End to Ban on Gay Marriage in California|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/us/13prop.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=August 12, 2010 | first=Jesse | last=McKinley | date=August 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Final Stay Order|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/35799834/Final-Stay-Order?tsp=1|publisher=scribd.com|accessdate=August 12, 2010}}</ref>
However, on August 16, 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] indefinitely extended the District Court's stay, stopping new same-sex marriages in the state of California pending appeal. It also scheduled an accelerated time table for hearing an appeal of Walker's ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/17/2984912.htm?section=world|title=California gay marriages on hold again|last=Reuters|date=August 17, 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref>

====''Perry v. Brown'' (on appeal)====
As the State of California chose not to appeal the ruling, an appeal was sought by two parties—the initiative proponents, and Imperial County (via its deputy clerk). The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] considered the question of [[standing (law)|standing]] first. On January 4, 2011, the Ninth Circuit ruled that [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]] did not have [[Standing (law)|standing]] to intervene in the lawsuit (by now called ''Perry v. Brown'')—the formal reason being the county's appeal had been "untimely", but also that the appellant was the county's deputy clerk, and precedent existed in other cases that a deputy clerk could not 'represent' a county.

To address the question whether the initiative proponents had particularized standing (that is, standing either via personal interest, or standing to represent the State's interest), the Ninth Circuit [[Certified question|certified a question]] to the [[California Supreme Court]] on January 4, 2011, asking that court to rule whether, under the California Constitution or otherwise under California law, non-governmental proponents of an [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative]] have standing to appeal when the State is no longer willing to defend it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wisckol |first=Martin |url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/gay-282710-court-marriage.html |title=Prop. 8 gay marriage ruling hits detour |publisher=Ocregister.com |date=January 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> On February 16, 2011, the California Supreme Court unanimously agreed to address the Ninth Circuit's request.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://us.cnn.com/2011/US/02/16/california.proposition.8/ |title=California Supreme Court to decide issue in same-sex marriage ban case |publisher=CNN |date=February 16, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The court set an expedited schedule for the [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/17/local/la-me-proposition8-20110217 |title=California Supreme Court reenters Proposition 8 fray |first=Maura |last=Dolan |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref> and heard [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] on September 6, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |date=September 7, 2011 |title=Yesterday's Hearing On Standing In The Prop 8 Case: Full Video, Reactions |author=Andy Towle |url=http://www.towleroad.com/2011/09/prop8full.html#ixzz1ewYFwGOB}}</ref> On November 17, 2011, the California Supreme Court issued an [[Advisory opinion#United States|advisory opinion]] that the proponents of Proposition 8 did have [[Standing (law)|standing]], and could defend it.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Ariane de Vogue |date=November 17, 2011 |title=Prop 8: California Supreme Court Rules Sponsors Can Continue Case |url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/11/prop-8-california-supreme-court-rules-sponsors-can-continue-case/ |work=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite court |date=11/17/11 |litigants=Perry v Brown |court=California Supreme Court |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S189476.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219213100/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S189476.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-12-19}}</ref>

=====Ninth Circuit ruling=====
[[File:Seal of the United States Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit.svg|thumb|right|200px|Seal of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]
On February 7, 2012, a [[Judicial panel|three-judge panel]] on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 2–1 [[majority opinion]] affirming the judgment in ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', which declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional, saying it violated the [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clause. The opinion, written by [[Stephen Reinhardt|Judge Stephen Reinhardt]] and joined by [[Michael Daly Hawkins|Judge Michael Hawkins]], states that Proposition 8 did nothing more than lessen the status and dignity of gays and lesbians, and classify their relationships and families as inferior to those of opposite-sex couples.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry v Brown (pg 5)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/80680002/10-16696-398-Decision|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> The court found that the people of California, by using their initiative power to target a [[minority group]] and withdraw the right to marry they once possessed under the [[California State Constitution]], violated the federal Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry v Brown (pg 79–80)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/80680002/10-16696-398-Decision|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>

The court concluded that the trial court had correctly found Proposition 8 to have no purpose other than to impose the majority's private [[disapproval voting|disapproval]] of gays, lesbians, and their relationships through the [[public law]], and to take away from them the designation of [[civil marriage|marriage]] and its recognized societal status.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry v Brown (pg 77)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/80680002/10-16696-398-Decision|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> The [[Perry v. Brown#Findings of fact|findings of fact]] and [[expert witness]] testimony in [[trial court|District Court]] played an important role in this appellate decision, emphasizing that it is unreasonable to believe Proposition 8 was enacted to: promote [[childrearing]] by biological parents, encourage procreation, be cautious in [[social change]], protect [[freedom of religion|religious liberty]], or control children's education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry v Brown (pg 69)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/80680002/10-16696-398-Decision|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> The court declared that it is "implausible to think that denying two men or two women the right to call themselves married could somehow bolster the stability of families headed by one man and one woman".<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry v Brown (pg 63)|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/80680002/10-16696-398-Decision|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Court: Calif. gay-marriage ban unconstitutional |agency=CBS/AP |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 7, 2012 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57372620/court-calif-gay-marriage-ban-unconstitutional/ |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>

The dissenting judge, [[N. Randy Smith|Judge N.

On February 21, 2012, proponents requested to have to the case reviewed [[en banc]] by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.<ref name="proponentsEnBanc">{{cite news|title=Prop. 8 backers seek full review by appeals court|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/22/local/la-me-prop8-appeal-20120222|accessdate=February 29, 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=February 22, 2012|first=Maura|last=Dolan}}</ref> If granted, en banc review could have taken a year or more, which would have delayed possible U.S. Supreme Court review.<ref name="proponentsEnBanc" /> Pending the appeal, a [[stay of execution|stay]] was continued, barring any marriages from taking place.<ref name="guardian120207">{{cite news |last=McVeigh |first=Karen |title=Prop 8: California gay marriage ban struck down by federal appeals court |work=The Guardian  |date=February 7, 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/prop-8-california-gay-marriage-ban-struck-down |accessdate=February 8, 2012 |location=London}}</ref> On June 5, 2012, the full Ninth Circuit refused to rehear the case; the stay would remain in place pending final action by the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_20786293/proposition-8-case-headed-u-s-supreme-court |title=California's Proposition 8 case headed to U.S. Supreme Court |publisher=Mercurynews.com |accessdate=November 15, 2012|date=2012-06-05 }}</ref>

The Ninth Court's ruling was subsequently vacated (withdrawn) although it affirmed the district court ruling, since the Supreme Court later determined that the proponents of Proposition 8 had not had [[standing (law)|standing]] to appeal the district court's ruling.

====''Hollingsworth v. Perry'' (U.S. Supreme Court)====
The proposition's proponents filed a petition for [[certiorari]] with the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on July 30, 2012, requesting that the Supreme Court review the case.<ref>{{cite web |author=Denniston, Lyle |title="Proposition 8" defenders' appeal filed (FINAL UPDATE) |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/07/proposition-8-appeal-filed/ |publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]] |date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012}}</ref>  Briefs in opposition both from the individual respondents and from the City and County of San Francisco were filed August 24, and the petitioners replied on September 4.<ref name="SCOTUS_docket_12-144">''Hollingsworth v.

To have standing, they "must have suffered an injury in fact, thus giving [them] a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of the issue in dispute".<ref name="nytbetweenlines" /> Because no injury had been shown, the appeal to the Ninth Circuit should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. (This only applied to the Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court cases.) The Court returned the case to the Ninth Circuit with instructions to dismiss the appeal. This left the district court's ruling overturning Proposition 8 as the final ruling in the case. Because the appeal was decided on the question of standing, the Supreme Court did not examine nor rule on whether in their view Proposition 8 had violated the U.S. Constitution.

Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], writing for the minority, said the views of the California Supreme Court on the proponents' standing should have been respected,<ref name="nytbetweenlines" /> because "the basic premise of the initiative process [and] the essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government, not the other way around".<ref name="scopinion" />{{rp|13}}

On June 28, 2013, the Ninth Circuit lifted its stay of the district court's ruling, enabling same-sex marriages to resume;<ref name="latimes.com" /> minutes afterward, plaintiffs Perry and Stier became the first couple in California to legally wed under state law since the enactment of Proposition 8 in 2008, doing so at San Francisco City Hall at 4:45 PDT, with California's Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]]  officiating at the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news |title=Same-sex marriages resume in Calif.: San Francisco plaintiffs in Prop. 8 ruling are first couple to wed after appellate action. |last1=Winter |first1=Michael |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/28/california-gay-marriage/2474109/ |newspaper=USA Today |date=June 28, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>

There were two legal challenges made to the implementation of the ruling, both subsequently denied:

'''State court legal challenges to statewide implementation of ruling'''
{{block indent|Even before the Ninth Circuit lifted its stay, Proposition 8 proponents had expressed the intent to fight on, by asserting that the ruling only applies to the persons or counties involved and would be unlawful for other couples or counties to comply with it.<ref name="LA Times 6-27">[https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-prop8-supreme-court-20130626,0,4307010.story Goodbye and good riddance to Prop. 8]—''Los Angeles Times'', editorial, June 27, 2013</ref>

Two petitions to this effect were filed with the California Supreme Court, by proponents (''Hollingsworth v. O'Connell and Brown'', July 12, 2013) and—against county policy—by a [[San Diego]] County Clerk (''Dronenburg'', July 19, 2013: dropped August 2 as duplicative). The proponents' petition challenged the state and county clerk responses to the ruling in ''Perry'', asserting that, in their view, only two counties were affected by the ruling and other counties had no legal capacity to discretionally do likewise; that the plaintiffs, not representing a [[class action|class]], had their relief while others who were not plaintiffs had no change to their position within the law; and that county clerks were not in fact covered by the ruling and were therefore bound to comply with the law as it stood.

This position was rejected by California's governor, who on legal advice<ref name="sfgate 07-12">[http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Prop-8-backers-ask-court-to-stop-weddings-4662269.php Prop. 8 backers ask court to stop weddings] SFGate, 2013-07-12, by Bob Egelko.</ref> ordered the change to license issuance, according to the ruling.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Same-sex-marriage-foes-file-suit-in-clerk-s-name-4676171.php Same-sex marriage foes file suit in clerk's name]—SFGate 2013-07-19, by Bob Egelko.</ref> California's Attorney General [[Kamala Harris]] noted that "state officials are obligated to govern marriage equally in all counties and that [United States District Court for the Northern District of California Chief Judge Vaughn] Walker's ruling specifically covers those officials."<ref name="LA Times 6-27" /> [[San Francisco]]'s city attorney stated that it was "the most basic concepts of American law ... that a state court will not overrule the federal judiciary".<ref name="sfgate 07-12" /> Twenty-four [[County Clerk]]s  stated, through their lawyer, that their role was "ultimately state supervised" and it would be unfeasible to have a "patchwork" of different marriage criteria varying between the counties of a single state.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/lgbt/article/24-Calif-county-clerks-back-same-sex-marriages-4680582.php 24 Calif. county clerks back same-sex marriages]—''SFGate'', 2013-07-22, by Bob Egelko.</ref>
