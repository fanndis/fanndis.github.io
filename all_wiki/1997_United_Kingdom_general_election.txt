The '''1997 United Kingdom general election''' was held on 1 May 1997. The incumbent governing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led by Prime Minister [[John Major]] was defeated in a [[landslide victory#United Kingdom|landslide]] by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Tony Blair]].

The political backdrop of campaigning focused on public opinion towards a change in government. [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]], [[Tony Blair]] focused on transforming his party through a more [[centrism|centrist]] policy platform, entitled '[[New Labour]]', with promises towards [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] referendums for [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], fiscal responsibility, and Blair's decision to nominate [[all-women shortlists|more female politicians]] for constituencies. Major sought to rebuild public trust in the Conservatives following a series of scandals, including the events of [[Black Wednesday]] in 1992,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/202525.stm |title=UK Politics - The Major Scandal Sheet |publisher=BBC}}</ref> through campaigning on the strength of the economic recovery following the [[early 1990s recession]], but faced divisions within the party over the UK's membership of the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Opinion polls during campaigning showed strong support for Labour due to the popularity of Blair amongst voters{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}, and Blair won a personal public endorsement from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper two months before the vote.<ref name="Labour Sun Endorse"/> The final result of the election on 2 May 1997 revealed that Labour had won a landslide majority, making a net gain of 146 seats and winning 43.2% of the vote. The Conservatives, meanwhile, suffered defeat with a net loss of 178 seats, despite winning 30.7% of the vote. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], under the leadership of [[Paddy Ashdown]], made a net gain of 28 seats, winning 16.8% of the vote.

The overall result of the election ended 18 years of Conservative government, in their worst defeat since [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]], a defeat which left them devoid of any MPs outside of England, only 17 MPs north of the Midlands, and less than 20% of MPs in London.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Immediately following the election Major resigned both as Prime Minister and as [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|party leader]]. Labour's victory, the largest achieved in their history and by any political party in British politics since the [[World War II|Second World War]], led to the party's first of three consecutive terms in power lasting 13 years, with Blair as the newly appointed [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. The Liberal Democrats' success in the election, in part due to anti-Conservative [[tactical voting]],<ref name="LSEtactical">{{cite web |last1=Hermann |first1=Michael |last2=Munzert |first2=Simon |last3=Selb |first3=Peter |title=The conventional wisdom about tactical voting is wrong |url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-conventional-wisdom-about-tactical-voting-is-wrong/ |website=London School of Economics British Politics and Policy blog |publisher=London School of Economics |accessdate=7 July 2020 |date=2015-11-04}}</ref> both strengthened Ashdown's leadership and the party's position as a strong [[Third party (politics)|third party]], having won the highest number of seats by any third party since [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]].

Although the Conservatives lost many ministers such as [[Michael Portillo]], [[Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree|Tony Newton]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]], [[Ian Lang]] and [[William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill|William Waldegrave]] and controversial MPs such as [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Jonathan Aitken]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Election.

==Overview==
[[File:Labour's five year pledge.jpg|thumb|Labour's five-year pledge]]
The British economy had been in recession at the time of the 1992 election, which the Conservatives had won, and although the recession had ended within a year, events such as [[Black Wednesday]] had tarnished the Conservative government's reputation for economic management. Labour had elected [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as its party leader in 1992, but his death from a heart attack in 1994 led the way for [[Tony Blair]] to become Labour leader.

Blair brought the party closer to the political [[centrism|centre]] and abolished the party's Clause IV in their constitution, which had committed them to mass nationalisation of industry. Labour also reversed its policy on unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]] and the events of Black Wednesday allowed Labour to promise greater economic management under the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellorship]] of [[Gordon Brown]]. A manifesto, entitled [[New Labour, New Life For Britain]] was released in 1996 and outlined five key pledges:

* Class sizes to be cut to 30 or under for 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds by using money from the assisted places scheme.
* Fast track punishment for persistent young offenders, by halving the time from arrest to sentencing.
* Cut [[National Health Service|NHS]] waiting lists by treating an extra 100,000 patients as a first step by releasing £100 million saved from NHS red tape.
* Get 250,000 under-25-year-olds off benefit and into work by using money from a windfall levy on the privatised utilities.
* No rise in income tax rates, cut [[VAT]] on heating to 5%, and keeping inflation and interest rates as low as possible.

Disputes within the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government over [[European Union]] issues, and a variety of "sleaze" allegations had severely affected the government's popularity. Despite the strong economic recovery and substantial fall in unemployment in the four years leading up to the election, the rise in Conservative support was only marginal with all of the major opinion polls having shown Labour in a comfortable lead since late 1992.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm |work=BBC News |title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule |date=15 April 2005 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>

== Loss of parliamentary majority ==
Following the 1992 general election, the Conservatives held government with 336 of the 651 House of Commons seats. Through a series of defections and by-election defeats, the Conservative government gradually lost its absolute majority in the House of Commons. By 1997, the Conservatives held only 324 House of Commons seats (and had not won a by-election since [[1989 Richmond (Yorks) by-election|1989]]).

==Timing==
The previous Parliament first sat on 29 April 1992. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] required at the time for each Parliament to be dissolved before the fifth anniversary of its first sitting; therefore, the latest date the dissolution and the summoning of the next parliament could have been held on was 28 April 1997.

The [[Representation of the People Act 1985|1985 amendment]] of the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] required that the election must take place on the eleventh [[Business day|working day]] after the deadline for nomination papers, which in turn must be no more than six working days after the next parliament was summoned.

Therefore, the latest date the election could have been held on was 22 May 1997 (which happened to be a Thursday). British elections (and [[referendum]]s) have been held on Thursdays by convention since the 1930s, but can be held on other working days.

==Campaign==
Prime Minister [[John Major]] called the election on Monday 17 March 1997, ensuring the formal campaign would be unusually long, at six weeks (Parliament was [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolved]] on 8 April).<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1997/mar/17/dissolution-of-parliament |title=House of Lords Debates 17 March 1997 vol 579 cc653-4: Dissolution of Parliament |work=House of Lords Hansard |accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref> The election was scheduled for 1 May, to coincide with the [[1997 United Kingdom local elections|local elections]] on the same day. This set a precedent, as the three subsequent general elections were also held alongside the May local elections.

The Conservatives argued that a long campaign would expose Labour and allow the Conservative message to be heard. However, Major was accused of arranging an early dissolution to protect [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] from a pending parliamentary report into his conduct: a report that Major had earlier guaranteed would be published before the election.

In March 1997, soon after the election was called, [[Asda]] introduced a range of election-themed beers, these being 'Major's Mild', 'Tony's Tipple' and 'Ashdown's Ale'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/advertising-promotion-ads-contract-election-fever/60527 |title=Advertising & Promotion: Ads contract election fever|work=Campaign|date=20 March 1997 |accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref>

===Conservative campaign===
The Conservative Party began low in the polls, and had experienced great difficulties over the previous five years, with polling often putting it some 40 points adrift of Labour.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Major hoped that a long campaign would expose Labour's "hollowness" and the Conservative campaign emphasised stability, as did its manifesto title 'You can only be sure with the Conservatives'.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=4}} However, the campaign was beset by deep-set problems, such as the rise of [[James Goldsmith]]'s [[Referendum Party]] which advocated a referendum on continued membership of the European Union. The party threatened to take away many right-leaning voters from the Conservatives. Furthermore, about 200 candidates broke with official Conservative policy to oppose British membership of the [[Euro|single European currency]].<ref name="Single currency 1997">Travis, Alan (17 April 1997). "Rebels' seven-year march". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> Major fought back, saying: "Whether you agree with me or disagree with me; like me or loathe me, don't bind my hands when I am negotiating on behalf of the British nation." The moment is remembered as one of the defining, and most surreal, moments of the election.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/election-97--john-major-takes-on-the-tories-1267550.html |title=Election '97: John Major takes on the Tories |last=Bevins |first=Anthony |date=17 April 1997 |work=The Independent |access-date=19 December 2015 }}</ref>{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=4}}

Meanwhile, there was also division amongst the Conservative cabinet, with Chancellor [[Kenneth Clarke]] describing the views of Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]] on Europe as "paranoid and xenophobic nonsense". The Conservatives also struggled to come up with a definitive theme to attack Labour, with some strategists arguing for an approach which castigated Labour for "stealing Tory clothes" (copying their positions), with others making the case for a more confrontational approach, stating that "New Labour" was just a façade for "old Labour".

The [[New Labour, New Danger]] poster, which depicted [[Tony Blair]] with demon eyes, was an example of the latter strategy. Major veered between the two approaches, which left [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Conservative Central Office]] staff frustrated. As [[Andrew Cooper, Baron Cooper of Windrush|Andrew Cooper]] explained: "We repeatedly tried and failed to get him to understand that you couldn't say that they were dangerous and copying you at the same time."{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=35}} In any case, the campaign failed to gain much traction, and the Conservatives went down to a landslide defeat at the polls.

===Labour campaign===
Labour ran a slick campaign, which emphasised the splits within the Conservative government, and argued that the country needed a more centrist administration. Labour ran a centrist campaign that was good at picking up dissatisfied Conservative voters, particularly moderate and suburban ones. [[Tony Blair]], highly popular, was very much the centrepiece of the campaign, and proved a highly effective campaigner.

The Labour campaign was reminiscent of those of [[Bill Clinton]] for the US Presidency, focusing on centrist themes, as well as adopting policies more commonly associated with the right, such as cracking down on crime and fiscal responsibility. The influence of political "spin" came into great effect for Labour at this point, as media centric figures such as Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson provided a clear cut campaign, and establishing a relatively new political brand "[[New Labour]]" with enviable success.

===Liberal Democrat campaign===
The Liberal Democrats had suffered a disappointing performance in 1992, but they were very much strengthened in 1997 due in part to potential tactical voting between Labour and Lib Dem supporters in Conservative marginal constituencies, particularly in the south - which explains why while given their share of the vote decreased, their number of seats nearly doubled.<ref name="LSEtactical" /> The Lib Dems promised to increase education funding paid for by a 1p increase in income tax.

==Endorsements==
*In a sign of the change of direction which 'New Labour' represented, they were endorsed by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' (with a famous front page "The Sun Backs Blair"),<ref name="Labour Sun Endorse">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/18/past.roygreenslade|title=It's the Sun wot's switched sides to back Blair|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|date=18 March 1997|work=The Guardian}}</ref> as well as the more left-leaning newspapers the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Independent (newspaper)|The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/may/04/general-election-newspaper-support|title=Newspaper support in UK general elections|first=Katy|last=Stoddard|date=4 May 2010|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

[[File:1997_UK_Election_Notional_Result.png|right|thumb| The notional results of the 1992 election, as shown on a map of the 1997 constituencies.]]

==Results==
Labour won a [[landslide victory]] with its largest parliamentary majority (179) to date. On the BBC's election night programme [[Anthony King (professor)|Professor Anthony King]] described the result of the exit poll, which accurately predicted a Labour landslide, as being akin to "an asteroid hitting the planet and destroying practically all life on Earth". After years of trying, Labour had convinced the electorate that they would usher in a new age of prosperity—their policies, organisation and tone of optimism slotting perfectly into place.

Labour's victory was largely credited to the charisma of [[Tony Blair]] and a Labour public relations machine managed by [[Alastair Campbell]] and [[Peter Mandelson]]. Between the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 election]] and the 1997 election there had also been major steps to "modernise" the party, including scrapping [[Clause IV]] that had committed the party to extending public ownership of industry. Labour had suddenly seized the middle ground of the political spectrum, attracting voters much further to the right than their traditional working class or left wing support. In the early hours of 2 May 1997 a party was held at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], in which Blair stated that "a new dawn has broken, has it not?".

The election was a crushing defeat for the Conservative Party, with the party having its lowest percentage share of the popular vote since [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832]] under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]'s leadership, being [[Wipeout (elections)|wiped out]] in Scotland and [[Wales]]. A number of prominent Conservative MPs lost their seats in the election, including [[Michael Portillo]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]], [[Edwina Currie]], [[David Mellor]], [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Norman Lamont]]. Such was the extent of Conservative losses at the election that [[Cecil Parkinson]], speaking on the BBC's election night programme, joked upon the Conservatives winning their second seat that he was pleased that the subsequent election for the leadership would be contested.

The Liberal Democrats more than doubled their number of seats thanks to the use of tactical voting against the Conservatives.<ref name="LSEtactical" /> Although their share of the vote fell slightly, their total of 46 MPs was the highest for any UK Liberal party since [[David Lloyd George]] led the party to 59 seats in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]].

The Referendum Party, which sought a [[referendum]] on the United Kingdom's relationship with the [[European Union]], came fourth in terms of votes with 800,000 votes mainly from former Conservative voters,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} but won no seats in parliament. The six parties with the next highest votes stood only in either [[Scotland]], Northern Ireland or [[Wales]]; in order, they were the [[Scottish National Party]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Sinn Féin]], and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

In the previously safe seat of [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]], where incumbent Conservative MP [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] was facing charges of having taken [[cash for questions]], the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties decided not to field candidates in order that an independent candidate, [[Martin Bell]], would have a better chance of winning the seat, which he did with a comfortable margin.

The result declared for the constituency of [[Winchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Winchester]] showed a margin of victory of just two votes for the Liberal Democrats. The defeated Conservative candidate mounted a successful legal challenge to the result on the grounds that errors by election officials (failures to stamp certain votes) had changed the result; the court ruled the result invalid and ordered a [[1997 Winchester by-election|by-election]] on 20 November which was won by the Liberal Democrats with a much larger majority, causing much recrimination in the Conservative Party about the decision to challenge the original result in the first place.

This election saw a doubling of the number of women in parliament, from 60 elected in 1992 to 120 elected in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Richard |title=Women in the House of Commons: Background Paper |url=https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06651/ |website=House of Commons Library |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=8 July 2020 |date=2018-08-21}}</ref> 102 of them were on the Labour benches - controversially described as [[Blair Babe]]s - driven by the Labour Party’s 1993 policy (ruled illegally discriminatory in 1996) of [[all-women shortlist]]s.

==Post-election events==
The poor results for the Conservative Party led to infighting, with the [[One Nation Conservatism|One Nation]] group, [[Tory Reform Group]], and right-wing [[Maastricht Rebels]] blaming each other for the defeat. Party chairman [[Brian Mawhinney]] said on the night of the election that defeat was due to disillusionment with 18 years of Conservative rule. [[John Major]] resigned as party leader, saying "When the curtain falls, it is time to leave the stage".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/interview/major-players-1990-generation|title=Major players: The 1990 generation|date=2014-01-03|website=TotalPolitics.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>

Following the defeat, the Conservatives began their longest continuous spell in [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] in the history of the present day (post–[[Tamworth Manifesto]]) Conservative Party, and indeed the longest such spell for any incarnation of the [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]]/Conservatives since the 1760s, lasting 13 years, including the whole of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kettle|first=Martin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/13/cameron-clegg-liberal-bold-risk|title=Tories rule: but liberal Tories with a New Labour legacy|date=2010-05-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Throughout this period, their representation in the Commons remained consistently below 200 MPs.

Meanwhile Paddy Ashdown's continued leadership of the Liberal Democrats was assured, and they were felt to be in a position to build positively as a strong third party into the new millennium,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge97lib.shtml|title=BBC Politics 97|publisher=BBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> culminating in their sharing power in the [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|2010 coalition with the Conservatives]].

==Internet coverage==
With the huge rise in internet use since the previous general election, [[BBC News]] created a special website - BBC Politics 97 - covering the election.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Politics 97 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/ |website=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 July 2020 |year=1997}}</ref> This site was an experiment for the efficiency of [[BBC News Online|an online news service]] which was due for a launch later in the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freshnetworks.com/blog/2008/06/major-events-influenced-bbcs-news-online |title=Major events influenced BBC's news online &#124; FreshNetworks blog |publisher=Freshnetworks.com |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228193301/http://www.freshnetworks.com/blog/2008/06/major-events-influenced-bbcs-news-online/ |archive-date=28 December 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
