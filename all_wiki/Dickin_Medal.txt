Maria Dickin was the founder of the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] (PDSA), a British [[veterinary]] charity.  She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with [[British Empire]] armed forces or civil emergency services.  The medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949 – to 32 [[pigeons]], 18 [[dogs]], 3 [[horses]], and a [[ship's cat]] – to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the [[Second World War]] and subsequent conflicts.

The awarding of the medal was revived in 2000. In December 2007, 12 former recipients buried at the [[Ilford Animal Cemetery|PDSA Animal Cemetery]] in [[Ilford]], Essex, were afforded full military honours at the conclusion of a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]-aided project to restore the cemetery.<ref>{{Cite news| title =A better resting place for the animal VCs|author=Clout, Laura |work=The Daily Telegraph| date=14 December 2007|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/media-pr-centre/news/celebrity-to-open-animal-garden-of-remembrance | title = Celebrity to open animal Garden of Remembrance | accessdate = 2 March 2010 | publisher = PDSA | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174301/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/media-pr-centre/news/celebrity-to-open-animal-garden-of-remembrance | archivedate = 18 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The first recipients of the award, in December 1943, were three pigeons serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] who contributed to the recovery of aircrews from ditched aircraft.<ref name=pdsa /> The most recent recipient is Kuno, a [[Belgian Malinois]] who served with the [[Special Boat Service]] in [[Afghanistan]].<ref name= Kuno>{{cite web|title= Medal for hero dog Kuno which saved soldiers' lives in Afghanistan |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53949310|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 August 2020|date=29 August 2020}}</ref>
