She has continued writing for other artists since then. King's success as a performer in her own right did not come until the 1970s, when she sang her own songs, accompanying herself on the piano, in a series of albums and concerts. After experiencing commercial disappointment with her debut album ''[[Writer (album)|Writer]]'', King scored her breakthrough with the album ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'', which topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks in 1971 and remained on the charts for more than six years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caroleking.com/news/tapestry-jumps-15-7-billboards-top-pop-catalog-chart |title='Tapestry' Jumps from number 15 to number 7 on Billboard's Top Pop Catalog Chart |publisher=Carole King |date=October 12, 2001 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>

==1960s==
During the sixties, with King composing the music and Goffin writing the lyrics, the two wrote [[List of songs written by Goffin and King|a string of classic songs]] for a variety of artists.<ref name=caroleking /> King and Goffin were also the songwriting team behind Don Kirshner's [[Dimension Records]], which produced songs including "[[Chains (The Cookies song)|Chains]]" (later recorded by [[the Beatles]]), "[[The Loco-Motion]]", "[[Keep Your Hands off My Baby]]" both two for their babysitter [[Little Eva]], and "[[It Might as Well Rain Until September]]" which King recorded herself in 1962—her first hit.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dimension Album Discography |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/nyc/dimension/dimension.html |publisher=Both Sides Now Publications |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref> King recorded a few follow-up singles in the wake of "September", but none of them sold much, and her already sporadic recording career was entirely abandoned (albeit temporarily) by 1966.

Other songs of King's early period (through 1967) include "Half Way To Paradise" [Tony Orlando, recorded by Billy Fury in U.K.], "[[Take Good Care of My Baby]]" for [[Bobby Vee]], "[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]" for [[the Drifters]], "[[I'm into Something Good]]" for [[Earl-Jean]] (later recorded by [[Herman's Hermits]]), "[[One Fine Day (song)|One Fine Day]]" for [[the Chiffons]], and "[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]" for [[the Monkees]] (inspired by their move to suburban [[West Orange, New Jersey]]),<ref>La Gorce, Tammy.

By 1968, Goffin and King were divorced and were starting to lose contact.<ref name= weller-girls /> King moved to [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] in Los Angeles with her two daughters and reactivated her recording career by forming "The City", a music trio consisting of Charles Larkey, her future husband, on bass; [[Danny Kortchmar]] on guitar and vocals; and King on piano and vocals.<ref name=caroleking>{{cite book |url=http://www.caroleking.com/bio |title=Bio &#124; Carole King |work= caroleking.com |accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PT563 |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |author=Alex Ogg |page=556 |publisher=Rough Guides |date= November 1, 2003 |isbn=9781843531050 |accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-city-p16511 |title=The City |website=Allmusic |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref> The City produced one album, ''Now That Everything's Been Said'' in 1968, but King's reluctance to perform live meant sales were slow.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5lgPm5eq40C&pg=PA22 |title=The Words and Music of Carole King |first= James E.| last= Perone |page=22 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=9780275990275 |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref>  A change of distributors meant that the album was quickly deleted; the group disbanded in 1969.<ref name=now>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/now-that-everythings-been-said-r33221 |title=Now That Everything's Been Said – The City |website=Allmusic |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref>  The album was re-discovered by Classic Rock radio in the early 1980s and the cut "Snow Queen" received nominal airplay for a few years.  Cleveland's [[WMMS]] played it every few weeks from 1981 to 1985, and the long-out-of-print LP became sought after by fans of Carole King who like the edgy sound of the music.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==1970s, ''Tapestry''==
[[File:Carole King - Capitol.jpg|thumb|King about 1977]]
While in Laurel Canyon, King met [[James Taylor]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] as well as Toni Stern, with whom she collaborated on songs.<ref name=biography /> King made her first solo album, ''[[Writer (album)|Writer]]'', in 1970 for Lou Adler's Ode label, with Taylor playing acoustic guitar and providing backing vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.lightintheattic.net/wp-content/uploads/Carole-LouAdler_Photo-JimMcCrary.jpg|title=Photo of King with Lou Adler|website=Blog.lightintheattic.net|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref> It peaked at number 84 in the ''Billboard'' Top 200. The same year, King played keyboards on [[B.B. King]]'s album ''[[Indianola Mississippi Seeds]]''.

King followed ''Writer'' in 1971 with ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'', which featured new compositions as well as reinterpretations of  "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman." The album was recorded concurrently with Taylor's ''[[Mud Slide Slim]],'' with an overlapping set of musicians including King, [[Danny Kortchmar]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. Both albums included "[[You've Got a Friend]]", which was a number 1 hit for Taylor; King said in a 1972 interview that she "didn't write it with James or anybody really specifically in mind.

In 1973, King performed a free concert in New York City's [[Central Park]] with 100,000 attending.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistfacts.com/detail.php?id=226& |title=Carole King Artistfacts |publisher=Artistfacts.com |date=February 9, 1942 |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

In September 1974, King released her album ''[[Wrap Around Joy]],'' which was certified gold on October 16, 1974, and entered the top ten at 7 on October 19, 1974. Two weeks later it reached 1 and stayed there one week.  ''Wrap Around Joy'' spawned two hits. "[[Jazzman]]" was a single and reached 2 on November 9 but fell out of the top ten the next week. "[[Nightingale (Carole King song)|Nightingale]]", a single on December 17, went to No. 9 on March 1, 1975.

In 1975, King scored songs for the animated TV production of [[Maurice Sendak]]'s ''[[Really Rosie]]'', released as an album by the same name, with lyrics by Sendak.

''[[Thoroughbred (Carole King album)|Thoroughbred]]'' (1976) was the last studio album she made under the Ode label.<ref name= waddy>{{cite web |url=http://waddywachtelinfo.com/CaroleKing.html |title=Carole King – Thoroughbred 1976 Album and Tour |publisher=Waddywachtelinfo.com |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> In addition to enlisting her long-time friends such as [[David Crosby]], [[Graham Nash]], [[James Taylor]] and [[Waddy Wachtel]], King reunited with Gerry Goffin to write four songs for the album. Their partnership continued intermittently. King also did a promotional tour for the album in 1976.

After covering Carole's "[[Goin' Back]]" on October 17–18, 1975 at two of his high-profile [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]] gigs, [[Bruce Springsteen]] showed up in person at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]], New York on March 7, 1976 to sing "[[The Loco-Motion]]" with Carole for the night's final encore.<ref>{{cite web |title=1976-03-07-beacon-theatre-new-york-city-ny |url=http://brucebase.wikidot.com/gig:1976-03-07-beacon-theatre-new-york-city-ny |website=Brucebase |publisher=Brucebase |accessdate=3 May 2020}}</ref>

In 1977, King collaborated with another songwriter, Rick Evers, on ''[[Simple Things (Carole King album)|Simple Things]]'', the first release with a new label distributed by [[Capitol Records]]. Shortly after that King and Evers were married; he died of a [[cocaine overdose]] one year later, while King and daughter Sherry were in [[Hawaii]]. ''Simple Things'' was her first album that failed to reach the top 10 on the ''Billboard'' since ''Tapestry'', and it was her last Gold-certified record by the RIAA, except for a compilation entitled ''Her Greatest Hits'' the following year and ''Live at the Troubadour'' in 2010.

Despite its Gold-certified record status, ''Simple Things'' was named "The Worst Album of 1977" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref name= weller-girls />{{rp|394}} Neither ''Welcome Home'' (1978), her debut as a co-producer on an album, nor ''Touch the Sky'' (1979) reached the top 100. ''Pearls – The Songs of Goffin and King'' (1980) yielded a hit single, an updated version of "One Fine Day".

King moved to [[Atlantic Records]] for ''[[One to One (Carole King album)|One to One]]'' (1982), and ''[[Speeding Time]]'' in 1983, which was a reunion with ''Tapestry''-era producer [[Lou Adler]]. After a well-received concert tour in 1984, journalist Catherine Foster of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' dubbed King "a Queen of Rock". She also called King's performing "all spunk and exuberance."<ref>{{cite web |first= Catherine| last= Foster |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0223/022333.html |title=Carole King – still a Queen of Rock |work= CSMonitor.com |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

Also in 1985, she scored and performed (with [[David Sanborn]]) the soundtrack to the [[Martin Ritt]]-directed movie ''[[Murphy's Romance]]''. The soundtrack, again produced by Adler, included the songs "Running Lonely" and "Love For The Last Time (Theme from 'Murphy's Romance')", although a soundtrack album was apparently never officially released.<ref name=murphy>{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089643/soundtrack |title= Soundtracks for Murphy's Romance |website= IMDb.com |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> King made a cameo appearance in the film as Tillie, a town hall employee.<ref name=murphy />

In 1989, she returned to Capitol Records and recorded ''[[City Streets (album)|City Streets]]'', with [[Eric Clapton]] on two tracks and [[Branford Marsalis]] on one, followed by ''[[Color of Your Dreams]]'' (1993), with an appearance by [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]. Her song, "[[Now and Forever (Carole King song)|Now and Forever]]", was in the opening credits to the 1992 [[motion picture|movie]] ''[[A League of Their Own]]'', and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=perone />

In 1988, she starred in the off-Broadway production ''A Minor Incident'', and in 1994, she played Mrs Johnstone on Broadway in ''[[Blood Brothers (musical)|Blood Brothers]]''. In 1996, she appeared in ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' in Ireland, directed by [[Peter Sheridan]].

==1990s==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2018}}
Early 1991 saw King's song "[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]" recorded by [[Dina Carroll]] on the [[Quartz (band)|Quartz]] album ''Perfect Timing''. The cover topped the dance charts worldwide and reached No.8 in the UK Singles Chart in 1991. It was hoped that King would appear in the filming of the video for the song but she declined, citing her heavy tour schedule at that time.

In 1991, King co-wrote and co-produced "[[If It's Over]]" with singer-songwriter [[Mariah Carey]] from her second album "[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]". King saw Carey perform her first single "[[Vision of Love]]" live and began taking an interest in her and her material. She contacted Carey, asking if she would be interested in covering "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]", a song she had written alongside [[Gerry Goffin]] for [[Aretha Franklin]]. Carey declined, feeling uneasy about covering a song one of her musical influences had executed so perfectly. Still determined to work with Carey, King flew out to New York City for one day, in hopes of writing and composing a [[ballad]] of some sort. Throughout the day, the two songwriters exchanged musical ideas and melodies on the [[piano]] until "If It's Over" came into conception.

In 1997, she wrote "Wall Of Smiles/Torre De Marfil" with [[Soraya (musician)|Soraya]] for her 1997 [[Torre De Marfil|album of the same title]]. the same year King wrote and recorded backing vocals on "[[The Reason (Celine Dion song)|The Reason]]" for [[Celine Dion]] on her album ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]''. The song sold worldwide, including one million in France. It went to number 1 in France, 11 in the UK, and 13 in Ireland. The pair performed a duet on the first [[VH1 Divas Live]] benefit concert. King also performed her "[[You've Got a Friend]]" with Celine Dion, [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Shania Twain]] as well as "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]" with [[Aretha Franklin]] and others, including Mariah Carey. In 1998, King wrote "Anyone at All", and performed it in ''[[You've Got Mail]]'', starring [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Meg Ryan]].

==2000s==
In 2000, King was asked to record a version of her hit song "[[Where You Lead]]" as the theme song for the show ''[[Gilmore Girls]]''. She rewrote a few lyrics to fit the mother-daughter story. She often performs this song with her daughter, Louise Goffin. She rarely performed the song after its original release due to the rise in the [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] and falling out of favor of the sentiment behind the lyrics. King agreed to revamp the song to be, "something more relevant." The song became strongly associated with female friendships and family members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/where-you-lead-i-will-follow|title=The Full Story Behind How The "Gilmore Girls" Theme Song Came To Be|last=Yandoli|first=Krystie Lee|website=BuzzFeed|access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref>

In 2010, King and [[James Taylor]] staged their [[Troubadour Reunion Tour]] together, recalling the first time they played at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood]] in 1970. The pair had reunited to mark the club's 50th anniversary two and a half years earlier in 2007 with the band they used in 1970. They enjoyed it so much that they decided to take the band on the road for 2010. The touring band featured players from that original band: [[Russ Kunkel]], [[Leland Sklar]], and [[Danny Kortchmar]]. Also present was King's son-in-law, [[Robbie Kondor]]. King played piano and Taylor guitar on each other's songs, and they sang together some of the numbers they were both associated with. The tour began in Australia in March, returning to the United States in May. It was a major commercial success, with King playing to some of the largest audiences of her career. Total ticket sales exceeded 700,000 and the tour grossed over 59 million dollars, making it one of the most successful tours of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957335/james-taylor-and-carole-king-craft-seasons-hottest-tour |title=James Taylor and Carole King Craft Season's Hottest Tour |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

During their Troubadour Reunion Tour, King released two albums, one with James Taylor. The first, released on April 27, 2010, ''The Essential Carole King'', is a two-disc compilation album.

==Political and environmental activism==
After relocating to [[Idaho]] in 1977, King became involved in environmental issues. Since 1990, she has been working with the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other groups towards passage of the [[Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act]] (NREPA). King has testified on Capitol Hill three times on behalf of NREPA: in 1994, 2007 and again in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maloney.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1323&Itemid=61 |title=Carole King Joins Reps.

King is also politically active in the [[United States Democratic Party]]. In 2003, she began campaigning for [[John Kerry]], performing in private homes for caucus delegates during the Democratic primaries. On July 29, 2004, she made a short speech and sang at the [[Democratic National Convention]], about two hours before Kerry made his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination for president.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/popquiz/article/POP-QUIZ-CAROLE-KING-2701676.php|title=Pop Quiz: Carole King|newspaper=SF Gate|first=Aidin|last=Vaziri|date=August 15, 2004|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref> King continued her support of Kerry throughout the general election.  When Kerry was named Secretary of State in 2013 she campaigned with US Representative Ed Markey, the Democratic nominee to succeed Kerry in a special election.

In 2008, King appeared on the March 18 episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', touching on her politics again. She said she was supporting [[Hillary Clinton]], and said the choice had nothing to do with gender. She also said she would have no issues if [[Barack Obama]] won the election. Before the show's conclusion, she returned to the stage to perform "I Feel the Earth Move".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/ksfr/.artsmain/article/4/1010/1315893/Pop/Carole.King.Her.music..her.life..her.daughter/|title=Carole King: Her music, her life, her daughter|first=Sean|last=Daly|publisher=KSFR|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref>

On January 21, 2017, King marched in the [[2017 Women's March]] in [[Stanley, Idaho|Stanley]], Idaho, carrying a sign that said "One Small Voice."  In an op-ed for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', she wrote she carried that message because "I’ve never stopped believing that one small voice plus millions of other small voices is exactly how we change the world."<ref name="women's march">{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Carole|title=Why I'm Just Now Re-Releasing A Song I First Wrote In 1982|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-small-voice_us_588a2830e4b0024605fe459f|accessdate=January 26, 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=January 26, 2017}}</ref>

==Tributes and covers==
[[File:Carole King Boston 2012.jpg|thumb|240px|King during an interview at the [[JFK Presidential Library]], Boston, Mass., April 12, 2012]]
An all-star roster of artists paid tribute to King on the 1995 album ''[[Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King]]''. From the album, [[Rod Stewart]]'s version of "[[So Far Away (Carole King song)|So Far Away]]" and [[Celine Dion]]'s recording of "A Natural Woman" were both [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart hits.

Former [[The Monkees|Monkee]] [[Micky Dolenz]] released ''King for a Day'', a tribute album consisting of songs written or co-written by King, in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=Graff |first=Gary |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957931/monkee-micky-dolenz-pays-tribute-to-carole-king |title=Monkee Micky Dolenz Pays Tribute to Carole King |website=Billboard |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref> The album includes "[[More of the Monkees|Sometime in the Morning]]", a King-penned song originally recorded by the Monkees in 1967. Dolenz had previously recorded another of King's Monkees compositions, "[[Porpoise Song (Theme from Head)|Porpoise Song]]", on his lullaby-themed CD ''Micky Dolenz Puts You to Sleep.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/micky-dolenz-puts-you-to-sleep-r116428 |title=Micky Dolenz Puts You to Sleep |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref>

Many other cover versions of King's work have appeared over the years. Among the most notable are:

===Film biography===
{{main|Grace of My Heart}}
In 1996, a film very loosely based on King's life, ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', was written and directed by [[Allison Anders]].  In the film, an aspiring singer sacrifices her own singing career to write hit songs that launch the careers of other singers. Mirroring King's life, the film follows her from her first break, through the pain of rejection from the recording industry and a bad marriage, to her final triumph in realizing her dream to record her own hit album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/grace-of-my-heart-20001208|title=Grace of My Heart|first=Peter|last=Travers|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=September 13, 1996|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref>

The story includes material and characters loosely based on King's songwriting colleagues, as well as the singers for whom they wrote their material, and various producers involved in the creative environment that existed at the [[Brill Building]] from 1958 to 1964 and in the California music scene from 1965 to 1971.
