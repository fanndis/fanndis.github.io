'''''Collateral''''' is a 2004 American [[neo-noir]] [[action film|action]] [[thriller film]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Collateral|url=https://www.fandango.com/collateral-85609/movie-overview|publisher=Fandango|access-date=October 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429052505/https://www.fandango.com/collateral-85609/movie-overview|archive-date=April 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Collateral|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Collateral#tab=summary|publisher=The Numbers|access-date=October 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921153738/https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Collateral#tab=summary|archive-date=September 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> directed and produced by [[Michael Mann]] from a script by [[Stuart Beattie]] and starring [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. The supporting cast includes [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Peter Berg]], [[Javier Bardem]], and [[Bruce McGill]]. It follows Max, a Los Angeles cab driver and his customer Vincent. When offered a high fare for driving to several locations, Max agrees but soon finds himself taken hostage by Vincent who turns out to be a hitman on a contract killing spree.

Screenwriter Beattie first conceived the idea for the film when taking a [[taxicab]] home from [[Sydney]] airport. Beattie shared the idea with producer Julie Richardson, who showed it to director [[Frank Darabont]]. The film was pitched to [[HBO]] but was declined. It was purchased by [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] but would not see development for three years. Before the trio of Mann, Cruise and Foxx joined the film, [[Mimi Leder]], [[Janusz Kami≈Ñski]] and [[Fernando Meirelles]] were each considered as director, and [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Adam Sandler]] were in talks to star as Vincent and Max, respectively. Filming primarily took place throughout [[Los Angeles]], and was the first feature film to be shot with a [[Viper FilmStream High-Definition Camera]]. The musical score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], with additional songs from [[Audioslave]] and [[Paul Oakenfold]].

''Collateral'' was released in the United States on August 6, 2004, and grossed $217 million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim in particular for the performances of Cruise and Foxx, Mann's direction and the editing, although the pacing and second half of the film received a mixed reception. ''Collateral'' was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2004#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2004]]. At the [[77th Academy Awards]], Foxx received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]; while film editors [[Jim Miller (film editor)|Jim Miller]] and [[Paul Rubell]] were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

==Plot==
<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words-->
Max is a meticulous Los Angeles cab driver trying to earn enough to start his own limousine business. One of the evening's fares is federal prosecutor Annie Farrell, who works for the U.S. Attorney for the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Central District of California]]. On the drive to her office, they strike up a conversation and Annie gives Max her business card.

Max's next fare is Vincent. Apparently impressed by Max's skill at navigating through traffic, Vincent tells Max that he is in Los Angeles for one night to complete a real estate deal, and offers Max $600 to drive him to several locations. Initially reluctant to violate regulations, Max is eventually persuaded. As Max waits at the first stop, a corpse falls onto his car; Vincent reveals himself as a [[Contract killing|hitman]] and the body is one of his five targets. He forces Max to hide the body in the trunk and continue driving.

At the second stop, Vincent restrains Max's hands to the steering wheel. Max asks a group of young men for help, but two of them rob him and seize Vincent's briefcase. Vincent returns and kills them. He then offers to buy Max a drink at a jazz club. At the club, Vincent engages the owner Daniel in conversation. Vincent then reveals Daniel to have been his third target. Max pleads with Vincent to let Daniel go, causing Vincent to offer a compromise, betting Daniel cannot answer a question about where [[Miles Davis]] "learned music". Daniel states that Davis went to the [[Juilliard School]], seemingly giving a correct answer. Vincent, suddenly, unexpectedly shoots Daniel, revealing that Miles Davis dropped out of Julliard to be mentored by [[Charlie Parker]].

Max's boss Lenny, who has been hectoring him over the radio, tells Max his mother Ida called. Learning of Max's nightly visits to the hospital to see his mother, Vincent insists that Max proceed with the visit. At the hospital, Ida proudly tells Vincent that Max has his own limousine company, revealing Max has been lying to her.

Overwhelmed, Max leaves, stealing Vincent's briefcase, and hurls it onto a freeway where it is destroyed by a passing truck. With the information on his last two targets destroyed, Vincent coerces Max to meet drug lord Felix Reyes-Torrena to re-obtain the information. Max, posing as Vincent, acquires the information but Felix orders his men to kill "Vincent" if he does not complete the job.

Max heads with Vincent to a nightclub, seeking the next target, Peter Lim. Narcotics detective Ray Fanning uncovers a connection between the three victims and reports his finding to FBI agent Frank Pedrosa. Pedrosa identifies the victims as witnesses in a federal grand jury indicting Reyes-Torrena the following day. At the nightclub, Vincent kills Felix's hitmen, Lim, and his bodyguards. Fanning rescues Max and smuggles him outside but is killed by Vincent, who beckons Max back into the cab.

Following their getaway, the two trade insulting summaries of each other's personalities and choices in life. After a heated exchange, Max deliberately crashes the cab, but both survive, and Vincent escapes. A police officer arrives. Seeing the corpse in the trunk, he tries to arrest Max. However, Max notices Vincent's open laptop, revealing that his final target is Annie. He overpowers the police officer, takes his gun, and rushes toward Annie's office building.

Stealing a bystander's phone, Max uses Annie's business card to call and warn her. She is incredulous until Max reveals details about Vincent's previous victims, urging her to call 911. Vincent steals the security guard's gun and uses a fire axe to cut the power and telephone lines on Annie's floor. Vincent finds Annie but is shot and wounded by Max, who escapes with Annie on foot. Vincent pursues the pair onto a [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|metro rail]] train. Cornered on the train, Max engages Vincent in a sudden shootout. Vincent, fatally wounded, slumps into a seat, repeating a story about a man dying unnoticed on a Metro train. Max and Annie get off at the next station in the dawn of a new day.

===Development===
When he was 17 years old, Australian writer Stuart Beattie took a cab home from Sydney airport and had the idea of a homicidal maniac sitting in the back of a cab with the driver nonchalantly conversing with him, trusting his passenger implicitly. Beattie drafted his idea into a two-page treatment titled "The Last Domino", then later began writing the screenplay. The original story centered around an African-American female cop who witnesses a [[hit (crime)|hit]], and the romance between the cab driver and his then librarian girlfriend. The final film has limited resemblance to the original treatment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cath |first1=le Couteur |last2=Stuart |first2=Beattie |title=Independent Filmmakers Network : Shooting People |url=https://shootingpeople.org/interviews.php?mode=beattie |website=shootingpeople.org |accessdate=August 18, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331091024/https://shootingpeople.org/interviews.php?mode=beattie |archive-date=March 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Beattie was waiting tables when he came in to contact with Julie Richardson, whom he had met on a [[UCLA]] Screenwriting Extension course. Richardson had become a producer and was searching for projects for [[Frank Darabont]], Rob Fried and [[Chuck Russell]]'s company, Edge City, which was created to make low budget genre movies for HBO. Beattie later pitched her his idea of "The Last Domino." Richardson pitched the idea to Darabont, who brought the team in for a meeting, including Beattie, and set up the project under Edge City. After two drafts, HBO passed on the project. At a general meeting at [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] with executive Marc Haimes, Beattie mentioned the script. Haimes immediately contacted Richardson, read the script overnight, and DreamWorks put in an offer the following day.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanders |first1=Steven |title=Michael Mann ‚Äì Cinema and Television: Interviews, 1980‚Äì2012 |date=2014 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748693559 |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klirBgAAQBAJ&q=%22Stuart%20Beattie%22%20Edge%20City&pg=PA136 |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429052501/https://books.google.bg/books?id=klirBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA136&q=%22Stuart%20Beattie%22%20Edge%20City |archive-date=April 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Early drafts of ''Collateral''{{'}}s script set the film in [[New York City]].

[[Mimi Leder]] and cinematographer [[Janusz Kami≈Ñski]] were attached to the project at one point as the director. Upon [[Russell Crowe]] expressing interest in playing the role of Vincent, development on the film moved forward. Crowe got his ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' director [[Michael Mann]] involved, but after constant delays, Crowe departed the project. Mann then approached [[Tom Cruise]] with the idea of him playing Vincent and [[Adam Sandler]] in the role of Max.

[[Stephen Hunter]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the film and Cruise's performance. He summarized the film as "the best kind of genre filmmaking: It plays by the rules, obeys the traditions and is both familiar and fresh at once".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hunter |first1=Stephen |title='Collateral': The Meter Keeps Running |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44231-2004Aug5.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=19 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107140952/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44231-2004Aug5.html |archive-date=January 7, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] praised the performances of Cruise and Foxx, with Ebert calling Foxx's work a "revelation".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title='Collateral' a genre thriller, but so much more |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/collateral-2004 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=19 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221180445/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/collateral-2004 |archive-date=December 21, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition to praising the performances of Cruise, Pinkett Smith, [[Mark Ruffalo]] and [[Javier Bardem]], [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote of Foxx's performance: "Foxx can act.

In a mixed review, Marrit Ingman of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' gave positive remarks to Mann's film-making, but stated "There‚Äôs not much substance lurking beneath all the style, though the plot digresses into several awkward scenes intended to flesh out the characters".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ingman |first1=Marrit |title=Collateral |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2004-08-06/collateral/ |publisher=[[Austin Chronicle]] |accessdate=20 June 2020 |archive-date=September 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200915065250/https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2004-08-06/collateral/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine highlighted Foxx's performance as "terrific" and was favorable to the film's first act, but derided the rest of the film. "It‚Äôs too bad that halfway through, ''Collateral'' turns into a series of loud, chaotic, over-the-top action set pieces in which the existentialist Mann proves he‚Äôs lousy at action". Edelstein also criticized the performance of Cruise, referring to his performance as "robotic".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edelstein |first1=David Edelstein |title=Taxicab Confessions |url=https://slate.com/culture/2004/08/collateral-s-taxicab-philosopher.html |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=20 June 2020 |archive-date=September 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200915065300/https://slate.com/culture/2004/08/collateral-s-taxicab-philosopher.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' magazine criticized Cruise's performance, finding that "Cruise's dignity rings stiff and false". Zacharek did praise the performance of Foxx, stating "Foxx inhabits his character so comfortably that he renders meaningless Vincent's babble about the tough, real world. Max is the one who lives in the real world, which is ultimately the point of the movie -- but it takes the picture a very long time to reach a conclusion that's evident from the start to any attuned viewer".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zacharek |first1=Stephanie |title=Collateral |url=https://www.salon.com/2004/08/06/collateral/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=20 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706135622/http://www.salon.com/2004/08/06/collateral/ |archive-date=July 6, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
