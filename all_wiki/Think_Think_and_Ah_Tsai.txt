During her presidency, Tsai has regularly posted social media updates which include her cats, and these are popular.<ref>{{Cite book|last=《中國密報》編輯部|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgZGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT141&lpg=PT141&dq=%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87+%E6%83%B3%E6%83%B3+%E9%98%BF%E6%89%8D#q=%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%20%E6%83%B3%E6%83%B3%20%E9%98%BF%E6%89%8D|title=《中國密報》第46期: 江澤民導演習李鬥？|date=2016-06-02|publisher=中國密報雜誌社|isbn=978-1-68182-163-4|language=zh-TW}}</ref> During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], one of these posts discouraged Taiwanese citizens from performing [[April Fools' Day]] pranks which involved false rumours. Posting a picture of herself with one of the cats, she said: "...we can exercise our sense of humor...but we can’t make jokes about the pandemic, to avoid breaking the law", and: "I wish everybody not only a humorous, but also healthy and safe April Fools’ Day".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Submission|first=Internal|date=2020-04-01|title=Pandemic pranks off the table on April Fools' Day|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/01/world/pandemic-pranks-off-table-april-fools-day/|access-date=2020-07-09|website=The Japan Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

When baseball games resumed after Taiwan's pandemic lockdown was partially lifted, with the [[Chinatrust Brothers]] taking on the [[Uni-President Lions|Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions]], Tsai posted a picture of herself watching the game at home, accompanied by one of the cats.<ref>{{Cite web|last=hermes|date=2020-04-14|title=Taiwan first up to the plate|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/taiwan-first-up-to-the-plate|access-date=2020-07-09|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref> A new Twitter hashtag – ''#ThisAttackComeFromTaiwan'' – aims to welcome overseas visitors to Taiwan after the pandemic, and includes images of Taiwanese landscapes, [[bubble tea]], and Tsai's cats.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Aspinwall|first=Nick|title=Tsai Rejects Accusations Taiwan Attacked WHO Chief, Invites Him to Visit|url=https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/tsai-rejects-accusations-taiwan-attacked-who-chief-invites-him-to-visit/|access-date=2020-07-09|website=thediplomat.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

In July 2020, Tsai visited the [[Hsinchu]] Animal Protection Education Park, where she made a statement urging citizens who wanted pets to adopt stray animals, instead of purchasing them.<ref>{{Cite web|title=參訪新竹市動保園區 總統呼籲國人「以認養代替購買」 讓無家可歸的毛小孩重新開始新的生活|url=https://www.president.gov.tw/NEWS/25441|access-date=2020-07-24|website=www.president.gov.tw|language=zh-tw}}</ref>

==Media coverage==
===Supporters and critics===
Shortly after Tsai was elected as president in 2016, she was criticised for being a single woman – and therefore 'emotional' and 'erratic' – in a newspaper article published by China's state news agency [[Xinhua]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/china-taiwan-tsai-unmarried-single.html |title=Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's First Female Leader, Is Assailed in China for Being 'Emotional' |first1=Javier C. |last1=Hernández |first2=Vanessa Piao |last2=May |date=25 May 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The article, written by [[Wang Weixing]]<ref name="straitstimes1">{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/sexist-remarks-on-tsai-ing-wen-spark-outrage-in-china-taiwan |title=Sexist remarks on Tsai Ing-wen spark outrage in China, Taiwan |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=26 May 2016 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> a military officer in the [[Peoples Liberation Army|PLA]], provoked an outcry for its sexist views,<ref name="straitstimes1"/> and was quickly withdrawn. On China's social media platform [[Sina Weibo]], one commentator suggested that the Chinese leadership are "... probably threatened that a cat lady like Ms Tsai could beat any men she sets her mind to&nbsp;...".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/05/25/taiwan-president-accused-of-being-extremist-and-erratic-because-she-is-single/ |title=Taiwan president accused of being "extremist" and "erratic" because she is single |author=WITW Staff |website=[[Women in the World]] |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>

Taiwanese activist magazine ''New Bloom'' describes her as 'an unorthodox politician&nbsp;... a female academic who loves cats and supports [[LGBT rights in Taiwan|gay rights]]'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newbloommag.net/2016/01/18/taiwan-narrative-tsai/ |title=Is the Narrative About Taiwan Changing After Tsai Ing-Wen's Presidential Victory? |first=Brian |last=Hioe |website=New Bloom |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref> Gideon Rachman of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' observes that Tsai is one of two cat-lovers who have recently risen to power – the other being [[Jaroslaw Kaczynski]], leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://next.ft.com/content/165b3e09-847e-3e05-930e-33ea5802b7b6 |title=Rise of the cat leaders |first=Gideon |last=Rachman |newspaper=Financial Times |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=20 June 2016 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In June 2016, while in Miami, Tsai met Taiwanese professional baseball pitcher [[Wei-Yin Chen]], whose gifts to her included feeding bowls for each of the two cats and three adopted dogs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201606260009.aspx |title=U.S. representative welcomes Tsai in Miami, voices support for Taiwan |first1=Tony |last1=Liao |first2=Sophia |last2=Yeh |first3=Elizabeth |last3=Hsu |website=Focus Taiwan |publisher=Central News Agency |date=26 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref>

===Three dogs – Bella, Bunny and Maru===

After first being sworn in as president, Tsai also announced plans to adopt three retired [[guide dog]]s once she moves into her [[Official Residence of the President of the Republic of China|official residence]].<ref name="straitstimes2">{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwans-cat-loving-president-tsai-ing-wen-to-adopt-3-retired-guide-dogs |title=Taiwan's cat-loving President Tsai Ing-wen to adopt 3 retired guide dogs |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=26 May 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> The media in Taiwan asked Tsai whether she anticipated any conflict with her cats, but she said that the dogs "are very well trained and they can definitely get along with the cats".<ref name="straitstimes2"/>

Other observers attempted to draw parallels with Taiwan's political situation. Alex Lo, writing in Hong Kong's ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', has suggested that Tsai's adoption of the dogs is a good sign for relations between Taiwan and [[Mainland China]].<ref name="SCMP2">{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1956856/tale-cats-dogs-and-cross-strait-relations |title=A tale of cats, dogs and cross-strait relations |first=Alex |last=Lo |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=27 May 2016 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> He proposes that the Taiwanese are 'cat people', while the mainland Chinese are 'dog people' – citing a psychological study indicating cat lovers are 11 per cent more open to 'unusual ideas', while dog people are more 'conventional and traditional'.<ref name="SCMP2"/> In Singapore, ''[[The Straits Times]]'' dismissed as media speculation any suggestion of a 'civil war' between Tsai's cats and dogs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwans-cat-loving-president-to-adopt-dogs-too |title=Taiwan's cat-loving President to adopt dogs too |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=26 May 2016}}</ref>

Tsai adopted the dogs in October 2016, and their names are ''Bella'', ''Bunny'' and ''Maru''. She signed their adoption papers at a ceremony organised by the Huikuang Guide Dog Foundation, where she vowed to improve the barrier-free environment for visually impaired people and their seeing-eye dogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2016/11/03/2003658436 |title=President Tsai adopts three retired guide dogs 蔡英文總統 收養三隻退役導盲犬 |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2017-01-14 |accessdate=2017-01-20}}</ref> Of the three dogs, Tsai has described Bella as her favourite; while Bunny is 'elegant' and Maru is 'timid'.<ref>{{Cite web|last=https://www.facebook.com/ETtoday|title=獨／蔡英文形容3愛犬：Maru最膽小、Bella最愛吃、Bunny最優雅 {{!}} ETtoday新聞雲|url=https://www.ettoday.net/news/20190207/1371858.htm|access-date=2020-07-13|website=www.ettoday.net|language=zh-Hant}}</ref>

Tsai appeared wearing a pair of pink cat ears in a DPP campaign rally advertisement, which was posted on social media by [[Freddy Lim]], frontman of [[death metal]] band [[Chthonic (band)|Chthonic]], and also himself a politician.<ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=Taiwan|title=Photo of the Day: Cat ears, cosplay, death metal featured in Taiwan campaign ad|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3854070|access-date=2020-07-09|website=Taiwan News}}</ref> Although Lim is founder of the [[New Power Party]] (NPP), he ran as an independent after a dispute about the NPP's relationship with the ruling [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|last=News|first=Taiwan|title=Freddy Lim triumphs in Taipei pan-blue bastion|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3855115|access-date=2020-07-11|website=Taiwan News}}</ref> Despite his role as an independent, Lim had been voicing his support for the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen.<ref name="auto"/>

Other publicity material in the Tsai campaign included a pillow in the shape of Taiwan, and  a hot sauce which was a pun on Tsai's "Hot Taiwanese Girl" nickname.<ref name="auto5"/><ref>{{Cite web|last=Staff|first=T.

During the 2020 election, several other politicians associated themselves with animals, pets or [[anime]] characters – such as Lii Wen, who appeared in a video wearing a pair of wings in the shape of [[mussel]]s.<ref name="auto5"/> Writing for ''New Bloom'', Brian Hioe suggested at least one was following Tsai's lead; highlighting main Presidential rival [[Han Kuo-yu]], who appeared with imagery of his pet [[Shiba Inu|Shibu Inu]].<ref name="auto5"/> Taiwan's Digital Minister in charge of Social Innovation, [[Audrey Tang]], says that politicians using internet memes and cat pictures reflects a 'coming out' of digital subcultures.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-13|title=The civic hacker that became Digital Minister of Taiwan: interview with Audrey Tang|url=https://digitalfuturesociety.com/interviews/the-civic-hacker-that-became-digital-minister-of-taiwan-interview-with-audrey-tang/|access-date=2020-08-03|website=Digital Future Society|language=en-US}}</ref>

The former mining town of [[Houtong Cat Village|Houtong]] is known as a 'cat village', which attracts tourists with its large population of roaming cats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/taipei/2013/11/09/393242/Taiwans-cat.htm |title=Taiwan's 'cat village' on CNN list of attractions |newspaper=[[The China Post]] |date=9 November 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref>

The [[Hello Kitty]] character is very popular, with the Taiwanese embracing Japan's [[kawaii]], or 'cuteness', culture. ''[[The Economist]]'' suggests this is a way for the Taiwanese to '... define themselves as different from China – which lays [[Political status of Taiwan|claim]] to their island – by cleaving to Japan, their former coloniser'.<ref name="economist1"/>
