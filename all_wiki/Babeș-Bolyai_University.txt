The history of the education in Kolozsvár, ({{lang-ro|Cluj}} {{lang-de|Klausenburg}}, [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]]) begins in 1581, with the establishment of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college by [[Stephen Báthory]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/handle/123456789/48169 |title=Istoria Universităţii "Babeş-Bolyai" |chapter=Începuturile: Colegiul iezuit din 1579-1581 |last=Pop |first=Ioan-Aurel |date=2012 |pages=12–29 |language=Romanian}}</ref> The college received buildings and land within the medieval city walls, specifically on ''Platea Luporum'' (the present Mihail Kogălniceanu Street). The first rector of the [[Jesuit Academy of Cluj|Collegium Academicum Claudiopolitanum]] was the Polish Jesuit priest [[Jakub Wujek]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agerpres.ro/destinatie-romania/2014/08/27/destinatie-romania-un-secol-de-invatamant-superior-romanesc-la-cluj-12-10-58 |title=Un secol de învățământ superior românesc la Cluj |work=Agerpres |last=Stanciu |first=Elena |date=27 August 2014 |language=Romanian}}</ref> The institution had the rights to confer the university/academic titles of ''baccalaureus'', ''magister'', and ''doctor''. In 1585, there were 230 students studying here, divided into six classes. The language of instruction and learning was [[Latin language|Latin]]. After 1698, the institution was named Universitas Claudiopolitana (see the cover of the book from 1742 by [[Andreas Matis]] entitled ''Peregrinus Catholicus de peregrina unitaria religione''), with teachings in Latin and later also in German. In 1753, Empress [[Maria Theresa]] changed the status of the university into an imperial one, and in 1773, after the dissolution of the Jesuit Order, the university went under the administration of the [[Piarists|Piarist order]]. In 1786 Universitas Claudiopolitana became the Royal Academic Lyceum (Lyceum Regium Academicum - semiuniversity statute), which was later followed by two institutions with a semiuniversity statute (e.g., offering training at of baccalaureus/magister level, but not at doctor level): (a) the Surgical-Medical Institute and (b) the Academy of Law. This institutions will be later incorporated in the [[Franz Joseph University]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://u-szeged.hu/download.php?docID=7855|title=A Szegedi Tudományegyetem és elődei története (1581-2011)|author=Makk F., Marjanucz, L.|publisher=University of Szeged|date=2011|isbn=9789633060940}}</ref><ref name="hist">{{cite web |url=https://www.ubbcluj.ro/en/despre/prezentare/istoric |title=Babeș-Bolyai University - short history}}</ref>

With the affirmation of the Romanian nation, in the context of the European revolutions of 1848, was explicitly questioned the issue on university in national language. At the express request of the Romanians, in 1870, [[József Eötvös]], then Minister of Education, proposes the creation in Kolozsvár of a university teaching in Hungarian, Romanian and German, idea also welcomed by the Romanian elite. Meanwhile, Eötvös dies, and in 1872, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] legislates the establishment of the [[Franz Joseph University|Hungarian Royal University of Kolozsvár]] in Hungarian only, which caused dissatisfaction among Romanians.<ref name="ubb">{{cite web |url=http://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/despre/misiune/istoric |title=Repere istorice ale universităţii clujene |work=Universitatea Babeş-Bolyai |language=Romanian |access-date=2015-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109211738/http://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/despre/misiune/istoric |archive-date=2015-11-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the oath, on 20 December 1872, 258 students start courses. There were created four distinct faculties: Faculty of Law and State Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and History, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The faculties were equal to each other and enjoyed internal autonomy. The first rector was Professor Áron Berde from the Faculty of Law, specialist in economics and finance. Besides the four faculties is created a Pedagogical Institute, for training secondary school teachers. From 1895 the girls had the right to learn at university.<ref name="istoria">{{cite book |title=Istoria Universităţii Babeş-Bolyai |last=Ghiță |first=Ovidiu |date=2012 |publisher=Mega |isbn=978-606-543-222-2 |language=Romanian}}</ref>

After the [[First World War]], and in the context of the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Great Union of 1918]], the university was taken over by the Romanian authorities and became an institution of [[Greater Romania]]. On 12 September 1919, the decree signed by [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand I]] stipulated "the transformation of Royal Hungarian Franz Joseph University in Romanian university beginning 1 October 1919".<ref name="ubb" /> The Hungarian staff who have not sworn allegiance to the Romanian state moved to Szeged where it contributed to the formation of the [[University of Szeged]] (1921).

The new Romanian university, initially named ''Superior Dacia University'', later ''King Ferdinand I University'', was composed of four faculties: Law, Medicine, Sciences, Letters and Philosophy. The inaugural lecture, "The Duty of Our Life", was delivered by [[Vasile Pârvan]] on 3 November 1919. The official inauguration took place between 31 January and 2 February 1920, in the presence of King Ferdinand I. The first elected rector was [[Sextil Pușcariu]].<ref name="hist"/><ref name="ubb" />

In 1940, after territorial revision imposed by the [[Second Vienna Award]], the university was moved to [[Timișoara]] and [[Sibiu]],<ref name="istoria" /> and the former Hungarian university was recreated in the city, returning from the Hungarian University of Szeged. After the end of the [[Second World War]] and the repeal of the Vienna Award, on 1 June 1945, Romanian authorities moved back in Cluj the Romanian ''King Ferdinand I University'' (later renamed to ''Victor Babeș University''), and established ''Bolyai University'', a state university teaching in Hungarian, with four faculties (Letters and Philosophy, Law and Political Economy, Sciences, and Human Medicine which, in 1948, was separated and moved to Târgu Mureș to form the [[University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Târgu Mureș|University of Medicine and Pharmacy]]).<ref name="ubb" />

In the spring of 1959, the two educational institutions were united under the name ''Babeș-Bolyai University'',<ref name="ubb" /> after two renowned scholars: Romanian biologist [[Victor Babeș]] and Hungarian mathematician [[János Bolyai]]. In 1995, the Babeș-Bolyai University reorganises its structure, introducing a multicultural based education.<ref name="ubb" />

UBB is today a complex university, having programs from art/humanities, social sciences, life and natural sciences, mathematics/computer sciences to engineering and technology.<ref name="admitere ubb">[https://admitere.ubbcluj.ro/en/ "Admission at Babeș-Bolyai University]</ref>

UBB typically occupies the first position among the Romanian universities in the major international ranking of universities. In 2016, the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research commissioned the University Metaranking, combining the major international rankings of universities, as recognized by [[IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence|IREG]]). Since 2016, UBB occupies the first position among Romanian universities.<ref name="metaranking_2016" /><ref name="metaranking_2019" /> In 2019, based on British QS STAR academic audit,<ref>[https://www.qs.com/solutions/research-intelligence/qs-stars/ "QS Stars rating system"]</ref> UBB was evaluated as an international university with excellence in teaching and research (QS****).

== Hungarian section ==
In 1995, the Babeș-Bolyai University introduced an educational system backed by the [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMrjNm237lUC&pg=PA170 |title=Mechanisms for the implementation of minority rights |last=Morawa |first=Alexander H. E. |publisher=Council of Europe Publishing |date=2005 |isbn=978-92-871-5499-6}}</ref> and based on multiculturalism and multilingualism, with three lines of study (Romanian, Hungarian and German) at all levels of academic degrees.<ref name="multicultural">{{cite web|url=http://www.ubbcluj.ro/en/despre/misiune/caracter_multicultural |title=The multicultural feature |work=UBB |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303190652/http://www.ubbcluj.ro/en/despre/misiune/caracter_multicultural |archivedate=2014-03-03 |df= }}</ref>

The Hungarian section enrolls 4,874 students in 115 study programmes (75 bachelor's level and 40 master's level); the university is thus the principal institution that educates members of the Hungarian minority in Transylvania.<ref name="multicultural" />

=== Hungarian-Romanian dispute ===
The Hungarian section of the university has a partial autonomy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/despre/publice/files/Carta_2014.pdf |title=Carta Universității Babeș-Bolyai |work=UBB |language=Romanian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608054737/http://www.ubbcluj.ro/ro/despre/publice/files/Carta_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-08 |df= }}</ref> gradually increasing in the recent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/proiecte-locale/ubb-isi-consolideaza-pozitia-in-mediul-academic-romanesc--24881 |title=UBB isi consolideaza pozitia in mediul academic romanesc |work=Romania Libera |last=Padurean |first=Claudiu |date=10 March 2006 |language=Romanian}}</ref> However, in the opinion of the Council of the Hungarian section, those members appointed by the Hungarian-speaking teaching staff desire a more institutionalized form of autonomy. Since university decision-making is based on majority vote of the entire faculty, the Hungarian representatives in minority can always be silenced by this procedure.

In November 2006, [[Peter Hantz|Hantz Péter]] and Kovács Lehel, lecturers at the Babeș-Bolyai University, were discharged by the university after a series of actions started in October 2005 taken for language equality. They were campaigning for the re-organization of the Bolyai University by splitting it in two independent institutions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1712488-scandalul-placutelor-ubb-provocat-demisia-doi-prorectori.htm |title=Scandalul placutelor de la UBB a provocat demisia a doi prorectori |work=HotNews.ro |last1=Padurean |first1=Claudiu |last2=Sarbu |first2=Daniel |date=1 December 2006 |language=Romanian}}</ref> On 22 November 2006, the University organized an exhibition in the [[European Parliament]], where they tried to give the impression that there are multilingual signs at the university. That day, Hantz added signs like "Information" and "No smoking" in Hungarian alongside those ones in Romanian.<ref name="eurolang">{{cite web |url=http://bolyai.eu/dok/eurolang20070117.pdf |title=Sacked Hungarian lecturers fail to get re-instated |work=Eurolang |last=Tharan-Trieb |first=Marianne |date=17 January 2007}}</ref> The two acted upon a decree permitting the use of multilingual signs, which had been decreed by the university but never put in practice, and official claims that the university is a multicultural institution with three working languages (Romanian, German and Hungarian).<ref name="bolyai">{{cite news |url=http://bolyai.eu/dok/AP2006126.pdf |title=Hungary asks Romania to reinstate 2 ethnic Hungarian professors expelled by university |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> On 27 November 2006, the Senate voted for exclusion of the two lecturers, with 72 for and 9 against (from 2 Romanian and 7 Hungarian members) votes. The Hungarian academic community is convinced that the exclusion was not a disciplinary action, but the vote was not ethnic based.<ref name="eurolang" /> In spite of protests, the resignation out of solidarity by several Hungarian-speaking university staff, and a call by 24 Hungarian MEPs for the reinstatement of the lecturers, they remained unemployed.<ref name="eurolang" /> The parties in the [[Hungarian Parliament]] asked the university to reinstate the two professors and respect the rights of the Hungarian minority. The presidents of the five parties represented in the Hungarian Parliament signed a statement of protest. [[Istvan Hiller]], the Education Minister of Hungary, wrote to his Romanian counterpart Mihail Hărdău, asking for his help on the issue.<ref name="bolyai" /> The case has also been put forward in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]. [[Göran Lindblad]], from the Swedish [[European People's Party]], along with 24 signatories from 19 European countries, presented a motion for a resolution on the alleged breaching of the 1994 [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] by the [[Romanian Government]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bolyai.eu/dok/times2007feb23.pdf |title=Motion supports sacked lecturer |work=The Times |last=McCall |first=Becky |date=23 February 2007}}</ref>

The two lecturers sued Romania at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) in [[Strasbourg]]. Hantz and Kovacs turned to former Hungarian Justice Minister [[Albert Takács]] to represent them at the ECHR, eventually accepting the proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ziuadecj.realitatea.net/eveniment/doi-profesori-universitari-din-cluj-dau-in-judecata-statul-roman-la-strasbourg--35640.html |title=Doi profesori universitari din Cluj dau în judecată statul român la Strasbourg |work=Ziua de Cluj |date=30 April 2008 |language=Romanian }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2008, the European Court of Human Rights established that the decision of UBB Senate to exclude Hantz Péter and Kovács Lehel from the teaching staff of the educational institution was legal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ziare.com/tudor-serban/cluj-napoca/justitia-a-stabilit-inlaturarea-lui-hantz-peter-si-kovacs-lehel-din-cadrul-ubb-a-fost-legala-699305 |title=Justitia a stabilit: Inlaturarea lui Hantz Peter si Kovacs Lehel din cadrul UBB a fost legala |work=Ziare.com |date=1 December 2008 |language=Romanian}}</ref>

In 2010, the education law has sparked numerous controversies by promoting ethnic segregation in higher education, according to teachers representatives.<ref name="cotidian">{{cite web |url=http://www.cotidiantr.ro/maghiarii-forteaza-nota-integritatea-ubb-ului-pusa-in-pericol-de-legea-educatiei-45251.php#.Vd86932LWA4 |title="Maghiarii forţează nota!"

Among main disadvantages would be the increasingly serious gaps of ethnic Hungarians regarding the knowledge of [[Romanian language]]. Romanian MEP [[Corina Crețu]] warned that adopting the education law, with the claims of [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania|UDMR]], would have harmful effects especially in Cluj. "Applying the law could lead to breaking UBB", stated Crețu.<ref name="cotidian" />
