The '''Pacific Crest Trail''' (PCT), officially designated as the '''Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail''', is a long-distance [[hiking]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] trail closely aligned with the highest portion of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain ranges, which lie {{convert|100|to|150|mi|km|-1}} east of the U.S. Pacific coast. The trail's southern terminus is just south of [[Campo, California]] by the [[Mexico–United States border|U.S. border with Mexico]], and its northern terminus is on the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] on the edge of [[E. C. Manning Provincial Park|Manning Park]] in [[British Columbia]]; it passes through the states of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

It was designated a [[National Scenic Trail]] in 1968, although it was not officially completed until 1993.<ref name=pcthist/> The PCT was conceived by Clinton Churchill Clarke in 1932.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gally |first=Sid |url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/general-news/20130811/sid-gally-the-pacific-crest-trail-had-its-roots-in-pasadena |title=The Pacific Crest Trail had its roots in Pasadena |work=Pasadena Star News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114145427/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/general-news/20130811/sid-gally-the-pacific-crest-trail-had-its-roots-in-pasadena |archive-date=2015-01-14}}</ref> It received official status under the [[National Trails System]] Act of 1968.

The Pacific Crest Trail, the [[Appalachian Trail]], and the [[Continental Divide Trail]] form what is known as the [[Triple Crown of Hiking]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Karen|title=Hiking the Triple Crown: How to Hike America's Longest Trails : Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail|location=Seattle|publisher=Mountaineers Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-89886-760-2}}</ref> The Pacific Crest Trail is also part of the 6,875-mile [[Great Western Loop]].

==Route==
The route is mostly through National Forest and protected [[wilderness]]. The trail avoids civilization and covers scenic and pristine mountainous terrain with few roads. It passes through the [[Laguna Mountains|Laguna]], [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa]], [[San Jacinto Mountains|San Jacinto]], [[San Bernardino Mountains|San Bernardino]], [[San Gabriel Mountains|San Gabriel]], [[Liebre Mountains|Liebre]], [[Tehachapi Mountains|Tehachapi]], [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]] ranges in [[California]], and the [[Cascade Range]] in [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

A parallel route for bicycles, the [[Pacific Crest Bicycle Trail]] (PCBT) is a {{convert|2500|mi|km|adj=on}} route designed closely parallel to the PCT on roads. The PCT and PCBT cross in about 27 places along their routes.

==History==

The Pacific Crest Trail was first proposed around 1932 by Clinton C. Clarke as a trail running from Mexico to Canada along the crest of the mountains in California, Oregon, and Washington. The original proposal was to link the [[John Muir Trail]], the [[Tahoe–Yosemite Trail]] (both in California), the [[Skyline Trail (Oregon)|Skyline Trail]] (in Oregon) and the Cascade Crest Trail (in Washington).<ref name="pcthist">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pct/pacific_crest_trail_history.html |title=History of the Pacific Crest Trail |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122032122/http://www.fs.fed.us/pct/pacific_crest_trail_history.html |archive-date=2010-01-22 |access-date=2010-03-28}}</ref>

The Pacific Crest Trail System Conference was formed by Clarke to both plan the trail and to lobby the federal government to protect the trail. The conference was founded by Clarke, the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], the [[YMCA]], and [[Ansel Adams]] (amongst others). From 1935 through 1938, YMCA groups explored the 2,000 miles of potential trail and planned a route, which has been closely followed by the modern PCT route.<ref name=pcthist/>

In 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] defined the PCT and the [[Appalachian Trail]] with the [[National Trails System Act]]. The PCT was then constructed through cooperation between the federal government and volunteers organized by the Pacific Crest Trail Association. In 1993, the PCT was officially declared finished.<ref name=pcthist/>

The Trust for Public Land has purchased and conserved more than {{convert|3000|acre|sqkm}} along the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/our-work/pacific-crest-scenic-trail#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Pacific Crest Scenic Trail|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}</ref> Consolidation of this land has allowed for better recreational access as well as greater ease to manage conservation lands.<ref name=":0" />

==Thru hiking==
{{main|Thru-hiking}}
Thru hiking is a term used in referring to hikers who complete long-distance trails from end to end in a single trip. Thru-hiking is a long commitment, usually taking between four and six months, that requires thorough preparation and dedication.
The Pacific Crest Trail Association estimates that it takes most hikers between six and eight months to plan their trip.<ref name=pctfaq>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcta.org/about_trail/faqs.asp | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111230073345/http://www.pcta.org/about_trail/faqs.asp | archivedate = 2011-12-30 | title = FAQs | publisher = Pacific Crest Trail Association | accessdate = 2006-12-19 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

While most hikers travel from the southern terminus at the Mexico–US border northward to Manning Park, British Columbia, some hikers prefer a southbound route. In a normal weather year, northbound hikes are most practical due to snow and temperature considerations.  Additionally, some hiker services are seasonal and may be better timed for northbound hikers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Jackie|year=2017|title=Yogi's Pacific Crest Trail Handbook 2017-2018}}</ref> If snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is high in early June and low in the Northern Cascades, some hikers may choose to 'flip-flop.' Flip-flopping can take many forms but often describes a process whereby a hiker begins at one end (on the PCT, usually the southern end) of the trail and then, at some point, like reaching the Sierra, 'flips' to the end of the trail at the Canada–US border and hikes southbound to complete the trail. However, it is not currently possible to legally enter the United States from Canada by using the Pacific Crest Trail.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mind the border: Feds warn Pacific Crest Trail hikers crossing from Canada to U.S.|newspaper=The Oregonian|first=Kimberly|last=Wilson|date=2010-07-02|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2010/07/mind_the_border_feds_warn_pacific_crest_trail_hikers_crossing_from_canada_to_us.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109194740/http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2010/07/mind_the_border_feds_warn_pacific_crest_trail_hikers_crossing_from_canada_to_us.html|archivedate=2013-11-09}}</ref>

Hikers also have to determine their resupply points. Resupply points are towns or post offices where hikers replenish food and other supplies such as cooking fuel. Hikers can ship packages to themselves at the U.S. Post Offices along the trail, resupply at general and grocery stores along the trail, or any combination of the two.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.planyourhike.com/planning/resupplypoints.php | title = Pacific Crest Trail Resupply Points | publisher = PlanYourHike.com | accessdate = 2010-03-01 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110107211853/http://www.planyourhike.com/planning/resupplypoints.php | archivedate = 2011-01-07 }}</ref> The final major logistical step is to create an approximate schedule for completion. Thru hikers have to make sure they complete enough miles every day to reach the opposite end of the trail before weather conditions make sections impassable. For northbound thru-hikers, deep snow pack in the Sierra Nevada can prevent an early start. The timing is a balance between not getting to the Sierra too soon nor the Northern Cascades too late. Most hikers cover about 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) per day.<ref name=pctfaq/>

In order to reduce their hiking time and thereby increase their chances of completing the trail, many hikers try to substantially reduce their pack weight. Since the creation of the Pacific Crest Trail there has been a large movement by hikers to get away from large heavy packs with a lot of gear. There are three general classifications for hikers: Traditional, Lightweight, and [[Ultralight backpacking|Ultralight]].<ref name=Jardine>{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=Ray|title=Beyond Backpacking: Ray Jardine's Guide to Lightweight Hiking|location=LaPine, OR|publisher=AventureLore|year=2000|isbn=978-0-9632359-3-0}}</ref><ref name="UltraLight Backpacking">{{cite web|title=Ultralight Backpacking: Have You Considered It?|url=https://hikingspree.com/ultralight-backpacking/|website=hikingspree.com|accessdate=23 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924001503/https://hikingspree.com/ultralight-backpacking/|archivedate=24 September 2017}}</ref>

==Notable hikers==
Before the PCT became an official trail, Martin Papendick was the first known person to hike across three states of the PCT in 1952.<ref name=PCTbook>{{cite book|title=The Pacific Crest Trail: Southern California|first1=Ben|last1=Schifrin|first2=Jeffrey P|last2=Schaffer|first3=Ruby Johnson|last3=Jenkins|page=5|publisher=Wilderness Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-89997-316-6|url=https://archive.org/details/pacificcresttrai0000unse/page/5}}</ref> After being one of the first to finish the [[Appalachian trail]] in 1951, Papendick hiked between July 4 and December 1, 1952, from British Columbia to the Mexico–US border over the crests of the mountains along the Pacific Coast, a feat he reported in a periodical under the title "Pacific Crest Trails".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Martin|last=Papendick|title=Pacific Crest Trails|journal=Appalachia|volume=XXVIII|pages=374–376|publisher=Appalachian Mountain Club, 1953}}</ref>
<!--Barry Murray with his three young children: they rode the PCT on horse back between April 1969 and October 1970 (http://www.searchforashadowofthepast.com/index.html) -->

On October 16, 1970, Eric Ryback, an 18-year-old student, completed the first PCT thru-hike. His personal congratulations came by telegram from Edward P. Cliff, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ryback-returns-sept09.pdf|title=Ryback Returns|publisher=Pcta.org|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924065924/http://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ryback-returns-sept09.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> Ryback is credited, recognized, and has been honored by the Pacific Crest Trail Association as the official first thru-hiker of the entire trail.<ref name=funFacts/> Ryback completed the Appalachian Trail in 1969 (as a 16-year-old); the Pacific Crest Trail in 1970; and a route approximating today's Continental Divide Trail in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Medals4MilesFeb2010.pdf|title=Medals for Miles|publisher=Pcta.org|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924065930/http://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Medals4MilesFeb2010.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> Ryback's 1971 book ''The High Adventure of Eric Ryback: Canada to Mexico on Foot'' focused public attention on the PCT. Ryback carried an 80-pound pack on his 1970 thru-hike. He had only five resupply packages on the entire trip and was loaded with 40 pounds of food at the start of each leg. He often ran out of food and foraged or went hungry.<ref name=funFacts>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcta.org/about_trail/fun.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821135547/http://www.pcta.org/about_trail/fun.asp|archivedate=2012-08-21|publisher=Pacific Crest Trail Association|title=Fun Facts|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ryback also helped the Forest Service lay out future plans for the PCT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mchalepacks.com/ultralight/Detail%20Hi%20Rez%20Pages/Muir%20Trail%20Story.htm|title=Muir Trail Story|publisher=Mchalepacks.com|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226114742/http://www.mchalepacks.com/ultralight/Detail%20Hi%20Rez%20Pages/Muir%20Trail%20Story.htm|archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref>

However, Ryback's claim is disputed. When the guidebook publisher, Wilderness Press, stated that Ryback had used motor transport in places along the PCT, Ryback sued for $3 million but withdrew the suit after Wilderness Press revealed statements from the people who claim to have picked up the young hiker along highways parallel to the 2,600-mile trail. Ryback is in Smithsonian's top 9 list of people ''Cheating Their Way to Fame'' though it notes that "the claims that Ryback 'cheated' are still doubted by some."<ref>{{cite web

The first person to hike the PCT from south to north was Richard Watson, who completed the trail on September 1, 1972.<ref name=PCTbook/> Watson was often credited as the first PCT thru-hiker, because Papendick was generally unknown and Ryback may have accepted rides.<ref name=PCTbook/> The first woman to complete the PCT was Mary Carstens, who finished the journey later in 1972, accompanied by Jeff Smukler.<ref name=PCTbook/>

The first person to thru-hike the entire PCT both ways in a single continuous round-trip was [[Scott Williamson (hiker)|Scott Williamson]], who completed the "yo-yo" circuit on his fourth attempt in November 2004. Williamson traveled a total of {{convert|5300|mi|km|-1}} in 197 days, covering an average of {{convert|35|to|40|mi|km|0}} per day when not in snow – an overall average of {{convert|27|mi|km}} per day – wearing an extremely [[Ultralight backpacking|ultra-lightweight pack]], which "without food, weighed about {{convert|8.5|lb|kg|1}}".<ref>{{cite news

Her memoir ''[[Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail]]'' was published in 2012 and reached #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers list.<ref>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Ihsan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-07-15/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html |title=Best Sellers - The New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |accessdate=2012-03-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712023108/http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-07-15/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 }}</ref> Her hike is the subject of the 2014 film [[Wild (2014 film)|''Wild'']], starring [[Reese Witherspoon]].

The first two reported deaths on the Pacific Crest Trail were in November 1995, when thru-hikers Jane and Flicka Rodman were killed during a detour down [[California State Route 138]] in [[Southern California]], when they were struck by a motorist who lost control of his vehicle. They were less than 400 miles from their goal of reaching the Mexico–US border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcta.org/about-us/history/in-memoriam/jane-and-flicka-rodman/|title=Jane and Flicka Rodman|publisher=Pacific Crest Trail Association|accessdate=2015-05-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426141756/http://www.pcta.org/about-us/history/in-memoriam/jane-and-flicka-rodman/ |archivedate=2015-04-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sierra hikers remembered in trek by family, friends|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/1997/aug/18/sierra-hikers-remembered-in-trek-by-family-friends/|accessdate=8 May 2015|newspaper=The Las Vegas Sun|date=Aug 18, 1997|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722105905/http://lasvegassun.com/news/1997/aug/18/sierra-hikers-remembered-in-trek-by-family-friends/|archivedate=22 July 2015}}</ref>

The oldest person to thru-hike the trail is not fully established, with multiple competing claims.

On August 7, 2013, Heather "Anish" Anderson of [[Bellingham, Washington]], set the current unsupported speed record. She completed the entire PCT in 60 days, 17 hours, 12 minutes,<ref>Doug Williams, [http://espn.go.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/9629683/endurance-sports-josh-garrett-heather-anderson-master-pacific-crest-trail Records set on Pacific Crest Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001225751/http://espn.go.com/sports/endurance/story/_/id/9629683/endurance-sports-josh-garrett-heather-anderson-master-pacific-crest-trail |date=2015-10-01 }}, at ESPN Enduracne Sports, September 3, 2013</ref> beating the previous record by almost 4 days.<ref name=fkt>{{cite web|url=http://fastestknowntime.proboards.com/thread/29|title=Pacific Crest Trail (CA, OR, WA)|publisher=Fastest Known Time|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113170508/http://fastestknowntime.proboards.com/thread/29|archivedate=13 January 2015}}</ref> She documented this journey in her book, "Thirst".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thirst : 2600 miles to home|last=Anderson, Heather|isbn=9781680512366|location=Seattle, Washington|oclc=1055681514|year=2019}}</ref>  In 2018 she became the first woman to complete the [[Triple Crown of Hiking]] in a single calendar year.

On August 10, 2014, Joseph McConaughy of [[Shoreline, Washington]], and a former [[Boston College]] middle distance runner, set a new supported speed record and the overall fastest time for the PCT. The distance was covered in 53 days, 6 hours, and 37 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwpr.org/post/seattle-runner-smashes-speed-record-full-length-pacific-crest-trail|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212654/http://nwpr.org/post/seattle-runner-smashes-speed-record-full-length-pacific-crest-trail|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-08-12|title=Seattle Runner Smashes Speed Record For Full Length of Pacific Crest Trail|publisher=Northwest Public Radio}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024221697_pacificcrestrunner02xml.html|title=55 miles a day: Blistering pace for hiker seeking Pacific Crest record|newspaper=The Seattle Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812141659/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024221697_pacificcrestrunner02xml.html|archivedate=2014-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runforcolin.com/#!blog/c16p9|title=Run For Colin|publisher=Runforcolin.com|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113000909/http://www.runforcolin.com/#!blog/c16p9|archivedate=13 January 2015}}</ref> This overcame the previous record of 59 days, 8 hours, 14 minutes,<ref name=fkt/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcta.org/2013/pct-speed-record-is-shattered-twice-13750/|title=PCT speed record is shattered twice|date=9 August 2013|publisher=Pacific Crest Trail Association|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113165321/http://www.pcta.org/2013/pct-speed-record-is-shattered-twice-13750/|archivedate=13 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-vegan-hiker-sets-new-record-on-pacific-crest-trail/|title=Vegan Hiker Sets New Record On Pacific Crest Trail|publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113170613/http://www.opb.org/news/article/npr-vegan-hiker-sets-new-record-on-pacific-crest-trail/|archivedate=13 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/2013/08/man-woman-set-records-on-pacific-crest-trail/|title=Man, woman set records on Pacific Crest Trail|newspaper=Seattle Times|accessdate=13 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113170231/http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/2013/08/man-woman-set-records-on-pacific-crest-trail/|archivedate=13 January 2015}}</ref> set by Josh Garret on August 8, 2013, by more than 6 days.

==Equestrian use==
Don and June Mulford made the first verifiable equestrian Thru-Ride of the PCT in 1959.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=PCTA Communicator|date=December 2009|first=Barney|last=Mann|url=https://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Mulfords_Dec09_spreads.pdf|title=Giving Trail History Its Due: The 1959 Thru-Ride of Don and June Mulford}}</ref> In that year the Pacific Crest Trail stretched a poorly marked 2,400 miles from Mexico to Canada. More concept than footpath, the trail was an oft-broken, high-ridge track disappearing regularly from map and terrain. On April 19, 1959, on an empty scrub sage plain seven miles east of Tijuana, with four horses, Don and June Mulford began their journey north to the Washington–Canada border. The Mulfords went to Hollywood for three months immediately after the ride and were featured on network television. June's old press book yields a half-dozen TV-Guide pages, and she recalls, "Art Linkletter was such a nice man. We appeared on his 'House Party' show and he had coffee with us afterward." "High Road to Danger," a syndicated TV show, made an episode on their ride. Even after they had returned home to the Northwest, there was continued TV coverage. A January 1961 TV Guide records their appearance on Portland's [[KOIN]] Red Dunning Show. The Mulfords even made a 90-minute movie and showed it around 12 western states for 10 years.

The Murray family – Barry, Bernice, Barry Jr. and Bennette – completed the trek on horseback on October 7, 1970.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Life Magazine|date=September 3, 1971|pages=60–69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SkAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=60|title=Twenty-five hundred miles on horseback|first=Barry|last=Murray}}</ref>{{Third-party inline|date=June 2019}}

==Future==
• In 2008, an agreement for realignment through [[Tejon Ranch]] in Southern California was reached.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcta.org/2014/pct-tejon-ranch-step-closer-19979/|title=PCT alignment through Tejon Ranch a big step closer - Pacific Crest Trail Association|date=2014-05-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806031535/http://www.pcta.org/2014/pct-tejon-ranch-step-closer-19979/|archivedate=2016-08-06}}</ref> This realignment would relocate 37 miles of the PCT from the Mojave Desert floor to the more scenic Tehachapi Mountains. While an agreement was reached, the realignment is a long-term project; many details remain to be determined, as well as an Optimal Location Review—a lengthy process through which the ideal path for the new section of trail is specified. Actual relocation of the trail is unlikely to happen before 2021.

• Plans are currently in progress to add a dedicated pedestrian/equestrian lane to the [[Bridge of the Gods (modern structure)|Bridge of the Gods]] across the Columbia River.<ref>{{Cite web|last=PortofCascadeLocks|title=Bridge of the Gods Pedestrian Lane|url=https://portofcascadelocks.org/bridge-of-the-gods-pedestrian-lane/|access-date=2020-08-01|website=Port of Cascade Locks|language=en-US}}</ref> Currently, PCT hikers and equestrians must cross the bridge walking in vehicle traffic lanes—a potential danger which the new lane will eliminate. A completion date for this project is unknown.

==Notable locations==
