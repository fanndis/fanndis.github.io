An initial public offering ([[IPO]]) was floated in February 1993 with an offer price of {{INRConvert|95|year=1993}} per share against a book value of {{INRConvert|20|year=1993}} per share.

==Controversies==

'''Settlement of tax fraud in the US'''

In December 2019, the Attorney General of California, Xavier Becerra announced an $800,000 settlement against Infosys and its BPM (business process management) subsidiary. Close to 500 Infosys employees were working in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas instead of H-1B visas between 2006 and 2017, as per an official post available on the website of State of California.<ref>{{Cite web|date=17 December 2019|title=Attorney General Becerra Announces $800,000 Settlement Against Infosys for Misclassification of Foreign Workers and Tax Fraud|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-800000-settlement-against-infosys|access-date=23 October 2020|website=State of California - Department of Justice - Office of the Attorney General|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|others=Special Correspondent|date=18 December 2019|title=Infosys to settle visa violation case in California for $800,000|language=en-IN|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/infosys-to-settle-visa-violation-case-in-california-for-800000/article30335612.ece|access-date=23 October 2020|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

'''Accusation of visa fraud in the US'''

In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing [[visa fraud]] by using [[B visa|B-1]] (visitor) visas for work requiring [[H-1B]] (work) visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that case was dismissed,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/us/alabama-judge-dismisses-infosys-whistle-blower-suit.html |title=Judge dismisses Infosys suit |work=The New York Times |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012 |first=Julia |last=Preston |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021012506/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/us/alabama-judge-dismisses-infosys-whistle-blower-suit.html |archive-date=21 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> it along with another similar case,<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443537404577578653130863044 "Former Employee Sues Infosys"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709234620/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443537404577578653130863044 |date=9 July 2017 }}, 9 August 2012, ''The Wall Street Journal''</ref><ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/271636/infosys-slashed-80-my-portfolio.html {{"'}}Infosys slashed 80% of my portfolio{{'"}}] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109081132/http://www.deccanherald.com/content/271636/infosys-slashed-80-my-portfolio.html |date=9 November 2012 }}, Shayan Ghosh, 14 August 2012, ''Deccan Herald''</ref><ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/infosys-says-settles-whistleblower-satya-dev-tripuraneni-visa-fraud-lawsuit/1045403 "Infosys says settles whistleblower..."], 14 December 2012, ''The Indian Express''</ref> brought the allegations to the notice of the US authorities&nbsp;– and the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and a [[federal grand jury]] started investigating.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thibodeau |first=Patrick |title=Whistleblower to continue helping U.S. Infosys probe |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9230419/Whistleblower_to_continue_helping_U.S._Infosys_probe |work=Computerworld |accessdate=27 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102154924/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9230419/Whistleblower_to_continue_helping_U.S._Infosys_probe |archive-date=2 November 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

'''Displacement of American workers at Southern California Edison and Disney'''

In 2015, the [[United States Department of Labor]] began an investigation of Infosys after claims were made that the company used workers with H-1B visas to replace workers at [[Disney]] and [[Southern California Edison]]. The investigation did not find any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Sarah|title=Infosys says cleared in U.S. visa probe by Labor Department|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/infosys-h1b-probes-idUSL1N11A0TQ20150908|agency=Reuters|accessdate=29 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202063845/http://www.reuters.com/article/infosys-h1b-probes-idUSL1N11A0TQ20150908|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Financial Irregularities'''

In 2019, whistle blowers alleged irregularities in the company's financial accounting. Internal investigations conducted by the company concluded that the allegations were without merit.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Parkin|first1=Benjamin|date=10 January 2020|title=Infosys probe finds whistleblower complaints were without merit|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d9889bf8-3399-11ea-9703-eea0cae3f0de|accessdate=21 August 2020|website=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times of London}}</ref> External auditors said that Infosys' approach to revenue recognition was in line with IAS 34 regulations.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mohapatra|first=Debasis|date=21 October 2019|title=Whistleblower stings Infosys again; alleges irregularities in accounting|work=Business Standard India|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/whistleblower-stings-infosys-over-allegation-of-wrong-accounting-practices-119102100499_1.html|access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>
