'''''B'Day Anthology Video Album''''' is the first [[video album]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. It features thirteen music videos for songs from her second studio album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' (2006) and its deluxe edition (2007). It was released through [[Columbia Records]], [[Sony Music]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] exclusively through [[Walmart]] stores on April 3, 2007 alongside the deluxe edition, but was later serviced to other retailers. Beyoncé shot nine videos for the album, and four pre-filmed videos were also included. ''B'Day Anthology Video Album'' has been [[RIAA certification|certified double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Outside North America, the album was featured as a bonus disc to the deluxe edition of ''B'Day''. The "[[Kissing You (Des'ree song)|Still in Love (Kissing You)]]" video was the subject of a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit, therefore only initial pressings of the album contain its video.

Gotta do something for "Beautiful Liar", that's the song with Shakira, of course we know we gotta do a video for that ... If I had another week I probably would have shot three more videos.

Beyoncé said that she filmed ''B'Day Anthology Video Album'' because she "always wanted to do a video album" so that her fans wouldn't have to log onto [[YouTube]] to watch her music videos, but could instead play them via DVD.<ref name="USAtoday">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-04-05-beyonce-video-album_N.htm |title=Beyonce releases 'B'Day' video album |work=USA Today |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=April 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref> Beyoncé knew what the videos' choreography would be before the filming began.

==Critical reception==
Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] criticized the music videos for the songs on ''B'Day Anthology Video Album'', writing that "none of them are anything special, though most will please narrow-minded fans".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2007/07/upgrade-b|title=Upgrade B|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|first=Sal|last=Cinquemani|date=April 7, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref> To celebrate the album's tenth anniversary, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' published "Beyoncé's Best Fashion Moments from Her Decade-Old 'B'Day Anthology Video Album'", the list in which ''Billboard'' editor Da'Shan Smith commented on ten best outfits Beyoncé wore in the music videos, on April 3, 2017, and stated: "The project has delivered audiences some of the singer's most iconic looks. In every frame she appears in, Beyoncé oozes a radiant confidence, wearing stunning outfits and costumes to match. Here is the project's ten best looks – from [[House of Deréon]] signatures to impromptu costume designs and haute couture get ups."<ref>{{cite web|first=Da'Shan|last=Smith|url=http://www.billboard.com/photos/7743515/beyonce-top-fashion-moments-from-bday|title=Beyoncé's Best Fashion Moments From Her Decade-Old 'B'Day Anthology Video Album'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref> The same day, ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' published a list in which Smith ranked all thirteen music videos from the worst to the best; he stated: "''B'Day Video Anthology Album'' must be heralded as an important pop culture artifact. As expressed before, it's the birther of Beyoncé's passion for providing fans visual sequences they need to tell an album’s story. Imagine a ''B'Day'' without its ''Anthology''—although the [[Go-go music|go-go]] and [[Funk music|funk]] infused tracks already made an impression upon audio listens only, the visuals made the record pop to life."<ref>{{cite web|first=Da'Shan|last=Smith|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/04/beyonce-bday-video-anthology-album-10-year-anniversary/|title=A Ranking Of Beyonce's 'B' Day Anthology Video Album' – Vibe|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Controversy==
{{main|Kissing You (Des'ree song)#Lawsuit|l1=''"Kissing You"''}}
Beyoncé covered [[Des'ree]]'s song "[[Kissing You (Des'ree song)|Kissing You]]" for the deluxe edition of ''B'Day'' and retitled it "Still in Love (Kissing You)". She filmed a video of the song for ''B'Day Anthology Video Album''; however one of the conditions set out by Des'ree's publishers, the Royalty Network, was that Beyoncé didn't release the song in video form. The Royalty Network filed a [[copyright infringement]] [[lawsuit]] against the involved parties seeking US$150,000 in damages.<ref name="over">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1557909/beyonce-pulls-bday-deluxe-edition-due-lawsuit.jhtml |title=Beyonce's ''B'Day'' Over?

;Notes
* The length of each of the music videos includes a five-second bumble bee introduction, except for "Green Light", which is listed as a continuation of "Kitty Kat" and therefore has no introduction. The credits and "Anthology Behind the Scenes" also don't include introductions.
