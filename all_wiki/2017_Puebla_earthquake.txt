==Background==
[[File:Mexico tectonic plates.png|thumb|220px|right|Tectonic plates of Mexico. Visible in the image is most of the North American continent, along with Central America. Mexico is located in the lower middle part of the picture, to the right of the Cocos plate.]]
Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions, sitting atop several intersecting [[tectonic plate]]s. The border between the [[Cocos Plate]] and [[North American Plate]], along the Pacific Coast of Mexico, creates a [[subduction zone]] that generates large seismic events.<ref name="USGS"/> Activity along the edges of the [[Rivera Plate|Rivera]] and [[Caribbean]] plates also generate seismic events. All together, these seismic forces cause an average of 40 earthquakes a day in Mexico.<ref name="SSN"/>

Mexico City is [[Lake Texcoco|built on a dry lakebed]] with soft soil made up of sand and clay, which amplifies the destruction that major earthquakes cause.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Grad |first1=Shelby |last2=Lin |first2=Rong-Gong II |date=19 September 2017 |title=Mexico City's notoriously soft soil probably contributed to destruction from 7.1 earthquake |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-soft-soil-20170919-htmlstory.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref> Loose sediments near the surface slow the shockwaves' speed from {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} per second (8700&nbsp;km/h) to roughly {{convert|150|ft|m}} per second (160&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/22/world/americas/mexico-city-earthquake-lake-bed-geology.html|title=Mexico City Was Built on an Ancient Lake Bed.

Deeper and denser soil layers increase amplified shockwaves' destructive duration.<ref name=":0" />

Less than two weeks before the Puebla earthquake, Mexico had been struck by an [[2017 Chiapas earthquake|earthquake in Chiapas]] on 7 September, which killed almost 100 people. Despite its close timing, the Puebla earthquake was not an [[aftershock]] of the Chiapas event, as the epicenters were {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} apart.<ref>{{cite news |date=19 September 2017 |title=The Latest: Seismologist: Mexico's 7.1 quake not aftershock |url=https://apnews.com/f6e1ffab3ccc4057a8ba47765c8c9632/The-Latest:-Seismologist:-Mexico's-7.1-quake-not-aftershock |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=19 September 2017}}</ref>

The possibility of a [[Remotely triggered earthquakes|link between the earthquakes]] was being investigated in the days after the second one. Big earthquakes can increase the long-term risk of seismic activity by [[Coulomb stress transfer|transferring "static stress"]] to adjacent faults, but only at a distance of up to four times the length of the original rupture. In 19 September earthquake, static stress transfer was considered unlikely due to the distance between the earthquakes, in excess of the expected 400&nbsp;km maximum. "Dynamic triggering", with seismic waves propagating from one quake affecting other faults, may operate at much longer distances, but usually happens within hours or a few days of the triggering quake; a 12-day gap is hard to explain.<ref name="Witze2017">{{cite journal|last1=Witze|first1=Alexandra|title=Pair of deadly Mexico quakes puzzles scientists|journal=Nature|date=20 September 2017 |issn=1476-4687|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22650}}</ref>

19 September is designated as a day of remembrance for the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], which killed approximately 10,000 civilians.
