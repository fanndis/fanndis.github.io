'''Karel Lodewijk Georgette Emmerence De Gucht''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈkarəl də ˈɣɵxt}}; born 27 January 1954) is a Belgian politician who was the [[European Commissioner for Trade]] from February 2010 until 31 October 2014.<ref name=bio>[http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/degucht/ "The Commissioners (2010–2014): Karel De Gucht"], European Commission</ref> Previously, he served as Belgium's [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Belgium)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 2004 to 2009 and as the [[European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response]] from 2009 to 2010.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/degucht/index_en.html European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid]</ref>

==Early life and education==
De Gucht was born in [[Overmere]], [[Belgium]]. He entered politics at a young age, and became president of the [[LVSV|Flemish Liberal Students]] while studying at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] in [[Brussels]]. He graduated with a master's degree in Law and practised as a lawyer, mainly in commercial matters, at the bar of Ghent. He later taught European Law at his university.

==Political career==
===Member of the European Parliament, 1980–1994===
De Gucht became a member of the [[European Parliament]] in 1980 and fulfilled this mandate until 1994. In 1989 he was the rapporteur of a landmark Parliamentary Declaration on the Fundamental Rights, leading eventually to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], which was later integrated as an essential part of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].

===Career in national politics===
De Gucht entered the [[Flemish Parliament]] after the elections of 1994 and moved to the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] in 2003, where he remained until 2004. In 1999 he was elected party president of the Flemish liberal party ([[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten]]). Although he was elected to the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Federal Parliament]] in the [[2003 Belgian general election|general election]] on 18 May 2003 and to the European Parliament in the elections of June 2004, he occupied the first seat only very briefly and the second not at all.

He entered the Belgian government on 18 July 2004 as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Belgium)|Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. He served as deputy prime minister in 2008–2009. He was Chairman-in-Office of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] in 2006.<ref name="osce">{{cite news |title=OSCE's Belgian Chairmanship says helped start new chapter for Organization |url=http://www.osce.org/node/48006 |accessdate=3 October 2014 |work=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe |date=5 December 2006 }}</ref> He was a Member of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council of the United Nations]] (2007–08) and Member of the European Council (2004–09).

===European Commission, 2009–2014===
In July 2009 De Gucht was appointed as the Belgian European Commissioner, in succession of [[Louis Michel]]. Like his predecessor, he was in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid, but from February 2010 onwards, he became Commissioner of Trade in the [[Barroso Commission|Barroso II Commission]], until 31 October 2014.

He prepared and launched free trade negotiations with the [[United States]], the so-called [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP). He achieved important trade agreements, among others with [[South-Korea]] (2011), [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] (2013), [[Central America]], [[Singapore]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Ukraine]] (2014). In October 2014 he concluded CETA, the free trade agreement with [[Canada]] and the first ever agreement with a [[G7]] member. He oversaw the start of trade negotiations with [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], resumed talks with [[Mercosur]] and began investment agreement negotiations with [[China]]. He also concluded landmark economic partnership agreements with [[West Africa]] (ECOWAS), [[South Africa]] (SADC) and [[Eastern Africa]] (EAC), covering together 75% of African economy.

De Gucht performed his ultimate duty as a commissioner by signing in Nairobi on 31 October 2014 the agreement with the Eastern African Community (EAC), consisting of [[Burundi]], [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]]. He also played a key role in the conclusion of a comprehensive trade agreement between the [[European Union]] and [[Ukraine]], which was a direct cause of the [[Euromaidan|upheavals in Independence Square]] and the [[2013–14 Ukrainian Crisis]].

At the end of his mandate he enjoyed a strong reputation within the European Commission because of the progression in the trade portfolio during his mandate and because of his strong views on European policy questions.<ref>[http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20141024_01340983 Exit interview De Gucht]</ref> At the end of this mandate he decided to leave politics, except on the local level, where he will be the chairman of the local council.<ref>[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20140916_01272405 De Guchts ends as European commissioner]</ref>

==Controversies==
De Gucht is well known for his outspoken views on different political issues.

On a trip to Africa in late 2004, De Gucht sparked a diplomatic controversy when he said that "there is a problem with the political class in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]" and questioned its ability to tackle corruption.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3753272.stm |title=Belgium rounds on former colony |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=18 October 2004 |accessdate=6 January 2010 }}</ref>  De Gucht received a lot of informal support in diplomatic circles and media and refused to retract his statement. Subsequent news stories suggested his concerns were well-founded.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3944591.stm |title=DR Congo slams 'Tintin' minister |date=22 October 2004 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}</ref>

In November 2008 he was accused by an anonymous person and by the president of the extreme-right party [[Vlaams Belang]] of insider trading.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/477613/2008/11/05/Fortis-aandelen-zijn-pure-privezaak.dhtml |title=De Gucht: "Fortis-aandelen zijn pure privézaak" |work=[[De Morgen]] |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2013|language=nl}}</ref> The [[Ghent]] public prosecutor ultimately decided not to pursue an investigation in the matter stating that "from the investigations it appears that Mr. De Gucht has never abused his inside knowledge of the Fortis situation, more specifically the loss in the value of its shares", and closed the case.

Later in his career, De Gucht caused controversy by his active promotion of the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP). Some critics accused him of being over-enthusiastic about the TTIP, playing down potential risks to European small and medium-sized companies associated with the so-called [[Investor-state dispute settlement]] (ISDS) mechanism, and even of ignoring public concerns about the ISDS.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/consultation%20ISDS%20discount.html |title=Did you take action on ISDS?
