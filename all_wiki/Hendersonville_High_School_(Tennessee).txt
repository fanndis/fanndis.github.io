'''Hendersonville High School''' is one of three public high schools located in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]], [[Sumner County, Tennessee|Sumner County]], [[Tennessee]]. The principal is Bob Cotter, a former principal for the alternative school R.T. Fisher. It is part of [[Sumner County Schools]]. Two middle schools feed into Hendersonville High: Ellis Middle School and Hawkins Middle School.

The school's colors have been black and gold ever since the first Commando football team in 1941, when the [[Vanderbilt University]] football  program provided the first Commando football team with older, used jerseys. The black and gold colors have remained ever since.  Hendersonville is known as the [[Commando]]s because 54 men were sent to fight in [[World War II]]. When they came back as veteran commandos the name stuck with the school and became the official mascot.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}
