The '''Iron Curtain''' was a political boundary dividing [[Europe]] into two separate areas from the end of [[World War II]] in 1945 until the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991. The term symbolizes the efforts by the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) to block itself and its [[satellite state]]s from open contact with [[Western Bloc|the West]] and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were [[NATO]] members or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain. It later became a term for the {{convert|7000|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} physical barrier of fences, walls, minefields, and watchtowers that divided the "east" and "west". The [[Berlin Wall]] was also part of this physical barrier.

The nations to the east of the Iron Curtain were [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[East Germany]], [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], and the [[USSR]]; however, [[Reunification of Germany|East Germany]], [[Breakup of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], and the [[Dissolution of the USSR|USSR]] have since ceased to exist. Countries that [[Republics of the USSR|made up the USSR]] were [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], [[Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarus]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldova]], [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajikistan]], [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]], [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenistan]], and [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]].

The use of the term ''Iron Curtain'' as a [[metaphor]] for strict separation goes back at least as far as the early 19th century. It originally referred to fireproof curtains in theaters.<ref name="Feuerlicht"/> Although its popularity as a Cold War symbol is attributed to its use in a speech [[Winston Churchill]] gave on the 5 March 1946 in [[Fulton, Missouri|Fulton]], [[Missouri]],<ref name="Feuerlicht"/> Nazi German Minister of Propaganda [[Joseph Goebbels]] had already used the term in reference to the Soviet Union.<ref name=":0" />

On the one hand, the Iron Curtain was a separating barrier between the power blocs and, on the other hand, natural biotopes were formed here, as the [[European Green Belt]] shows today, or original cultural, ethnic or linguistic areas such as the area around [[Trieste]] were preserved.

==Pre-Cold War usage==
[[File:Bakom Rysslands jarnrid.jpg|thumb|Swedish book "''Behind Russia's iron curtain''" from 1923]]

Various usages of the term "iron curtain" ({{lang-ru |link=no|Железный занавес|translit=Zheleznyj zanaves}}; {{lang-de |link=no|Eiserner Vorhang}}; {{lang-ka|2=tr|link=no|რკინის ფარდა}}; [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Železná opona''; {{lang-hu |Vasfüggöny}}; {{lang-ro|Cortina de fier}}; {{lang-pl|Żelazna kurtyna}}; {{lang-it |Cortina di ferro}}; {{lang-sr|Гвоздена завеса|translit=Gvozdena zavesa}}; {{lang-et |Raudne eesriie}}; {{lang-bg|Желязна завеса|translit=Zhelyazna zavesä}}) pre-date Churchill's use of the phrase. The concept goes back to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] of the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, where {{Cite Talmud|b|Tractate Sota|4=38b|5=yes}} refers to a "mechitza shel barzel", an iron barrier or divider: "{{Lang|he|אפילו מחיצה של ברזל אינה מפסקת בין ישראל לאביהם שבשמים|rtl=yes}}" ({{Transliteration|he|Even an iron barrier cannot separate [the people of] Israel from their heavenly father}}).

The term "iron curtain" has since been used metaphorically in two rather different senses – firstly to denote the end of an era and secondly to denote a closed geopolitical border. The source of these metaphors can refer to either the [[safety curtain]] deployed in theatres (the first one was installed by the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1794<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/exploring-theatres/history-of-theatres/eighteenth-century-theatre |title=Eighteenth-century theatre | work = History of theatres - Exploring Theatres |publisher= The Theatres Trust |access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref>) or to [[roller shutter]]s used to secure commercial premises.<ref>{{citation|last= Proust|first= Marcel|title= The Captive |translator-last= Scott Moncrieff|translator-first=C.K. |year= 1929}}</ref>

The first metaphorical usage of "iron curtain", in the sense of an end of an era, perhaps should be attributed to British author [[Arthur Machen]] (1863–1947), who used the term in his 1895 novel ''The Three Impostors'': "...the door clanged behind me with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life".<ref>{{citation |last= Machen |first= Arthur |title=The Three Impostors |publisher= Aegypan Press |location=Los Angeles(?) |year=2005 |page= 60 |isbn=1-59818-437-7}}</ref> The English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of "clang" with reference to an "iron curtain", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.

[[Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians]] used the term "Iron Curtain" in the context of World War I to describe the political situation between [[Belgium]] and [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] in 1914.<ref>Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians to Pierre Loti in 1915 ({{citation |first= Pierre |last= Loti |title= L'Album de la Guerre |edition=L'Illustration |location= Paris |year=1923 |page= 33}}).</ref>

The first recorded application of the term to [[Soviet Russia]], again in the sense of the end of an era, comes in [[Vasily Rozanov]]'s 1918 polemic ''[[The Apocalypse of Our Times]]'', and it is possible that Churchill read it there following the publication of the book's English translation in 1920. The passage runs:
{{Quote |With clanging, creaking, and squeaking, an iron curtain is lowering over Russian History. "The performance is over." The audience got up. "Time to put on your fur coats and go home." We looked around, but the fur coats and homes were missing.<ref>{{Citation |last =Rozanov | first =Vasily| title = The Apocalypse of our Times ("Апокалипсис нашего времени") | year =1918 | location =103| page =212}}</ref>}}

(Incidentally, this same passage provides a definition of [[nihilism]] adopted by [[Raoul Vaneigem]],<ref>{{Citation|last = Vaneigem | first = Raoul| title =The Revolution of Everyday Life ("Traité de savoir-vivre à l'usage des jeunes générations") | publisher = Red and Black | year =1967 | location = 176 | page = 279 }}</ref> [[Guy Debord]] and other [[Situationist International|Situationists]] as the intention of situationist intervention.)

The first English-language use of the term ''[[Iron (metaphor)|iron]] [[curtain]]'' applied to the border of Soviet Russia in the sense of "an impenetrable barrier" was used in 1920 by [[Ethel Snowden]], in her book ''Through Bolshevik Russia''.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Cohen |first1 = J.

[[G.K. Chesterton]] used the phrase in a 1924 essay in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''. Chesterton, while defending [[Distributism]], refers to "that iron curtain of [[industrialism]] that has cut us off not only from our neighbours' condition, but even from our own past".<ref>{{Citation |last= Chesterton |first=G.K. |title= The Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton: The Illustrated London News 1923 – 1925 |publisher= Ignatius Press |year= 1990 |page=452 |isbn= 0-89870-274-7}}</ref>

The term also appears in ''[[England, Their England]]'', an 1933 satirical novel by the Scottish writer A. G. Macdonell; it was used there to describe the way an artillery barrage protected the infantry from an enemy assault: "...the western sky was a blaze of yellow flame. The iron curtain was down". [[Sebastian Haffner]] used the metaphor in his book ''Germany: Jekyll & Hyde'', published in London in 1940, in introducing his discussion of the Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933: "Back then to March 1933. How, a moment before the iron curtain was wrung down on it, did the German political stage appear?"<ref>{{citation |last=Haffner |first= Sebastian |year=2008 |title=Germany: Jekyll & Hyde: A contemporary account of Nazi Germany |isbn=978-0-349-11889-5 |location=London |publisher= Abacus |page= 177}}</ref>

All German theatres{{when|date=August 2014}} had to install an iron curtain (''eiserner Vorhang'') as an obligatory precaution to prevent the possibility of fire spreading from the stage to the rest of the theatre. Such fires were rather common because the decor often was flammable. In case of fire, a metal wall would separate the stage from the theatre, secluding the flames to be extinguished by firefighters. [[Douglas Reed]] used this metaphor in his book ''Disgrace Abounding'': "The bitter strife [in Yugoslavia between Serb unionists and Croat federalists] had only been hidden by the iron safety-curtain of the King's dictatorship".<ref>{{citation |last= Reed |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Reed |title= Disgrace Abounding |publisher=Jonathan Cape |year=1939 |page= 129}}</ref>

A May 1943 article in ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'', a Nazi illustrated propaganda periodical published in many languages, bore the title "Behind the Iron Curtain". It discussed "the iron curtain that more than ever before separates the world from the Soviet Union".<ref name=":0">{{citation |title= Hinter dem eisernen Vorhang |newspaper= Signal |number= 9 |date= May 1943 |language= de |page= 2}}</ref> The German [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] wrote in his weekly newspaper ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'' that if the Nazis should lose the war a Soviet-formed "iron curtain" would arise because of agreements made by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Winston Churchill at the [[Yalta Conference]]: "An iron curtain would fall over this enormous territory controlled by the Soviet Union, behind which nations would be slaughtered".<ref name= Feuerlicht>{{citation |title=A New Look at the Iron Curtain |first= Ignace |last=Feuerlicht |journal= American Speech |volume= 30 |issue= 3 |date=October 1955 |pages=186–189 |doi=10.2307/453937 |jstor= 453937}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Goebbels |first= Joseph |url= http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/goeb49.htm |title= Das Jahr 2000 |newspaper=Das Reich |language=de |date= 25 February 1945 |pages=1–2 }}</ref> The first recorded oral intentional mention of an Iron Curtain in the Soviet context occurred in a broadcast by [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|Lutz von Krosigk]] to the German people on 2 May 1945: "In the East the iron curtain behind which, unseen by the eyes of the world, the work of destruction goes on, is moving steadily forward".<ref>{{citation|title=Krosigk's Cry of Woe |newspaper= The Times |date=3 May 1945 |page= 4}}</ref>

Churchill's first recorded use of the term "iron curtain" came in a 12 May 1945 telegram he sent to U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] regarding his concern about Soviet actions, stating "[a]n iron curtain is drawn down upon their front. We do not know what is going on behind".<ref name="maychurchill"/> He was further concerned about "another immense flight of the German population westward as this enormous Muscovite advance towards the centre of Europe".<ref name= "maychurchill"/> Churchill concluded "then the curtain will descend again to a very large extent, if not entirely. Thus a broad land of many hundreds of miles of Russian-occupied territory will isolate us from Poland".<ref name="maychurchill">{{Citation |last= Churchill |first= Winston S. |title= The Second World War, Triumph and Tragedy |publisher=Bantam |year=1962 |volume= 2 |chapter= 15 |pages= 489, 514}}</ref><ref>{{citation | publisher =US Dept of State |title= Foreign Relations of the US, The Conference of Berlin (Potsdam) |year=1945 |volume=1 |page= 9}}</ref>

Churchill repeated the words in a further telegram to President Truman on 4 June 1945, in which he protested against such a U.S. retreat to what was earlier designated as, and ultimately became, the U.S. occupation zone, saying the military withdrawal would bring "Soviet power into the heart of Western Europe and the descent of an iron curtain between us and everything to the eastward".{{sfn|Churchill |1962|p=92}} At the [[Potsdam Conference]], Churchill complained to Stalin about an "iron fence" coming down upon the British Mission in Bucharest.

The first American print reference to the "Iron Curtain" occurred when [[C. L. Sulzberger]] of ''The New York Times'' first used it in a dispatch published on 23 July 1945. He had heard the term used by [[Vladko Maček]], a [[Croatia]]n politician, a Yugoslav opposition leader who had fled his homeland for Paris in May 1945. Maček told Sulzberger, "During the four years while I was interned by the Germans in Croatia I saw how the Partisans were lowering an iron curtain over Jugoslavia [Yugoslavia] so that nobody could know what went on behind it".<ref>{{citation |last=Weintraub |first=Stanley |title= The Last Great Victory |publisher=Truman Talley Books |location= New York |year=1995 |page= 184}}</ref>

The term was first used in the British House of Commons by Churchill on 16 August 1945 when he stated "it is not impossible that tragedy on a prodigious scale is unfolding itself behind the iron curtain which at the moment divides Europe in twain".<ref>{{Citation |title= Debate on the address |publisher= Hansard, House of Commons |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1945/aug/16/debate-on-the-address#column_84 |at= column 84 |date= 16 August 1945 |volume= 413}}</ref>

[[Allen Dulles]] used the term in a speech on 3 December 1945, referring to only Germany, following his conclusion that "in general the Russians are acting little better than thugs", had "wiped out all the liquid assets", and refused to issue food cards to emigrating Germans, leaving them "often more dead than alive". Dulles concluded that "[a]n iron curtain has descended over the fate of these people and very likely conditions are truly terrible. The promises at Yalta to the contrary, probably 8 to 10 million people are being enslaved".{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The antagonism between the Soviet Union and the West that came to be described as the "iron curtain" had various origins.

During the summer of 1939, after conducting negotiations both with a British-French group and with [[Nazi Germany]] regarding potential military and political agreements,<ref>{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|pp=515–40}}</ref> the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]] (which provided for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials)<ref name="shirer668">{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=668}}</ref><ref name = "ericson57">{{Harvnb|Ericson|1999|p=57}}</ref> and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] (signed in late August 1939), named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries ([[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]), which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.<ref>Day, Alan J.; East, Roger; Thomas, Richard.

The Soviets thereafter occupied Eastern [[Poland]] (September 1939), [[Latvia]] (June 1940), [[Lithuania]] (1940), northern [[Romania]] ([[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]], late June 1940), [[Estonia]] (1940) and eastern [[Finland]] (March 1940). From August 1939, relations between the West and the Soviets deteriorated further when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany engaged in an extensive [[Nazi–Soviet economic relations|economic relationship]] by which the Soviet Union sent Germany vital oil, rubber, manganese and other materials in exchange for German weapons, manufacturing machinery and technology.<ref>{{citation|last=Ericson|first=Edward E.|title=Feeding the German Eagle: Soviet Economic Aid to Nazi Germany, 1933 – 1941 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=0-275-96337-3|pages=1–210}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Shirer|first=William L.|title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990 |isbn=0-671-72868-7|pages=598–610}}</ref> Nazi–Soviet trade ended in June 1941 when Germany broke the Pact and invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]].

In the course of World War II, Stalin determined{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} to acquire a buffer area against Germany, with pro-Soviet states on its border in an [[Eastern bloc]]. Stalin's aims led to strained relations at the [[Yalta Conference]] (February 1945) and the subsequent [[Potsdam Conference]] (July-August 1945).<ref>
{{Citation |first=Gar |last=Alperovitz |title=Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam: The Use of the Atomic Bomb and the American Confrontation with Soviet Power|orig-year=1965 |year=1985|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-008337-8}}</ref> People in the West expressed opposition to Soviet domination over the buffer states, and the fear grew that the Soviets were building an empire that might be a threat to them and their interests.

Nonetheless, at the [[Potsdam Conference]], the Allies assigned parts of Poland, Finland, Romania, Germany, and the Balkans to Soviet control or influence. In return, Stalin promised the Western Allies that he would allow those territories the right to [[Self-determination|national self-determination]]. Despite Soviet cooperation during the war, these concessions left many in the West uneasy. In particular, Churchill feared that the United States might return to its pre-war [[United States isolationism|isolationism]], leaving the exhausted European states unable to resist Soviet demands. (President Franklin D. Roosevelt had announced at Yalta that after the defeat of Germany, U.S. forces would withdraw from Europe within two years.)<ref>[[Antony Beevor]] ''Berlin: The building of the Berlin Wall'', p. 80</ref>

===Iron Curtain speech===
{{Wikisource|Iron Curtain Speech}}

Winston Churchill's [[:s:Sinews of Peace|"Sinews of Peace" address]] of 5 March 1946, at [[Westminster College, Missouri|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri]], used the term "iron curtain" in the context of Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe:

[[File:Iron Curtain as described by Churchill.PNG|thumb|The Iron Curtain as described by Churchill at Westminster College. Note that Vienna (''center red regions, 3rd down'') is indeed behind the Curtain, as it was in the Austrian [[Allied-occupied Austria|Soviet-occupied zone]].]]

{{blockquote|From [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to [[Trieste]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston|title=The Sinews of Peace ('Iron Curtain Speech')|url=https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1946-1963-elder-statesman/the-sinews-of-peace/|website=Winstonchurchill.org|publisher=[[International Churchill Society]]|access-date=2 December 2017|date=5 March 1946}}</ref>}}

Much of the Western public still regarded the [[Soviet Union]] as a close ally in the context of the recent defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] and of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]. Although not well received at the time, the phrase ''iron curtain'' gained popularity as a shorthand reference to the division of Europe as the Cold War strengthened. The Iron Curtain served to keep people in and information out, and people throughout the West eventually came to accept and use the metaphor.

Churchill's "Sinews of Peace" address was to strongly criticise the Soviet Union's exclusive and secretive tension policies along with the Eastern Europe's state form, [[Police State]] (''Polizeistaat''). He expressed the Allied Nations' distrust of the Soviet Union after the World War II. In September that year, US-Soviet cooperation collapsed due to the US disavowal of the Soviet Union's opinion on the German problem in the [[Stuttgart Council]], and then followed the announcement by US President [[Harry S. Truman]] of a hard line anti-Soviet, anticommunist policy. After that the phrase became more widely used as an anti-Soviet term in the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1146410&cid=40942&categoryId=31656 |title=철의 장막 : 지식백과 |language=ko |publisher=Terms.naver.com |access-date=2015-09-16}}</ref>

In addition, Churchill mentioned in his speech that regions under the Soviet Union's control were expanding their leverage and power without any restriction. He asserted that in order to put a brake on this ongoing phenomenon, the commanding force of and strong unity between the UK and the US was necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=72578&cid=504&categoryId=504 |title=철의 장막 : 지식백과 |language=ko |publisher=Terms.naver.com |access-date=2015-09-16}}</ref>

Stalin took note of Churchill's speech and responded in ''[[Pravda]]'' soon afterward. He accused Churchill of warmongering, and defended Soviet "friendship" with eastern European states as a necessary safeguard against another invasion. He further accused Churchill of hoping to install right-wing governments in eastern Europe with the goal of agitating those states against the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stalin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1946/03/x01.htm |title=Interview to "Pravda" Correspondent Concerning Mr. Winston Churchill's Speech |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=2015-09-16}}</ref> [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Stalin's chief propagandist, used the term against the West in an August 1946 speech:<ref>{{cite web

{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}

While the Iron Curtain remained in place, much of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe (except [[West Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]]) found themselves under the hegemony of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Soviet Union annexed:

* [[Estonia]],<ref name="wettig20" /><ref name="senn" />
* [[Latvia]]<ref name="wettig20">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}</ref><ref name="senn">Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}</ref>
* [[Lithuania]]<ref name="wettig20" /><ref name="senn" />
as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].

Germany effectively gave Moscow a free hand in much of these territories in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, signed before Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941.

Other Soviet-annexed territories included:

The majority of European states to the east of the Iron Curtain developed their own international economic and military alliances, such as [[COMECON]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]].

====West of the Iron Curtain====

To the west of the Iron Curtain, the countries of Western Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe – along with [[Austria]], [[West Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]] – operated [[market economy|market economies]]. With the exception of a period of [[Francoist Spain|fascism in Spain]] (until [[Spanish transition to democracy|1975]]) and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] (until [[Carnation Revolution|1974]]) and a [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military dictatorship in Greece (1967–1974)]], [[Democracy|democratic governments]] ruled these countries.

Most of the states of Europe to the west of the Iron Curtain – with the exception of [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Malta]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] – allied themselves with [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] within [[NATO]]. Economically, the [[European Community]] (EC) and the [[European Free Trade Association]] represented Western counterparts to [[COMECON]]. Most of the nominally neutral states were economically closer to the United States than they were to the [[Warsaw Pact]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In January 1947 [[Harry Truman]] appointed General [[George Marshall]] as Secretary of State, scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive 1067 (which embodied the [[Morgenthau Plan]]), and supplanted it with JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."<ref name="beschloss277">{{Harvnb|Beschloss|2003|p=277}}</ref> Officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.<ref name="miller16">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}</ref>

Relations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] also published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939 – 1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]<ref name="henig67"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}</ref> revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,<ref name="roberts97">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}</ref> the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],<ref name="roberts97"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}</ref> and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}</ref> In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'', a Stalin-edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.<ref name="henig67">{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}</ref>

After the Marshall Plan, the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased [[Reichsmark]] and massive electoral losses for communist parties, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to [[Berlin]], initiating the [[Berlin Blockade]], which cut off all non-Soviet food, water and other supplies for the citizens of the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.<ref name="miller25">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=25–31}}</ref> Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.<ref name="miller6">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=6–7}}</ref> A massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, the success of which caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.

Migration from east to west of the Iron Curtain, except under limited circumstances, was effectively halted after 1950.

{{Further|Inner German border|Czechoslovakian border fortifications during the Cold War}}
[[File:Moedlareuth Museum 2002b.jpg|thumb|Preserved section of the border between [[East Germany]] and West Germany called the "Little Berlin Wall" at [[Mödlareuth]]]]

The Iron Curtain took physical shape in the form of border defences between the countries of western and eastern Europe. There were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called "[[inner German border]]" – commonly known as ''die Grenze'' in German – between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the [[Berlin Wall]] was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.<ref>Keeling, Drew (2014), business-of-migration.com [http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-processes/other-regions/berlin-wall-and-migration/ "Berlin Wall and Migration," ''Migration as a travel business'']</ref>

The barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier – between the actual borderline and the barrier – was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk, because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.

[[File:Point Alpha Ostseite.jpg|thumb|Fence along the former east–west border in Germany]]
Several villages, many historic, were destroyed as they lay too close to the border, for example [[Erlebach]]. Shooting incidents were not uncommon, and several hundred civilians and 28 East German border guards were killed between 1948 and 1981 (some may have been victims of "[[friendly fire]]" by their own side).

Elsewhere along the border between West and East, the defence works resembled those on the intra-German border. During the Cold War, the border zone in Hungary started {{convert|15|km}} from the border. Citizens could only enter the area if they lived in the zone or had a passport valid for traveling out. Traffic control points and patrols enforced this regulation.

Those who lived within the {{convert|15|km}} border-zone needed special permission to enter the area within {{convert|5|km}} of the border. The area was very difficult to approach and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed {{convert|50|m}} from the border. The space between the two fences was laden with [[land mine]]s. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about {{convert|1|km}} from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.

Regular patrols sought to prevent escape attempts. They included cars and mounted units. Guards and dog patrol units watched the border 24/7 and were authorised to use their weapons to stop escapees. The wire fence nearest the actual border was irregularly displaced from the actual border, which was marked only by stones. Anyone attempting to escape would have to cross up to {{convert|400|m}} before they could cross the actual border. Several escape attempts failed when the escapees were stopped after crossing the outer fence.

In parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the border strip became hundreds of meters wide, and an area of increasing restrictions was defined as the border was approached. Only people with the appropriate government permissions were allowed to get close to the border.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold river : the cold truth of freedom|last=Imrich, Jozef.|date=2005|publisher=Double Dragon|isbn=9781554043118|location=East Markham, Ontario|oclc=225346736}}</ref>

The Soviet Union built a fence along the entire border between [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it.

In [[Greece]], a highly militarised area called the "Επιτηρούμενη Ζώνη" ("Surveillance Area") was created by the Greek Army along the Greek-Bulgarian border, subject to significant security-related regulations and restrictions. Inhabitants within this {{convert|25|km}} wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than {{convert|60|m2}}, and had to travel within the area with a special passport issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the [[Pomaks]], a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living on the other side of the Iron Curtain.<ref>[https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb7-2_labrianidis.pdf Lois Labrianidis, The impact of the Greek military surveillance zone on the Greek side of the Bulgarian-Greek borderlands], 1999</ref>

The Hungarian outer fence became the first part of the Iron Curtain to be dismantled. After the border fortifications were dismantled, a section was rebuilt for a formal ceremony. On 27 June 1989, the [[foreign minister]]s of Austria and Hungary, [[Alois Mock]] and [[Gyula Horn]], ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries.

The creation of these highly militarised no-man's lands led to ''de facto'' nature reserves and created a [[wildlife corridor]] across Europe; this helped the spread of several species to new territories. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, several initiatives are pursuing the creation of a [[European Green Belt]] nature preserve area along the Iron Curtain's former route. In fact, a [[long-distance cycling route]] along the length of the former border called the [[Iron Curtain Trail]] (ICT) exists as a project of the European Union and other associated nations. The trail is {{Convert|6,800|km|abbr=on}} long and spans from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ironcurtaintrail.eu/en/der_iron_curtain_trail/index.html |title=The Iron Curtain Trail |publisher=Ironcurtaintrail.eu |access-date=2013-11-16}}</ref>

The term "Iron Curtain" was only used for the fortified borders in Europe; it was not used for similar borders in Asia between communist and capitalist states (these were, for a time, dubbed the [[Bamboo Curtain]]). The [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|border between North Korea and South Korea]] is very comparable to the former inner German border, particularly in its degree of militarisation, but it has never conventionally been considered part of any Iron Curtain.

====Helmstedt-Marienborn crossing====
{{Main|Helmstedt-Marienborn border crossing}}

The '''Border checkpoint Helmstedt–Marienborn''' ({{lang-de|'''Grenzübergang Helmstedt-Marienborn'''}}), named ''Grenzübergangsstelle Marienborn'' (GÜSt) (''border crossing Marienborn'') by the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), was the largest and most important border crossing on the [[Inner German border]] during the [[History of Germany since 1945|division of Germany]]. Due to its geographical location, allowing for the shortest land route between [[West Germany]] and [[West Berlin]], most transit traffic to and from West Berlin used the Helmstedt-Marienborn crossing. Most travel routes from West Germany to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] and [[Poland]] also used this crossing. The border crossing existed from 1945 to 1990 and was situated near the East German village of [[Marienborn]] at the edge of the [[Lappwald]]. The crossing interrupted the [[Bundesautobahn 2]] (A&nbsp;2) between the junctions ''[[Helmstedt]]-Ost'' and ''[[Ostingersleben]]''.

Following a period of [[Brezhnev stagnation|economic and political stagnation]] under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in [[Eastern Bloc politics]]. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (General Secretary from 1985) decreased adherence to the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]],<ref name="crampton338">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=338}}</ref> which held that if socialism were threatened in any state then other socialist governments had an obligation to intervene to preserve it, in favor of the "[[Sinatra Doctrine]]". He also initiated the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). A wave of [[Revolutions of 1989|Revolutions occurred throughout the Eastern Bloc]] in 1989.<ref name="Szafarz-221">E.

Speaking at the Berlin Wall on June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further, saying "General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" Later, in November 1989, East German authorities began allowing citizens to pass freely through border checkpoints,[303][304] and began dismantling the Wall the following June;[305][306] its demolition was completed in 1992.[305][306]

In February 1989 the Hungarian [[politburo]] recommended to the government led by [[Miklós Németh]] to dismantle the iron curtain. Nemeth first informed [[Austria]]n chancellor Franz Vranitzky. He then received an informal clearance from [[Gorbachev]] (who said "there will not be a new [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956#Soviet intervention of 4 November|1956]]") on 3 March 1989, on 2 May of the same year the Hungarian government announced and started in [[Rajka]] (in the locality known as the "city of three borders", on the border with Austria and Czechoslovakia) the destruction of the Iron Curtain. For public relation Hungary reconstructed 200m of the iron curtain so it could be cut during an official ceremony by Hungarian foreign minister Gyula Horn, and Austrian foreign minister Alois Mock, on 27 June 1989, which had the function of calling all European peoples still under the yoke of the national-communist regimes to freedom.<ref>[https://orf.at/stories/3127918/ Ungarn als Vorreiter beim Grenzabbau], orf.at, 2019-06-27.</ref> However, the dismantling of the old Hungarian border facilities did not open the borders, nor did the previous strict controls be removed, and the isolation by the Iron Curtain was still intact over its entire length. Despite dismantling the already technically obsolete fence, the Hungarians wanted to prevent the formation of a green border by increasing the security of the border or to technically solve the security of their western border in a different way. After the demolition of the border facilities, the stripes of the heavily armed Hungarian border guards were tightened and there was still a firing order.<ref>Andreas Rödder: ''Deutschland einig Vaterland – Die Geschichte der Wiedervereinigung'' (2009), p 72.</ref><ref>Miklós Németh in Interview with Peter Bognar, ''Grenzöffnung 1989: „Es gab keinen Protest aus Moskau“'' (German - Border opening in 1989: There was no protest from Moscow), in: Die Presse 18 August 2014.</ref>

The opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on August 19, 1989 then set in motion a chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony came from [[Otto von Habsburg]] and was brought up by him to [[Miklós Németh]], the then Hungarian Prime Minister, who promoted the idea.<ref>Miklós Németh in Interview, Austrian TV - ORF "Report", 25 June 2019.</ref> The Paneuropa Picnic itself developed from a meeting between Ferenc Mészáros of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) and the President of the [[Paneuropean Union]] Otto von Habsburg in June 1989. The local organization in Sopron took over the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the other contacts were made via Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State [[Imre Pozsgay]]. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the [[Paneuropean Union]], which was then headed by [[Karl von Habsburg]], distributed thousands of brochures inviting them to a picnic near the border at Sopron.<ref>Hilde Szabo: ''Die Berliner Mauer begann im Burgenland zu bröckeln'' (The Berlin Wall began to crumble in Burgenland - German), in Wiener Zeitung 16 August 1999; Otmar Lahodynsky: ''Paneuropäisches Picknick: Die Generalprobe für den Mauerfall'' (Pan-European picnic: the dress rehearsal for the fall of the Berlin Wall - German), in: ''Profil'' 9 August 2014.</ref><ref>Ludwig Greven "Und dann ging das Tor auf", in Die Zeit, 19 August 2014.</ref> The local Sopron organizers knew nothing of possible GDR refugees, but thought of a local party with Austrian and Hungarian participation.<ref>Otmar Lahodynsky "Eiserner Vorhang: Picknick an der Grenze" (Iron curtain: picnic at the border - German), in Profil 13 June 2019.</ref> More than 600 East Germans attending the "Pan-European Picnic" on the Hungarian border broke through the Iron Curtain and fled into Austria. The refugees went through the iron curtain in three big waves during the picnic under the direction of Walburga Habsburg. Hungarian border guards had threatened to shoot anyone crossing the border, but when the time came, they did not intervene and allowed the people to cross.

It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The patrons of the picnic, Otto Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State [[Imre Pozsgay]], who were not present at the event, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]`s reaction to an opening of the border on the Iron Curtain.<ref>Thomas Roser: ''DDR-Massenflucht: Ein Picknick hebt die Welt aus den Angeln'' (German - Mass exodus of the GDR: A picnic clears the world) in: Die Presse 16 August 2018.</ref> In particular, it was examined whether Moscow would give the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary the command to intervene.<ref>„Der 19. August 1989 war ein Test für Gorbatschows“ (German - August 19, 1989 was a test for Gorbachev), in: FAZ 19 August 2009.</ref> After the pan-European picnic, [[Erich Honecker]] dictated the '' Daily Mirror '' of August 19, 1989: “Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.” But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Thus the bracket of the Eastern Bloc was broken. Now tens of thousands of the media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use force of arms. The leadership of the GDR in East Berlin did not dare to completely lock the borders of their own country.<ref>Michael Frank: Paneuropäisches Picknick – Mit dem Picknickkorb in die Freiheit (German: Pan-European picnic - With the picnic basket to freedom), in: Süddeutsche Zeitung 17 May 2010.</ref><ref>Andreas Rödder, Deutschland einig Vaterland – Die Geschichte der Wiedervereinigung (2009).</ref>

In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the [[Parliament of Hungary|Hungarian parliament]] adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election.<ref name="crampton394">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=394–5}}</ref>

The legislation transformed Hungary from a [[People's Republic of Hungary|People's Republic]] into the [[Republic of Hungary|Republic]], guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. In November 1989, following mass protests in [[East Germany]] and the relaxing of border restrictions in Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of [[East Berlin]]ers flooded checkpoints along the [[Berlin Wall]], crossing into [[West Berlin]].<ref name="crampton394"/>

In the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]], on 22 December 1989, the Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Communist ruler [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], who was executed after a brief trial three days later.<ref name="crampton400">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=400}}</ref> In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.

The Berlin Wall officially remained guarded after 9 November 1989, although the inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. On 1 July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the [[Deutsche Mark|West German currency]], all border-controls ceased and West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.

==Monuments==
[[File:Iron Curtain - Hungary.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial in [[Budapest]] reads: "Iron Curtain 1949–1989"]]
There is an Iron Curtain monument in the southern part of the Czech Republic at approximately {{Coord|48.8755|15.87477|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Iron Curtain monument}}. A few hundred meters of the original fence, and one of the guard towers, has remained installed. There are interpretive signs in Czech and English that explain the history and significance of the Iron Curtain. This is the only surviving part of the fence in the Czech Republic, though several guard towers and bunkers can still be seen. Some of these are part of the Communist Era defences, some are from the never-used [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] in defence against [[Adolf Hitler]], and some towers were, or have become, hunting platforms.

Another monument is located in [[Fertőrákos]], Hungary, at the site of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by [[Gabriela von Habsburg]]. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants. On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text: ''In necessariis unitas – in dubiis libertas – in omnibus caritas'' ("Unity in unavoidable matters – freedom in doubtful matters – love in all things"). The memorial symbolises the Iron Curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.

Another monument is located in the village of [[Devín]], now part of [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], at the confluence of the [[Danube]] and [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava]] rivers.

There are several open-air museums in parts of the former inner German border, as for example in Berlin and in [[Mödlareuth]], a village that has been divided for several hundred years. The memory of the division is being kept alive in many places along the ''Grenze''.
