== History ==
[[File:NTUAdministrationBldg.jpg|260px|right|thumb|NTU Central Administration Building]]
=== Imperial University ===
National Taiwan University has its origins in 臺北帝國大學 Taihoku Imperial University (Taihoku Teikoku Daigaku), founded in 1928 during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] as a member of the [[National Seven Universities|imperial university system]] administered by the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref name=":0" />

The school's first president was {{Interlanguage link multi|Taira Shidehara|ja|3=幣原坦}}. Taihoku Imperial University began with the aculty of Liberal Arts and Law and the Faculty of Science and Agriculture serving 60 students. The University was intended mainly for Japanese nationals; few Taiwanese students were admitted. The Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Engineering were added in 1935 and 1943, respectively.<ref name=":0" />

=== National University ===
After [[World War II]], the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] government reorganized the school as an institution for Chinese-speaking students. The school was renamed ''National Taiwan University'' on 15 November 1945 and [[Lo Tsung-lo]] was appointed as its president. The Literature and Politics division was divided into the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law. Additionally, colleges of Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture were established. Initially, there were six colleges with 22 departments. In 1945, student enrollment was 585.<ref name=":0" />

In 1960, the night school was initiated on a trial basis, and in 1967 a new night school was established. In 1987, the College of Management was established, followed by the College of Public Health in 1993 and the College of Electrical Engineering in 1997. The College of Electrical Engineering was later reorganized as the College of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. In 1999, the College of Law has renamed the College of Social Sciences, and the Night Division and the Center for Continuing Education were combined to form the School for Professional and Continuing Studies. In 2002, the College of Agriculture has renamed the College of Bio-resources and Agriculture, and in 2002 a College of Life Sciences was added.

;Kuan Chung-ming Controversy
:[[Kuan Chung-ming]], an economist who previously served in the [[Ma Ying-jeou|Ma]] Administration, was named university president-elect in January 2018 but soon became embroiled in allegations related to plagiarism, academic misconduct, and violations of civil code which stipulated that Taiwanese public servants were not permitted to deliver lectures or to be involved in any mainland China-related academic activities due to national security concerns. During the election and the subsequent investigation, Tei-Wei Kuo served as the interim president of the university<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntu.edu.tw/about/director.html|title=歷任校長姓名與任期 - 臺大校史 - 認識臺大 - 國立臺灣大學|website=www.ntu.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> while the president-elect underwent multiple legal investigations from the ruling [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tw.news.yahoo.com/管中閔案-台大遴委會：校長遴選不受行政程序法約-092122138.html|title=管中閔案 台大遴委會：校長遴選不受行政程序法約束|access-date=2018-04-26|language=zh-Hant-TW}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/paper/1167906|title=未利益迴避? 管爺：上任前辭營利職 - 生活 - 自由時報電子報|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?SerialNo=39851|title=要教育部退出政治干預　管中閔推「挺管連署」不到一天破萬人|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> Though Kuan was eventually cleared of all accusations and officially named as the university president in January 2019<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewslens.com/article/111573}}</ref> (see {{Interlanguage link multi|2018 NTU Presidential Election Controversy|zh|3=2018年國立臺灣大學校長遴選事件}}), this prolonged investigation raised suspicion regarding the intervention from the ruling DPP government.
