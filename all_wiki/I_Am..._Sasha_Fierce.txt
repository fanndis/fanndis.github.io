'''''I Am... Sasha Fierce''''' is the third [[studio album]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. It was released on November 12, 2008, by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]]. In its original release, the album was formatted as a [[double album]], intending to market Beyoncé's [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] artistic persona. The first disc, '''''I Am...''''', contains slow and midtempo [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[ballad]]s, while the second, '''''Sasha Fierce''''' (named after Beyoncé's on-stage [[alter ego]]), focuses on more uptempo beats that blend [[Synthpop|electropop]] and [[Europop]] elements. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyoncé worked with writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration.

Beyoncé credited both her husband—rapper [[Jay-Z|Shawn Carter]]—and jazz singer [[Etta James]] for inspiring her to push the limits of her songwriting and artistry. Musically, ''I Am...'' drew inspiration from [[Folk music|folk]] and [[alternative rock]], while blending acoustic guitar elements into contemporary ballads, and its tracks were written and produced by Beyoncé, during collaborative efforts with [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], [[Tricky Stewart]], [[The-Dream]] and [[Ryan Tedder]]. ''Sasha Fierce'' boasted production from [[Rodney Jerkins|Darkchild]] and [[Sean Garrett]].

''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' received mixed reviews from music critics, but was a commercial success nonetheless, debuting at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart with first-week sales of 482,000 units, earning Beyoncé her third consecutive US number-one solo album. The album has earned one diamond and over thirty platinum certifications in separate worldwide markets, being certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on January 16, 2009, selling over three million copies in the United States. As of 2015, ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' has sold over 8 million copies worldwide.<ref name="bustle">{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/131836-lets-put-adeles-7-million-albums-sold-before-2016-into-perspective-shall-we|title=Let's Put Adele's 7 Million Albums Sold Before 2016 Into Perspective, Shall We?|first=Shannon|last=Carlin|work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> The album garnered seven [[Grammy Award]] nominations at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]] ceremony (2010), including a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], winning five and eventually collecting a record setting six wins—the most awards won in one night by a female artist.

The album was marketed with the release of several singles, including "[[If I Were a Boy]]" and "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]", both of which charted highly internationally. The former topped the charts in over eight countries and reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with the latter becoming her fifth number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. "[[Diva (Beyoncé song)|Diva]]" and "[[Ego (Beyoncé song)|Ego]]" were released exclusively in the United States, while "[[Halo (Beyoncé song)|Halo]]" and "[[Sweet Dreams (Beyoncé song)|Sweet Dreams]]" were promoted internationally as the third and fourth singles, respectively. "[[Broken-Hearted Girl]]" was released internationally as the fifth single, while "[[Video Phone (song)|Video Phone]]" was released in September 2009 as the overall eighth, and "[[Why Don't You Love Me (Beyoncé song)|Why Don't You Love Me]]" was released in July 2010 as the ninth and final single. To further promote the album, Beyoncé made several award show and televised appearances across Europe and America, and embarking on the worldwide [[I Am... World Tour]] (2009–10).

==Music and lyrics==
In an interview for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, Beyoncé described ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' as a [[double album]]. She said, "One side has songs that are more [[mainstream]] and another has my more traditional [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] songs for my fans who've been there the whole time. Some of it sounds like [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Karen Carpenter]] and [[The Beatles]] around the 1970s."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://login.vnuemedia.com/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003895366 |title=Beyoncé: Worker B |last=Crosley |first=Hillary |date=November 18, 2008 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref> Music writer Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] viewed its first disc as "essentially a small set of [[adult contemporary]] ballads.

According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, they resemble ''Sasha Fierce'' musically, but thematically and lyrically, they are vulnerable like Beyoncé on the ''I Am...'' disc.<ref name="twyb"/> The album formally introduces Beyoncé's [[alter ego]] Sasha Fierce. She revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her hit single "[[Crazy in Love (Beyoncé song)|Crazy in Love]]" (2003). In an interview with Emmet Sullivan of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, Beyoncé affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage, with the editor describing Sasha Fierce as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20241113,00.html |title=Beyoncé 'Still Can't Believe' Justin Was Her Backup Dancer |last=Sullivan |first=Emmet |date=November 18, 2008 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=Time Inc |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref>

"[[If I Were a Boy]]", the first single of ''I Am...'', stands as the only song on either disc that Beyoncé did not co-write. [[BC Jean]], who wrote most of the song's lyrics, took inspiration from a poor relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/neighbors/article_da62ec71-408d-5aa3-86e9-7b8cebfd62bf.html |title=NEIGHBORS: Singer-songwriter ready for the spotlight |last=Frank |first=Jeff |date=March 9, 2009 |work=[[North County Times|NC Times]] |publisher=Peter York |accessdate=February 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317104133/http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/neighbors/article_da62ec71-408d-5aa3-86e9-7b8cebfd62bf.html |archivedate=March 17, 2011  }}</ref> Beyoncé explained in ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' that "If I Were a Boy" is different from her previous songs in the sense that it is not a traditional [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song.
