==Reception==
The show received mixed to negative reviews, with the critics panning host Ricky Gervais's jokes as well as lack of energy in ceremony. Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Hank Stuever]] heavily criticised the ceremony saying, "We ask for the worst, so we get the worst", and went on to said "Gervais acted like he was the one being made to suffer, but truly this misery is shared all around."<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Globes review: We ask for the worst, so we get the worst|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/01/11/golden-globes-review-we-ask-for-the-worst-so-we-get-the-worst/|author=[[Hank Stuever]]|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}</ref> Daniel D'Addario of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s also felt that show was a "bore" and said, "By the Globes' own standard, this year's show felt unbearably bogged down."<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Ricky Gervais Presides Over a Dire Golden Globes Ceremony|url=http://time.com/4174674/golden-globes-recap-ricky-gervais/|author=Daniel D'Addario |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}</ref> However, ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[James Poniewozik]] reviewed the ceremony moderately saying: "A well-run, fun Globes — privileged people toasting their terrific success with bottomless Moët — is its own corrective to Hollywood self-seriousness.
