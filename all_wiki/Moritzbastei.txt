'''The Moritzbastei''' is the only remaining part of the ancient town fortifications of [[Leipzig]]. Today it is widely known as a cultural centre.

== History of the building ==
The Moritzbastei was built as a [[bastion]] in between 1551–1554 under the supervision of the mayor [[Hieronymus Lotter]], who was also responsible for Leipzig's Altes Rathaus (old town hall) which is one of the most important [[Renaissance]] buildings in [[Germany]]. Elector Moritz of [[Saxony]] directed the reconstruction of the town fortifications of Leipzig after it became largely destroyed during the [[Smalkaldic War]] between German Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and the [[Smalkaldic League]]. 

After being stormed for the first time in the [[Thirty Years War]], the Moritzbastei lost its military function in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Henceforth it served as a store for trade goods and workplace for a bell founder and a book printer. 

In the period 1796–1834, the first public school (1. Bürgerschule) was built over the basement of the Moritzbastei by architect [[Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe]]. It was the first school in Germany without confessional segregated classes and was destroyed in 1943 during [[World War II]].

From 1974 the Moritzbastei was rebuilt under the supervision of the [[University of Leipzig]]. More than 30,000 students were engaged in the reconstruction of the bastion, among them the current [[Chancellor of Germany]], [[Angela Merkel]].  From 1982 onward the Moritzbastei was the official [[student club]] of the University of Leipzig.

== Moritzbastei as student club ==
In 1973 or 1974 students discovered the remains of the Moritzbastei and persuaded the university and city of [[Leipzig]] to allow it to be rebuilt. Subsequently it was run by the [[Free German Youth]] as a venue for encounter and cultural events.

From 1992 the Moritzbastei was no longer part of the [[University of Leipzig]] and became a commercial foundation.

== Moritzbastei since 1993 ==
Since 1993 the Moritzbastei has been run under the licence of the Moritzbastei foundation as a well known cultural centre. Its main purpose being to foster and sustain the student and academic culture in Leipzig. The foundation is headed by the vice chancellor of the [[University of Leipzig]].
The Board of Trustees, which oversees the work of the foundation without institutional subvention, consists of one representative of the city of [[Leipzig]], the Free State of [[Saxony]] and the student body.

In recent years artists from all over the world have been guests of the Moritzbastei.
