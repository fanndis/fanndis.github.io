'''"Halo"''' is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). Included on the ''I Am...'' disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyoncé's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. [[Columbia Records]] released the song, the album's fourth single, to [[mainstream radio]] in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by [[Ray LaMontagne]]'s 2004 song "Shelter", "Halo" was written and composed by Beyoncé, [[Ryan Tedder]] and [[E. Kidd Bogart|Evan Bogart]]. It was originally conceived by Tedder and Bogart specifically for Beyoncé, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for [[Leona Lewis]].

"Halo" is a [[Pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[power ballad]], the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features [[drum]], [[piano]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[String instrument|string]], [[synthesizer]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] instrumentation. The song faced a controversy when [[Kelly Clarkson]] claimed that Tedder had reused the musical arrangement in her own 2009 song "[[Already Gone (Kelly Clarkson song)|Already Gone]]". "Halo" received positive reviews from music critics, who made comparisons with Lewis's 2007 song "[[Bleeding Love]]". Its production and Beyoncé's emotional vocals also received critical praise. "Halo" was nominated for [[Record of the Year]] and won [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. It won [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song|Best Song]] at the [[2009 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. "Halo" topped the singles charts of Brazil, Norway, and Slovakia, and reached the top five on the singles chart of Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has received over ten certifications including a seven-times platinum certification from Australia and a double-platinum from Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US.

[[Philip Andelman]] directed "Halo"'s accompanying [[music video]], which features American actor [[Michael Ealy]]. It portrays a romantic relationship between Beyoncé's and Ealy's characters. Critics complimented Beyoncé's looks in the clip. An alternative music video, which shows Ealy's character being chased by police through a forest at night, was posted on the Internet in May 2010. The lyrics to "Halo" were changed for three of Beyoncé's special live performances: a tribute to [[Michael Jackson]] following his death, a tribute to the victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], and for [[Death of Kobe Bryant|Kobe and Gianna Bryant's memorial]] in 2020. The song has been [[Cover version|covered]] by many artists, including [[Florence and the Machine]], [[Harper Blynn]], and [[Westlife]]. It was performed on the television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and was added to the international soundtrack of the Brazilian [[soap opera]] ''[[Caminho das Índias]]''.

==Writing and production==
[[File:Ryan Tedder OneRepublic Austria 3.jpg|Beyoncé, Bogart, and Tedder ''(pictured)'' composed "Halo" in Tedder's music studio in California.|thumb|alt=The portrait of a blonde man. He wears a gray coat and a hat.|upright]]
"Halo" was composed by [[Ryan Tedder]], lead vocalist of [[OneRepublic]], together with [[Evan "Kidd" Bogart]] and [[Beyoncé]].<ref name="booklet1"/> In an interview for [[HitQuarters]], Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his [[Achilles tendon]] and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer [[Ray LaMontagne]] was the primary inspiration for "Halo". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's "[[Trouble (Ray LaMontagne album)|Shelter]]" for Beyoncé and her husband [[Jay-Z]], and proposed the title "Halo" after hearing Tedder play "angelic" [[chord (music)|chords]]. They wrote the song in three hours.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Evan_Bogart_Interview.html |title=Interview With Evan 'Kidd' Bogart |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=February 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |first=Kimbel |last=Bouwman |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/624wuY74C?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Evan_Bogart_Interview.html |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="bill10053">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/467645/beyonces-30-biggest-billboard-hits|title=Beyoncé's 30 Biggest Billboard Hits|page=2|first1=Erika|last1=Ramirez|first2=Jason|last2=Lipshutz|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

According to [[Simon Cowell]], owner of the music production company [[Syco Entertainment]], Bogart and Tedder intended "Halo" for his client, singer [[Leona Lewis]], who could not record the song because of her tight schedule.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> David Balls, editor of the British media website [[Digital Spy]], asked Tedder during an interview whether "Halo" had initially been written for Lewis.<ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"/> Tedder answered that he had only tentatively offered the track to Lewis, after Beyoncé waited a long time before recording it.<ref name="digitalspy.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a189416/tedder-halo-wasnt-written-for-leona.html |title=Music – News – Tedder: 'Halo wasn't written for Leona' |publisher=[[Digital Spy]]. [[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]] |date= December 1, 2009|last=Balls |first=David |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> He commented:

<blockquote>There was this huge scandal that originally "Halo" was meant to go to Leona. That was never the case&nbsp;... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song&nbsp;... I thought this would be a brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have&nbsp;... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just want to know if you like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!"<ref name="digitalspy.co.uk"/></blockquote>

Tedder and Beyoncé produced "Halo" in 2008 at Los Angeles' Manfield Studios, and at [[New York City]]'s Germano and Roc The Mic Studios.<ref name="booklet1"/><ref name=ASCAP>{{cite web |url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=382580636&search_in=i&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=20&start=1 |title=Song list: Halo |publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] |accessdate=December 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/624x6pIa1?url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=382580636&search_in=i&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=20&start=1 |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Tedder did the musical [[arrangement]]s and played the [[musical instrument|instrument]]s, while Christian Baker assisted in [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] the music.
