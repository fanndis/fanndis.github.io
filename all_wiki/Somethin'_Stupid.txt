In the early 1960s, Carson Parks was a folk singer in [[Los Angeles]]. He was an occasional member of [[The Easy Riders (American band)|The Easy Riders]], and also performed with The Steeltown Three, which included his younger brother [[Van Dyke Parks]]. In 1963, he formed the Greenwood County Singers, later known as The Greenwoods, who had two minor hits and included singer Gaile Foote.  Before the Greenwoods disbanded, Parks and Foote married and, as Carson and Gaile, recorded an album in 1966 for [[Kapp Records]], ''San Antonio Rose'', which included the song "Something Stupid".  The recording was then brought to the attention of Frank Sinatra.<ref name=parks>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccarsonparks.com/discography.htm |title=C. Carson Parks |publisher=C.
