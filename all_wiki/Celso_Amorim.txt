==Early life and academic career==
Amorim was born in [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]], [[Sao Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], on June 3, 1942. 

He graduated from the [[Rio Branco Institute]], a graduate school of [[international relations]] run by the Ministry of External Relations, in 1965, and obtained his post-graduate degree in International Relations from the [[Diplomatic Academy of Vienna]] in 1967.

Amorim was a professor of [[Portuguese language]] at the Rio Branco Institute, as well as professor of [[political science]] and international relations at the [[University of Brasília]]. He is a permanent member of the Foreign Affairs Department of the [[University of São Paulo]] Institute of Advanced Studies.

==Political career==
Amorim has a long history of government service, beginning in 1987 when he was appointed Secretary for International Affairs for the Ministry of Science and Technology. He served in that position until 1989, when he was selected to be the Director-General for Cultural Affairs in the Ministry of External Relations. Amorim was shifted again in 1990, moving to a new post as Director-General for Economic Affairs. In 1993, he was promoted to the position of Secretary General of the Brazilian foreign-affairs agency.

While serving in the Ministry of External Relations, Amorim spent large amounts of time working as an [[ambassador]] to the [[United Nations]]. Most notably, he represented Brazil on the [[Kosovo]]–[[Yugoslavia]] [[International sanctions|sanctions]] [[committee]] in 1998, and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] panel on [[Iraq]] in 1999. Amorim was named as Brazil's permanent ambassador to the United Nations and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] later that year, and served for two years before becoming ambassador to the United Kingdom in 2001.

===WTO controversy===
On July 19, 2008, Amorim stirred up controversy by comparing the descriptions used by wealthier countries to characterize the agricultural concessions they were offering during the [[Doha Development Round|Doha Round]] of WTO talks to the work of [[Nazi]] propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]].  This brought a swift condemnation from the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/07/19/1679722-brazil-officials-nazi-reference-rocks-wto-talks|title=Brazil official's Nazi reference rocks WTO talks|last=Klapper|first=Bradley S.|date=2008-07-19|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Newsvine]]|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>
