The '''Good Life Cafe''' was a health food market and cafe in [[Los Angeles, California]], known for its [[open mic]] nights that helped the 1990s Los Angeles [[alternative hip hop]] movement flourish. In 2008, director [[Ava DuVernay]], who had performed at the cafe with the [[Figures of Speech]] hip hop group, released a documentary about the cafe, ''[[This Is the Life (2008 film)|This Is The Life]]''. The film featured a number of hip hop artists discussing the importance of the Good Life Cafe to themselves and the hip hop scene. The Cafe was open from 1989 to 1999. 

It was described as "a platform for rappers to perform their material" and "a testing ground for Los Angeles' independent rap scene".<ref name="ugsmag">{{cite web|url=http://ugsmag.com/interviews/ava-duvernay|title=Ava DuVernay: This is the Life|publisher=UGSMAG|first=Jon|last=B|date=May 13, 2008}}</ref> Artists like [[Ice Cube]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Lenny Kravitz]] and others reportedly attended the open-mic, while many other musicians learned their skills at the events.<ref name="laweekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/music/down-for-the-good-life/11397/|title=Down for the Good Life|publisher=LA Weekly|first=Brendan|last=Mullen|date=June 21, 2000}}</ref>

==History==

The Good Life Health Food Centre's weekly open-mic night began December 1989 on the intersection of Crenshaw Blvd & Exposition Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|title=This Is The Life (doc)|url=http://goodlifelove.ning.com/|website=This Is The Life}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Good Life Documentary |url=http://hiphopattack.com |website=Hip Hop Attack Documentary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219203843/http://www.hiphopattack.com/ |archivedate=2014-12-19 }}</ref> Started by B. Hall and her son R/KainBlaze with his friends [[The Mighty O-Roc]] and The Dynamic Flow, KNGR: The Underground Radio at the Good Life offered a workshop-like atmosphere for aspiring MCs, poets and musicians to hone their craft.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Xela|first1=Alex|url=http://beetbak.blogspot.ca/2015/03/evolution-of-man-interview-with.html|website=Bring That Beat Back|title=Evolution of a Man: An Interview with Imperator (Part 1)|accessdate=2015-10-30|date=2015-03-06}}</ref>

On Thursday nights from 8-10pm, artists were allowed to perform one song. Some would perform written songs, and some would [[Freestyle music|freestyle]]. When a performance was not up to par, the audience would call out "Please pass the mic!" and the emcee would end the performance promptly. In addition, there was a strict policy that no [[profanity|cursing]] was allowed. B. Hall once explained, "Young people needed a place to go to develop their own art. The no-cussing policy wasn’t about us being uptight church people, it was about wanting the atmosphere of a serious arts workshop. Most of the crowd respected the rule, some said it made rapping more challenging, that it created more respect and brotherhood."<ref>Morgan, Marcyliena.

After the venue closed at night, people would take their rhymes into the parking lot and battle after closing. In December 1995, several notable performers established Project Blowed which became its own successful venue.

[[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]],  [[Ice Cube]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[will.i.am]] and [[Macy Gray]]  reportedly attended the open-mic, while artists such as [[The Pharcyde]], [[Biz Markie]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Skee-Lo]], and [[Kurupt]] occasionally performed there. 

Good Life regulars [[Rebels of Rhythm]] and Unity Committee came together to form [[Jurassic 5]]. 

Other Good Life regulars included [[Freestyle Fellowship]], [[The Righteous Family]], [[Pigeon John]], [[Abstract Rude]], Chillin Villain Empire, Rifleman Ellay Khule, [[Volume 10 (rapper)|Volume 10]], Medusa, OMD, [[Spoon Iodine]], [[Ganjah K]], Fat Jack, [[The Nonce]] and many others. 

Core years that one would consider the GoodLife Open Mics apex were hosted by a cast of highly influential lyricists/masters of ceremony including Chu Black, J-Smoov of Dark Leaf, TrenSeta, Big Al, Quiet Storm, Menace Clan's Jammin D and a host of others.
In closing, the last Good Life Open Mic show was in September 1997 and was hosted by local Good Life emcee called Ink Rezin. The Good Life Health Food Centre closed in 1999. Regulars of the open mic night later founded [[Project Blowed]], a hip-hop workshop.
