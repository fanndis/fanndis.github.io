The song was written by [[Mark Irwin (songwriter)|Mark Irwin]], [[Josh Kear]] and [[The Warren Brothers|Brad and Brett Warren]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Conaway|first=Alanna|title=Story Behind The Song: The Warren Brothers Discuss Tim McGraw and Taylor Swift's "Highway Don't Care"|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/story-behind-the-song-the-warren-brothers-discuss-tim-mcgraw-and-taylor-swift-s-highway-don-t-care|accessdate=March 13, 2013|newspaper=Roughstock|date=February 13, 2013}}</ref> McGraw and Swift recorded their parts separately.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stromblad|first=Cory|title=Tim McGraw Spills on Recording 'Highway Don't Care' 'With' Taylor Swift, Keith Urban|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-highway-dont-care-keith-urban/|accessdate=March 13, 2013|newspaper=Taste of Country|date=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

==Composition==
The song is a mid-tempo ballad where the male narrator is separated from his lover who is driving. Throughout the verses, he tells her what he "bets" she is feeling, when a song comes on her radio (its part sung by Swift) containing the lines "I can't live without you, baby." He also says that the highway she's driving on doesn't care if she's alone or if she's going home, but he does. The song is in [[D major]] with a main chord pattern of D-B{{sub|m}}7-G{{sub|sus2}}-A.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0116258&|title=Tim McGraw "Highway Don't Care" Sheet Music in D Major (transposable) - Download & Print|first=Irwin|last=Mark|website=Musicnotes.com}}</ref> [[Keith Urban]] plays [[lead guitar]] on it.

==Critical reception==
Thom Jurek of [[AllMusic]], in his review of the album, wrote that "the hook is irresistible and McGraw's vocal, paired with the young singer's, is a perfect match."<ref>{{cite web|last=Jurek|first=Thom|title=Two Lanes of Freedom – Tim McGraw|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0002474140|pure_url=yes}}|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref> Chuck Dauphin of ''Roughstock'' also reviewed the song favorably, saying that "this song flows well, with winning performances from two of the format's top vocalists."<ref>{{cite news|last=Dauphin|first=Chuck|title=The Weekly Single Recap: February 22, 2013: Tate Stevens, Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift, Jason Aldean & More|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/the-weekly-single-recap-february-22-2013-tate-stevens-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-jason-aldean-more|accessdate=March 13, 2013|newspaper=Roughstock|date=February 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301044322/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/the-weekly-single-recap-february-22-2013-tate-stevens-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-jason-aldean-more|archivedate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> Billy Dukes of ''Taste of Country'' gave the song five stars saying that the track is arguably "one of the best collaborations of the decade – maybe even ever. Each artist brings his or her best effort to the song from McGraw's ''[[Two Lanes of Freedom]]'' album. 'Highway Don't Care' feels like a special moment from the very first listen, and only becomes more cathartic with time."<ref>{{cite web|last=Dukes|first=Billy|title=Tim McGraw (Feat.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by [[Shane Drake]] and premiered on May 6, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/tim-mcgraw/906464/highway-dont-care.jhtml|title=CMT : Videos : Tim McGraw : Highway Don't Care|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref> The music video for the song features Tim McGraw, Taylor Swift, and Keith Urban, as well as actors portraying the song's narrator and his lover. It was made in partnership with [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] in Nashville, Tennessee and highlights the dangers of driving while distracted, particularly texting and driving. In the video, the narrator's lover mentioned in the song is driving, crying, and texting the narrator. After dropping her phone and trying to retrieve it, she drifts into the wrong lane while reaching across her car and collides with oncoming traffic. She is then airlifted by a Vanderbilt LifeFlight helicopter to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where she is treated in the Adult Emergency Department. The video implies that she survives as the doctor comes out to see the girl's parents and the narrator, after which they are seen smiling happily and embracing that their daughters going to be ok.

The structure of the video at first seems to imply that Tim McGraw (as the singer/narrator and a character in the video) is the boyfriend who keeps being texted by the female driver. Upon the LifeFlight helicopter arriving at the hospital, the viewer realizes that Tim McGraw's character is actually the physician who saves the driver's life, and the texts he had been receiving earlier in the video were from the hospital paging/notifying him about this emergency. Taylor Swift was standing in the bedroom-curtain. Keith Urban was standing on the beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2013/05/09/vanderbilt-county-superstar-tim-mcgraw-share-important-message-regarding-dangers-of-distracted-driving/|title=Vanderbilt, country superstar Tim McGraw share important message regarding dangers of distracted driving|first=Jennifer|last=Wetzel|website=Vanderbilt University}}</ref>
