'''Oligarchy''' ({{etymology|el|''[[wikt:ὀλιγαρχία|ὀλιγαρχία]]'' (oligarkhía)}}; {{etymology||''[[wikt:ὀλίγος|ὀλίγος]]'' (olígos)|few||''[[wikt:ἄρχω|ἄρχω]]'' (arkho)|to rule or to command}})<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29li%2Fgos "ὀλίγος"], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw "ἄρχω"], Liddell/Scott.</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29ligarxi%2Fa "ὀλιγαρχία"]. Liddell/Scott.</ref> is a form of [[power structure]] in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] rests with a small number of people. These people may be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[education]], [[corporate]], [[religious]], [[political]], or [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition of oligarchy.

Throughout history, oligarchies have often been [[tyrant|tyrannical]], relying on public obedience or [[oppression]] to exist. [[Aristotle]] pioneered the use of the term as meaning rule by the rich,<ref>Winters (2011) p. 26-28. "Aristotle writes that 'oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their hands... wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy'."</ref> for which another term commonly used today is [[plutocracy]]. In the early 20th century [[Robert Michels]] developed the theory that democracies, as all large organizations, have a tendency to turn into oligarchies. In his "[[Iron law of oligarchy]]" he suggests that the necessary division of labor in large organizations leads to the establishment of a ruling class mostly concerned with protecting their own power.

This was already recognized by the [[Athenian]]s in the fourth century [[BCE]]: after the restoration of [[democracy]] from oligarchical coups, they used the [[Sortition|drawing of lots]] for selecting government officers to counteract that tendency toward oligarchy in government.<ref>Hansen, Mogens Herman (1991). ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes''. Oxford: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0631180173}}. {{OCLC|22809482}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2014}} They drew lots from large groups of adult volunteers to pick civil servants performing judicial, executive, and administrative functions (''archai'', ''boulē'', and ''hēliastai'').<ref name="Manin">Bernard Manin. ''Principles of Representative Government''. pp. 11–24 (1997).</ref> They even used lots for posts, such as judges and jurors in the political courts (''nomothetai''), which had the power to overrule the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Assembly]].<ref>Manin (1997), pp. 19–23.</ref>

== Minority rule==
{{Main|Minoritarianism}}
The exclusive consolidation of power by a [[dominant minority|dominant religious or ethnic minority]] has also been described as a form of oligarchy.<ref name=Minority1>{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=James|last2=Rosberg|first2=Carl|title=Political Parties and National Integration in Tropical Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000cole|url-access=registration|date=1966|pages=[https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000cole/page/681 681–683]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0520002531}}</ref> Examples of this system include South Africa under ''[[apartheid]]'', [[Liberia]] under [[Americo-Liberians]], the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], and [[Rhodesia]], where the installation of oligarchic rule by the descendants of foreign settlers was primarily regarded as a legacy of various forms of [[colonialism]].<ref name=Minority1/>

The modern United States has also been described as an oligarchy because economic elites and organized groups representing special interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.<ref>Gilens, M., & Page, B. (2014). Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens. Perspectives on Politics, 12(3), 564-581. {{doi|10.1017/S1537592714001595}}</ref>

== Putative oligarchies==
A business group might be defined as an oligarch if it satisfies the following conditions:

<blockquote>(1) owners are the largest private owners in the country 
(2) it possesses sufficient political power to promote its own interests
(3) owners control multiple businesses, which intensively coordinate their activities.<ref name=Chern2018>{{cite journal|last1= Chernenko|first1= Demid |title= Capital structure and oligarch ownership |journal= Economic Change and Restructuring |date=2018|pages=383–411|doi= 10.1007/S10644-018-9226-9|volume=52|issue= 4|s2cid= 56232563 |url= https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/83641/1/MPRA_paper_83641.pdf }}</ref></blockquote>

==Intellectual oligarchies==
[[The Nobel Prize in Literature]] winner [[George Bernard Shaw]] defined in his play [[Major Barbara]], premiered in 1905 and first published in 1907, a new type of Oligarchy namely the intellectual oligarchy that acts against the interests of the common people: “I now want to give the common man weapons against the intellectual man. I love the common people. I want to arm them against the lawyer, the doctor, the priest, the literary man, the professor, the artist, and the politician, who, once in authority, are the most dangerous, disastrous and tyrannical of all the fools, rascals, and impostors. I want a democratic power strong enough to force the intellectual oligarchy to use its genius for the general good or else perish.” <ref>Shaw, Bernard und Baziyan, Vitaly. 2-in-1: English-German. Major Barbara & Majorin Barbara. New York, 2020, {{ISBN|979-8692881076}}</ref>

=== Russian Federation ===
{{main|Russian oligarch}}
Since [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[privatization]] of the economy in December 1991, privately owned Russia-based multinational corporations, including producers of petroleum, natural gas, and metal have, in the view of many analysts, led to the rise of [[Russian oligarch]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA51#v=onepage&q&f=false 51] & [https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q&f=false 222–223] }}</ref> Most of these are connected directly to the highest-ranked government officials, such as [[Presidents of the Russian Federation|President]].

=== Ukraine ===
{{main|Ukrainian oligarchs}}
The Ukrainian oligarchs are a group of [[business oligarch]]s that quickly appeared on the economic and political scene of [[Ukraine]] after its independence in 1991. Overall there are 35 oligarchic groups <ref name=Chern2018 />

=== Zimbabwe ===
The Zimbabwean oligarchs are a group of [https://mg.co.za/article/2017-12-14-war-veterans-remain-a-potent-political-force-in-zimbabwe-and-sa liberation war veterans] who form the [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front]], a colonial liberation party. The philosophy of the Zimbabwean government is that Zimbabwe can only be governed by a leader who took part in the [[Rhodesian Bush War|pre-independence war]]. The motto of ZANU-PF in [[Shona language|Shona]] is "''Zimbabwe yakauya neropa''", meaning Zimbabwe was born from the blood of the sons and daughters who died fighting for its independence. The born free generation (born since independence in 1980) has no birthright to rule Zimbabwe.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

A study conducted by political scientists Martin Gilens of [[Princeton University]] and [[Benjamin Page]] of [[Northwestern University]] was released in April 2014,<ref name=Gilens>{{cite journal |title=Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens |author1=Martin Gilens |author2=Benjamin I. Page |name-list-style=amp |journal=[[Perspectives on Politics]] |date=2014 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=564–581 |doi=10.1017/S1537592714001595 |url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf}}</ref> which stated that their "analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts." The study analyzed nearly 1,800 policies enacted by the US government between 1981 and 2002 and compared them to the expressed preferences of the American public as opposed to wealthy Americans and large special interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/major-study-finds-that-the-us-is-an-oligarchy-2014-4|title=Major Study Finds The US Is An Oligarchy|website=businessinsider.com}}</ref> It found that wealthy individuals and organizations representing business interests have substantial political influence, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little to none. The study did concede that "Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance, such as [[Elections in the United States|regular elections]], [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of association|association]], and a widespread ([[Voter suppression in the United States|if still contested]]) [[Suffrage|franchise]]." Gilens and Page do not characterize the US as an "oligarchy" per se; however, they do apply the concept of "civil oligarchy" as used by [[Jeffrey A. Winters|Jeffrey Winters]] with respect to the US. Winters has posited a comparative theory of "oligarchy" in which the wealthiest citizens – even in a "civil oligarchy" like the United States – dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth- and income-protection.<ref>Gilens & Page (2014) p. 6</ref>

Gilens says that average citizens only get what they want if wealthy Americans and business-oriented interest groups also want it; and that when a policy favored by the majority of the American public is implemented, it is usually because the economic elites did not oppose it.<ref>Prokop, A.
