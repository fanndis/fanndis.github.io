[[File:14-02-04-Parlement-européen-Strasbourg-RalfR-121.jpg|thumb|left|Michel Barnier in the [[European Parliament]] in 2014]]
Barnier served on the staff of various Gaullist ministers in the 1970s, before being elected in 1978, aged 27, to the [[French National Assembly]] as deputy for the Department of [[Savoie]] representing the neo-Gaullists, [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR), serving until 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/trombinoscope/Vrepublique/Legis06/barnier-michel-09011951.asp |title=VIe législature Michel Barnier |website=assemblee-nationale.fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/trombinoscope/Vrepublique/Legis10/barnier-michel-09011951.asp |title=Xe législature Michel Barnier |website=assemblee-nationale.fr}}</ref>

Together with [[Jean-Claude Killy]] he organised the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] in [[Albertville]] as co-president of the COJO (''Comité d'Organisation des Jeux Olympiques'').

Barnier first joined the French Cabinet as Minister of the Environment following the Right's landslide victory in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. In 1995, [[Jacques Chirac]] appointed him secretary of state for European affairs, serving as such until the defeat of the presidential majority in the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 legislative election]]. Barnier then served as a [[European Commission]]er for Regional Policy in the [[Prodi Commission]] from 1999 until 31 March 2004. Then he served as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Foreign Minister]] of France in [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s government until 5 June 2005 when [[Dominique de Villepin]] replaced him with [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]]. He considered he was unjustly sanctioned for the victory of the "No" in the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|French referendum over the European Constitution]].

In March 2006, Barnier was elected vice president of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) for a three-year term. Under [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s presidency, upon the reshuffle of the French cabinet, caused by the resignation of [[Alain Juppé]] after the [[2007 French legislative election]], he re-joined the French Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture.

In 2016, the French investigating judge Sabine Kheris requested that the case of Michel Barnier, [[Dominique de Villepin]] and [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]] be referred to the Court of Justice of the Republic. These former ministers were suspected of having allowed the exfiltration of the mercenaries responsible for the attack on the Bouaké camp in 2004, killing nine French soldiers. The operation was allegedly intended to justify a response operation against the [[Laurent Gbagbo]] government in the context of the 2004 crisis in [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2016/04/BENVENUTO/55185 |title=Soupçons sur la Cour pénale internationale |first=Francesca Maria |last=Benvenuto |date=1 April 2016 |website=Le Monde diplomatique |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>

Barnier led the UMP list in [[Île-de-France (region)|Ile-de-France]] for the [[2009 European Parliament election in France|2009 European Parliament election]]. In February 2010 he was confirmed as [[European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services]].<ref>{{cite web |work=Euobserver |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29063 |title=Michel Barnier to take over internal market portfolio |date=2009-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/6693989/Michel-Barnier-looks-to-calm-City-nerves-about-reform.html |title=Michel Barnier looks to calm City nerves about reform |work=The Telegraph |date=30 November 2009 |author=Philip Aldrick |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-67167-012-01-03-901-20100112IPR67166-12-01-2010-2010-false/default_en.htm |title=Summary of Hearing of Michel Barnier |date=2010-01-13 |work=European Parliament |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924195614/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-67167-012-01-03-901-20100112IPR67166-12-01-2010-2010-false/default_en.htm |archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> In charge of European banking system reform, he argued for a "coherent single market with intelligent rules that apply everywhere".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/business/global/eu-offers-berlin-compromise-on-bank-union.html?ref=global |work=The New York Times |first=Stephen |last=Castle |title=European Union Offers Berlin Compromise on Bank Proposal |date=12 July 2013}}</ref>
