This is a list of '''Portuguese monarchs''' who ruled from the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], in 1139, to the deposition of the Portuguese monarchy and creation of the [[Portugal|Portuguese Republic]] with the [[5 October 1910 revolution]].

Through the nearly 800 years in which Portugal was a monarchy, the kings held various other titles and pretensions. Two kings of Portugal, Ferdinand I and Afonso V, also claimed the [[crown of Castile]]. When the house of Habsburg came into power, the [[kings of Spain]], [[kings of Naples|Naples]], and [[kings of Sicily|Sicily]] also became kings of Portugal. The house of Braganza brought numerous titles to the Portuguese Crown, including [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves|King of Brazil]] and then ''de jure'' [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]].

After the demise of the Portuguese monarchy, in 1910, Portugal almost restored its monarchy in a revolution known as the [[Monarchy of the North]], though the attempted restoration only lasted a month before destruction. With Manuel II's death, the [[Miguelist]] branch of the house of Braganza became the pretenders to the throne of Portugal. They have all been acclaimed king of Portugal by their monarchist groups.

The monarchs of Portugal all came from a single ancestor, [[Afonso I of Portugal]], but direct lines have sometimes ended. This has led to a variety of royal houses coming to rule Portugal, though all having Portuguese royal lineage. These houses are:

* The '''[[Portuguese House of Burgundy|House of Burgundy]]''' (1139–1383)
* The '''[[House of Aviz]]''' (1385–1581)
* The '''[[Philippine Dynasty|House of Habsburg]]''' (1581–1640)
* The '''[[House of Braganza]]''' (1640–1910)

==House of Burgundy (1139–1383)==
{{The monarchs of the Iberian Peninsula}}
The '''[[Portuguese House of Burgundy]]''', known as the '''Afonsine Dynasty''', was the founding house of the Kingdom of Portugal. Prior to the independence of Portugal, the house ruled the feudal [[County of Portugal]], of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. When Alphonso I Henriques declared the independence of Portugal, he turned the family from a comital house to a royal house which would rule Portugal for over two centuries.
When Ferdinand I died, a [[1383–1385 Crisis|succession crisis]] occurred between 1383 and 1385. Ferdinand's daughter [[Beatrice of Portugal]] was proclaimed queen and her husband [[John I of Castile]] proclaimed king by [[Jure uxoris|the right of his wife]]. Her legitimacy as a monarch is disputed.<ref>David Williamson, «Debrett's Kings and Queens of Europe»,1988,Webb & Bower, Exeter, {{ISBN|0-86350-194-X}}; César Olivera Serrano, [http://www.google.pt/search?hl=pt-PT&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Apt-PT%3Aofficial&channel=s&q=%22Segunda+Maqueta+Beatriz+Portugal.pmd%22&btnG=Pesquisar&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai= «Beatriz de Portugal»]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=3OWoTMqfHY2EswbgsP29DA&ct=result&id=A51pAAAAMAAJ&dq=&q=beatriz+regente+1383#search_anchor García de Cortázar, Fernando (1999), ''Breve historia de España'', Alianza Editorial, page 712]; Armindo de Sousa, in História de Portugal coordinated by José Mattoso, Editorial Estampa, vol.

==House of Aviz (1385–1580)==
The '''[[House of Aviz]]''', known as the '''Joanine Dynasty''', succeeded the [[Portuguese House of Burgundy|House of Burgundy]] as the reigning house of the Kingdom of Portugal. The house was founded by John I of Portugal, who was the Grand Master of the [[Order of Aviz]]. When King John II of Portugal died without an heir, the throne of Portugal passed to his cousin, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel, Duke of Beja]]. When King [[Sebastian of Portugal]] died, the throne passed to his uncle, [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry of Portugal]] (he might be called Henry II because [[Henry, Count of Portugal]], father of [[Alphonso I of Portugal]], was the first of that name to rule Portugal).  When Henry died, a [[War of the Portuguese Succession|succession crisis]] occurred and [[António, Prior of Crato]], was proclaimed [[António of Portugal]].

==House of Habsburg (1581–1640)==
The '''[[Philippine Dynasty|House of Habsburg]]''', known as the '''Philippine Dynasty''', is the house that ruled Portugal from 1581 to 1640. The dynasty began with the acclamation of Philip II of Spain as Philip I of Portugal in 1580, officially recognized in 1581 by the [[Portuguese Cortes]] of [[Tomar]]. Philip I swore to rule Portugal as a kingdom separate from his Spanish domains, under the personal union known as the [[Iberian Union]].

==House of Braganza (1640–1910)==
The '''[[House of Braganza]]''', also known as the '''Brigantine Dynasty''', came to power in 1640, when [[John IV of Portugal|John II, Duke of Braganza]], claimed to be the rightful heir of the defunct House of Aviz, as he was the great great grandson of King Manuel I. John was proclaimed King John IV, and he deposed the House of Habsburg in the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].

The descendants of Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] and her consort, King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]] (a German prince of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]), came to rule in 1853. Portuguese law and custom treated them as members of the House of Braganza, though they were still Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasts. This has led some to classify these last four monarchs of Portugal as members of a new royal family, called the '''[[House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]''', though this view is not widely held.

In fact, while king Carlos died instantly under the bullets of the anarchists on 1 February 1908, his son Luís Filipe, the crown prince, survived for a few hours, enough to allow governmental officials to name him king. This act is, however, usually considered as historically irrelevant, given that the crown prince never recovered from his coma. His younger brother Manuel (who was also injured, though not seriously) is therefore considered to have been the direct successor of the murdered king Carlos I.</ref>
