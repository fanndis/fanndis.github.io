'''Electoral fraud''', sometimes referred to as '''election fraud''', '''election manipulation''', '''voter fraud''' or '''vote rigging,''' involves illegal interference with the process of an [[election]], either by increasing the vote share of a favored candidate, depressing the vote share of rival candidates, or both.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Myth of Voter Fraud {{!}} Brennan Center for Justice|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.brennancenter.org|language=en}}</ref> It differs from but often goes hand-in-hand with [[voter suppression]].

In national elections, successful electoral fraud on a sufficient scale can have the effect of a [[coup d'état]],{{cn|date=November 2020}} [[protest]]<ref>Dawn Brancati. 2016. ''Democracy Protests: Origins, Features, and Significance''. New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN?}}</ref> or [[corruption]] of democracy. In a [[List of narrow elections|narrow election]], a small amount of fraud may suffice to change the result. Even if the outcome is not affected, the revelation of fraud can reduce voters' confidence in democracy. In April 2020, a 20-year voter fraud study by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] found the level of fraud in the United States "exceedingly rare" since it occurs only in "0.00006 percent" of instances nationally, and, in one state, "0.000004 percent — about five times less likely than getting hit by lightning."<ref name="MIT-cite">{{cite news |title=Election 2020 – Voting by mail in the U.S. is safe, honest, and fair – Let's put the vote-by-mail 'fraud' myth to rest. |url=https://shass.mit.edu/news/news-2020-pandemic-voting-mail-safe-honest-and-fair-stewart |date=April 28, 2020 |work=[[MIT University]] |access-date=July 28, 2020 }}</ref>

==Electorate manipulation==
{{Elections}}

Electoral fraud can occur in advance of voting if the composition of the electorate is altered. The legality of this type of manipulation varies across jurisdictions. Deliberate manipulation of election outcomes is widely considered a violation of the principles of democracy.<ref>[http://www.nvri.org/about/new_york_state_policies.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111172709/http://www.nvri.org/about/new_york_state_policies.shtml|date=November 11, 2007}}</ref>

===Artificial migration or party membership===
In many cases, it is possible for authorities to artificially control the composition of an electorate in order to produce a foregone result. One way of doing this is to move a large number of voters into the electorate prior to an election, for example by temporarily assigning them land or lodging them in [[flophouse]]s.<ref>{{cite book

</ref> Many countries prevent this with rules stipulating that a voter must have lived in an electoral district for a minimum period (for example, six months) in order to be eligible to vote there. However, such laws can also be used for demographic manipulation as they tend to [[disenfranchise]] those with no fixed address, such as the homeless, travelers, [[Romani people|Roma]], students (studying full-time away from home), and some casual workers.

Another strategy is to permanently move people into an electoral district, usually through [[public housing]]. If people eligible for public housing are likely to vote for a particular party, then they can either be concentrated into one area, thus making their votes count for less, or moved into [[marginal seat]]s, where they may tip the balance towards their preferred party. One example of this was the 1986-1990 [[Homes for votes scandal]] in the [[City of Westminster]] in England under [[Shirley Porter]].<ref>''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldjudgmt/jd011213/magill-2.htm Magill v. Porter Magill v. Weeks]'', H=House of Lords Judgments, 13 December 2001. Accessed 2012-02-16.</ref>

Immigration law may also be used to manipulate electoral demography. For instance, [[Malaysia]] gave citizenship to immigrants from the neighboring [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], together with suffrage, in order for a political party to "dominate" the state of [[Sabah]]; this controversial process was known as [[Project IC]].<ref name=Sadiq>{{cite journal |last=Sadiq |first=Kamal |year=2005 |title=When States Prefer Non-Citizens Over Citizens: Conflict Over Illegal Immigration into Malaysia |journal=International Studies Quarterly |volume=49 |pages=101–22 |url=http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/ISQ2005FinalCopy.pdf |access-date=2008-04-23 |doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2005.00336.x |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080614044317/http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/ISQ2005FinalCopy.pdf |archive-date=2008-06-14 }}</ref>

A method of manipulating [[primary election|primary contests]] and other elections of party leaders are related to this. People who support one party may temporarily join another party (or vote in a crossover way, when permitted) in order to elect a weak candidate for that party's leadership. The goal ultimately is to defeat the weak candidate in the general election by the leader of the party that the voter truly supports. There were claims that this method was being utilised in the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|UK Labour Party leadership election in 2015]], where Conservative-leaning [[Toby Young]] encouraged [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to join [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and vote for [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in order to "consign Labour to electoral oblivion".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11680016/Why-Tories-should-join-Labour-and-back-Jeremy-Corbyn.html|title=Why Tories should join Labour and back Jeremy Corbyn|first=Toby|last=Young|date=17 June 2015|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/06/labours-response-to-toriesforcorbyn-shows-they-really-have-lost-the-plot/|title=Labour's response to #ToriesForCorbyn shows they really have lost the plot – Coffee House|date=24 June 2015}}</ref> Shortly after, #ToriesForCorbyn [[Trending topics|trended]] on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/06/labours-response-to-toriesforcorbyn-shows-they-really-have-lost-the-plot/|title=Labour's response to #ToriesForCorbyn shows they really have lost the plot – Coffee House|date=24 June 2015}}</ref>

===Disenfranchisement===
The composition of an electorate may also be altered by [[disenfranchising]] some classes of people, rendering them unable to vote. In some cases, states have passed provisions that raised general barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy and comprehension tests, and record-keeping requirements, which in practice were applied against minority populations to discriminatory effect. From the turn of the century into the late 1960s, most African Americans in the southern states of the former Confederacy were disenfranchised by such measures. Corrupt election officials may misuse voting regulations such as a literacy test or requirement for proof of identity or address in such a way as to make it difficult or impossible for their targets to cast a vote. If such practices discriminate against a religious or ethnic group, they may so distort the political process that the political order becomes grossly unrepresentative, as in the post-[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] or [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era until the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. [[Felony disenfranchisement|Felons have been disenfranchised]] in many states as a strategy to prevent African Americans from voting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/magazine/ex-felons-voting-rights-florida.html|title=Will Florida's Ex-Felons Finally Regain the Right to Vote?|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|date=2018-09-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Groups may also be disenfranchised by rules which make it impractical or impossible for them to cast a vote. For example, requiring people to vote within their electorate may disenfranchise serving military personnel, prison inmates, students, hospital patients or anyone else who cannot return to their homes.{{examples|date=May 2017}} Polling can be set for inconvenient days, such as midweek or on holy days of religious groups: for example on [[Shabbat|the Sabbath]] or other [[Liturgical year|holy days]] of a religious group whose teachings determine that voting is prohibited on such a day. Communities may also be effectively disenfranchised if polling places are situated in areas perceived by voters as unsafe, or are not provided within reasonable proximity (rural communities are especially vulnerable to this){{examples|date=April 2017}}.

In some cases, voters may be invalidly disenfranchised, which is true electoral fraud. For example, a legitimate voter may be "accidentally" removed from the [[electoral roll]], making it difficult or impossible for the person to vote.

In the Canadian federal election of 1917, during the [[World War I|Great War]], the Union government passed the [[Military Voters Act]] and the [[Wartime Elections Act]]. The Military Voters Act permitted any active military personnel to vote by party only and allowed that party to decide in which electoral district to place that vote. It also enfranchised those women who were directly related or married to an active soldier. These groups were believed to be disproportionately in favor of the Union government, as that party was campaigning in favor of conscription.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The Wartime Elections Act, conversely, disenfranchised particular ethnic groups assumed to be disproportionately in favour of the opposition Liberal Party.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!-- how? -->

===Division of opposition support===
Stanford University professor Beatriz Magaloni described a model governing the behaviour of autocratic regimes. She proposed that ruling parties can maintain political control under a democratic system without actively manipulating votes or coercing the electorate. Under the right conditions, the democratic system is maneuvered into an equilibrium  in which divided opposition parties act as unwitting accomplices to single-party rule. This permits the ruling regime to abstain from illegal electoral fraud.<ref>{{cite web |last= Magaloni |first=Beatriz |title= Autocratic Elections, Voters, and the Game of Fraud |url= http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/ruleoflaw/papers/Magaloni.pdf |website=Yale University |access-date= 10 December 2015}}</ref>

Preferential voting systems such as [[score voting]], [[instant-runoff voting]], and [[single transferable vote]] are designed to prevent systemic electoral manipulation and [[Two-party system|political duopoly]].<ref>{{cite book  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_24bJHyBV6sC&q=Gaming%20the%20Vote%3A%20Why%20elections%20Aren't%20Fair&pg=PA170| title=Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (And What We Can Do About It) | publisher=Macmillan | author=Poundstone, William | year=2009 | page=170 | isbn=978-0809048922}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576321171406816538 | title=Latest Issue on the Ballot: How to Hold a Vote | work=Wall Street Journal | date=May 14, 2011 | access-date=June 29, 2012 | author=Bialik, Carl}}</ref>

=== Intimidation ===
[[#5|Voter intimidation]] involves putting undue pressure on a voter or group of voters so that they will vote a particular way, or not at all. [[Absentee voting|Absentee]] and other [[Postal voting|remote voting]] can be more open to some forms of intimidation as the voter does not have the protection and privacy of the polling location. Intimidation can take a range of forms including verbal, physical, or coercion. This was so common that in 1887, a Kansas Supreme Court in ''New Perspectives on Election Fraud in The Gilded Age'' said "[...] physical retaliation constituted only a slight disturbance and would not vitiate an election."
* '''Violence or the threat of violence''': In its simplest form, voters from a particular demographic or known to support a particular party or candidate are directly threatened by supporters of another party or candidate or by those hired by them. In other cases, supporters of a particular party make it known that if a particular village or neighborhood is found to have voted the 'wrong' way, reprisals will be made against that community. Another method is to make a general threat of violence, for example, a [[bomb threat]] which has the effect of closing a particular polling place, thus making it difficult for people in that area to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madison.com/tct/news/index.php?ntid=106590&ntpid=12 |title=Did bomb threat stifle vote? (Capital Times) |publisher=Madison.com |access-date=2012-05-03 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304173104/http://www.madison.com/tct/news/index.php?ntid=106590&ntpid=12 |archive-date=March 4, 2009 }}</ref> One notable example of outright violence was the [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack]], where followers of [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] deliberately contaminated salad bars in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], in an attempt to weaken political opposition during county elections.
* '''Attacks on polling places''': Polling places in an area known to support a particular party or candidate may be targeted for vandalism, destruction or threats, thus making it difficult or impossible for people in that area to vote.
* '''Legal threats''': In this case, voters will be made to believe, accurately or otherwise, that they are not legally entitled to vote, or that they are legally obliged to vote a particular way. Voters who are not confident about their entitlement to vote may also be intimidated by real or implied authority figures who suggest that those who vote when they are not entitled to will be imprisoned, deported or otherwise punished.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D91638F932A25752C1A965958260 |title= Florio's Defeat Revives Memories of G.O.P.

** For example, in 2004, in Wisconsin and elsewhere voters allegedly received flyers that said, "If you already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the Presidential Election", implying that those who had voted in earlier primary elections were ineligible to vote. Also, "If anybody in your family has ever been found guilty of anything you can't vote in the Presidential Election." Finally, "If you violate any of these laws, you can get 10 years in prison and your children will be taken away from you."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121190107/http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm |url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-01-21 |title=Intimidation and Deceptive Practices EP365 |access-date=2018-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ac4vr.com/reports/072005/republicanincidents.html |title=Incidents Of Voter Intimidation & Suppression |date=2006-11-08 |access-date=2012-05-03 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404073205/http://www.ac4vr.com/reports/072005/republicanincidents.html |archive-date=April 4, 2007 }}</ref>
** Another method, allegedly used in [[Cook County, Illinois]] in 2004, is to falsely tell particular people that they are not eligible to vote.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026234525/http://www.ep365.org/site/c.fnKGIMNtEoG/b.2052599/k.6FF4/Intimidation_and_Deceptive_Practices.htm|date=October 26, 2006}}</ref>
** In 1981 in New Jersey, the Republican National Committee created the [[Ballot Security Task Force]] to discourage voting among Latino and African-American citizens of New Jersey. The task force identified voters from an old registration list and challenged their credentials. It also paid off-duty police officers to patrol polling sites in Newark and Trenton, and posted signs saying that falsifying a ballot is a crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/11/nyregion/florio-s-defeat-revives-memories-of-gop-activities-in-1981.html|title=Florio's Defeat Revives Memories of G.O.P. Activities in 1981|date=November 13, 1993|last=Sullivan|first=Joseph F.|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>
* '''Coercion''': The demographic that controlled the voting ballot would try to persuade others to follow them. By singling out those who were against the majority, people would attempt to switch the voters' decision. Their argument could be that since the majority sides with a certain candidate, they should admit defeat and join the winning side. If this didn't work, this led to the threatening of violence seen countless times during elections. Coercion, electoral intimidation was seen in the Navy. In 1885 William C. Whitney started an investigation that involved the men in the Navy. As said by Whitney "the vote of the yard was practically coerced and controlled by the foremen. This instance shows how even in the Navy there were still instances of people going to great lengths for the desired elective to win.

===Disinformation===
People may distribute false or misleading information in order to affect the outcome of an election.<ref name="Myagkov"/> For example, in the [[1970 Chilean presidential election|Chilean presidential election of 1970]], the U.S. government's [[Central Intelligence Agency]] used "black propaganda"—materials purporting to be from various political parties—to sow discord between members of a coalition between socialists and communists.<ref>[http://foia.state.gov/Reports/ChurchReport.asp Church Report (Covert Action in Chile 1963–1973)], [[United States Senate]] [[Church Committee]], 1975</ref>

Another use of [[disinformation]] is to give voters incorrect information about the time or place of polling, thus causing them to miss their chance to vote. As part of the [[2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal]], [[Elections Canada]] traced fraudulent phone calls, telling voters that their polling stations had been moved, to a telecommunications company that worked with the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/22/racknine-inc-fraudulent-election-calls-traced/ |title=Fraudulent election calls traced to Racknine Inc., an Edmonton firm with Tory links {{pipe}} News {{pipe}} National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |access-date=2012-05-03|date=2012-02-23 }}</ref>

==Vote buying{{anchor|Vote buying}}<!--[[Electoral bribery]] redirects here-->==

Vote buying occurs when a political party or candidate seeks to buy the vote of a voter in an upcoming election. Vote buying can take various forms such as a monetary exchange, as well as an exchange for necessary goods or services.<ref name="rienner.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rienner.com/title/Elections_for_Sale_The_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Vote_Buying|title=Lynne Rienner Publishers – Elections for Sale The Causes and Consequences of Vote Buying|website=www.rienner.com}}</ref> This practice is often used to incentivise or persuade voters to turn out to elections and vote in a particular way. Although this practice is illegal in many countries such as the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Kenya, Brazil and Nigeria, its prevalence remains worldwide.

In some parts of the United States{{Which|date=June 2018}} in the mid- and late 19th century, members of competing parties would vie, sometimes openly and other times with much greater secrecy, to buy and sell votes. Voters would be compensated with cash or the covering of one's house/tax payment. To keep the practice of vote buying secret, parties would open fully staffed vote-buying shops.<ref name="Wahlgren">{{Cite book|last=Mark Wahlgren Summers |title=Party Games: Getting, Keeping, and Using Power in Gilded Age Politics |year=2004 |isbn=978-0807855379}}</ref> Parties would also hire runners, who would go out into the public and find floating voters and bargain with them to vote for their side.<ref name="Wahlgren" />

In England, documentation and stories of vote buying and vote selling are also well known. The most famous episodes of vote buying came in 18th century England when two or more rich aristocrats spent whatever money it took to win. The "Spendthrift election" came in [[Northamptonshire]] in 1768, when three earls each spent over £100,000 on their favoured candidates.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8QNwwkg784C&q=spendthrift+election%22+came+in+Northamptonshire+in+1768,&pg=PR14 |title=A History of Parliamentary Elections and Electioneering in the Old Days .. |author= Joseph Grego |access-date=2015-05-29|year=1886 }}</ref>

Voters may be given money or other rewards for voting in a particular way, or not voting. In some jurisdictions, the offer or giving of other rewards is referred to as "electoral treating".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/peaea1912382/s149.html |title=Parliamentary Electorates And Elections Act 1912 – Section 149, New South Wales Consolidated Acts |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |access-date=2012-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130180105/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/peaea1912382/s149.html |archive-date=2011-11-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
Electoral [[treating]] remains legal in some jurisdictions, such as in the [[Seneca Nation of New York|Seneca Nation of Indians]].<ref>Herbeck, Dan (November 15, 2011). [http://www.buffalonews.com/incoming/article633468.ece Resentments abound in Seneca power struggle]. ''The Buffalo News''. Retrieved November 16, 2011.</ref>

Vote buying can take the form of "turnout buying", where a broker brings many people to the polls, with a background sure to vote one way, and the results are seen in the precinct results.<ref name="Larreguy et al 2016">{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0003055415000593 |title=Parties, Brokers, and Voter Mobilization: How Turnout Buying Depends Upon the Party's Capacity to Monitor Brokers |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=110 |pages=160–179 |year=2016 |last1=Larreguy |first1=Horacio |last2=Marshall |first2=John |last3=Querubín |first3=Pablo }}</ref>

=== Whom to target ===
One of the main concerns with vote buying lies in the question of which population or group of voters are most likely to be susceptible to accepting compensation in exchange for their vote. Scholars such as Stokes argue that it is the weakly opposed voters are the best ones to target for vote buying.<ref name=Stokes2005/> This means that in a situation in which there are two parties running for office, for example, the voters who are not inclined to vote one way or the other are the best to target.
Other scholars argue that it is people of lower income status who are the best group to target, as they are the most likely to be receptive to monetary or other forms of compensation.<ref name=Stokes2005/> This has proven to be the case in both Argentina and Nigeria. Since the wealthy are presumably not in need of money, goods or services, it would require a much larger compensation in order to sway their vote. However, as seen in the case of Argentina for example, citizens who reside within poor communities are in great need of income, or medical services, for example, to feed their families and keep them in good health. With that being said, a much smaller sum of cash or a medical prescription would be of much greater value and thus their political support can be much easier to purchase.

=== How to monitor ===
When [[postal ballot]]s are mailed to voters, the buyer can fill them out or see how they are filled out. Monitoring is harder when ballots are cast secretly at a polling place.<ref name=Stokes2005/> In some cases, there have been instances of voter tickets, or monitoring by individuals.<ref name="Nichter2008"/> Voters seeking to be compensated for their votes would use specially-provided voter ballots, or would fold their ballot in a particular way in order to indicate that they voted for the candidate they were paid to vote for.

If a buyer is able to obtain a blank ballot (by theft, counterfeit, or a legitimate [[absentee voting|absentee ballot]]) the buyer can then mark the ballot for their chosen candidates and pay a voter to take the pre-marked ballot to a [[polling station]], exchange it for the blank ballot issued and return the blank ballot to the attacker. This is known as chain voting.<ref name="jones-chain">{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Douglas |date=2005-10-07 |title=Chain Voting |url=http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/nist2005chain.pdf |access-date=2020-06-25 |website=University of Iowa}}

It can be controlled in polling places by issuing each ballot with a unique number, which is checked and torn off as the ballot is placed in the ballot box.

Another strategy has been to invoke personalized social norms to make voters honor their contracts at the voting booth.<ref name="rienner.com"/> Such social norms could include personal obligation such as moral debts, social obligations to the buyers, or a threat of withholding or ceasing to produce necessary resources. This is made more effective when the rewards are delivered personally by the candidate or someone close to them, in order to create a sense of gratitude on behalf of the voters towards the candidate.<ref name="rienner.com"/>

=== Consequences ===
There are several negative consequences that arise from the practice of vote buying. The presence of vote buying in democratic states poses a threat to democracy itself, as it interferes with the ability to rely on a popular vote as a measure of people's support for potential governments' policies.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3982/ECTA9035 |title=Vote-Buying and Reciprocity |journal=Econometrica |volume=80 |issue=2 |page=863 |year=2012 |hdl=10419/55130 |url=http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=Document1342009124.088992E-02.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=1882&fref=repec }}</ref>

Another noted consequence is that the autonomy of voters is undermined. Since getting paid or receiving rewards for their votes generates a form of income that they may need to support themselves or their families, they have no autonomy to cast the vote that they truly want.<ref name=Stokes2005/> This is extremely problematic because if it is the most corrupt politicians who are engaging in vote buying, then it is their interests that remain the ones that dictate how the country is going to be run. This, in turn, perpetuates corruption in the system even further creating an unbreakable cycle.

Thirdly, vote buying can create a dependency of voters on the income or goods that they are receiving for their votes, and can further perpetuate a type of [[poverty trap]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1365100510000246 |title=Vote-Buying and Growth |journal=Macroeconomic Dynamics |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=656 |year=2011 |last1=Gersbach |first1=Hans |last2=Mühe |first2=Felix }}</ref> If they are receiving medicine from their communities' broker for example, if this tie is cut off then they may no longer have access to this necessity. It can be true that the broker in that community has no interest or incentive to actually increase the standards of living of the community members, as it is very possible that they are only interested in getting whatever share of the profit they are entitled to for working for the party.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Javier |last1=Auyero |date=April 1999 |title='From the Client's Point(s) of View': How Poor People Perceive and Evaluate Political Clientelism |journal=Theory and Society |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=297–334 |jstor=3108473 |doi=10.1023/A:1006905214896 |s2cid=141606279 }}</ref> Additionally, if the goods or money are coming directly from a candidate, this candidate's only wish is to maintain their power. That being said, they may provide services but their real interest may lie in keeping the voters dependent on the rewards they are providing in order to stay in power.

=== Latin America ===
The 2010 and 2012 surveys for the Americas Barometer showed that 15% of surveyed voters in Latin America had been offered something of value in exchange for voting a particular way.<ref name="Mares">{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-060514-120923| doi-access=free| title=Buying, Expropriating, and Stealing Votes| year=2016| last1=Mares| first1=Isabela| last2=Young| first2=Lauren| journal=Annual Review of Political Science| volume=19| pages=267–288}}</ref>

==== Argentina ====
Vote buying and the overall practice of clientelism is widespread in Argentina. According to Simeon Nichter, one of the main perpetrators of these illegal activities were the Peronist party.<ref name="Nichter2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0003055408080106 |jstor=27644495 |title=Vote Buying or Turnout Buying? Machine Politics and the Secret Ballot |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |year=2008 |last1=Nichter |first1=Simeon }}</ref> The relationship between voters and Peronist candidates allegedly are such that voters are offered particular goods, services, favours or monetary compensation in exchange for their political support for the party. These rewards could include a job, medicine, a roof, clothing, foods, and other goods or services. The case of Argentina in particular in that it relies heavily on face-to-face and day-to-day interactions between "brokers" who act as middlemen and voters.<ref name="Brusco et al 2004">{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/lar.2004.0022 |title=Vote Buying in Argentina |journal=Latin American Research Review |volume=39 |issue=2 |page=66 |year=2004 |last1=Brusco |first1=Valeria |last2=Nazareno |first2=Marcelo |last3=Stokes |first3=Susan Carol |s2cid=154003297 }}</ref> Since many of the communities in Argentina are ridden with poverty and are in need of these particular resources, it is these communities that have statistically shown to be in a certain demographic that were targeted for voted buying. Additionally, vote buying in this region focuses on citizens who are not strongly in favour or opposed to the political machine, and whose political loyalty does not necessarily lie with one party or another.<ref name=Stokes2005>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0003055405051683 |title=Perverse Accountability: A Formal Model of Machine Politics with Evidence from Argentina |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=99 |issue=3 |page=315 |year=2005 |last1=Stokes |first1=Susan C }}</ref> In this way, vote buying acts as a mechanism to sway the decisions of weakly opposed voters. In a study done by [[Susan Stokes|Susan C. Stokes]], she finds that the brokers in these communities are known to all the citizens and have access to the necessary resources from the municipality. They maintain relationships with the voters and grant them rewards and favours continuously in order to keep the party they work for in the office. This is one main explanation for why many lower-income voters are seen voting for populist leaders, as well as authoritarian ones.<ref name=Stokes2005/> Many citizens view these brokers as positive pillars in their lives and have the utmost respect for the help they distribute. However, others view them as hands of corruption. Stokes further explains that the capacity of these brokers is constrained due to the fact that they can only maintain this type of transactional relationship with a limited number of voters.<ref name=Stokes2005/> Furthermore, the brokers have the additional responsibility of maintaining trusting and solid relationships with their resource suppliers. Without these strong ties, they would have no means through which to carry out vote-buying practices.<ref name="Brusco et al 2004"/>

==== Mexico ====
Similarly to Argentina, it has been found that vote-buying in Mexico is most likely in rural and poor regions of the country.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10611-010-9260-7 |title=Vote-buying crime reports in Mexico: Magnitude and correlates |journal=Crime, Law and Social Change |volume=54 |issue=5 |page=325 |year=2010 |last1=Vilalta |first1=Carlos |s2cid=154628413 }}</ref> There are many instances of vote buying that have occurred in the history of Mexican elections, however, there are two main instances of fund in the literature that occurred in the last two decades. The first was the 2006 Mexican election, where it was found that 8.8% of the population that was not a beneficiary of a specific social program was offered compensation for their vote.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/viewArticle/942|title=Vote Buying with Illegal Resources: Manifestation of a Weak Rule of Law in Mexico|first=Gilles|last=Serra|date=10 May 2016|journal=Journal of Politics in Latin America|volume=8|issue=1|pages=129–150|via=journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de|doi=10.1177/1866802X1600800105|doi-access=free}}</ref> Similarly, a corruption inquiry arrested [[Andrés Granier Melo]] for embezzlement of funds in the state of [[Tabasco]] during his governorship: among other things, some of these funds were used for vote-buying (although Melo has denied all accusations).<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/942|title=Vote Buying with Illegal Resources: Manifestation of a Weak Rule of Law in Mexico|first=Gilles|last=Serra|date=10 May 2016|journal=Journal of Politics in Latin America|volume=8|issue=1|pages=129–150|doi=10.1177/1866802X1600800105|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Africa ===
The fifth [[Afrobarometer]] survey showed that 48% of voters in 33 African countries feared violence during elections, and 16% of voters were offered money or other goods in exchange for voting a particular way in the most recent election.<ref name="Mares"/>

==== Nigeria ====
On a self-reported survey that was conducted, 1 in 5 Nigerian has experienced an offer for their vote. The rewards offered by Nigerian politicians include money, commodities such as food and clothing, or a job.<ref name="Bratton2008">{{cite journal|last1=Bratton|first1=Michael|year=2008|title=Vote buying and violence in Nigerian election campaigns|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=27|issue=4|page=621|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2008.04.013}}</ref> Although the practice of vote buying is widespread, 58% of Nigerians surveyed at the time of the 2007 election viewed vote buying as immoral.<ref name=Bratton2008/> Despite this, when asked if they thought it was wrong to accept rewards or monetary compensation for your vote, 78% said no.<ref name=Bratton2008/> One factor that needs to be iterated when it comes to studies that are based on surveys is that since vote buying is illegal in most countries, a researcher's ability to collect accurate data is hindered. This is because many citizens may not feel comfortable revealing their experience or involvement with corrupt activities, or fear that they will suffer repercussions from their governments for coming forward with such information.<ref name=Bratton2008/>

==== Kenya ====
Since the 1990s, Kenya has had regular multiparty elections in which vote buying has played a central role. In his article, scholar Eric Kramon states that: "According to the data gathered by the Coalition for Accountable Political Finance in Kenya, cash handouts to voters represents around 40% of the average parliamentary candidates' campaign budget, making up the largest budget item."<ref name=Kramon2016>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2016.09.006 |title=Where is vote buying effective? Evidence from a list experiment in Kenya |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=44 |page=397 |year=2016 |last1=Kramon |first1=Eric |doi-access=free }}</ref> These handouts are made in various ways including stops on the campaign trail, and at-large campaign rallies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Election Shenanigans – Kenyan Hybrid Warfare |asin=B08DMZJ893}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Election Shenanigans – Kenyan Hybrid Warfare |asin=B08DGP72MH}}</ref> "In the 2002 election, 40% of surveyed adult Kenyans reported having accepted a bribe in exchange for their vote, and 22% for the 2007 elections."<ref name=Kramon2016/>

It is noted by Kramen that access to information is a huge factor in determining the success of vote buying in Kenya. If the voters have little access to political information or lack political knowledge then they are more likely to be swayed by clientelistic reasoning.<ref name=Kramon2016/> Moreover, if the voter does have access to information about an incumbent, then the price to sway their vote is more likely to go up. Additionally, Kramon notes that citizens of Kenya tend to value candidates who provide rewards because their ability to do so points to how great their abilities will be once they are in office.<ref name=Kramon2016/>

=== Asia ===
==== Indonesia ====
In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], vote buying is often known as ''{{ill|politik uang|id}}'' (lit. 'money politics'). According to a survey of 440 respondents by Institut Riset Indonesia in January–March 2020 in areas that will have [[2020 Indonesian local elections|local elections in 2020]], 60 percent of respondents said that they will allow their vote to be bought. Reasons for accepting vote buying include considering it as a gift that can not be rejected (35–46 percent), compensation for not working on the election day (25–30 percent), and supporting daily needs (9–16 percent).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Saubani |first1=Andri |title=Potensi Maraknya Praktik Politik Uang Pilkada Kala Pandemi |url=https://republika.co.id/berita/qculq7409/potensi-maraknya-praktik-politik-uang-pilkada-kala-pandemi |access-date=November 12, 2020 |work=Republika Online |date=July 3, 2020 |language=id}}</ref> One of the common tactics of vote buying is ''{{ill|serangan fajar|id|Serangan fajar (politik)}}'' (lit. 'dawn attack'), which is giving money a day or two before the election day. The amount ranges from Rp30,000 to Rp50,000.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wasono |first1=Hari Tri |title=Saat Serangan Fajar Justru Dinanti Warga |url=https://pemilu.tempo.co/read/568918/saat-serangan-fajar-justru-dinanti-warga/full&view=ok |access-date=November 12, 2020 |work=Tempo |date=April 8, 2014 |language=id}}</ref> According to Burhanuddin Muhtadi in his book ''Kuasa Uang; Politik Uang dalam Pemilu Pasca-Orde Baru'', vote buying in Indonesia is done by individual candidates instead of political parties because of intense intraparty competition, forcing candidates to rely on their own networks instead of relying on the party machine.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marzuqi |first1=Abdillah |title=Di Balik Serangan Fajar |url=https://mediaindonesia.com/read/detail/321885-di-balik-serangan-fajar |access-date=November 12, 2020 |work=Media Indonesia |date=June 20, 2020 |language=id}}</ref>

==== Philippines ====

==Voting process and results==

A list of threats to voting systems, or electoral fraud methods considered as sabotage are kept by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>[http://vote.nist.gov/threats/papers.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021021000/http://vote.nist.gov/threats/papers.htm|date=October 21, 2006}}</ref>

===Misleading or confusing ballot papers===
Ballot papers may be used to discourage votes for a particular party or candidate, using the design or other features which confuse voters into voting for a different candidate. For example, in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 U.S. presidential election]], Florida's [[butterfly ballot]] paper was criticized as poorly designed, leading some voters to vote for the wrong candidate. While ballot was designed by a Democrat, it was the Democrat, [[Al Gore]], who was most harmed by voter errors because of this design.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/13/recount.tm/index.html | work=CNN | first=Richard | last=Lacayo | title=Florida recount: In the eye of the storm |url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622085605/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/13/recount.tm/index.html | archive-date=2011-06-22 }}</ref> Poor or misleading design is usually not illegal and therefore not technically election fraud, but it can nevertheless subvert the principles of democracy.

[[Sweden]] has a system with separate ballots used for each party, to reduce confusion among candidates. However, ballots from small parties such as [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Piratpartiet]], [[Junilistan]] and [[Feministiskt initiativ]] have been omitted or placed on a separate table in the election to the EU parliament in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sr.se/sormland/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=2894807 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615232203/http://www.sr.se/sormland/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=2894807 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-06-15 |title = Sidolagda valsedlar inget lagbrott |website= sr.se}}</ref> Ballots from [[Sweden Democrats]] have been mixed with ballots from the larger [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], which used a very similar font for the party name written on the top of the ballot.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Another method of confusing people into voting for a different candidate than intended is to run candidates or create political parties with similar names or symbols as an existing candidate or party. The goal is to mislead voters into voting for the false candidate or party to influence the results.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathon|last=Hicks|title=Seeing Double on Ballot: Similar Names Sow Confusion|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E7D9173DF937A15754C0A9629C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Organizations/B/Board%20of%20Elections|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=July 24, 2004|access-date=18 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304222653/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E7D9173DF937A15754C0A9629C8B63&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FOrganizations%2FB%2FBoard%20of%20Elections|archive-date=2009-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Such tactics may be particularly effective when a large proportion of voters have limited literacy in the language used on the ballot. Again, such tactics are usually not illegal but often work against the principles of democracy.

Another type of possible electoral confusion is multiple variations of voting by different [[electoral system]]s. This may cause ballots to be counted as invalid if the wrong system is used. For instance, if a voter puts a [[first-past-the-post]] cross in a numbered [[single transferable vote]] ballot paper, it is invalidated. For example, in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom, up to four different voting systems and types of ballots may be used, based on the jurisdictional level of elections for candidates. [[Local government in Scotland|Local elections]] are determined by [[single transferable vote]]s; [[Scottish Parliament general election|Scottish parliamentary elections]] by the [[additional member system]]; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|national elections]] for the UK Parliament by [[first-past-the-post]]; and [[elections to the European Parliament]] by a [[Closed list|party list system]].

===Ballot stuffing===

[[Image:Ballotstuffing.jpg|thumb|A specialised ballot box used to assist ballot stuffing, featured in [[Frank Leslie's Weekly|''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'']] in 1856.]]
'''Ballot stuffing''', or "ballot-box stuffing", is the illegal practice of one person submitting multiple [[ballot]]s during a [[vote]] in which only one ballot per person is permitted.

Many elections feature multiple opportunities for unscrupulous officials or 'helpers' to record an elector's vote differently from their intentions. Voters who require assistance to cast their votes are particularly vulnerable to having their votes stolen in this way. For example, a blind or illiterate person may be told that they have voted for one party when in fact they have been led to vote for another.

===Misuse of proxy votes===
[[Absentee voting#Proxy voting|Proxy voting]] is particularly vulnerable to election fraud, due to the amount of trust placed in the person who casts the vote. In several countries, there have been allegations of retirement home residents being asked to fill out 'absentee voter' forms. When the forms are signed and gathered, they are secretly rewritten as applications for proxy votes, naming party activists or their friends and relatives as the proxies. These people, unknown to the voter, cast the vote for the party of their choice. In the [[United Kingdom]], this is known as 'granny farming.'<ref>{{cite news |title=Row over Alzheimer woman's proxy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/england/4510971.stm |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC MMVIII |access-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419083742/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/england/4510971.stm |archive-date=19 April 2016 |language=en|date=2005-05-04 }}</ref>

===Destruction or invalidation of ballots===
One of the simplest methods of electoral fraud is to destroy ballots for an opposing candidate or party. While mass destruction of ballots can be difficult to execute without drawing attention, in a very close election, it may be possible to destroy a very small number of ballot papers without detection, thereby changing the overall result. Blatant destruction of ballot papers can render an election invalid and force it to be re-run. If a party can improve its vote on the re-run election, it can benefit from such destruction as long as it is not linked to it.

Another method is to make it appear that the voter has spoiled his or her ballot, thus rendering it invalid. Typically this would be done by adding another mark to the paper, making it appear that the voter has voted for more candidates than entitled, for instance. It would be difficult to do this to a large number of paper ballots without detection in some locales, but altogether too simple in others, especially jurisdictions where legitimate ballot spoiling by voter would serve a clear and reasonable aim. Examples may include emulating protest votes in jurisdictions that have recently had and since abolished a "none of the above" or "against all" voting option, civil disobedience where voting is mandatory, and attempts at discrediting or invalidating an election. An unusually large share of invalidated ballots may be attributed to loyal supporters of candidates that lost in primaries or previous rounds, did not run or did not qualify to do so, or some manner of protest movement or organized boycott.

* Tampering with the [[software]] of a voting machine to add malicious code that alters vote totals or favors a candidate in any way.

* Abusing the administrative access to the machine by election officials might also allow individuals to vote multiple times.
* Election results that are sent directly over the internet from the polling place centre to the vote-counting authority can be vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]], where they are diverted to an intermediate website where the man in the middle flips the votes in favour of a certain candidate and then immediately forwards them on to the vote-counting authority. All votes sent over the internet violate the chain of custody and hence should be avoided by driving or flying memory cards in locked metal containers to the vote-counters. For purposes of getting quick preliminary total results on election night, encrypted votes can be sent over the internet, but final official results should be tabulated the next day only after the actual memory cards arrive in secure metal containers and are counted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electiondefensealliance.org/man_in_the_middle |title="Man in the Middle" Attacks to Subvert the Vote |publisher=Electiondefensealliance.org |access-date=2015-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721233505/http://electiondefensealliance.org/man_in_the_middle |archive-date=2015-07-21 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{main|Voter impersonation (United States)}}
Some commentators, such as former [[Federal Election Commission]] member [[Hans von Spakovsky]], have claimed that voter impersonation fraud, in which one person votes by impersonating another, eligible voter, is widespread, but documentation has been scarce and prosecutions rare. Numerous others, such as Professor [[Larry Sabato]], and a variety of studies have shown this to be "relatively rare" in the USA.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/29/the-voter-fraud-myth | title=The Voter-Fraud Myth | work=The New Yorker | date=29 October 2012 | access-date=9 December 2015 | author=Mayer, Jane}}</ref> Since 2013, when the US Supreme Court ruled that a provision of the Voting Rights Act was no longer enforceable, several states have passed [[voter ID laws]], ostensibly to counter the alleged fraud. But many experts counter that voter ID laws are not very effective against some forms of impersonation. These ID laws have been challenged by minority groups that claimed to be disadvantaged by the changes. By August 2016, four federal court rulings overturned laws or parts of such laws because they placed undue burdens on minority populations, including African Americans and Native Americans.<ref name="post">{{cite news |author=Rober Barnes |title=Federal judge blocks N.

The investigation found fewer than 500 incidences of invalid ballots cast, the vast majority of which were cast by individuals on probation for [[felony]] who were likely not aware that this status disqualified them from voting, and the total amount of invalid votes was far too small to have affected the outcome of any race in North Carolina in the 2016 election.<ref>https://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/editorials/article146486019.html</ref><ref>{{Cite press release|title=North Carolina State Board of Elections|date=April 21, 2017|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/Post-Election%20Audit%20Report_2016%20General%20Election/Post-Election_Audit_Report.pdf|access-date=June 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425061254/https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/Post-Election%20Audit%20Report_2016%20General%20Election/Post-Election_Audit_Report.pdf|archive-date=April 25, 2017}}</ref>

===Artificial results===
{{Main|Show election}}
In particularly corrupt regimes, the voting process may be nothing more than a sham, to the point that officials simply announce whatever results they want, sometimes without even bothering to count the votes. While such practices tend to draw international condemnation, voters typically have little if any recourse, as there would seldom be any ways to remove the fraudulent winner from power, short of a revolution.

In [[Turkmenistan]], incumbent President [[Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov]] received 97.69% of votes [[2017 Turkmen presidential election|in the 2017 election]], with his sole opponent, who was seen as pro-government, in fact being appointed by Berdymukhamedov.

==In legislature==
Vote fraud can also take place in legislatures. Some of the forms used in national elections can also be used in parliaments, particularly intimidation and vote-buying. Because of the much smaller number of voters, however, election fraud in legislatures is qualitatively different in many ways. Fewer people are needed to 'swing' the election, and therefore specific people can be targeted in ways impractical on a larger scale. For example, [[Adolf Hitler]] achieved his [[dictator]]ial powers due to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]]. He attempted to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to pass the Act by arresting members of the opposition, though this turned out to be unnecessary to attain the needed majority. Later, the Reichstag was packed with [[Nazi]] party members who voted for the Act's renewal.

In many legislatures, voting is public, in contrast to the [[secret ballot]] used in most modern public elections. This may make their elections more vulnerable to some forms of fraud since a politician can be pressured by others who will know how he or she has voted. However, it may also protect against bribery and blackmail, since the public and media will be aware if a politician votes in an unexpected way. Since voters and parties are entitled to pressure politicians to vote a particular way, the line between legitimate and fraudulent pressure is not always clear.

As in public elections, proxy votes are particularly prone to fraud. In some systems, parties may vote on behalf of any member who is not present in parliament. This protects those members from missing out on voting if prevented from attending parliament, but it also allows their party to prevent them from voting against its wishes.

The three main strategies for the prevention of electoral fraud in society are: 1) Auditing the election process, 2) Deterrence through consistent and effective prosecution; and 3) Cultivation of mores that discourage corruption. Some of the main fraud prevention tactics can be summarised as secrecy and openness. The [[secret ballot]] prevents many kinds of intimidation and vote selling, while transparency at all other levels of the electoral process prevents and allows detection of most interference.

===Election audits===
{{main|Election audits}}

Election auditing refers to any review conducted after polls close for the purpose of determining whether the votes were counted accurately (a results audit) or whether proper procedures were followed (a process audit), or both.

Audits vary and can include checking that the number of voters signed in at the polls matches the number of ballots, seals on ballot boxes and storage rooms are intact, computer counts (if used) match hand counts, and counts are accurately totaled.

[[Election recount]]s are a specific type of audit, with elements of both results and process audits.

===Prosecution===
In the United States the goal of prosecutions is not to stop fraud or keep fraudulent winners out of office; it is to deter and punish years later. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] has published ''Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses'' in eight editions from 1976 to 2017, under Presidents [[Gerald Ford|Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], Bush and [[Donald Trump|Trump]]. It says, "Department does not have authority to directly intercede in the election process itself.... overt criminal investigative measures should not ordinarily be taken... until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded."<ref name="fedpros2017">{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal/file/1029066/download |title=Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses Eighth Edition |date=December 2017 |website=[[United States Department of Justice]] |access-date=2019-07-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201012214302/https://www.justice.gov/criminal/file/1029066/download |archive-date=October 12, 2020}}</ref><ref name="fedpros">{{Cite web |url=http://site.votewell.net/a/doj-elections.htm |title=Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses |website=votewell.net |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>  Sentencing guidelines provide a range of 0–21 months in prison for a first offender;<ref name="ussc-table">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2011/manual-pdf/Sentencing_Table.pdf |title=Sentencing Table |date=2011 |website=US Sentencing Commission |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> [[offense level]]s range from 8 to 14.<ref name="ussc">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2018-guidelines-manual/2018-chapter-2-c |title=2018 Chapter 2 Part C, section 2C1.1 |date=2018-06-27 |website=United States Sentencing Commission |language=en |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Investigation, prosecution and appeals can take over 10 years.<ref name="wkyt">{{Cite news |url=https://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/275602001.html |title=Ex-judge convicted of vote fraud in Clay County disbarred |last=WKYT |access-date=2019-07-13 |language=en}}</ref> [[The Heritage Foundation]]’s election fraud database<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search |title=Voter Fraud Map: Election Fraud Database |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=heritage.org |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |access-date=October 15, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005120117/https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search |archive-date=October 5, 2020 }}</ref> listed 1,285 proven instances of voter fraud in America from 1982 to 2020, averaging 34 cases per year.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Samalis-Aldrich |first1=Kaitlynn |last2=von Spakovsky |first2=Hans A. |date=May 10, 2020 |title=Database Swells to 1,285 Proven Cases of Voter Fraud in America |url=https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/database-swells-1285-proven-cases-voter-fraud-america |url-status=live |work=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005222430/https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/database-swells-1285-proven-cases-voter-fraud-america |archive-date=October 5, 2020 |access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref>

Andrade |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2011-11-18 }}</ref>

===Mores===
The patterns of conventional behaviour in a society, or [[mores]], are an effective means for preventing electoral fraud and corruption in general. A good example is [[Sweden]], where the culture has a strong tendency toward positive values, resulting in a low incidence of political corruption.<ref name=cpi>{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi|work=Transparency International|publisher=Transparency International|access-date=1 December 2011|year=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619145956/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi|archive-date=19 June 2006|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Until recently [[Canada]] had a similar reputation. The [[In and Out scandal]] of 2008 and the [[Robocall scandal]] of 2011 has tarnished Canada's electoral integrity.

An advantage of cultivating positive mores as a prevention strategy is that it is effective across all electoral systems and devices. A disadvantage is that it makes other prevention and detection efforts more difficult to implement because members of society generally have more trust and less of a [[Confidence trick#Vulnerability to confidence tricks|sense for fraudulent methods]].

===Secret ballot===
{{Main|Secret ballot}}
The [[secret ballot]], in which only the voter knows how they have voted, is believed by many to be a crucial part of ensuring free and fair elections through preventing voter intimidation or retribution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why You Should Expect Challenges To Secret Ballots|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/07/12/why-you-should-expect-challenges-to-secret-ballots/|publisher=The Federalist|access-date=16 July 2016|date=2016-07-12}}</ref> Others argue that the secret ballot enables election fraud (because it makes it harder to verify that votes have been counted correctly) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepress.org/article/scrap-secret-ballot-return-open-voting|title=Scrap the "secret" ballot – return to open voting}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/~davies/secret-ballot.pdf|title=Consequences of the Secret Ballot|author=Todd Davies|publisher=Symbolic Systems Program, Stanford University}}</ref> and that it discourages voter participation.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Abolish the Secret Ballot|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/abolish-the-secret-ballot/309038/|magazine=The Atlantic}}</ref> Although the secret ballot was sometimes practiced in [[ancient Greece]] and was a part of the [[Constitution of the Year III]] of 1795, it only became common in the nineteenth century. Secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in the former British [[colony]]—now an [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|state]]—of [[Tasmania]] on 7 February 1856. By the turn of the century, the practice had spread to most Western democracies.

In the United States, the popularity of the Australian ballot grew as reformers in the late 19th century sought to reduce the problems of election fraud. Groups such as the Greenbackers, Nationalist, and more fought for those who yearned to vote, but were exiled for their safety. George Walthew, Greenback, helped initiate one of the first secret ballots in America in Michigan in 1885. Even George Walthew had a predecessor in John Seitz, Greenback, who campaigned a bill to " preserve the purity of elections" in 1879 after the discovery of Ohio's electoral fraud in congressional elections.

The efforts of many helped accomplish this and led to the spread of other secret ballots all across the country. As mentioned on February 18, 1890, in the Galveston News "The Australian ballot has come to stay. It protects the independence of the voter and largely puts a stop to vote to buy." Before this, it was common for candidates to intimidate or bribe voters, as they would always know who had voted which way.

===Transparency===
Most methods of preventing electoral fraud involve making the election process completely transparent to all voters, from nomination of candidates through casting of the votes and tabulation.<ref name="CB1">{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Dangerous Ideas |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=1892 |work=Voting Fiasco, Part 279.236(a) |publisher=Criminal Brief |access-date=2010-10-07 |date=2008-08-17 }}</ref> A key feature in ensuring the integrity of any part of the electoral process is a strict [[chain of custody]].

To prevent fraud in central tabulation, there has to be a public list of the results from every single polling place. This is the only way for voters to prove that the results they witnessed in their election office are correctly incorporated into the totals.

[[End-to-end auditable voting systems]] provide voters with a receipt to allow them to verify their vote was cast correctly, and an audit mechanism to verify that the results were tabulated correctly and all votes were cast by valid voters. However, the ballot receipt does not permit voters to prove to others how they voted, since this would open the door towards forced voting and blackmail. End-to-end systems include [[Punchscan]] and [[Scantegrity]], the latter being an add-on to optical scan systems instead of a replacement.

In many cases, [[election observers]] are used to help prevent fraud and assure voters that the election is fair. International observers (bilateral and multilateral) may be invited to observe the elections (examples include election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), European Union election observation missions, observation missions of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), as well as international observation organised by NGOs, such as [[CIS-EMO]], European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations (ENEMO), etc.). Some countries also invite foreign observers (i.e. bi-lateral observation, as opposed to multi-lateral observation by international observers).

In addition, national legislatures of countries often permit domestic observation. Domestic election observers can be either partisan (i.e. representing interests of one or a group of election contestants) or non-partisan (usually done by civil society groups). Legislations of different countries permit various forms and extents of international and domestic election observation.

Election observation is also prescribed by various international legal instruments. For example, paragraph 8 of the 1990 Copenhagen Document states that "The [OSCE] participating States consider that the presence of observers, both foreign and domestic, can enhance the electoral process for States in which elections are taking place. They, therefore, invite observers from any other CSCE participating States and any appropriate private institutions and organisations who may wish to do so to observe the course of their national election proceedings, to the extent permitted by law. They will also endeavour to facilitate similar access for election proceedings held below the national level. Such observers will undertake not to interfere in the electoral proceedings".

Critics note that observers cannot spot certain types of election fraud like targeted [[voter suppression]] or manipulated software of [[voting machine]]s.

===Statistical indicators and election forensics===
Various forms of [[statistic]]s can be indicators of election fraud, e.g. [[exit poll]]s which diverge from the final results. Well-conducted exit polls serve as a deterrent to electoral fraud. However, exit polls are still notoriously imprecise. For instance, in the Czech Republic, some voters are afraid or ashamed to admit that they voted for the Communist Party (exit polls in 2002 gave the Communist party 2–3 percentage points less than the actual result). Variations in willingness to participate in an exit poll may result in an unrepresentative sample compared to the overall voting population.

When elections are marred by ballot-box stuffing (e.g., the Armenian presidential elections of 1996 and 1998), the affected polling stations will show abnormally high voter turnouts with results favouring a single candidate. By graphing the number of votes against turnout percentage (i.e., aggregating polling stations results within a given turnout range), the divergence from bell-curve distribution gives an indication of the extent of the fraud. Stuffing votes in favour of a single candidate affects votes vs. turnout distributions for that candidate and other candidates differently; this difference could be used to quantitatively assess the number of votes stuffed. Also, these distributions sometimes exhibit spikes at round-number turnout percentage values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://podmoskovnik.livejournal.com/65386.html |title=podmoskovnik: Cтатья о выборах из Троицкого Варианта |publisher=Podmoskovnik.livejournal.com |access-date=2015-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=27 октября 2009&nbsp;года. |url=http://www.trvscience.ru/2009/10/27/statisticheskoe-issledovanie-rezultatov-rossijskix-vyborov-2007-2009-gg |title=Статистическое исследование результатов российских выборов 2007–2009 гг. : Троицкий вариант – Наука |publisher=Trvscience.ru |date=2009-10-27 |access-date=2015-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423162343/http://trvscience.ru/2009/10/27/statisticheskoe-issledovanie-rezultatov-rossijskix-vyborov-2007-2009-gg/ |archive-date=2013-04-23 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Walter R.

[[Risk-limiting audit]]s are methods to assess the validity of an election result statistically without the effort of a full [[election recount]].

Though [[election forensic]]s can determine if election results are anomalous, the statistics themselves are not indicative of fraud. Election forensics can be combined with other fraud detection and prevention strategies, such as in-person monitoring.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MXR7.pdf| title=A Guide to Elections Forensics| year=2017 | first1=Allen| last1=Hicken| first2=Walter R.| last2= Mebane| publisher=University of Michigan Center for Political Studies}}</ref>

===Voting machine integrity===
{{further|Certification of voting machines|Election audits}}

One method for verifying [[voting machine]] accuracy is [[Parallel Testing]], the process of using an independent set of results compared to the original machine results. Parallel testing can be done prior to or during an election. During an election, one form of parallel testing is the [[VVPAT]]. Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) or verified paper record (VPR) is a method of providing feedback to voters using a ballotless voting system. A VVPAT is intended as an independent verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify that their vote was cast correctly, to detect possible election fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the stored electronic results. This method is only effective if [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] numbers of voters verify that their intended vote matches both the electronic and paper votes.

On election day, a statistically significant number of voting machines can be randomly selected from polling locations and used for testing. This can be used to detect potential fraud or malfunction unless manipulated software would only start to cheat after a certain event like a voter pressing a special key combination (Or a machine might cheat only if someone doesn't perform the combination, which requires more insider access but fewer voters).

Another form of testing is [[Logic & Accuracy Testing]] (L&A), pre-election testing of voting machines using test votes to determine if they are functioning correctly.

Another method to ensure the integrity of electronic voting machines is independent [[software verification]] and [[Certification of voting machines|certification]].<ref name=" CB1" /> Once a software is certified, code signing can ensure the software certified is identical to that which is used on election day. Some argue certification would be more effective if voting machine software was publicly available or [[open source]].

Certification and testing processes conducted publicly and with oversight from interested parties can promote transparency in the election process. The integrity of those conducting testing can be questioned.

Testing and certification can prevent voting machines from being a [[Black Box Voting|black box]] where voters cannot be sure that counting inside is done as intended.<ref name="  CB1" />

One method that people have argued would help prevent these machines from being tampered with would be for the companies that produce the machines to share the source code, which displays and captures the ballots, with computer scientists. This would allow external sources to make sure that the machines are working correctly.<ref name="Bonsor"/>

===Voting Rights Act of 1965===
{{main|Voting Rights Act of 1965}}
This was the most important federal legislation of the 20th century to protect voting rights, especially of ethnic and language minorities who had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] for decades by states' constitutions and practices. Initially, it was particularly important for enforcing the constitutional right of African Americans in the South to vote, where millions of people had been mostly disenfranchised since the turn of the 20th century and excluded from politics. The law has also protected other ethnicities, such as Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, and language minorities in other states, who have been discriminated against at various times, especially in the process of voter registration and electoral practices.

===Civil Rights Act of 1964===
{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964}}
The '''Civil Rights Act of 1964''' ({{USStatute|88|352|78|241|1964|07|02}}) was a landmark piece of legislation in the [[United States]]<ref>Wright, Susan (2005), ''The Civil Rights Act of 1964: Landmark Antidiscrimination Legislation'', The Rosen Publishing Group, {{ISBN|1-4042-0455-5}}</ref> that outlawed major forms of discrimination against African Americans and other minorities.
