She is the elder daughter of [[Frank Sinatra]] and Nancy Sinatra ({{née}} Barbato), and is widely known for her 1965 [[signature song|signature hit]] "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]{{-"}}.

Other defining recordings include "[[Sugar Town]]", the 1967 number one "[[Somethin' Stupid]]" (a duet with her father), [[You Only Live Twice (song)|the title song]] from the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', several collaborations with [[Lee Hazlewood]], such as "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]", "[[Summer Wine]]" and her cover of [[Cher]]'s "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]". Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] number-one hit with "These Boots Are Made for Walkin{{'"}}. She appeared on TV in high boots, and with colorfully dressed [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancers]], creating a popular and enduring image of the [[Swinging Sixties]].<ref name=KLSmith/><ref name=SLeigh/> The song was written by [[Lee Hazlewood]], who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including "[[Some Velvet Morning]]". In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured [[Billy Strange]] as arranger and conductor.

Sinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid-1960s, including a co-starring role with [[Elvis Presley]] in the movie ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'', and with [[Peter Fonda]] in ''[[The Wild Angels]]''. In ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'', Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter.

==Early life==

Sinatra was born on June 8, 1940 in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. She is the eldest of the three children whom [[Frank Sinatra]] fathered by his first wife, Nancy Barbato (1917–2018). Both of her parents were of [[Italian Americans|Italian]] ancestry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/obituaries/nancy-barbato-sinatra-dead.html|title=Nancy Barbato Sinatra, 101, an Idol's First Wife and Lasting Confidante, Dies|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=2018-07-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> When she was a toddler, the family moved to [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey|Hasbrouck Heights]], New Jersey. They later moved again to [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake, California]] for her father's Hollywood career. There, she spent many years in piano, dance and dramatic performance lessons, and underwent months of voice lessons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/nancy-sinatra-21047995|title=Nancy Sinatra|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-12}}</ref>

==Recording career==
===1960s===
In the late 1950s, Sinatra began to study music, dancing and voice at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], but she dropped out after one year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11574700/Nancy-Sinatra-It-still-hurts-to-hear-his-voice.html|title=Nancy Sinatra: 'It still hurts to hear his voice'|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}</ref> She made her professional debut on her father's 1960 television special ''[[The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis]]'', which celebrated the return of [[Elvis Presley]] from Europe following his discharge from military service. Nancy was sent to the airport on behalf of her father to welcome Presley when his plane landed. On the special, Sinatra and her father danced and sang a duet, "You Make Me Feel So Young/Old." That same year, she began a five-year marriage to [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]].<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=tzHABQAAQBAJ&pg=PT362&lpg=PT362&dq=sinatra+a+five-year+marriage+to+Tommy+Sands&source=bl&ots=zpzB_I4luO&sig=ACfU3U3zxA3heAZhJUm6WGRt7kYTFybcdQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_jtHNzLnpAhXGUt8KHZKhAKA4ChDoATACegQIChAB#v=onepage&q=sinatra%20a%20five-year%20marriage%20to%20Tommy%20Sands&f=false Sinatra: Behind the Legend]</ref>

Sinatra was signed to her father's label, [[Reprise Records]], in 1961. Her first single, "Cuff Links and a Tie Clip," went largely unnoticed. However, subsequent singles charted in Europe and Japan. Without a hit in the U.S. by 1965, she was on the verge of being dropped by the label. Her singing career received a boost with the help of songwriter/producer/arranger [[Lee Hazlewood]], who had been making records for ten years, notably with [[Duane Eddy]]. Hazlewood's collaboration with Sinatra began when Frank Sinatra asked Lee to help boost his daughter's career. When recording ''These Boots are Made for Walkin''', Hazelwood is said to have suggested to Nancy, "You can’t sing like Nancy Nice Lady anymore. You have to sing for the truckers." She later described him as "part Henry Higgins and part Sigmund Freud."<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/99eb9de6-d821-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e Elemental and enigmatic — the mystery of Some Velvet Morning]</ref>

Bolstered by an image overhaul—including bleached-blond hair, frosted lips, heavy eye makeup and [[Carnaby Street]] fashions—Sinatra made her mark on the American (and British) music scene in early 1966 with "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']],{{-"}}<ref name="pc44">{{Gilliland |https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19808/m1/ |Show 44 – Revolt of the Fat Angel: Some samples of the Los Angeles sound.

A run of chart singles followed, including the two 1966 top 10 hits "How Does That Grab You, Darlin'?" (U.S. No. 7) and "[[Sugar Town]]" (U.S. No. 5). "Sugar Town" became Sinatra's second million-seller.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" /> The ballad "[[Somethin' Stupid]]"—a duet with her father—hit No. 1 in the U.S. and the U.K. in April 1967 and spent nine weeks at the top of [[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'s [[easy listening]] chart.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6531810/rewinding-the-charts-in-1967-frank-nancy-sinatra-shared-a-no-1]</ref> The pair became the only father-daughter duo to top the Hot 100, but DJs dubbed the track "the incest song" because it was sung as if by two lovers.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6531810/rewinding-the-charts-in-1967-frank-nancy-sinatra-shared-a-no-1 Rewinding the Charts: In 1967, Frank & Nancy Sinatra Shared a No. 1]</ref> The record earned a Grammy Award nomination for [[Record of the Year]] and remains the only father-daughter duet to hit No. 1 in the U.S.; it became Sinatra's third million-selling [[gramophone record|disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs" />

Other singles showing Sinatra's forthright delivery include "Friday’s Child" (U.S. No. 36, 1966) and the 1967 hits "Love Eyes" (U.S. No. 15) and "Lightning’s Girl" (U.S. No. 24). She rounded out 1967 with the raunchy but low-charting "Tony Rome" (U.S. No. 83)—the title track from the detective film ''[[Tony Rome]]'' starring her father—while her first solo single in 1968 was the more wistful "100 Years" (U.S. No. 69). In 1968, she recorded "Highway Song", written by [[Kenny Young]] and produced by [[Mickie Most]], for the European markets. The song reached the top 20 in the U.K. and other European countries.

[[File:Nancy_Sinatra_(1967).png|right|250px|thumb|Nancy Sinatra in 1967]]
Sinatra enjoyed a parallel recording career cutting duets with the husky-voiced, [[country music|country-and-western]]-inspired Hazlewood, starting with "[[Summer Wine]]" (originally the [[B-side]] of "Sugar Town"). Their biggest hit was a cover of the country song "[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]". The single peaked at No. 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the summer of 1967, when [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]] also made the song their own.

In December, Sinatra and Hazlewood released the single "[[Some Velvet Morning]]" (U.S. No. 26), accompanied by a [[music video|promo clip]]. The song is regarded as one of pop's more unusual singles; critic [[Cathi Unsworth]] wrote, "The puzzle of its lyrics and otherworldly beauty of its sound [offer] seemingly endless interpretations."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/99eb9de6-d821-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e|title=Elemental and enigmatic — the mystery of Some Velvet Morning|first=Cathi|last=Unsworth|date=January 31, 2017|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=October 13, 2020}}</ref> The British [[broadsheet]] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' placed "Some Velvet Morning" atop its 2003 list of the Top 50 Best Duets Ever ("Somethin' Stupid" ranked No. 27.)<ref name="bla">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/11/08/bmduet08.xml|title=Duet|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2011-10-11}}</ref> The song appeared on the duo's 1968 album ''[[Nancy & Lee]]'', about which [[National Public Radio]] commented in 2017, "... its sly, sultry movements both are a gem of traditional '60s pop and an inversion of traditional conceptions of romance."<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2017/08/11/542413100/shocking-omission-nancy-sinatra-and-lee-hazlewood-s-charismatic-nancy-lee Shocking Omissions: Nancy Sinatra And Lee Hazlewood's Charismatic 'Nancy & Lee']</ref>

In 1967, Sinatra recorded the [[You Only Live Twice (song)|theme song]] for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''. In the liner notes of the CD reissue of her 1966 album ''[[Nancy In London]]'', Sinatra states that she was "scared to death" of recording the song, and asked the songwriters: "Are you sure you don't want [[Shirley Bassey]]?" There are two versions of the Bond theme. The first is the lushly orchestrated track featured during the opening and closing credits of the film. The second—and more guitar-heavy—version appeared on the [[double A-sided]] single with "Jackson", though the Bond theme stalled at No. 44 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6753813/james-bond-songs-hot-100-highest-charting. 007 on Hot 100: See James Bond Songs From Lowest to Highest Charting]</ref> "Jackson"/"You Only Live Twice" was more successful in the U.K., reaching No.11 on the singles chart during a 19-week chart run (in the Top 50) that saw the single become the 70th-best-selling single of 1967 in the U.K.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixtiescity.net/charts/67chart.htm#top100|title=Pop Music Charts – Every Week Of The Sixties|publisher=Sixties City|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>

In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra traveled to [[Vietnam]] to perform for the U.S. troops. Many soldiers adopted her song "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]{{-"}} as their anthem, as shown in [[Pierre Schoendoerffer]]'s documentary ''[[The Anderson Platoon]]'' (1967) and reprised in a scene in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987). Sinatra recorded several [[anti-war|antiwar]] songs, including "[[My Buddy (song)|My Buddy]]", which was featured on her album ''[[Sugar (Nancy Sinatra album)|Sugar]]'', "Home", co-written by [[Mac Davis]] and "[[It's Such A Lonely Time of Year|It's Such a Lonely Time of Year]]", which appeared on the 1968 LP ''[[The Sinatra Family Wish You a Merry Christmas]]''. In 1988, Sinatra recreated her Vietnam concert appearances on an episode of the television show ''[[China Beach]]''. Sinatra still performs for charitable causes supporting [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam veterans]], including [[Rolling Thunder (organization)|Rolling Thunder Inc]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

She starred in three [[beach party film]]s: ''[[For Those Who Think Young (film)|For Those Who Think Young]]'' (1964), ''[[Get Yourself a College Girl]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini]]'' (1966), and she sang in the latter film. She was also scheduled for the role that went to [[Linda Evans]] in ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'', but withdrew because the character is kidnapped in the film, a parallel too close to actual events as her brother [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]] was [[Frank Sinatra Jr.#Kidnapping|kidnapped]] in December 1963.<ref>p.231 McGee, Mark Thomas ''Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'' McFarland, 1996</ref>

In 1967, NBC aired Sinatra's own special, ''[[Movin' With Nancy]]''. It featured Lee Hazlewood, her father and his [[Rat Pack]] pals Dean Martin and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], her brother [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]] and ''[[West Side Story]]'' dancer David Winters, who [[Choreography|choreographed]] the show. [[Jack Haley Jr.]] directed and produced the special, for which he received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Music or Variety. During the special, Sinatra shared a kiss with Davis Jr, about which she has stated, "The kiss [was] one of the first interracial kisses seen on television and it caused some controversy then, and now. [But] contrary to some inaccurate online reports, the kiss was unplanned and spontaneous."<ref name="sinatrakugel">{{cite news|url=http://www.pr.com/article/1174|title=Nancy Sinatra: The Promise She Made Her Father, Praising Mia Farrow & Embracing Social Media|author-link=Allison Kugel|last=Kugel|first=Allison|date=April 28, 2011|publisher=PR.com|access-date=2011-10-11}}</ref> Winters was nominated for an Emmy in the Special Classification of Individual Achievements category for his choreography but lost to co-winners ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000223/1968?ref_=ttawd_ev_2|title=Primetime Emmy Awards|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}{{User-generated source|date=February 2018}}</ref> The special's success may have been a motivating factor for the development of the Emmy award for Outstanding Choreography, which was introduced the following year.<ref>{{IMDb name|935916|David Winters|section=awards}}{{User-generated source|date=February 2018}}</ref> ''[[Movin' With Nancy]]'' was sponsored by [[RC Cola]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidkrell.com/uncategorized/movin-with-nancy-sinatra/|title="Movin' With Nancy" (Sinatra)|publisher=David Krell|date=2013-03-04|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref>

===1970s and 1980s===
Sinatra remained with Reprise until 1970. In 1971, she signed with [[RCA Records]], resulting in three albums: ''Nancy & Lee – Again'' (1971), ''[[Woman (Nancy Sinatra album)|Woman]]'' (1972) and a compilation of some of her Reprise recordings called ''This Is Nancy Sinatra'' (1973). In 1973, she released the non-LP single "Sugar Me" [[A-side and B-side|b/w]] "[[Ain't No Sunshine]]." "Sugar Me" was written by [[Lynsey De Paul]] and [[Barry Blue]] and, with other covers of works by early-'70s popular songwriters, resurfaced on the 1998 album ''How Does It Feel?''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/how-does-it-feel-mw0000049216|title=How Does It Feel - Nancy Sinatra - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nancy-Sinatra-How-Does-It-Feel/release/857875|title=Nancy Sinatra - How Does It Feel?|website=Discogs|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>

By 1975, Sinatra was releasing singles on the [[Private Stock Records]] label, which are the most sought-after by collectors.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Among the singles were "Kinky Love", "Annabell of Mobile", "It's for My Dad" and "Indian Summer" (with Hazlewood). "Kinky Love" was banned by some radio stations for its suggestive lyrics. It appeared on ''Sheet Music: A Collection of Her Favorite Love Songs'' in 1998, and [[Pale Saints]] covered the song in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pale-Saints-Kinky-Love/release/500810|title=Pale Saints – Kinky Love (Vinyl) at Discogs|publisher=Discogs.com|date=1991-06-24|access-date=2014-04-01}}{{User-generated source|date=February 2018}}</ref>

By the mid-1970s, Sinatra had slowed her musical activity and ceased acting to concentrate on her family. She returned to the studio in 1981 to record a country album with [[Mel Tillis]] called ''Mel & Nancy''. Two of their songs made the ''Billboard'' country chart: "Texas Cowboy Night" (No. 23) and "Play Me or Trade Me" (No. 43).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nancy-sinatra|title=Nancy Sinatra|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>

At 54, Sinatra posed for ''[[Playboy]]'' in the May 1995 issue and made appearances on TV shows to promote her album ''One More Time''. The magazine appearance caused some controversy. On the talk-show circuit, she said that her father was proud of the photos. Sinatra told [[Jay Leno]] on a 1995 ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]'' that her daughters gave their approval, but her mother said that she should ask her father before committing to the project. Sinatra claims that when she told her father what ''Playboy'' would be paying her, he said, "Double it."<ref>{{cite news|last=Riedel|first=Michael|date=April 11, 1995|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|title=Nancy Sinatra poses in boots only to kick off a comeback|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-04-11/features/1995101154_1_sinatra-boots-frank | access-date=March 17, 2017}}</ref>

In August 2002, Sinatra appeared live at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]. The sold-out, one-off concert was filmed by the [[BBC]] and later aired on [[BBC Four]].

In 2004, she collaborated with former Los Angeles neighbor [[Morrissey]] to record a version of his song "[[Let Me Kiss You]]", which was featured on her album ''[[Nancy Sinatra (album)|Nancy Sinatra]]''. The single—released the same day as Morrissey's version—charted at No. 46 in the U.K., providing Sinatra with her first hit in more than 30 years. The follow-up single, "Burnin' Down the Spark," failed to chart. The album featured [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[U2]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Steven Van Zandt]], [[Jon Spencer]] and [[Pete Yorn]], all of whom have cited Sinatra as an influence. Each artist crafted a song for Sinatra to sing on the album.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jody|date=September 28, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Nancy Sinatra's indie-rock comeback|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/28/arts/nancy-sinatras-indierock-comeback.html?_r=0 | access-date=March 17, 2017}}</ref>
