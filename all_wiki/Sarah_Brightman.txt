===1981–1989: Stage career===
In 1981, Brightman auditioned for the new musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', by composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], and was cast as Jemima. After a year in ''Cats'', Brightman took over from [[Bonnie Langford]] as Kate in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' at the Drury Lane Theatre, London, and appeared as Tara Treetops in ''Masquerade'', a musical based on [[Kit Williams]]'s [[Masquerade (book)|book of the same title]].

Enticed by a rave review, Webber went to watch her in the show one evening and was greatly impressed by her performance. Though she had appeared in his musical ''Cats'', Webber had not previously singled Brightman out as a great talent. The two married in 1984, and Brightman appeared in Lloyd Webber's subsequent musicals including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and ''[[Song and Dance]]'', as well as the [[mass (music)|mass]] [[Requiem (Lloyd Webber)|Requiem]], which was written and composed for Lloyd Webber's father.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In 1985, Brightman's recording of "[[Pie Jesu]]" was a strong commercial success, selling 25,000 copies<ref name="ReferenceA"/> on the first day of release and peaking at number 3, despite the lyrics being in Latin. With classical music permeating the Lloyd Webber household (Brightman was in heavy operatic training at the time), Lloyd Webber was moved to write the Requiem Mass as a tribute to his father. Its Manhattan premiere, starring [[Plácido Domingo]] and Brightman, was filmed by the [[BBC]] and [[PBS]] for later broadcast. The LP eventually became UK's top selling classical album of the year and earned Brightman a Grammy nomination as Best New Classical Artist.<ref name="video">{{cite web |title= Video Biography |url= http://www.sarah-brightman.com/sound_vision.html |publisher= Sarah Brightman Official Website |access-date= 18 June 2009 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090713231323/http://www.sarah-brightman.com/sound_vision.html |archive-date= 13 July 2009 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

After leaving ''Phantom,'' she performed in a tour of Lloyd Webber's music throughout England, Canada and the United States, and performed Requiem in the Soviet Union. Studio recordings from this time include the single "Anything But Lonely" from ''Aspects of Love'' and two solo albums: the 1988 album ''[[The Trees They Grow So High (album)|The Trees They Grow So High]],'' a collection of [[folk song]]s accompanied by piano, and the 1989 album ''[[The Songs That Got Away]],'' a compilation of obscure musical theatre songs from shows by such composers as [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]].

Her 2003 album ''[[Harem (album)|Harem]]'' represented another departure: a [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern-themed]] album influenced by dance music. On ''Harem'', Brightman collaborated with artists such as [[Ofra Haza]] and Iraqi singer [[Kazem al-Saher]]. [[Nigel Kennedy]] contributed violin tracks to the songs "[[Free (Sarah Brightman song)|Free]]" and "The War is Over" and [[Jaz Coleman]] contributed arrangements.<ref name="video"/>

==Music and voice==

Brightman underwent vocal training first with Elizabeth Hawes, head of the [[Trinity College of Music|Trinity Music College]] in London, and later with [[Ellen Faull]] of [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]. She studies with voice teacher David Romano.<ref>Alter, Gaby.

David Caddick, a conductor of ''Phantom'', has stated:

<blockquote>What is amazing about Sarah is that she has two voices, really. She can produce a pop, contemporary sound, but she can also blossom out into a [[light lyric soprano]]. The soprano part of her voice can go up to a F6 above her known E6. She doesn't sing it full out, but it is there. Of course, she has to dance while she is singing some of the time, so it's all the more extraordinary.<ref name="chin"/></blockquote>

She sometimes uses her pop and classical voices in the same song. One example is "Anytime, Anywhere" from ''Eden'', a song based on [[Albinoni]]'s [[Adagio in G minor]]. In the song, she starts out in classical voice, switches to pop voice temporarily, and finishes with her classical voice. Another example is heard in the [[Lions Gate]] film ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'', during the songs "Chase The Morning" and "Chromaggia" by her character, Blind Mag.

Brightman's music is generally classified as classical crossover. According to [[Manhattan Records]] GM Ian Ralfini, she is largely responsible for the popularity of the genre. In a 2000 interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Brightman dismissed the classical crossover label as "horrible" but stated she understood people's need to categorise music.<ref>Charaipotra, Sona. ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]'', 6 November 2000.</ref> Her personal influences include 1960s and 1970s musicians and artists such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Pink Floyd]],<ref name="video"/> and she incorporates aspects of genres from pop/rock to classical.

Retrieved 1 September 2007.</ref> The material on her albums ranges from versions of opera arias from composers such as [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] (on ''Harem'', ''Eden'', and ''Timeless''), to pop songs by artists such as [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] ("[[Dust in the Wind]]" on ''Eden''), [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] ("[[Here with Me (Dido song)|Here with Me]]" on ''La Luna''), and [[Procol Harum]] ("[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]" on ''La Luna''). She sings in many languages which are English, Spanish, French, Latin, German, Italian, Russian, Hindi, Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.

==Personal life==
At age 18, in 1979, Brightman married Andrew Graham-Stewart, who at that time managed the German band [[Tangerine Dream]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.early-sarah-brightman.com/bio1.htm |title=Biography |publisher=Early-sarah-brightman.com |access-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710163708/http://www.early-sarah-brightman.com/bio1.htm |archive-date=10 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> She later met [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] when she performed in ''Cats''.

They are currently on friendly terms; in 2006, at the 20th London anniversary of ''The Phantom of the Opera'', Lloyd Webber called Brightman a "wonderful woman" and "absolutely beloved mentor", and she performed at the 25th anniversary of the musical in 2011. He appeared as a special guest in her [[Sarah Brightman: In Concert|1997 concert]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.

Brightman had a 10-year relationship with Frank Peterson, during which they tried and were unsuccessful in having children. In an interview with British magazine ''[[Hello! (magazine)|Hello!]]'', she said motherhood would have been "lovely" but accepted that she would never have a child.<ref>Barber, Richard. ''[[Hello! Magazine|Hello!]]''. 5 December 2006.</ref>
