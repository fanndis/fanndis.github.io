"'''At Last'''" is a song written by [[Mack Gordon]] and [[Harry Warren]] for the [[musical film]] ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941). [[Glenn Miller]] and his orchestra recorded the tune several times, with a 1942 version reaching number two on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|pop music]] chart.<ref name="Miller peak"/>

In 1960, [[rhythm and blues]] singer [[Etta James]] recorded an arrangement by Riley Hampton that improvised on Warren's melody. James' version was the title track on her debut album ''[[At Last!]]'' (1960) and was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Hall_Of_Fame/ |title=Grammy Hall of Fame Database |publisher=Replay.waybackmachine.org |date=April 20, 2009 |access-date=December 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420055756/http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Hall_Of_Fame/ |archive-date=April 20, 2009 }}</ref> [[Celine Dion]] and [[Beyoncé]] also had chart successes with the song.

==Glenn Miller renditions==
Prior to release of ''Sun Valley Serenade'', "At Last" was performed in the film by [[Glenn Miller]] and his orchestra, with vocals by [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]] and [[Lynn Bari]], dubbed by [[Pat Friday]]. Studio head [[Darryl Zanuck]] reportedly said, "There are too many big ones in this.  Let's save one for the next."  The "At Last" vocal by Payne and Bari was thus deleted, although instrumental versions remained in the film, including in the Black Ice Ballet finale.

Unreleased recordings of the song had been made in 1941 by Glenn Miller. A new version was recorded by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra in Hollywood on May 20, 1942, and released by RCA Victor Records as a 78 single,<ref>RCA Victor 27934-B</ref> backed with the A-side "[[(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo]]". The song entered the US ''Billboard'' pop music chart (called ""Songs with the Most Radio Plugs" at the time) on August 1, 1942 at number 17,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-08-01.pdf |title=The Billboard Music Popularity Chart |website=americanradiohistory.com |date=August 1, 1942 |page=22<!--(chart entry ref) Chart listings for singles in section "Songs with the Most Radio Plugs" under publisher's name "Feist" for [[Leo Feist]] music publishers.--> |access-date=March 29, 2019 }}</ref> and peaked at number two on August 29, 1942.<ref name="Miller peak">{{cite web |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-08-29.pdf |title=The Billboard Music Popularity Chart |website=americanradiohistory.com |date=August 29, 1942 |page=20<!--(chart peak ref) Chart listings for singles in section "Songs with the Most Radio Plugs" under publisher's name "Feist" for [[Leo Feist]] music publishers.--> |access-date=March 29, 2019 }}</ref> It spent a total of 17 weeks on the chart,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-11-21.pdf |title=The Billboard Music Popularity Chart |website=americanradiohistory.com |date=November 21, 1942 |page=24<!--(last chart date ref--chart position number 17) Chart listings for singles in section "Songs with the Most Radio Plugs" under publisher's name "Feist" for [[Leo Feist]] music publishers.--> |access-date=March 29, 2019 }}</ref> and later became a [[Great American Songbook|standard]].

When RCA Victor issued two 10-inch LP soundtracks to ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]''<ref>RCA Victor LPT- 3064</ref> and ''Orchestra Wives''<ref>RCA Victor LPT-3065</ref> in 1954, to coincide with the theatrical reissue of the two films, the outtake version of "At Last" from "Sun Valley Serenade" was included, heard for the first time, but the version in ''Orchestra Wives'' was not.  This latter rendition was eventually on LP in 1958, in the 20th-Fox double-disc (TCF-100-2) Glenn Miller ''Compilation of His Original Film Soundtracks''.

The song became [[Etta James]]'s [[signature song]] and was the third in a string of successful songs from her [[Argo Records]] debut album (Argo LP 4003, mono; LPS 4003, stereo) ''[[At Last!]]''. In April 1961, it became her second number two R&B hit single (Argo 5380) and crossed over to pop radio, reaching number 47 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Despite its modest pop chart standing, the song is well-known and is still played regularly on [[oldies]] radio stations.

By contrast, Thom Jurek of [[Allmusic]] wrote that on "At Last",
{{quote|Beyoncé possesses little of the legendary singer's power or edgy finesse. She's entirely too polished and restrained. Her phrasing doesn't come close in terms of inventiveness or inspiration, and her emotional conviction is lacking, to say the least.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/cadillac-records-r1448334/review |title=Cadillac Records |publisher=[[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]] |author=Thom Jurek |date=December 2, 2008 |access-date=March 27, 2011}}</ref>}}

This was somewhat echoed by Robert Fontenot of [[About.com]] who thought that Beyoncé
{{quote|sings Etta like a diva{{snd}}technically proficient, but overemoted and lacking every bit of Etta's sly subtext and hard-won earthiness. Beyoncé knows how to sing the blues, in other words; she just doesn't know how to have them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/buyersguides/gr/cadillacrecords.htm |title=Various Artists: Cadillac Records Original Movie Soundtrack |publisher=[[About.com]] [[The New York Times Company]] |author=Robert Fontenot |access-date=March 27, 2011}}</ref>}}

Margeaux Watson of ''Entertainment Weekly'' also gave a mixed review for the song, writing,
{{quote|The only major drawback to her performance is that she lacks the pained vocal chops to convincingly pull off James's songs or make them her own... Each time she covers classics like "At Last" and "Trust in Me," you hear Beyoncé, not Etta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2008/11/25/first-look-beyo/|title=Beyoncé in 'Cadillac Records': the EW First Look|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Margeaux|last=Watson|date=November 25, 2011|access-date=June 27, 2013}}</ref>}}

===Live performances===
"At Last" was performed live for the first time by Beyoncé during the 2008 [[Fashion Rocks]] on September 5, 2008 as a tribute to James.<ref name="wash" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/beyonce-knowles-flashes-wedding-ring-fashion-rocks-article-1.324357|title=Beyoncé Knowles flashes wedding ring at Fashion Rocks|work=Daily News|first=Korin|last=Miller|date=September 7, 2008|access-date=June 27, 2013}}</ref> The live version of the song at the show was later released in 2008.<ref name="ALLAFR"/> Beyoncé performed the song live at [[Barack Obama]]'s first dance with his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] during the Neighborhood Ball on the night of his inauguration as [[President of the United States]]. She told [[Entertainment Tonight]]: "To sing 'At Last' while they have their first dance is a dream come true. I could not be more honored and excited that they have asked me to be part of this moment in history."<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602971/beyonces-inaugural-song-choice-expert-weighs.jhtml |title=Beyoncé's Inaugural Song Choice: An Expert Weighs In |publisher=MTV News.

Etta James, who was not happy at all, remarked to the audience at a concert from the stage of Seattle's Paramount Theatre a week later:
{{quote|You guys know your president, right? You know the one with the big ears? Wait a minute, he ain't my president. He might be yours; he ain't my president.

A week later, she continued savaging Beyoncé's performance by adding
{{quote|The great Beyoncé. Like I said, she ain't mine. [...] I can't stand Beyoncé. She has no business up there, singing up there on a big ol' president day, gonna be singing my song that I've been singing forever.<ref name="guar"/>}}

However, she later told the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' she meant no harm when poked fun at the president and she ripped Beyoncé for her performance of "At Last" during the inauguration; James acknowledged being miffed she was not invited to perform her signature song for Obama's first dance with his wife on inauguration night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/02/05/2009-02-05_etta_james_truly_miffed_about_obama_snub.html |title=Etta James truly miffed about Obama snub, but was kidding about disliking Beyoncé |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=February 5, 2009 |access-date=December 2, 2011 |location=New York |first=Carrie |last=Melago}}</ref> The event was telecast live on multiple broadcast and cable television networks.
