'''Soft rock''' (also known as '''light rock'''<ref>Alan Stephenson, David Reese, Mary Beadle, 2013, ''Broadcast Announcing Worktext: A Media Performance Guide'' p. 198.</ref> and '''adult-oriented rock'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Regev|first=Motti|title=Pop-Rock Music: Aesthetic Cosmopolitanism in Late Modernity|page=115|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=0745670903}}</ref>) is a derivative form of [[pop rock]]<ref name="AMearly">{{cite web|title=Early Pop/Rock|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/early-pop-rock-ma0000002763|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> that originated in the late 1960s in the U.S. region of [[Southern California]] and in the [[United Kingdom]]. The style smoothed over the edges of singer-songwriter and pop rock,<ref name="AMSoftrock"/> relying on simple, melodic songs with big, lush productions. Soft rock was prevalent on the radio throughout the 1970s and eventually metamorphosed into the synthesized music of [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] in the 1980s.<ref name="AMSoftrock"/>

==History==
{{cite-check|section|date=August 2016}}
===Mid- to late 1960s===
Softer sounds in rock music could be heard in mid-1960s songs, such as "[[A Summer Song]]" by [[Chad & Jeremy]] (1964) and "[[Here, There and Everywhere]]"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/htae.shtml|title=Alan W. Pollack's Notes on "Here, There, And Everywhere"|website=Icce.rug.nl}}</ref> by [[the Beatles]] and "[[I Love My Dog]]"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/31/dogs-reggae-soft-rock-10-top-dog-tracks|title=Dogs-Reggae-Soft-Rock-10-Top-Dog-Tracks|first=Rhik|last=Samadder|date=January 31, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> by [[Cat Stevens]] (both from 1966).

By 1968, [[hard rock]] had been established as a mainstream genre. From the end of the 1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock,<ref>R. B. Browne and P. Browne, eds, ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture'' (Popular Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-87972-821-3}}, p. 687.</ref> with both emerging as major radio formats in the US.<ref>M. C. Keith, ''The Radio Station: Broadcast, Satellite and Internet'' (Focal Press, 8th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-240-81186-0}}, p. 14.</ref> Late 1960s soft rock artists include the [[Bee Gees]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/article/andy-gibb-in-the-shadow-of-the-bee-gees|title=Andy Gibb, In the Shadow of the Bee Gees|website=Legacy.com}}</ref> whose song "[[I Started a Joke]]" was a [[Chart-topper|number one]] single in several countries; [[Neil Diamond]] with the 1969 hit "[[Sweet Caroline]]", [[the Hollies]] with their US and UK top 10 hit "[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]", and [[Elton John]] with his popular song "[[Skyline Pigeon]]".

===Early 1970s===
By the early 1970s, softer songs by [[the Carpenters]], [[Anne Murray]], [[John Denver]], [[Barry Manilow]], and even [[Barbra Streisand]] began to be played more often on "top 40" radio and others were added to the mix on many [[adult contemporary]] stations.

Major artists of that time included [[Bread (band)|Bread]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Soft Rock |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/soft-rock-ma0000011841 |title=Soft Rock : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://80music.about.com/od/genresmovements/p/softrockprofile.htm |title=Soft Rock – Profile of the Mellow, Romantic Soft Rock of the '70s and Early '80s |publisher=80music.about.com |date=April 12, 2012 |access-date=January 9, 2013}}</ref> [[Carly Simon]], [[Carole King]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[James Taylor]],<ref>J. M. Curtis, ''Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954–1984'' (Popular Press, 1987), p. 236.</ref> [[Lobo (musician)|Lobo]] and [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]] who achieved number-one hit singles between 1970–1972 with "[[Nothing Rhymed]]", "[[Alone Again (Naturally)]]" and "[[Clair (song)|Clair]]".

The Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts became more similar again toward the end of the 1960s and into the early and mid-1970s, when the texture of much of the music played on [[top 40]] radio once more began to soften. The adult contemporary format began evolving into the sound that later defined it, with rock-oriented acts as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Eagles (band)|the Eagles]] and [[Elton John]] becoming associated with the format. The Carpenters' hit version of "[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]" was released in the summer of 1970, followed by [[Bread (band)|Bread]]'s "[[Make It with You]]", both early examples of a softer sound that was coming to dominate the charts.<ref>Simpson, 2011 ''Early 70s Radio'', chap. 2 "Pillow Talk: MOR, Soft Rock, and the 'Feminization' of Hit Radio".</ref>

The soft rock album ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'' by Carole King, released in February 1971, became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The lead [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double-sided]] single from the album, "[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]"/"[[I Feel the Earth Move]]", spent five weeks at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] beginning in mid-June of 1971.<ref>Bronson, Fred, (2003). ''The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits'' (5th ed.) New York: Billboard Books. p. 294. {{ISBN|9780823076772}}</ref>

Los Angeles station [[KCBS-FM#History|KNX-FM]], under program director Steve Marshall, introduced a "mellow rock" format in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socalradiohistory.com/knxfm.html|title=KNX FM 93.1|website=Socalradiohistory.com|access-date=September 5, 2020}}</ref>

[[Albert Hammond]] scored a major hit single with "[[It Never Rains in Southern California]]" in 1972, which went top 10 in at least six countries including Canada and the U.S. at numbers 2 and 5, respectively.

In the spring of 1972, [[Neil Young]] scored his only number one single with "[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]", from the album ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]''. Topping the charts in both the U.S. and Canada, this soft rock ballad featured backing vocals from [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]], heard near the end of the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/tp/Sound-Familiar-10-Famous-Cameos-That-May-Surprise-You.htm|title=Sound Familiar? 10 Famous Cameos That May Surprise You|last=Fortenot |first=Robert |website=about.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526050043/http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/tp/Sound-Familiar-10-Famous-Cameos-That-May-Surprise-You.htm|archive-date=May 26, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2020 }} #8 Neil Young's "Heart of Gold". "Musicians of the Los Angeles scene -- this time in the mellow '70s, when soft rock was king and El Lay was its epicenter."</ref>

In 1973, [[Paul McCartney and Wings]] had a U.S. number one with "[[My Love (Paul McCartney and Wings song)|My Love]]", which also reached No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary charts of both the U.S. and Canada.

===Mid- to late 1970s===

Soft rock reached its commercial peak in the mid- to late 1970s with acts such as [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[England Dan & John Ford Coley]], [[Air Supply]], [[Seals and Crofts]], [[America (band)|America]] and the reformed [[Fleetwood Mac]], whose ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.<ref>P. Buckley, ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 378.</ref> 

Denver station [[KYGO-FM#History|KIMN-FM]] introduced a "mellow rock" album format in 1975. "There's a Colorado music", program director Scott Kenyon told ''Billboard'' magazine, "[[Michael Martin Murphy|Michael Murphey's]] '[[Wildfire (Michael Martin Murphey song)|Wildfire]]' is a perfect example; it feels like Colorado, you can tell it came from this part of the country. There's a sound of the Rockies... the best description is mellow rock. Take that kind of music and make it into a Colorado sounding station."<ref>{{cite web|author=Pelton-Roby, Ruth|title="Colorado's Diverse Radio Scene"|publisher=Billboard|date=September 13, 1975|page=C-22|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1975/Billboard%25201975-09-13.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjB87LLov_mAhVaGDQIHWX1CtEQFjABegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw1ixqdOZoOIOxeaJPIgnDRF|website=Americanradiohistory.com}}</ref>

By 1977, some radio stations, notably New York's [[WKTU|WTFM]] and [[NBC]]-owned [[WQHT#WYNY (1978–1988)|WYNY]], had switched to an all-soft rock format.<ref>C. H. Sterling, M. C. Keith, ''Sounds of Change: a History of FM broadcasting in America'' (UNC Press, 2008), pp. 136–7.</ref> Chicago's [[WBBM-FM]] adopted a soft rock/album rock hybrid format in 1977 and was known as "Soft Rock 96" presenting the "Mellow sound of Chicago". Five years later, they would flip to a "Hot Hits" top 40 format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.classicb96.com/B96_History_Summarized|title=B96 History Summarized - CLASSICB96 Wiki|website=Wiki.classicb96.com}}</ref>

In the mid- to late 1970s, prominent soft rock acts included [[Billy Joel]], [[Elton John]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Boz Scaggs]], the [[Alessi Brothers]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[England Dan & John Ford Coley]], [[Paul Davis (singer)|Paul Davis]], [[Seals and Crofts]], [[Eric Carmen]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[the Alan Parsons Project]], [[Captain & Tennille]], [[the Hollies]], [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show|Dr. Hook]], [[America (band)|America]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]].

By the 1980s, tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change, including musical artists such as [[Journey (band)|Journey]].<ref name=SoftRockClassificationBBC>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11733277|title=Journey: The band who did not stop believing|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=December 6, 2010|date=November 12, 2010}}</ref>

A prominent counterpart of soft rock in the late 1970s and early 1980s came to be known as [[yacht rock]];<ref name="docksinNY">{{cite news |url=http://www.observer.com/node/52629 |newspaper=The New York Observer |title=Yacht Rock Docks in New York |first=William |last=Berlind |date=August 27, 2006 |access-date=July 29, 2008 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518083009/http://www.observer.com/node/52629|archive-date=May 18, 2011 }}</ref> its name coined in 2005 by the makers of the online video series ''[[Yacht Rock (web series)|Yacht Rock]]''. Originating from California's session musicians, yacht rock only partially overlapped with soft rock; it could include soft to mid-level (but rarely ever purely hard) rock.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0549/051207_music_talktalk.php |title= Talk Talk: J.D.

===1980s===
In the early 1980s, the radio format evolved into what came to be known as "[[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]" or "[[adult album alternative]]", a format that has less overt rock bias than its forebear radio categorization.<ref>C. H. Sterling, M. C. Keith, ''Sounds of Change: a History of FM Broadcasting in America'' (UNC Press, 2008), p. 187.</ref> In Los Angeles, [[KOST]] 103.5, under program director Jhani Kaye, debuted its soft adult contemporary format in November of 1982.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carney |first=Steve |date= November 14, 2007|title=It's been a smooth ride for KOST radio |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-14-et-kost14-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref> Although dance-oriented electronic pop and ballad-oriented rock dominated the 1980s, soft rock songs still enjoyed mild success from artists such as [[Sheena Easton]], [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[Dan Hill]], [[Gino Vannelli]], [[Leo Sayer]], [[Air Supply]], [[Julio Iglesias]] and [[Bertie Higgins]].

[[Chris Norman]], former lead singer of the band [[Smokie (band)|Smokie]], scored several hits between 1986–1988 in Europe, particularly in Germany, including "[[Some Hearts Are Diamonds (song)|Some Hearts Are Diamonds]]", "[[Broken Heroes]]" and "[[Midnight Lady]]", the latter reaching number one in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

===1990s===
Soft rock persisted in the 1990s, with artists from previous decades continuing to release new music, such as [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], whose 1992 soft rock single "[[Hold on My Heart]]"<ref>{{cite
