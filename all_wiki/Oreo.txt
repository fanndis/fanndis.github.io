'''Oreo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔːr|i|oʊ}}) is an American [[sandwich cookie]] consisting of two (usually chocolate) [[wafer]]s<!--Please get consensus on talk page before changing "wafer" to anything else.--> with a sweet [[Cream#Other items called "cream"|crème]] filling. Introduced on March 6, 1912, Oreo is the best selling cookie brand in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2005/562/?start=5|title=Top 10 Food Brands of 2005 |last=Toops |first=Diane |date=July 1, 2005 |publisher=www.foodprocessing.com |access-date=April 6, 2012|quote=In the enviable position of being the No. 1 selling cookie in America since its introduction in 1912, the Oreo, made by Nabisco, East Hanover, N.J., a brand of Kraft Foods, was a true innovation – two chocolate disks with a crème filling in between.}}</ref> As of 2018, the version sold in the U.S. is made by the [[Nabisco]] division of [[Mondelez International]].

Oreo cookies are available in over one hundred countries.<ref name="2017 Fact Sheet" />  Many varieties of Oreo cookies have been produced, and limited-edition runs have become popular in the 21st century.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name "''Oreo''" is unknown, but there are many hypotheses, including derivations from the French word ''or'', meaning 'gold', or from an Ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] root meaning 'mountain'.<ref name="Imponderables">{{Cite book |title=Why do clocks run clockwise? and other Imponderables |last=Feldman |first=David |publisher=Harper & Row Publishers |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-06-095463-5 |location=New York City |pages=173–174 |author-link=David Feldman (author)}}</ref> Others believe that the cookie was named Oreo simply because the name was short and easy to pronounce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/1910s/a/oreohistory.htm |title=History of the Oreo Cookie |publisher=About |access-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref> Another theory, proposed by food writer [[Stella Parks]], is that the name derives from the Latin ''[[Oreodaphne]]'', a genus of the [[Lauraceae|laurel]] family. She observes that the original design of the Oreo includes a laurel wreath; and the names of several of Nabisco's cookies at the time of the original Oreo had botanical derivations, including [[Avena]], [[Lotus (genus)|Lotus]], and Helicon (from ''[[Heliconia]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2017/08/history-of-oreos-bravetart-cookbook.html|title=How Oreos Got Their Name: The Rise of an American Icon|last=Parks|first=Stella|origyear=15 August 2017|date= 5 February 2019|website=|publisher=Serious Eats|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=BraveTart|last=Parks|first=Stella|publisher=W.

The Oreo Biscuit was renamed in 1921 to "Oreo Sandwich";<ref name="Imponderables" /> in 1948, the name was changed to "Oreo Crème Sandwich"; and in 1974 it became the "Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie",<ref name="Imponderables" /> the name that has remained to this day.

Another advertisement featured a "Hooded Menace" threatening to take over the DSRL, with Eli Manning and Stufy (the DSRL mascot) needing some help, which aired on September 14, 2010. Six days later, it was announced that [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Apolo Ohno]] had joined Oreo's DSRL veterans Eli Manning and Venus Williams.
[[File:Oreo pride poster.jpg|thumb|The 2012 rainbow Oreo advertisement supporting Pride month]]
In April 2011, Oreo announced its special edition Oreo cookies with blue crème to promote the 2011 3D computer-animated movie ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]''. The promotion included stickers inside each package of cookies. Two contests were also announced: by completing an album of stickers, consumers could win three movie passes and medium snack bar combos; and prize stickers could be found in winning packages, including a trip to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[backpacks]], cinema passes for a year, and [[Polarized 3D system|3D glasses]]. The promotion was available in [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]], and ended on May 30, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pe.promogana.net/2011/04/concurso-promo-oreo-gana-paquetes-de.html |title=Concurso Promo Oreo, gana paquetes de cine, viaje a Rio, mochilas y más |date=April 8, 2011 |publisher=Promogana |access-date=April 8, 2011}}</ref>

In June 2012, Oreo posted an advertisement displaying an Oreo cookie with rainbow colored crème to celebrate [[Gay pride#LGBT Pride Month|LGBT Pride month]];<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/06/26/oreo-unveils-rainbow-cookie-image-for-pride/ |title=Oreo unveils rainbow cookie image for Pride |last=Gray |first=Stephen |date=June 26, 2012 |publisher=[[Pink news]] |access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref> the cookie itself was fictional and was not being manufactured or made available for sale.

We feel the Oreo ad is a fun reflection of our values."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/26/kraft-oreo-gaypride-idUSL2E8HQH6120120626 |title=Rainbow-colored Oreo filled with controversy |date=June 26, 2012 |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref> This was followed during 2012 by a series of adverts commemorating other holidays and events, including a blue, white, and red crème Oreo to honor [[Bastille Day]], a stream of cookie crumbs marking the appearance of the [[Southern Delta Aquariids|Delta Aquariids]] [[meteor shower]], and a cookie with a jagged bite taken out of it to promote [[Shark Week]] on [[Discovery Channel]].

== International distribution ==
Oreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing channels. As their popularity continues to grow, so too does the amount of distribution that comes with it. According to the [[Kraft Foods Inc.|Kraft Foods]] company, the Oreo is the "World's Best Selling Cookie".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kraftfoodscompany.com/sitecollectiondocuments/pdf/Oreo_Global_Fact_Sheet_100th_Birthday_as_on_Jan_12_2012_FINAL.pdf |title=Oreo Global Fact Sheet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028094642/http://www.kraftfoodscompany.com/sitecollectiondocuments/pdf/Oreo_Global_Fact_Sheet_100th_Birthday_as_on_Jan_12_2012_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 28, 2013 |url-status = dead}}</ref> In March 2012, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine reported that Oreo cookies were available in more than 100 different countries. Overall, it is estimated that since the Oreo cookie's inception in 1912, over 450 billion Oreos have been produced worldwide.<ref name="100 years" />

''Oreo biscuits'' (as they are known in the United Kingdom) were first introduced into Britain through the supermarket chain [[Sainsbury's]]. For several years, this was the only supermarket chain in the UK to stock the Oreo – until May 2008, when Kraft decided to fully launch the Oreo across the whole of the UK. It was repackaged in the more familiar British tube design, accompanied by a [[£]]4.5M television advertising campaign based around the "twist, lick, [[Dunking (biscuit)|dunk]]" catchphrase.<ref name="BBCMay2008">{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7376123.stm |title=Can Oreo win over British biscuit lovers? |publisher=BBC News Magazine |date=May 2, 2008}}</ref>

In the UK, Kraft partnered with [[McDonald's]] to introduce the Oreo [[McFlurry#Desserts|McFlurry]] (which was already on sale in several other countries) into a number of McDonald's locations during its annual ''Great Tastes of America'' promotions; in October 2015, the Oreo McFlurry became a permanent menu item at McDonald's in the UK. An Oreo flavored "Krushem" drink was also on sale in [[KFC]] stores across Britain.

The ingredients of the British Oreo biscuit (as listed on the UK Oreo website) are slightly different from those of the US Oreo cookie. Unlike the US version, the British Oreo originally contained [[whey powder]], which was not suitable for people with [[lactose intolerance]]. Additionally, as the whey powder was sourced from cheese made with [[Rennet|calf rennet]], the British version was also unsuitable for [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nabiscoworld.com/Brands/ProductInformation.aspx?BrandKey=oreo&Site=1&Product=4400000820 |title=NabiscoWorld |date=January 1, 2006 |publisher=NabiscoWorld |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref> On December 6, 2011, Kraft announced that production of Oreo biscuits was to start in the UK – their Cadbury factory in [[Sheffield]], South Yorkshire, was selected to manufacture Oreo biscuits in Britain for the first time and production began there in May 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Article/2013/05/10/Food-manufacturing-giant-starts-UK-Oreos-production |title=Mondelēz starts UK manufacture of Oreos |date=May 9, 2013 |publisher=Food manufacture |language=en-GB |access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref>

Oreo cookies were introduced onto the Indian market by [[Cadbury#India|Cadbury India]] in 2011. The biscuit industry in [[India]] is estimated to be worth around 1.8 billion dollars.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/cadbury-enters-indian-biscuit-market-launches-oreo-brand/articleshow/7618573.cms |title=Cadbury enters Indian biscuit market, launches 'Oreo' brand |date=March 3, 2011 |via=The Economic Times}}</ref>

In Pakistan, Oreo is manufactured and sold by [[LU (biscuits)|Lefèvre-Utile]], also known as LU.

== Production ==

According to a statement from Kim McMiller, an Associate Director of Consumer Relations,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} a two-stage process is used to produce Oreo cookies. The base cake dough is formed into the familiar round cookies by a rotary mold at the entrance of a {{convert|300|ft|m|-long|adj=mid}} oven.

Most of the Oreo production was once carried out at the [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]] factory in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} By 2017, more than 40 billion Oreo cookies were being produced annually in 18 different countries around the world.<ref name="2017 Fact Sheet" /> Oreo cookies for the [[Asia]]n markets are manufactured in India, Indonesia, and China, with the exception of the [[Japan]]ese market where they are manufactured locally under the brand "[[Yamazaki Baking|Yamazaki]]-Nabisco". Oreo cookies for the [[Europe]]an market are made in [[Spain]]; they are made in [[Russia]] (Mondelēz Rus) for consumers in several [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS countries]]; and those sold in [[Australia]] are manufactured in Indonesia (previously China) or Spain, depending on the flavor. The version produced in Canada (sold under the Christie's brand) includes [[coconut oil]] and is sold exclusively in that region. Manufacture of Oreo biscuits began in [[Pakistan]] in early 2014, in collaboration with Mondelēz International of the United States and Continental Biscuits Limited (CBL) of Pakistan, at the CBL production plant in [[Sukkur]].

=== Oreo boycott ===

In 2015, Mondelēz announced its decision to close some of its American factories and [[offshoring|move production]] to [[economy of Mexico|Mexico]], prompting the [[Oreo boycott]].<ref name=inquirer>{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Oreo-maker-faces-billionaire-squeeze-labor-boycott-calls.html|title=Oreo sees support, but also backlash and boycott, for gay pride rainbow cookie |author=Joseph N.

One six-pack of Oreos contains 270 [[Food energy|calories]], hence there are 45 calories in one cookie. Of these 45 calories, 27 come from [[carbohydrate]]s, 16.5 come from [[fat]], and 1.5 calories are provided by [[protein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/303766-how-many-calories-are-in-one-oreo-cookie/|title=How Many Calories Are in One Oreo Cookie?|first=Dakota|last=Karratti|publisher=livestrong.com|date=October 3, 2017|access-date=May 8, 2018}}</ref>

Different Oreo flavors have varying amounts of carbohydrate: the chocolate fudge Oreo contains 13g of total carbohydrates (4% of the [[Reference Daily Intake|recommended daily intake]]) and 9g of sugars per serving of 3 cookies, while mint Oreos contain 25g of total carbohydrates and 18g of sugars per serving.

[[File:Nabisco-Oreo-Minis.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Oreo Minis]]
*''Oreo Mini'' – First introduced in 1991,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/24/business/rjr-nabisco-reports-neet-of-123-million-in-3d-quarter.html |title=RJR Nabisco Reports Neet Of $123 Million in 3d Quarter |last=Foltz |first=Kim |date=October 24, 1991 |access-date=March 2, 2011 |publisher=Nytimes.com}}</ref> these are miniature bite-sized versions of the original Oreo cookie. After being discontinued in the late 1990s, they were re-released in 2000 along with the redesigned 2001 [[Dodge Caravan]] minivan as part of a promotional tie-in with [[Daimler AG]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28159731_ITM |title=New Mini Oreos Debut in New Mini Van |date=August 10, 2000 |work=PR Newswire}}</ref> Their packaging in the 1990s consisted of a "miniaturized" version of the full-sized cardboard tray and box used in Oreo packaging at the time. Their revised packaging consists of an aluminum foil bag.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} ''Oreo Minis'' are available with various flavors of crème filling including original, chocolate, strawberry, and the new mint flavor which debuted in 2015. As well as the bagged version, they are also sold in Nabisco To-Go Cups, lidded plastic cups which fit into car cup-holders (in line with other Nabisco snacks that come in miniature form, such as Nutter Butters). A ''Golden Oreo Mini'' was also made available after the ''Golden Oreo'' was released in 2004. According to the Oreo website, the slogan of the ''Oreo Mini'' is "Grab 'em. Pop 'em. Love 'em."
* ''Mega Stuf Oreo'' – Released in February 2013, the ''Mega Stuf'' variety is similar to ''Double Stuf'', but with even more white crème filling. They come in both chocolate and golden wafer varieties.
* ''Oreo Thins'' – Introduced in July 2015, this is a thin version of the original Oreo cookie. ''Thins'' come in both chocolate and golden wafer varieties, with various crème filling flavors including chocolate, mint, lemon and tiramisu. Each cookie contains only 40 calories; they are 66% thinner than the original version.
* ''Chocolate Oreo'' – Simply an Oreo cookie with chocolate crème filling instead of the original vanilla flavored white crème filling.<!--Introduced 2011-->
* ''Mint Oreo'' – A variety of Oreo with two chocolate wafers separated by a mint flavored crème filling.<!--Introduced when?-->
* ''The Most Stuf'' – Introduced in January 2019, a limited edition Oreo with approximately four times the amount of crème filling of a standard Oreo.

Special edition ''Double Stuf Oreo'' cookies are produced during springtime, and around [[Halloween]] and [[Christmas]]. These have colored frosting reflecting the current holiday: blue or yellow for springtime; orange for Halloween; and red or green for the Christmas holiday. One side of each seasonal cookie is stamped with an appropriate design; the spring cookies feature flowers, butterflies, etc., while the Halloween editions feature a jack o'lantern, ghost, cat, flock of bats, and broom-riding witch.<!--What designs are featured on the Christmas ones?--> The 2017 ''Halloween Oreo'' broke with this tradition, having orange-colored crème filling (albeit with classic vanilla flavor) but carrying no seasonal designs.

In some countries, Oreos come in a variety of flavors that are not familiar to the U.S. market. For example, ''Green Tea Oreos'' are only available in China and Japan, while ''Lemon Ice Oreos'' were only ever introduced in Japan. Additionally, there are [[alfajor]] Oreo cookies available in Argentina, composed of three Oreo cookies with vanilla filling between each, and covered in chocolate.

=== Limited editions ===
[[File:Mr. Christie, you definitely make good cookies! (2523264708).jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a golden Oreo cookie wafer]]
Beginning in the early 2010s, Nabisco began releasing [[Limited edition candy|limited edition]] runs of cookies with more exotic flavors. These "limited editions" typically appear in stores for a short period and are then discontinued, although some varieties have since resurfaced, for example: ''Reese's Oreos'' returned for a second limited run after they were first introduced for a limited period in 2014; and ''Birthday Cake Oreos'', originally introduced in 2012, have since become permanently available.<ref name="List">{{cite web |url=http://www.glamour.com/story/special-oreos-flavors-limited-edition |title=A Comprehensive List of Every Special Oreo Flavor, Ever |last=Clinton |first=Leah Melby |date=June 17, 2015 |publisher=Glamour |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Some limited editions are only made available at certain retailers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foodbeast.com/news/blueberry-oreos-fruity-crisps/ |title=NEW OREO FLAVORS: Blueberry Pie & Fruity Crisps |last=Ayerouth |first=Elie |date=May 26, 2016 |publisher=foodbeast.com |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref>

Limited edition runs usually feature a crème filling that has been flavored to replicate the taste of a specific fruit or dessert, from familiar flavors such as [[lemon]] or [[Mentha|mint]], to the more specific and unusual flavors of [[blueberry pie]] or [[red velvet cake]]. They may also incorporate different varieties of cookie wafer, for example ''Cinnamon-Bun Oreos'' featured [[cinnamon]] flavored cookies and "frosting flavored crème". In recent years, some limited editions have paired Oreos with other recognizable [[confectionery]] brands, including [[Reese's Peanut Butter Cups|Reese's]], [[Swedish Fish]], and [[Peeps]].

Some examples of limited edition Oreos are:
* ''Birthday Cake Oreo'' – A limited edition, available from February to July 2012, to celebrate Oreo's 100th birthday. Made up of two chocolate Oreo cookies with a [[birthday cake]] flavored crème filling and sprinkles inside. On one of the two cookies, the traditional design was replaced with a birthday candle and the words "OREO 100". The birthday cake flavor has since been reintroduced, with a "double stuf" amount of crème filling, in both chocolate and golden Oreo varieties, except that the cookies no longer display the "OREO 100" print.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.snackworks.com/search/product-results.aspx?searchText=oreo+birthday+cake |title=Product Search Results – Snackworks |publisher=Snackworks |access-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

==Naming controversy==
Oreo cookies, due to their almost-black cookies and white filling, have often been used in popular culture as a metaphor for relations between [[people of color]] and [[white people]]. In the 1976 movie ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', [[Barbra Streisand]]'s character Esther Hoffman is the white central member of The Oreos, a three-girl singing group, between black actresses [[Venetta Fields]] and [[Clydie King]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Keegan |first1=Rebecca |title=Why Every Era Gets the A Star Is Born It Deserves |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/why-every-etra-gets-the-a-star-is-born-it-deserves |work=Vanity Fair |language=en-us |date=30 August 2013}}</ref>
