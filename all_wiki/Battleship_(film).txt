'''''Battleship''''' is a 2012 American [[military science fiction]] [[action film]] that is loosely based on the [[board game]] [[Battleship (game)|of the same name]]. The film was directed by [[Peter Berg]] and stars [[Alexander Skarsgård]], [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Brooklyn Decker]], [[Rihanna]], [[Tadanobu Asano]], and [[Liam Neeson]]. Filming took place in [[Hawaii]] and on {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}. In the film, the crews of a small group of warships are forced to battle against a naval fleet of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial origin]] in order to thwart their destructive goals.

''Battleship'' premiered in Tokyo on April 3, 2012, and received a wide release by [[Universal Pictures]] on May 18, 2012. It received mixed reviews and was a [[Box-office bomb|financial disappointment]], making $65 million in North America against its  gross of $303 million worldwide.

==Plot==
In 2005, a planet designated "Planet G" is discovered to be a potentially [[Habitable zone|habitable planet]] with conditions similar to Earth and a communications array is built by [[NASA]] in [[Hawaii]] a year later, designed to send transmissions to the planet to establish contact with any [[Extraterrestrial life|intelligent life]]. Meanwhile, Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Sam Shane, the daughter of [[Admiral]] Terrance Shane. His brother, [[Commander]] Stone Hopper, forces Alex to join the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in order to improve his life.

In 2012, Alex and Sam are in a relationship; Alex serves as a Tactical Actions Officer as a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] aboard {{USS|John Paul Jones|DDG-53|6}} while Stone is the commanding officer of {{USS|Sampson|DDG-102|6}}, but Alex is in danger of receiving a disciplinary [[military discharge|discharge]]. During the [[Exercise RIMPAC#RIMPAC 2012|2012 RIMPAC exercise]], five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship is damaged upon colliding with a satellite and crashes in [[Hong Kong]] causing many deaths while the other four plunge into the waters off Hawaii. ''Sampson'', ''John Paul Jones'', and Japanese destroyer [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JDS]] {{ship|JDS|Myōkō||2}} are ordered by Admiral Shane to investigate, and they discover a floating structure. When Alex touches it, it generates a [[force shield|force field]] that encloses the Hawaiian Islands, isolating them and the three destroyers from the rest of the world, while jamming all radar and communications in it. Three alien warships surface and in a resultant engagement, the ''Myōkō'' is destroyed, the ''Sampson'' is lost with all hands including Stone, and the command crew of ''John Paul Jones'' are killed, with Alex, the next senior officer, reluctantly assuming command. The fight is ended when ''John Paul Jones'' disengages to recover the survivors from ''Myōkō'' including its commanding officer, Captain Yugi Nagata, whom Alex began a rivalry with after he inadvertently kicked Alex in the face during a soccer match earlier. The aliens launch drones designed to cause heavy damage to attack Hawaii.

On Oahu, Sam is accompanying retired [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[lieutenant colonel]] and double amputee Mick Canales on a mountain hike. After becoming aware of the aliens' presence, they encounter scientist Cal Zapata who informs them the aliens have taken over the communications array, and Mick determines they are planning to use it to re-establish military communications with their home planet. Aboard ''John Paul Jones'', naval personnel capture a semi-conscious alien, which forms a telepathic link with Alex, showing him their history of destroying worlds. Other aliens arrive and retrieve their comrade, but Alex leads a team to prevent one who stayed behind from sabotaging the ship. He lures the alien into the line of fire of the destroyer’s [[5-inch gun]], which Raikes uses to obliterate the alien. Examination of the captured alien's helmet reveals the aliens are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Nick and Zapata recover his [[spectrum analyzer]] from the aliens and use it to radio ''John Paul Jones'' to inform them the aliens intend military telecommunication with their home planet in four hours.

As night falls Captain Nagata suggests a strategy of using the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warning buoys]] around Hawaii to track the alien warships without radar. This allows ''John Paul Jones'' to destroy two of them. They lure the remaining warship eastwards at dawn, as Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows, blinding its crew and allowing ''John Paul Jones'' to destroy it before the drones sink the American ship.

The survivors return to Pearl Harbor and commandeer the previously decommissioned World War II [[battleship]] {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} with the aid of the retired veterans preserving her, restoring her to battle readiness. Going to the communications array, they are confronted by the floating structure, revealed to be a giant mothership. ''Missouri'' is able to severely damage the mothership and disable the force field, and Admiral Shane immediately summons fighter jets from aircraft carrier {{USS|Ronald Reagan|CVN-76|6}}. Meanwhile, Sam, Mick and Cal attempt to stall the aliens at the communications array. Alex chooses to use the ''Missouri'''s last shell to destroy the communications array, rendering the ''Missouri'' defenseless from drones launched by the foundering mothership. Just before impact, the drones are destroyed by [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F/A-18]] fighter jets which then finish off the mothership, saving ''Missouri'' and eliminating the alien threat.

A ceremony is held to honor the military personnel, where Alex is promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] and presented with a [[Silver Star]] and his brother's posthumous [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. Admiral Shane promises Alex will soon have a ship of his own while he is also offered a chance to become a Navy SEAL. After the ceremony, Alex asks Sam's father Admiral Shane for her hand in marriage. The admiral refuses, but shortly thereafter invites Alex to lunch to discuss the matter.

In a [[post-credits scene]], three teenagers and a [[handyman]] in Scotland discover a crashed alien pod. When they open it, an alien hand reaches out, and they run off in terror.

''Battleship'' was to begin filming in [[Australia]]'s [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in 2010, but the production company changed location due to a lack of Australian government tax incentives and a high estimated budget of $220 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/03/27/202331_gold-coast-news.html |title=$100m Film Deal Sunk |publisher=goldcoast.com.au |date=March 27, 2010 |access-date=July 10, 2010}}</ref>

The film marks the reunion between former co-stars Kitsch and Jesse Plemons, who previously worked together on Berg's television series ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]''.

Due to his success with the ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' franchise, composer [[Steve Jablonsky]] was chosen to score the official soundtrack. The soundtrack features original compositions from Jablonsky and features rock guitarist [[Tom Morello]] from [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Director Peter Berg stated:

{{quote|Working with composers often is a really frustrating experience because you speak a different language and, oftentimes, they take two or three jobs, at the same time. They're difficult and pretentious and they're tormented artists. I'm not going to name names, but most of them are. One guy who isn't is [[Hans Zimmer]], who taught Steve Jablonsky. We had a couple of meetings and I came up with this idea. The day I met with him, I had had an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] for my neck, and they make that really scary sound. I was like, 'I just had this MRI, and when I was in there, I was thinking about the aliens, and it was really scary.' And he was like, 'Oh, that's awesome!' He went and recorded MRIs and made music out of MRIs, and that's the theme of the aliens in our film. He is no drama, and just goes and gets it done. The score is big and awesome and scary and driving. At times, it's very simple and acoustic and touching and emotional. He's the best I've ever worked with.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/brooklyn-decker-peter-berg-battleship-interview/153633/ |title=Brooklyn Decker and Director Peter Berg Talk BATTLESHIP, Naval Warfare and the Design of the Aliens at WonderCon |website=Collider |date=March 19, 2012 |access-date=May 1, 2012}}</ref>}}

===Critical reception===
[[Metacritic]] has given the film an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 39 reviews meaning "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/battleship |title=Battleship |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date= January 14, 2014 | quote = Mixed or average reviews }}</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 34% based on reviews from 221 critics, with a rating average of 4.59/10. The site's consensus reads: "It may offer energetic escapism for less demanding filmgoers, but ''Battleship'' is too loud, poorly written, and formulaic to justify its expense -- and a lot less fun than its source material."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battleship/ |title=Battleship  |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]  |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>

Megan Lehmann of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' thought that the "impressive visual effects and director [[Peter Berg]]'s epic set pieces fight against an armada of cinematic clichés and some truly awful dialogue."<ref name=Lehmann>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/film-review-battleship-310991 |title=Battleship: Film Review |last=Lehmann |first=Megan |date=April 11, 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=April 18, 2012}}</ref> [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]]'s Nick de Semlyen felt there was a lack of character development and memorable action shots, and sums up his review of the movie in one word: "Miss."<ref name=deSemlyen>{{cite news|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=136712 |title=Empire's Battleship Movie Review |last=de Semlyen |first=Nick |publisher=[[Empire Magazine]] |access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>

Many reviews criticised the "based on a board game" concept driving the film, although some, such as Jason Di Rosso from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[Radio National]], claimed the ridiculousness of the setup is "either sheer joy or pure hell – depending on how seriously you take it", while de Semlyen "had to admire [the film's creators] jumping through hoops to engineer a sequence that replicates the board game."<ref name=deSemlyen/><ref name=Hardie/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/movietime/battleship/3946780 |title=Battleship |last=Di Rosso |first=Jason |date=April 12, 2012 |work=MovieTime|publisher=[[Radio National]] ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|access-date=April 18, 2012}}</ref> Several compared the film to [[Michael Bay]]'s ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' film series in terms of quality and cinematic style, with Giles Hardie of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' claiming that the movie "finds the same balance between action-packed imagination and not taking the premise seriously that made Michael Bay's original ''Transformers'' such a joyride."<ref name=Lehmann/><ref name=Hardie>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/realism-sinks-without-a-trace-but-guns-aliens-and-rihanna-triumph-20120411-1ws3c.html |title=Battleship movie review |last=Hardie |first=Giles |date=April 12, 2012 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=April 18, 2012}}</ref> Andrew Harrison of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine called the film "crushingly stupid".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://news.qthemusic.com/2012/04/film_review_-_battleship_this.html|access-date=April 30, 2012|date=April 11, 2012|title=Film review – Battleship: This brainless Rihanna vehicle deserves to be scuttled without delay|author=Andrew Harrison|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419205145/http://news.qthemusic.com/2012/04/film_review_-_battleship_this.html|archive-date=April 19, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Film critic Kenneth Turan, in a review written for the ''Los Angeles Times'', also expressed disappointment, criticizing the film's "humanoid aliens", stating that they are "as ungainly as the movie itself, clunking around in awkward, protective suits." He called the content "all very earnest", but added "it's not a whole lot of fun".<ref>{{cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Movie review: Aliens can have this 'Battleship'|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-battleship-20120518,0,6752668.story|newspaper=L.A.

Other critics were less harsh for ''Battleship'': Writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Steven James Snyder was somewhat positive because he had low expectations of the film. He wrote, "The creative team behind this ocean-bound thriller decided to fill the narrative black hole with a few ingredients all but absent from today’s summer tent poles – namely mystery, nostalgia and a healthy dose of humility" and described it as "an unlikely mix of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''".<ref>{{cite web|title=Battleship: More Fun Than a Board Game Blockbuster Has Any Right to Be|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/17/battleship-more-fun-than-a-board-game-blockbuster-has-any-right-to-be/#ixzz1vA22YnP7|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=May 18, 2012|author=Steven James Snyder|date=May 17, 2012}}</ref> Giving it a C+ grade, Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "For every line of howler dialogue that should have been sunk, there's a nice little scene in which humans have to make a difficult decision.
