According to the organization's website, "the Monitor's global approach is reflected in how Mary Baker Eddy described its object as 'To injure no man, but to bless all mankind.' The aim is to embrace the human family, shedding light with the conviction that understanding the world's problems and possibilities moves us towards solutions." ''The Christian Science Monitor'' has won seven [[Pulitzer Prizes]] and more than a dozen [[Overseas Press Club|Overseas Press Club awards]].<ref name="AboutCSM">{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/About|title=About the Monitor|last=|first=|date=|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=February 5, 2007}}</ref>

== Reporting ==
Despite its name, the ''Monitor'' is not a religious-themed paper, and does not promote the [[doctrine]] of its patron church. However, at its founder Eddy's request, a daily religious article has appeared near the end of every issue of the ''Monitor''.

The paper has been known for avoiding [[sensationalism]], producing a "distinctive brand of nonhysterical journalism".<ref name="beam">{{Cite news|author=Alex Beam|periodical=[[The Boston Globe]]|title=Appealing to a higher authority|date=June 9, 2005|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2005/06/09/appealing_to_a_higher_authority/|access-date=May 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908040220/http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2005/06/09/appealing_to_a_higher_authority/|archive-date=September 8, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="askt">{{cite news|author=Daniel Akst |work=Carnegie Reporter |date=Fall 2005 |url=http://carnegie.org/publications/carnegie-reporter/single/view/article/item/138/ |title=Nonprofit Journalism: Removing the Pressure of the Bottom Line |publisher=[[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] |accessdate=January 10, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311110221/http://carnegie.org/publications/carnegie-reporter/single/view/article/item/138/ |archivedate=March 11, 2015 }}</ref> In 1997, the ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', a publication critical of United States policy in the Middle East, praised the ''Monitor'' for its objective and informative coverage of Islam and the Middle East.<ref name="curtiss">{{cite news|title=As U.S. Media Ownership Shrinks, Who Covers Islam?|url=http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/190-washington-report-archives-1994-1999/december-1997/2775-media-watch-as-us-media-ownership-shrinks-who-covers-islam-.html|author=Richard Curtiss|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=December 1997|accessdate=January 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427111113/http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/190-washington-report-archives-1994-1999/december-1997/2775-media-watch-as-us-media-ownership-shrinks-who-covers-islam-.html|archive-date=April 27, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Jill Carroll]], a freelance reporter for the ''Monitor'', was kidnapped in Baghdad, and released safely after 82 days. Although Carroll was initially a freelancer, the paper worked tirelessly for her release, even hiring her as a staff writer shortly after her abduction to ensure that she had financial benefits.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/04/02/carroll.hostage/|title=Carroll Reunites with family|work=[[CNN]] World|date=April 2, 2006|accessdate=January 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912215403/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/04/02/carroll.hostage/|archive-date=September 12, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Beginning in August 2006, the ''Monitor'' published an account<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/specials/carroll/index.html|title=Hostage: The Jill Carroll Story|author=Jill Carroll| work=Christian Science Monitor|date=August 14, 2006|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}</ref> of Carroll's kidnapping and subsequent release, with first-person reporting from Carroll and others involved.

== Circulation ==
The paper's overall circulation has ranged widely, from a peak of over 223,000 in 1970, to just under 56,000 shortly before the suspension of the daily print edition in 2009.<ref name=Fine>[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-10-28/the-christian-science-monitor-to-become-a-weeklybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910234126/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-10-28/the-christian-science-monitor-to-become-a-weeklybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |date=September 10, 2013 }}, Bloomberg Businessweek, October 28, 2008.</ref> Partially in response to declining circulation and the struggle to earn a profit, the church's directors and the manager of the [[Christian Science Publishing Society]] were purportedly forced to plan cutbacks and closures (later denied), which led in 1989 to the mass protest resignations by its chief editor [[Kay Fanning]] (an [[American Society of Newspaper Editors|ASNE]] president and former editor of the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]''), managing editor David Anable, associate editor David Winder, and several other newsroom staff. These developments also presaged administrative moves to scale back the print newspaper in favor of expansions into radio, a magazine, shortwave broadcasting, and television. Expenses, however, rapidly outpaced revenues, contradicting predictions by church directors. On the brink of bankruptcy, the board was forced to close the broadcast programs in 1992.

By late 2011, the ''Monitor'' was receiving an average of about 22 million hits per month on their website, slightly below the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name="Collins">{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Keith S. |title=The Christian Science Monitor: Its History, Mission, and People |date=2012 |publisher=Nebbadoon Press |isbn=978-1-891331-27-5}}</ref>
In 2017 the ''Monitor'' put up a paywall on its content; in 2018 it had approximately 10,000 subscriptions to its ''Monitor Daily'' email service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/05/the-christian-science-monitors-new-paid-daily-product-is-aiming-for-10000-subscribers-in-a-year/|title=The Christian Science Monitor's new paid, daily product is aiming for 10,000 subscribers in a year|website=Nieman Lab|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The ''Monitor''<nowiki/>'s inception was, in part, a response by its founder [[Mary Baker Eddy]] to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy. In addition, [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s ''[[New York World]]'' was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in ''[[McClure's]]'', furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.<ref name=AboutCSM /> Eddy also required the inclusion of "[[Christian Science]]" in the paper's name, over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a [[secular]] audience.<ref name=AboutCSM />

Eddy also saw a vital need to counteract the fear often spread by media reporting: <blockquote>Looking over the newspapers of the day, one naturally reflects that it is dangerous to live, so loaded with disease seems the very air. These descriptions carry fears to many minds, to be depicted in some future time upon the body. A periodical of our own will counteract to some extent this public nuisance; for through our paper, at the price at which we shall issue it, we shall be able to reach many homes with healing, purifying thought.<ref>Mary Baker Eddy, Miscellaneous Writings 7:17–24</ref></blockquote>Eddy declared that the ''Monitor''<nowiki/>'s mission should be "to injure no man, but to bless all mankind".<ref name="AboutCSM" />

=== Radio and television ===
MonitoRadio was a radio service produced by the [[Church of Christ, Scientist]] between 1984 and 1997. It featured several one-hour news broadcasts a day, as well as top of the hour news bulletins. The service was widely heard on [[public radio]] stations throughout the United States. The Monitor later launched an international broadcast over [[shortwave]] radio, called the World Service of the Christian Science Monitor. Weekdays were news-led, but weekend schedules were exclusively dedicated to religious programming. That service ceased operations on June 28, 1997.<ref name=MtN>{{cite book|title=Monitoring the News|publisher = M.E. Sharpe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__h9qS3s8nIC&q=monitoring+the+news|first=Susan|last=Bridge|isbn=0-7656-0315-2|year=1998}}</ref>

In 1986, the Monitor started producing a current affairs television series, ''The Christian Science Monitor Reports,'' which was distributed via syndication to television stations across the United States.  In 1988, the Christian Science Monitor Reports won a [[Peabody Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Peabody Awards "Islam in Turmoil"|url=http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/details.php?id=515 |access-date=April 10, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611122935/http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/details.php?id=515|archive-date=June 11, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> for a series of reports on Islamic fundamentalism.  That same year, the program was canceled and the Monitor created a daily television program, ''World Monitor'', anchored by former NBC correspondent John Hart, which was initially shown on the Discovery Channel. In 1991, World Monitor moved to the Monitor Channel, a 24-hour news and information channel.<ref name=MtN /> The channel launched on May 1, 1991 with programming from its Boston TV station.<ref name="bc">{{cite journal|title=Monitoring the 'Monitor'|journal=Broadcasting|date=December 31, 1990 |volume=119 |issue=27 |page=64 |url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1990/BC-1990-12-30.pdf|accessdate=April 6, 2017}}</ref> The only religious programming on the channel was a five-minute Christian Science program early each morning.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Deadline for Monitor Channel|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/business/the-media-business-new-deadline-for-monitor-channel.html|first=Seth, Jr.|last=Faison|date=April 6, 1992|page=D7 |access-date=February 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402222416/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/06/business/the-media-business-new-deadline-for-monitor-channel.html|archive-date=April 2, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1992, after eleven months on the air, the service was shut down amid huge financial losses.<ref>{{cite news|first=James L.|last=Franklin|date=April 24, 1994|page=28| title=Monitor Channel is missed|work=Boston Globe|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8276321.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121025081210/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8276321.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= October 25, 2012}}</ref> Programming from the Monitor Channel was also carried nationally via the [[WWOR EMI Service]] (a nationally oriented feed of New Jersey TV station [[WWOR-TV]], launched in 1990 due to the [[Syndication exclusivity|SyndEx]] laws put into place the year prior).

=== Modernization ===
The print edition continued to struggle for readership, and, in 2004, faced a renewed mandate from the church to earn a profit. Subsequently, the ''Monitor'' began relying more on the Internet as an integral part of its business model. The ''Monitor'' was one of the first newspapers to put its text online in 1996, and was also one of the first to launch a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] edition in 2001. It was also an early pioneer of [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds.<ref>{{Cite conference|last=Gill|first=K.

In 2005, [[Richard Bergenheim]], a [[Christian Science practitioner]], was named the new editor. Shortly before his death in 2008, Bergenheim was replaced by a veteran ''[[Boston Globe]]'' editor and former ''Monitor'' reporter [[John Yemma]].<ref name="yemma">{{cite web|first=David|last=Cook|title=John Yemma named Monitor editor|work=The Christian Science Monitor|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0609/p25s08-usgn.html|accessdate=January 30, 2013|date=June 9, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503181725/http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0609/p25s08-usgn.html|archive-date=May 3, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In October 2008, citing net losses of $US18.9 million per year versus $US12.5 million in annual revenue, the ''Monitor'' announced that it would cease printing daily and instead print weekly editions starting in April 2009.<ref name="fine">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-10-28/the-christian-science-monitor-to-become-a-weeklybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=The Christian Science Monitor to Become a Weekly|last=Fine|first=Jon|date=October 28, 2008|work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=January 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310234601/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-10-28/the-christian-science-monitor-to-become-a-weeklybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|archive-date=March 10, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="clifford">{{cite news|title=Christian Science Paper to End Daily Print Edition|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29paper.html?bl&ex=1225425600&en=63df0ce22e52f090&ei=5087%0A|accessdate=October 28, 2008|first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|date=October 28, 2008|page=B8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417082329/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29paper.html?bl&ex=1225425600&en=63df0ce22e52f090&ei=5087%0A|archive-date=April 17, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The last daily print edition was published on March 27, 2009.
