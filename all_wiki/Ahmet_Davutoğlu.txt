'''Ahmet Davutoğlu''' ({{IPA-tr|ahˈmet davuˈtoːɫu|tr|Ahmet_Davutoglu,_Turkish_pronunciation.ogg}}; born 26 February 1959) is a Turkish academic, politician and former diplomat who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|26th]] [[Prime Minister of Turkey]] and Leader of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) from 2014 to 2016. He previously served as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 2009 to 2014 and chief advisor to Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] from 2003 to 2009. He was elected as an AKP Member of Parliament for [[Konya]] in the [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]] and was reelected as an MP in both the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June]] and [[November 2015 Turkish general election|November 2015]] general elections. He resigned as Prime Minister on 22 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://researchturkey.org/pm-ahmet-davutoglu-announces-resignation/|title=PM Ahmet Davutoğlu Announces Resignation|work=Research Turkey|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>

Following the election of serving Prime Minister and AKP Leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as the [[List of Presidents of Turkey|12th]] [[President of Turkey]], Davutoğlu was announced by the AKP Central Executive Committee as a candidate for the party leadership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/erdogan_yeni_basbakani_acikliyor-1208245|title=Erdogan: AK Parti'nin yeni genel baskan adayi Ahmet Davutoglu|publisher=Radikal|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="TurkeyPM">{{cite news|title=Turkey chooses Ahmet Davutoglu as prime minister|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/27/turkey-foreign-minister-ahmet-davutoglu-succeed-erdogan|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> He was unanimously elected as leader during the [[2014 Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|first AKP extraordinary congress]] and consequently succeeded Erdoğan as prime minister, forming the [[Cabinet Davutoğlu I|62nd Government of the Turkish Republic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internethaber.com/ak-partide-tarihi-kongre-basladi-canli-yayin-714459h.htm|title=Erdoğan ve Davutoğlu kan ter içinde kaldı – AK Parti kongresi|publisher=İnternet Haber|accessdate=27 August 2014|date=27 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Akşam">{{cite web|url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/siyaset/tarihi-kongrede-ahmet-davutoglu-genel-baskan-secildi/haber-334404|title=Tarihi kongrede Ahmet Davutoğlu Genel Başkan seçildi|publisher=Akşam|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> His cabinet was dominated by Erdoğan's close allies such as [[Yalçın Akdoğan]]; this led to speculation that he would take a docile approach as prime minister while Erdoğan continued to pursue his own political agenda as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-turkish-cabinet-shows-continuity-with-erdogan-legacy-1409312847|title=New Turkish Cabinet Shows Continuity With Erdogan Legacy|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="Fox News">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/21/turkey-davutoglu-expected-to-be-docile-prime-minister-with-erdogan-calling/|title=Turkey's Davutoglu expected to be a docile prime minister _ with Erdogan calling the shots|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> The AKP lost its parliamentary majority in the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]], though it remained the largest party. Davutoğlu's government subsequently resigned but stayed in power until a new government could be formed.

The AKP regained its parliamentary majority in November after a landslide victory, with Davutoğlu subsequently forming [[Cabinet Davutoğlu III|his third government]].

Following a [[Pelican files|deterioration in relations between Davutoğlu and Erdoğan]] over their disagreements regarding parliamentary candidate lists, government policy and the implementation of an executive presidential system of government, Davutoğlu announced his resignation as AKP leader and Prime Minister seven months after his November 2015 general election victory.

Davutoğlu's administration oversaw an [[2015 PKK rebellion|escalation of conflict]] between the government and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) after a [[Solution process|two-year ceasefire]] broke down in mid-2015, with his premiership being described as the 'bloodiest' in Turkey's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/video/turkiye/sezgin-tanrikulundan-helallik-aciklamasi|title=Sezgin Tanrıkulu'ndan ''helallik'' açıklaması|work=CNN Türk}}</ref> His government originally [[Operation Martyr Yalçın|authorised airstrikes]] against both PKK and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) positions on 20 July after [[2015 Suruç bombing|a suicide bombing killed 32 people]] in the southeastern town of [[Suruç]]. The government's [[Turkey–ISIL conflict|offensive against ISIL]] suffered sustained criticism by allies such as the United States over Turkey's lack of action against the group, though the political opposition accused Davutoğlu of sparking the conflict deliberately to win back votes and regain a parliamentary majority in the November 2015 snap election. His government also presided over the [[Turkish government – Gülen Movement conflict|ongoing political conflict]] with the [[Gülen Movement]] and the [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|spillover effects]] of the [[Syrian Civil War]] across the [[Syrian-Turkish border|border with Turkey]], as well as the [[European migrant crisis]] that emerged as a result. Although his foreign policy outlook has been described as [[Neo-Ottomanism|Neo-Ottoman]] or [[Pan-Islamist]], Davutoğlu made Turkey's [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|accession bid]] to the [[European Union]] a strategic target for his government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dışişleri Bakanı Davutoğlu AB üyeliği yarım asırdır stratejik hedefimiz oldu ve böyle kalmaya devam edecek|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/disisleri-bakani-davutoglu-_ab-uyeligi-yarim-asirdir-stratejik-hedefimiz-oldu-ve-boyle-kalmaya-devam-edecek.tr.mfa|publisher=Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=1 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026014747/http://www.mfa.gov.tr/disisleri-bakani-davutoglu-_ab-uyeligi-yarim-asirdir-stratejik-hedefimiz-oldu-ve-boyle-kalmaya-devam-edecek.tr.mfa|archive-date=26 October 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Incoming Turkish prime minister says EU membership strategic target source: Reuters|url=https://news.yahoo.com/incoming-turkish-prime-minister-says-eu-membership-strategic-125256543.html |publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> He has been criticised for failing to tackle [[Corruption in Turkey|political corruption]] and for growing government [[authoritarianism]], with a new national security bill in early 2015 causing opposition commentators to accuse his government of turning Turkey into a [[police state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/critics-legislation-turkey-police-state/2495367.html|title=Critics: Proposed Legislation Turns Turkey Into Police State|work=VOA|access-date=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627044818/http://www.voanews.com/content/critics-legislation-turkey-police-state/2495367.html|archive-date=27 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In September 2019, having long been speculated to be preparing to launch his own party, Davutoğlu resigned from the AKP and accused his former party of no longer being able to provide solutions for Turkey. On 12 December 2019, he launched the [[Future Party (Turkey)|Future Party]] and became its first leader.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Yildiz|first=Andrew Wilks,Murat|title=Turkey: Former PM and Erdogan ally launches new party|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/13/turkey-former-pm-and-erdogan-ally-launches-new-party|access-date=2020-10-26|website=www.aljazeera.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Life and early career==
[[File:MSC 2014 Davutoglu Mueller MSC2014.jpg|thumb|left|Davutoğlu at the 50th [[Munich Security Conference]] in 2014]]

Ahmet Davutoğlu was born in [[Taşkent]], Konya, Turkey. He graduated from [[İstanbul Erkek Lisesi]], which is a ''Deutsche Auslandsschule'' (German International School) and studied at the Department of Economics and Political Science of the [[Boğaziçi University]], İstanbul. He holds a master's degree in [[Public Administration]] and a PhD degree in [[Political Science]] and [[International Relations]] from [[Boğaziçi University]]. Between 1993 and 1996 Davutoğlu taught Political Sciences at [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]. From 1996 to 1999 he worked at [[Marmara University]] and became a full professor in 1999. He was the chairman of the Department of International Relations at [[Beykent University]] in [[Istanbul]]. Between 1995 and 1999 he wrote weekly columns for Turkish daily newspaper ''[[Yeni Şafak]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yenisafak.com.tr/yazarlar/AhmetDavuto%C4%9Flu/Yazar-Arsiv/|title=Yazarın Tüm Yazıları|author=Piri Medya|work=Yeni Şafak}}</ref>

Davutoğlu was granted the title of ambassador in 2003 by the joint decision of President [[Ahmet Necdet Sezer]] and Prime Minister [[Abdullah Gül]].<ref>[http://rega.basbakanlik.gov.tr/eskiler/2003/01/20030118.htm#13 T.C Resmî Gazete, 18 January 2008, Ankara]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710044102/http://rega.basbakanlik.gov.tr/eskiler/2003/01/20030118.htm#13 |date=10 July 2010 }}</ref>

Since 1984 he has been married to Sare Davutoğlu, who is a [[gynecologist]] working in [[Istanbul]] and a vocal [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] campaigner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-new-pm-ahmet-davutoglus-wife-an-anti-abortion-gynecologist.aspx?pageID=238&nID=70771&NewsCatID=338|title=Turkey's new PM Ahmet Davutoğlu's wife an anti-abortion gynecologist|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> They have one son and three daughters.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

His publications include ''Alternative Paradigms: The Impact of Islamic and Western Weltanschauungs on Political Theory'', ''The Civilizational Transformation and The Muslim World'' in English, ''Stratejik Derinlik'' (''Strategic Depth''), and ''Küresel Bunalım'' (''The Global Crisis'') in Turkish.
His book ''Strategic Depth'' is a very influential book in Turkey's foreign policy orientation, even becoming a bestseller in [[Greece]] in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/61295/turkish-fms-strategic-depth-among-best-selling-book-in-greece|title=Turkish FM's "Strategic Depth" among best-selling book in Greece: source=Anatolia Agency|publisher=World Bulletin|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> He was very influential in the military, academic, and government triangle shaping Turkish foreign policy in 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biyografi.net/kisiayrinti.asp?kisiid=2063|title=biyografi.net: Ahmet Davutoğlu biyografisi burada ünlülerin biyografileri burada|website=www.biyografi.net}}</ref> In addition to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he speaks English, German, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Malay language|Malay]].

===Advisor to the prime minister===
Davutoğlu became Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's chief foreign policy advisor after the latter became prime minister, developing the Justice and Development Party's new foreign policy outlook that would bring Turkey to play a larger role in the Middle East. His position as chief advisor coincided with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion of Iraq]], with Davutoğlu co-ordinating Turkish responses to ongoing military efforts in Turkey's neighbouring country. In 2007, he stated that Turkey was against the United States troops entering northern [[Iraq]], with his opposition originating from the Kurdish separatist movements in that area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/siyaset/haber/218259-davutoglu-kuzey-iraka-dokundurtmuyor|title=Davutoğlu, Kuzey Irak'a dokundurtmuyor|author=Haber7|work=Haber7}}</ref>

==Foreign policy ideals==
[[File:Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Conference 2.jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu (third left) at the [[Organisation of Islamic Co-operation]] Conference in 2011]]

From his articles for ''Yeni Şafak'' and book ''Stratejik Derinlik'', academics and politicians have put forward the view that Davutoğlu's foreign policy vision rests on rebuilding and maintaining closer relations with former territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]] through a policy known as [[Neo-Ottomanism]].<ref name="Daloğlu">{{cite news|last=Daloğlu|first=Tulin|title=Davutoğlu Invokes Ottomanism as new Mideast Order|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/03/turkey-davutologu-ottoman-new-order-mideast.html|newspaper=Al Monitor|accessdate=22 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717193008/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/03/turkey-davutologu-ottoman-new-order-mideast.html|archive-date=17 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Davutoğlu's professor<ref>Sıtkı Özcan, "Davutoğlu'nun hocasi şokta", Zaman, 17 December 2014</ref> and close adviser of former President Turgut Özal, Greek geopolitician [[Dimitri Kitsikis]] is considered in fact to have had a decisive influence, precisely on this geopolitical theory.<ref>Gilles Bertrand, "Turquie: dix ans après l'arrivée au pouvoir de l'AKP», 12e congrès de l'Association française de science politique, July 2013, Paris, France, see pp. 8–11</ref>

Another theory developed by Davutoğlu's former student Behlül Özkan is that Davutoğlu has a [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamist]] foreign policy ideal, in which he sees [[Islam]] as a unifying factor within the Middle East.<ref name="Behlul_Ozkan_Pan_Islamism_1">{{cite news|title='''''(Turkish)''' Davutoglu, Neo-Osmanlici degil Pan-Islamist''|url=http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber-davutoglu-neo-osmanlici-degil-pan-islamist-162144/|publisher=[[Taraf]]|date=23 August 2014|accessdate=29 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825210018/http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber-davutoglu-neo-osmanlici-degil-pan-islamist-162144/|archivedate=25 August 2014}}</ref> Similarly, in their article, Ahmet Erdi Öztürk and Semiha Sözeri noted that Davutoğlu is theideational father of pan-Islamic foreign policy doctrine in the contemporary Turkey.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sözeri|first1=Semiha|last2=Öztürk|first2=Ahmet Erdi|date=September 2018|title=Diyanet as a Turkish Foreign Policy Tool: Evidence from the Netherlands and Bulgaria|journal=Politics and Religion|volume=11|issue=3|pages=624–648|doi=10.1017/S175504831700075X|issn=1755-0483|url=http://repository.londonmet.ac.uk/5404/1/Diyanet_Ozturk-Sozeri.pdf}}</ref> In contrast to these theories, Davutoğlu has also in the past also advocated a pro-western policy as a [[NATO]] member by expressing support for [[European Union]] membership.<ref name="Rusya'yı izole etme lüksümüz yok">{{cite web|title=Rusya'yı izole etme lüksümüz yok|url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/devlet-ve-siyaset/rusyayi-izole-etme-luksumuz-yok-haberi-6077|publisher=SoL|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

===Neo-Ottomanism===
{{main|Neo-Ottomanism}}
Davutoğlu has called for [[Turkey]] to become more than just a [[regional power]] within Europe and the Middle East and expressed a desire for [[Ankara]] to have a far more influential role in world politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8393516.stm |title=Turkey FM Davutoglu embraces mediation role |author=Jonny Dymond |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118055245/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8393516.stm |url-status=live |archivedate=18 November 2010 }}</ref> Davutoğlu is generally linked to the notion of Turkish [[neo-Ottomanism]], which favours a commonwealth with its neighbours and old [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] connections.<ref>{{cite web|last=Simsek |first=Ayhan |title=The changes and challenges of Turkey's foreign policy |date=10 June 2009 |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2009/06/10/feature-03 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112141155/http://setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2009/06/10/feature-03 |archivedate=12 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although his foreign policies have been regarded as neo-Ottomanist by Western and especially U.S. media, Davutoğlu does not accept such a characterization. He stated in an interview with Turkish daily ''[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'' that "as much as we don't use this conceptualization, the fact that it is being used against us is either because of misunderstanding or lack of goodwill." He argued against the idea that Turkey is trying to establish a neo-Ottoman imperial order: "I have said that Turkey as a nation-state is equal with any other nation-state of our region whether it is small in population or area. We don't have any hegemony on anyone. Rather what we are trying to do is to contribute to the establishment of a permanent peace in our region. If by order they mean is [[Pax Ottomana]], Pax in the meaning of order, we are trying to establish a order, it is not wrong to say such thing."<ref>{{cite news|last=Batur |first=Nur |title=New Ottomans is not a goodwilled description |url=http://sabah.com.tr/Siyaset/2009/12/04/yeni_osmanlilar_sozu_iyi_niyetli_degil |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |accessdate=4 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228121702/http://sabah.com.tr/Siyaset/2009/12/04/yeni_osmanlilar_sozu_iyi_niyetli_degil |url-status=live |archivedate=28 December 2010 }}</ref> In 2013, Davutoğlu spoke of developing a closer union between former Ottoman lands, though he stated that territorial claims would never rest on historical borders.<ref name="Daloğlu"/>

===Pan-Islamism===
{{main|Pan-Islamism}}
[[File:Suzan Sabanci Dinçer, Ahmet Davutoğlu, and Dr Robin Niblett (7999218930).jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu (C) at the [[Chatham House]] International Roundtable, [[İstanbul]], September 2012 with [[Suzan Sabancı Dinçer]] (L) and Dr [[Robin Niblett]] (R)]]

According to Behlül Özkan, who was lectured by Ahmet Davutoğlu in 1998 at [[Marmara University]] and currently serves as an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at the same university, Davutoğlu has [[pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] notions rather than neo-Ottoman. Özkan wrote an article for the ''"[[Survival (journal)|Survival]]"'', a scholarly international studies journal of the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], that he had reached his conclusion by researching approximately 300 articles Davutoğlu wrote between 1990 and 2000.<ref name="Behlul_Ozkan_Pan_Islamism_1"/> The notion of pan-Islamism is critical of Turkey's attempts to integrate with western nations, and advocates a union within the Middle East in order to increase regional strength and unity between peoples. Due to the several different cultures and races which inhabit the Middle East today, pan-Islamists believe that only [[Islam]] can provide a strong and long-lasting union between peoples, since they only share Islam in common. Since Davutoğlu is a [[Sunni Muslim]], Özkan stated that [[Iran]] is not part of Davutoğlu's plans for a united Middle East.<ref name="Behlul_Ozkan_Pan_Islamism_1"/><ref name="Behlul_Ozkan_Pan_Islamism_2">{{cite news|title=''Turkey, Davutoglu and the Idea of Pan-Islamism''|url=https://www.iiss.org/en/publications/survival/sections/2014-4667/survival--global-politics-and-strategy-august-september-2014-838b/56-4-12-ozkan-e36b|publisher=[[Survival (journal)|Survival]]|date=23 August 2014|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref>

Davutoğlu arguably observes parallel manners between [[Turgut Özal]] and [[Abdul Hamid II]]. According to Özkan, he criticizes Özal because of his [[Westernization|pro-West]] notions and supports the pan-Islamic trend of Abdul Hamid II's tenure. Özkan claims that there might be a misreading in Davutoğlu's perspective: The pan-Islamic trend of Abdul Hamid II was defensive because he was struggling to protect the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire. However, Davutoğlu can be said to have not defensive but [[Expansionism|expansionist]] pan-Islamic notions, as shown by his statements about the [[Syrian Civil War]].<ref name="Behlul_Ozkan_Pan_Islamism_1"/> Özkan also stated that Davutoğlu does not believe in the [[European Union]] and instead wants an Islamic Union.<ref>{{cite web|title='''''(Turkish)''' Davutoğlu AB'ye kesinlikle inanmıyor, Türkiye liderliği ile İslam birliği istiyor''|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/davutoglu-abye-kesinlikle-inanmiyor-turkiye-liderligi-ile-islam-birligi-istiyor,268521|publisher=T24|accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>

Davutoğlu's foreign policy has also been referred to as [[Muslim Brotherhood]]-inspired transnationalism, for example by [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] MP Aykut Erdemir.<ref>Lecture, December 2014, [[King's College London]]</ref> Since the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|overthrow]] of the Muslim Brotherhood-supported [[President of Egypt]] [[Mohamed Morsi]] in 2013, Turkey has been seen as the Brotherhood's last friendly country within the region. The advocacy of [[Islamic democracy]] by the Brotherhood as well as the AKP provides a means of Davutoğlu to expand Turkey's regional influence using [[Islam]] as a common heritage that unites Middle Eastern nations together. Turkish business opportunities for Brotherhood officials, as well as alleged funding and supplies of arms have been documented and have come to light primarily after the arrest of a Turkish intelligence officer, Irshad Hoz, in Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kader|first1=Mohammad Abdel|title=Turkey's relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/alarabiya-studies/2013/10/14/Turkey-s-relationship-with-the-Muslim-Brotherhood.html|publisher=AL ARABIYA}}</ref>
[[Istanbul]] hosted two meetings of the Muslim Brotherhood after the removal of Morsi's government from office, for which Davutoğlu faced criticism for hosting since it would damage ties with the government of [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]]. [[Qatar]] expelled leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2014, leaving Turkey as the organisation's only major supporter. The expulsion caused speculation as to whether Davutoğlu's government would offer them asylum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/09/21/turkey-may-welcome-muslim-brotherhood-brass-after-ouster-from-qatar/|title=Turkey may welcome Muslim Brotherhood brass after ouster from Qatar|author=Paul Alster|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/16/us-egypt-brotherhood-turkey-idUSKBN0HB0FF20140916|title=Turkey would welcome Muslim Brotherhood figures who leave Qatar: Erdogan|agency=Reuters|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>

==Minister of Foreign Affairs (2009–14)==
[[File:Press Conference (4774547680).jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu with former British Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] during a joint press conference, 2010]]

Davutoğlu was appointed [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in 2009 despite not being a member of parliament. He entered the [[Grand National Assembly]] as an MP for [[Konya]] in the [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]] and continued serving as foreign minister in [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s [[Cabinet Erdoğan III|third cabinet]].

He was listed in ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine as one of the "Top 100 Global Thinkers of 2010" for "being the brains behind Turkey's global reawakening."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,6 |work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]] |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers 7.

On 30 March 2012, Davutoğlu met with [[Bechara Boutros al-Rahi]] of [[Lebanon]] and said that they should meet occasionally during this century.<ref>{{cite news |date=30 March 2012 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |url=http://www.turizmtatilseyahat.com/en/ahmet-davutoglu-maronite-patriarch-historic-visit-2569.htm |title=Ahmet Davutoğlu meets with Maronite Patriarch in historic visit |newspaper=Tourism Travel Vacation |archivedate=15 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415132002/http://www.turizmtatilseyahat.com/en/ahmet-davutoglu-maronite-patriarch-historic-visit-2569.htm }}</ref>

In 2010, Davutoğlu set out four pillars upon which his foreign policy rests. The first is the indivisibility of security, the second is dialogue, the third is economic interdependence and the fourth is cultural harmony and mutual respect. He claimed that the goal of his policy was to integrate different nations and develop cultural understanding between different faiths and races, as well as maintaining co-operative relations and peaceful dialogue in order to solve crises when they arise.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001955/http://ecrgroup.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Turkish-Foreign-Policy-and-teh-EU-in-2010_Ahmet-Davutoglu.pdf ]</ref>

Latter analyses of Davutoğlu term as foreign minister in 2013 and 2014 have been significantly more negative and critical.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/opinion/turkeys-failed-foreign-policy.html|title=Turkey's Failed Foreign Policy|date=23 August 2014|work=The New York Times}}</ref> His failures are mostly associated with Turkey's policy on the [[Syrian Civil War]], attempts to increase political influence over former Ottoman states and his controversial stance against Egyptian President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] who took power in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/world/2013/08/05/No-more-friends-Turkish-foreign-policy-is-falling-apart.html|title=How not to win friends: Turkey's foreign policy falls apart|website=english.alarabiya.net}}</ref> Most criticism has been directed to Turkey's foreign policy on the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) and its refusal to help Kurdish fighters take back the town of [[Kobani]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist/suat-kiniklioglu/turkish-foreign-policy-hits-another-cul-de-sac_362367.html|title=SUAT KINIKLIOĞLU – Turkish foreign policy hits another cul-de-sac|date=22 October 2014|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=7 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614054905/http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist/suat-kiniklioglu/turkish-foreign-policy-hits-another-cul-de-sac_362367.html|archivedate=14 June 2015}}</ref> This, as well as the AKP's continued funding of [[Hamas]], has led to souring relations between Turkey and the United States, as well as other nations in the region.

===Armenia===
On 24 April 2014, he and Tayyip Erdogan issued a statement in nine languages including [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]] where they agreed that the [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|1915 Armenian deportations]] were inhumane. They also agreed that these events should be studied by both Turkish, [[Armenian people|Armenian]], and foreign historians. Nevertheless, they did not recognize the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://dippost.com/2014/04/24/turkeys-fm-davutoglu-pm-erdogans-condolences-a-call-for-consensus/ |title=Turkey's FM Davutoglu: PM Erdogan's condolences a call for consensus |date=24 August 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |archivedate=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809233746/http://dippost.com/2014/04/24/turkeys-fm-davutoglu-pm-erdogans-condolences-a-call-for-consensus/ }}</ref>

After [[Pope Francis]] has spoken that the Armenian genocide was one of the three major genocides in the 20th century, on 16 April 2015 Davutoğlu said that the Pope joined the "evil front" and the conspiracy against the Justice and Development Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pope-has-joined-conspiracy-against-turkish-government-pm-davutoglu-says.aspx?pageID=238&nID=81079&NewsCatID=510|title=Pope has joined conspiracy against Turkish government, PM Davutoğlu says|date=16 April 2015|work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref>

===Egypt===
[[File:Acilis.JPG|thumb|Davutoğlu alongside Erdoğan at the opening of a [[Yunus Emre]] cultural centre in [[Cairo]], 2011]]

Davutoğlu presided over a significant improvement in relations with [[Egypt]] following the [[2012 Egyptian presidential election|election]] of [[Mohamed Morsi]] as president in 2012, followed by a sudden deterioration shortly after the latter's removal in 2013. As one of the closest backers of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], Davutoğlu's relations with Morsi's government involved a Turkish offer of assistance in order to draft a secular constitution. This offer, which some viewed as an attempt by Davutoğlu to increase Turkish influence in Egypt, was rejected by Morsi's government who instead opted for a more [[Islamism|Islamist]] constitution. Regardless, both Davutoğlu and Erdoğan strongly criticised the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|July 2013 overthrow]] of Morsi, and the [[Grand National Assembly]] passed a cross-party motion of condemnation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/857672-meclisten-misirdaki-askeri-darbeyi-kinama|title=Meclis'ten Mısır'daki askeri darbeyi kınama|date=4 July 2013|work=haberturk.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>

Davutoğlu claimed that intense diplomatic traffic between [[Ankara]] and [[Cairo]] took place before the overthrow,.where an eight-point plan had been agreed. However, he stated after the July 3rd incident that the first action of the new administration should be allowing Morsi to resume active participation in politics. Davutoğlu also compared Morsi's overthrow to the Turkish coups in [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960]] and [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/first-step-in-egypt-is-to-include-morsi-in-politics-davutoglu-says-revealing-intense-diplomacy-.aspx?pageID=238&nID=50153&NewsCatID=338|title='First step in Egypt is to include Morsi in politics,' Davutoğlu says, revealing intense diplomacy – POLITICS|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> Davutoğlu also criticised the judicial decision to sentence 529 Muslim Brotherhood members to death, further arguing that the Egyptian government was anti-democratic and acting illegally. Relations subsequently soured, with Egypt expelling the Turkish ambassador, while Erdoğan declared the Egyptian ambassador ''persona non grata'' in retaliation. The Egyptian government also demanded an apology from the AKP for the comments, and refused to invite Turkey to an Islamic Conference held in Cairo due to the worsening relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_davutoglu-conviction-of-morsi-supporters-shows-egyptian-govt-is-anti-democratic_342936.html|title=Davutoğlu: Conviction of Morsi supporters shows Egyptian gov't is anti-democratic|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=7 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530120615/http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_davutoglu-conviction-of-morsi-supporters-shows-egyptian-govt-is-anti-democratic_342936.html|archivedate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Following the release of [[Hosni Mubarak]], Davutoğlu claimed that his release at a time while Morsi was still imprisoned worsened the situation that could involve into a crisis similar to that in [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/europe/7033-davutoglu-says-the-release-of-mubarak-while-morsi-is-detained-deteriorates-the-situation-|title=Davutoglu says the release of Mubarak while Morsi is detained deteriorates the situation|work=Middle East Monitor – The Latest from the Middle East|accessdate=7 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406101128/https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/europe/7033-davutoglu-says-the-release-of-mubarak-while-morsi-is-detained-deteriorates-the-situation-|archivedate=6 April 2015}}</ref> After being ousted from Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood had also held two conferences at [[Istanbul]] to debate the removal of Morsi and their response to it.

The AKP government's stance and President Erdoğan's remarks on Egypt have resulted in Davutoğlu's government being criticised strongly overseas, being blamed by the [[United Arab Emirates]] for 'irresponsible and blatant interference in the internal affairs' of Egypt. Critics have argued that the AKP's stance on Egypt is a threat to Davutoğlu's policy of expanding turkey's regional influence throughout the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/09/25/UAE-denounces-Erdogan-s-U-N-attack-on-Egypt.html|title=UAE denounces Erdogan's U.N. attack on Egypt|website=english.alarabiya.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/09/turkey-egypt-united-nations-muslim-brotherhood-sisi-erdogan.html|title=Turkish-Egyptian ties are at a standstill – Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>

===European Union===
[[File:Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in Western Thrace 1.jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu visiting [[Western Thrace]] in 2011]]

Despite being alleged to have Pan-Islamist foreign policy ideals, Davutoğlu has voiced a degree of support for Turkey's membership of the [[European Union]]. Despite this, talks froze due to Turkey's policy on [[Cyprus]] in mid 2012 after the Republic of Cyprus assumed the rotating EU presidency, with Davutoğlu claiming that Turkey would never beg for EU membership.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ahmet Davutoğlu: Turkey 'will never beg' for EU membership|url=http://www.nationalturk.com/en/ahmet-davutoglu-turkey-eu-membership-30790|publisher=National Türk|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> The bulk of Turkish-EU relations are handled by the Ministry of European Union Affairs, led by Ministers [[Egemen Bağış]] until 2013 and [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] between 2013 and 2014.

In the 51st Association Council meeting in [[Brussels]] held in May 2013, Davutoğlu claimed that Turkey had aimed for membership for 50 years and would continue to do so. He further stated that the international community needed to see Turkey as an EU member, but also said that it was unacceptable for Turkish citizens to be denied the right to free movement within Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Minister Davutoğlu "EU membership has been our strategic goal for almost 50 years and will continue to be"|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/foreign-minister-davutoglu-_eu-membership-has-been-our-strategic-goal-for-almost-50-years-and-will-continue-to-be.en.mfa|publisher=T.C.

In an article regarding Turkish foreign policy and the EU, Davutoğlu has claimed that Turkey's membership of the EU can allow it to develop stronger ties in the [[Balkan]] and [[Mediterranean]] regions and also help eliminate poverty in North Africa by using its influence in both the EU and the Islamic world. He has stated that with a multicultural identity and a diverse history, Turkey has a natural responsibility to bring about peace and stability within the world. Since Turkey already has close economic and diplomatic relations with EU member states, Davutoğlu has emphasised that full EU membership would benefit both Turkey and all other member states with added security and trade. Furthermore, Davutoğlu has also advocated that a united Europe with Turkey as a member would be fit to fight terrorism and other threats to democracy and human rights. Despite this, he has criticised the political obstacles in the path of Turkey's ascension which are in "stark contrast" with negotiation terms.

===Greece and Cyprus===
[[File:Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu & Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas 1.jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu meets with former Greek Foreign Minister [[Dimitrios Droutsas]]]]

In June 2012, Davutoğlu accused the Greek government of not respecting the rights of Turkish minorities, especially in [[Thrace|Western Thrace]]. He further stressed that the alleged withdrawal of Greek citizenships from Turkish minority citizens was against the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Davutoğlu: Greece failed to protect Turkish minority rights|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-283879-davutoglu-greece-failed-to-protect-turkish-minority-rights.html|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=22 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113607/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-283879-davutoglu-greece-failed-to-protect-turkish-minority-rights.html|archivedate=26 August 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, Davutoğlu brought a possible two-state solution of the [[Cyprus dispute]] to Greek Foreign Minister [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]] after controversy erupted over the ownership of offshore oil reserves. The prospect was swiftly disregarded by the Greek foreign ministry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Greece Nixes Turkish Bid on Cyprus|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/03/29/greece-nixes-turkish-bid-on-cyprus/|publisher=Greek Reporter|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> Davutoğlu also claimed that negotiations to resolve the dispute would accelerate under the leadership of [[Nikos Anastasiadis]], who had supported the [[Annan Plan]] and had voted yes in the [[2004 Cypriot Annan Plan referendums|2004 Annan Plan referendum]]. This, according to Davutoğlu, was in stark contrast to former Republic of Cyprus President [[Demetris Christofias]], who had voted against. Davutoğlu has also expressed that any new possible solution does not need to be based on the Annan Plan.<ref name="Anadolu Agency">{{cite web |title=Greece should be strong and stable says Davutoglu|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/rss/142022--greece-should-be-strong-and-stable-says-davutoglu|publisher=Anadolu Agency|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/anastasides-or-davutoglu-whose-strategy-deeper-1649258927|title=Anastasides or Davutoglu: whose strategy is deeper?|work=Middle East Eye|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>

On the issue of turning [[Hagia Sophia]] into a mosque, Davutoğlu has stated that all international laws on such issues would be obeyed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Greek and Turkish Ministers' Meeting on Minority Issues and Cyprus|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/12/13/greek-and-turkish-ministers-meeting-about-minority-issues-and-cyprus/|publisher=Greek Reporter|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Greece-Turkey: Foreign Minister Davutoglu in Athens|url=http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/politics/2013/12/13/Greece-Turkey-Foreign-Minister-Davutoglu-Athens_9772689.html|publisher=ANSA Med|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> He has also called the Greek government to respect the religious freedoms of Muslims within Greece, which he alleged to be under threat from legislation such as the "240 Imam Act." He claimed that the Greek government should refrain from interfering in religious affairs.<ref name="Anadolu Agency"/>

In May 2014, Davutoğlu stated that Turkey would not pay compensation of €90&nbsp;million to the Republic of Cyprus for the damages dating back to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974 Cyprus invasion]] despite a ruling by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR). In a statement, Davutoğlu claimed that the Foreign Ministry saw no need to obey a court ruling which was directed at an entity not recognised by the Republic of Turkey. He also criticised the ECHR ruling, and claimed that it contained errors and inconsistencies. Adding that obeying the ruling was impractical, Davutoğlu stated that the ruling of the court was a substantial blow against achieving a resolution to the Cyprus Dispute. The so-called ''government'' of the unrecognized '' [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] ''supported Davutoğlu's position, arguing that the court ruling was simply made to please Greece and Greek Cypriots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Turkey won't compensate Greek Cyprus over 1974, says Davutoğlu|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-347663-turkey-wont-compensate-greek-cyprus-over-1974-says-davutoglu.html|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=22 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521231600/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-347663-turkey-wont-compensate-greek-cyprus-over-1974-says-davutoglu.html|archivedate=21 May 2014}}</ref>

===Iran===

As the foreign minister of a [[Sunni]]-majority country, Davutoğlu has voiced concerns over [[Iran]]'s [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]]. Regardless, his foreign policy has been to develop relations with Iran, since Iran is Turkey's second biggest supplier of oil after Russia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey's Davutoglu visits Iran, talk on nuke, Syria

Relations between Turkey and the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG) in northern Iraq strengthened with the ceasefire with [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] rebels.

Before becoming foreign minister, Davutoğlu was one of the leading actors on behalf of the Turkish government during the shuttle diplomacy for the settlement of [[2008 Israel–Gaza conflict]].

Following the [[Mavi Marmara]] incident in May 2010, Davutoğlu put forward three conditions for the normalisation of relations between [[Turkey]] and [[Israel]]. He stated that the State of Israel should issue an apology for the incident and pay compensation, and also lift the naval blockade of the [[Gaza Strip]]. Davutoğlu managed to secure an apology in March 2013, and compensation deals were finalised in 2014. He further stated that the political unrest in [[Egypt]] had delayed the lifting of the naval blockade.<ref>{{cite web |title=Davutoglu says Turkish-Israeli relationship nears normalization|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/02/davutoglu-says-turkey-israel-relations-normalizing.html|publisher=Al Monitor|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> In February 2014, Davutoğlu claimed that Turkish-Israeli relations were closer to normalisation than ever, and that the strengthening of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] will help increase the influence of Turkey in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Minister Davutoğlu addressed the recent developments in Turkish – Israeli relations in a TV interview|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/foreign-minister-davutoglu-addressed-recent-developments-in-turkish-israeli-relations-in-tv-interview.en.mfa|publisher=T.C.

At an [[Ankara]] conference in May 2014, Davutoğlu claimed that the Israeli occupation of [[Jerusalem]] caused suffering to citizens, and that it was a moral obligation to protect the city's culture and Islamic identity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkish FM: Jerusalemites 'suffer' under occupation|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/turkish-fm-jerusalemites-suffer-under-occupation/|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

With Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan taking a strong anti-Israel stance during the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]], Davutoğlu pursued a policy of active participation, providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey airlifts 4 injured Gazans for treatment|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/turkey-airlifts-4-injured-gazans-for-treatment/|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> Relations between Turkey and Israel deteriorated significantly, with Israel withdrawing diplomatic staff from Turkey due to safety fears, just a few months after announcing that staff numbers would increase back to normal levels.<ref>{{cite web |title=After violent protests, Israel to pull some diplomatic staff from Turkey|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/after-violent-protest-israel-to-pull-some-diplomatic-staff-from-turkey/|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> On 26 July, Davutoğlu met with United States Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] and Qatari Foreign Minister [[Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah]] in Paris in an unsuccessful attempt to draft a ceasefire deal between Israel and [[Hamas]].<ref>{{cite web |title=US officials warn Kerry criticism could jeopardize Israel ties|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-officials-warn-kerry-criticism-could-jeopardize-israel-ties/|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

===Libyan Civil War===
[[File:Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs at the London Conference on Libya (5571019057).jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu at the [[London Conference on Libya]], March 2011]]

Davutoğlu took a humanitarian approach in an attempt to end the suffering of Libyan civilians during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Civil War]]. In a 2011 conference on Libya, Davutoğlu stated that ending civilian suffering should be a greater priority than toppling [[Muammar Gaddafi]] from power, stating that [[NATO]] should play a more active role in pressuring Gaddafi to respect the rights of Libyan citizens.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkish FM Ahmet Davutoğlu: NATO has ability to force Gaddafi Ceasefire|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/content/turkish-fm-davutoglu-nato-has-ability-force-qaddafi-ceasefire|work=World Affairs Journal|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> However, he warned against full military intervention, stating that the situation should not turn into a war effort similar to those in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] or [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FM Ahmet Davutoğlu says NATO can pressure Gaddafi to make truce|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-239555-fm-ahmet-davutoglu-says-nato-can-pressure-gaddafi-to-make-truce.html|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=24 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114634/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-239555-fm-ahmet-davutoglu-says-nato-can-pressure-gaddafi-to-make-truce.html|archivedate=26 August 2014}}</ref> In April, Davutoğlu stated that the Turkish government had cut its diplomatic ties with Gaddafi's regime and instead recognised the [[Libyan National Transitional Council|National Transitional Council]] as the legitimate government of Libya and pledged greater financial aid to the rebels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey cuts diplomatic ties with Gaddafi's Libyan gov't|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Turkey-cuts-diplomatic-ties-with-Gaddafis-Libyan-govt|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> In May 2011, Davutoğlu met with rebel leaders and voiced concerns on the threats to civilians, arguing that a [[peaceful transition of power]] could be achieved if Gaddafi and his family stepped aside.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey meets Libyan rebels, tells Gaddafi to quit|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE74M1P720110523|agency=Reuters|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>

===Russia and Crimea===
[[File:High-Level Russian-Turkish Cooperation Council.PNG|thumbnail|Davutoğlu at the annual meeting of the Turkish-Russian High-Level Co-operation Council in 2012]]

Before becoming foreign minister, Davutoğlu stated that Turkey would not pay the price of either Russian or [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] strategic failures during the [[Russo-Georgian War]] in 2008. Upon being asked whether Turkey would have to make a choice between either country, he stated that as a member of NATO and an EU candidate country, Turkey had already made its choice. However, he also emphasised that Turkey did not have the luxury of isolating Russia.<ref name="Rusya'yı izole etme lüksümüz yok"/>

While Turkey has overall maintained good relations with Russia, Davutoğlu has been influential in maintaining ties between the two countries which held differing views during the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Relations with Russia are also economically significant due to Turkish imports of natural gas. The two countries launched the High-Level Cooperation Council in 2010 which meets annually to review relations. The Joint Strategic Planning Group Meeting Protocol, which formed a part of the Co-operation Council, was signed in 2011. When the Turkish AKP government fell out with [[Fethullah Gülen]] in late 2013, Davutoğlu was able to find further common ground with Russia, which viewed Gülen and his [[Gülen movement|Cemaat movement]] extremely negatively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia, Turkey agree on Gulen|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/06/russia-turkey-davutoglu-syria-crisis-ukraine-tatar.html|publisher=Al Monitor|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

Economic relations improved with a Russian offer for Turkey to participate in the [[South Stream]] gas pipeline project, which will run through Turkish waters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia offers Turkey a role in South Stream gas pipeline – agencies|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/finance/11987608.asp?gid=244|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> Davutoğlu has stated that Turkey is eager to enhance economic co-operation with Russia.<ref>{{cite web|title=FM Davutoglu says Turkey eager to enchance cooperation with Russia|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/world/11991187.asp?gid=244|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> The issues of [[Syria]] and [[Crimea]] were discussed during a Joint Strategic Planning Group Meeting in May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Davutoğlu to depart for Russia for talks on strategic alliance|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-348713-davutoglu-to-depart-for-russia-for-talks-on-strategic-alliance.html|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=10 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730140424/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-348713-davutoglu-to-depart-for-russia-for-talks-on-strategic-alliance.html|archivedate=30 July 2014}}</ref> A new project to establish a joint investment bank between the two countries in order to fund joint projects and improve economic relations through the use of local currencies was also likely discussed.

With Turkey taking a pro-opposition stance throughout the Syrian Civil War in contrast to Russia's support of [[Bashar al-Assad|Bashar Al Assad]], Davutoğlu has been at odds with Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]]. Despite this, Davutoğlu has stated that actions taken by Turkey against Syria, such as the forcing the landing of a Syrian jet in 2012, would not damage relations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Davutoğlu: Rusya ile ilişkileri etkilemez|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25389220/|publisher=ntvmsnbc|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> In 2013, the two sides still failed to agree on the fate of Syria, yet both emphasised that they would formulate a strategic plan to bring peace and stability throughout the region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Lavrov talk Syria with Turkish Davutoglu|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/18/298897/russian-lavrov-talk-syria-with-turkish-davutoglu/|publisher=Press TV|accessdate=10 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406045444/http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/18/298897/russian-lavrov-talk-syria-with-turkish-davutoglu/|archivedate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Davutoğlu also supported Russia's call for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons instead of risking foreign military intervention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Davutoğlu: Rusya'nın çağrısı doğru bir adım|url=http://www.ahaber.com.tr/webtv/videoizle/davutoglu-rusyanin-cagrisi-dogru-bir-adim|publisher=a Haber|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> In May 2014, he raised concerns regarding the [[2014 Syrian presidential election|Syrian presidential election]] with Russia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Davutoğlu'ndan kritik Rusya ziyareti|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Gundem/2014/05/25/davutoglundan-kritik-rusya-ziyareti |publisher=Sabah|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

===Syrian Civil War===

The Turkish government adopted a policy of strong opposition against [[Bashar al-Assad|Bashar Al Assad]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Minister Davutoğlu "We will stand by the Syrian people until they live with honor in all around Syria"|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/foreign-minister-davutoglu-we-will-stand-by-the-syrian-people-until-they-live-with-honor-in-all-around-syria.en.mfa|publisher=T.C. Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> Davutoğlu has supported the need to strengthen the rebels against Assad's regime, though his stance was complicated by the growing influence of [[Al-Qaeda]] related militant action within Syria as the civil war progressed.

In September 2012, Davutoğlu called for the establishment of "safe zones" in northern Syria to accommodate refugees and reduce the number of civilian casualties. He warned that continued global inactivity in regards to Syria will lead to failure "like [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]]" in response to the United Nations General Assembly's failure to reach consensus.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey: Risk worth taking for Syria safe zones|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19753795|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

In a conference of Syria-bordering countries hosted in [[Jordan]], Davutoğlu stated in May 2014 that Turkey had spent US$3&nbsp;billion on maintaining refugee camps, and that the United Nations needed to do more to finance their upkeeping. In the same conference, he claimed that "the world has failed Syria."<ref>{{cite web |title=World has failed Syria, says Turkey's Davutoglu|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/world-has-failed-syria-says-turkey-s-davutoglu-1.1653018|publisher=iOL News|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> Davutoğlu has pledged to support the United States should they authorise military action within Syria. Losing confidence in the [[United Nations Security Council]], Davutoğlu has not ruled out a military option to resolving the crisis. The political opposition within Turkey has strongly criticised Davutoğlu's policy on Syria, claiming that it was responsible for the [[2013 Reyhanlı bombings]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Davutoğlu'ndan Reyhanlı Açıklaması|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/davutoglu-ndan-reyhanli-aciklamasi/siyaset/detay/1712489/default.htm|publisher=Milliyet News|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

On 23 March 2014, a Syrian fighter jet was shot down by the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. Davutoğlu claimed that the jet had violated Turkish airspace, whereas this allegation was denied by the Syrian authorities. The incident occurred 7 days before [[2014 Turkish local elections|local elections]], and Davutoğlu claimed that anyone who thought that the downing of the jet was an election ploy was "evil minded."<ref>{{cite web |title=Davutoglu defends Syria policy|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/03/turkey-syria-defend-foreign-policy-davutoglu.html#|publisher=Almonitor|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> He also stated that Turkey would not accept the [[2014 Syrian presidential election]] as legitimate.<ref>{{cite web |title=DAVUTOĞLU: NO ONE WILL ACCEPT THE LEGITIMACY OF SYRIAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2014/05/05/davutoglu-no-one-will-accept-the-legitimacy-of-syrian-presidential-elections|work=Daily Sabah|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

==Domestic views==
[[File:Giorgio Napolitano and Ahmet Davutoglu 2.jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu meeting with [[Giorgio Napolitano]], the [[List of Presidents of Italy|11th]] [[President of Italy]]]]

Despite serving as foreign minister, Davutoğlu maintained an active and influential role in shaping domestic policy, especially in response to the [[2013–14 protests in Turkey]] and the [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|2013 government corruption scandal]]. His strong support for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during such events has been seen as a key reason for his eventual nomination to succeed Erdoğan as leader of the AKP in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/davutoglu-designated-as-akp-leader-and-new-prime-minister.aspx?PageID=238&NID=70753&NewsCatID=338|title=Davutoğlu designated as AKP leader and new prime minister|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> He came under scrutiny after the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|August 10 presidential election]] after it was revealed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had initially devised the highly unsuccessful appointment system for overseas voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/102805/Randevu_sistemini_Disisleri_istemis.html|title=Randevu sistemini Dışişleri istemiş|publisher=Cumhuriyet|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

===Reyhanlı bombings===
{{main|Reyhanlı bombings}}
In response to an attack on the district of [[Reyhanlı]] in [[Hatay]] that killed 52 people, Davutoğlu stated that the killers were "known" and had been caught by the government, warning that no-one should attempt to cover up the suspects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haberand.com/videogaleri/davutoglu-ndan-reyhanli-aciklamasi-v-41288|title=Davutoğlu'ndan Reyhanlı açıklaması|publisher=Haberand|accessdate=9 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195529/http://haberand.com/videogaleri/davutoglu-ndan-reyhanli-aciklamasi-v-41288|archivedate=10 September 2014}}</ref> He also stated that suspicion of the Syrian opposition and their possible involvement should be avoided, and that violent groups had no place in the Syrian peace process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/siyaset/davutoglu-reyhanli-saldirisinin-failleri-bellidir/haber-208473|title=Davutoğlu: 'Reyhanlı saldırısının failleri bellidir'|publisher=Akşam|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

===2013–14 anti-government protests===
{{main|2013–14 protests in Turkey}}
Davutoğlu has been a heavy critic of both the aims and the conduct of the anti-government protests which began in late May 2013. Claiming that it was a critical event in Turkish politics, he criticized both the national and international media for their alleged support for the protests. He further claimed that in any European capital, a demonstration at a central square such as [[Taksim Square|Taksim]] would be forced to disband within 18 days of protest. In response to the claim that protesters assaulted a woman wearing a headscarf which was later proved to be fabricated, Davutoğlu claimed that the victim was the wife of one of his close students.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25450108/|title=Davutoğlu: 'Gezi' çok kritik bir virajdı|publisher=ntvmsnbc|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> It had initially been rumoured that Davutoğlu had said "I am honoured by Gezi [protests]," though he himself later denied these rumours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25480630/|title=Davutoğlu'ndan Gezi açıklaması|publisher=ntvmsnbc|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

In an article written for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Davutoğlu defended the police crackdown on protesters by claiming that the initially democratic demonstrations had been hijacked by militant groups. He also argued that his party was using undemocratic methods to pursue its agenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/16/protests-represent-turkey-democracy-akp|title=Turkey: despite the protests, we represent all of our citizens|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> Furthermore, he stated that the government was not polarizing the nation despite allegations to the contrary, but instead separating marginal groups with militant aims from democratic protests in an attempt to maintain the rule of law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2013/06/30/davutoglundan-gezi-parki-yaniti|title=Davutoğlu'ndan Gezi Parkı yanıtı|publisher=Sabah|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

===2013 corruption scandal===
{{main|2013 corruption scandal in Turkey}}
Davutoğlu has denied that any form of corruption has occurred during the AKP government. He has stated that his party would "break the hand of anyone who tries to steal what belongs to the Turkish people, even if it is the hand of our brother." He has also claimed that the AKP has been the strongest force in tackling corruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/davutoglunun-yutamayacagi-lokma-31878yy.htm|title=Davutoğlu'nun yutamayacağı lokma!|publisher=Yeniçağ|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> He had once stated that corruption is "the biggest crime."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajanshaber.com/davutoglu-yolsuzluk-en-buyuk-suctur-haberi/37173|title=Davutoğlu: Yolsuzluk en büyük suçtur|publisher=Ajans Haber|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

In response to 17 December 2013 corruption scandal, Davutoğlu claimed that it was simply a transition from one era to another and that the scandal would not be remembered in 30 years time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/ahmet_davutoglu_17_aralik_bizim_icin_sadece_seb_i_arustur-1172696|title=Ahmet Davutoğlu: '17 Aralık bizim için sadece Şeb-i Arus'tur'|publisher=Radikal|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> He further claimed that his party would not yield or slow down in bringing about reforms that had been planned. Remaining loyal with Prime Minister Erdoğan, Davutoğlu claimed that the Prime Minister himself was the ultimate target of the scandal which had been sparked by followers of [[Fethullah Gulen]]'s Cemaat Movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haber.rotahaber.com/davutoglundan-hedef-erdogan-iddiasi_485964.html|title=Davutoğlu'ndan hedef Erdoğan iddiası|publisher=Rota Haber|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

===2014 Soma mining disaster===
{{main|Soma mine disaster}}

Following an explosion in the [[Soma coal mine]] on 13 May which killed 301 miners, Davutoğlu declined all international offers for assistance. While thanking the nations for their offers to help, Davutoğlu stated that Turkish rescue workers would be able to respond to the disaster without foreign aid or help. On the subject of [[Israel]] offering aid despite diplomatic rifts between the two countries due to the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]], Davutoğlu stated that the [[Cabinet Erdoğan III|Turkish government]] would always receive offers of humanitarian assistance from any country in a positive manner regardless of any diplomatic situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/dunya/haber/948727-davutoglundan-soma-icin-yardim-teklifinde-bulunan-ulkelere-tesekkur|title=Davutoğlu'ndan Soma için yardım teklifinde bulunan ülkelere teşekkür|publisher=Habertürk|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

Speaking from the Turkish Embassy in London during the [[Friends of Syria Group]] Conference, Davutoğlu offered his condolences and claimed that Turkey had been through similar "tests" before, such as during earthquakes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/dis-politika/haber/1158190-bakan-davutoglundan-somaya-dua|title=Bakan Davutoğlu'ndan Soma'ya dua|publisher=Haber 7|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

In an interview with [[CNN]], he stated that everything would be done to discover the causes of the accident. In response to Prime Minister Erdoğan's highly criticized statement in which he gave several examples from the past of other mining disasters in other countries as a justification for the accident, Davutoğlu defended the Prime Minister by stating that mining disasters were challenges that all other countries had to face. Unlike in the 2013–14 anti-government protests, Davutoğlu stated that he would respect protests as a result of the disaster and claimed that both he and Erdoğan understood the pain of the people in such emotional times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/davutoglu-basbakan-somanin-acisini-yureginde-hissediyor,258560|title=Davutoğlu: Başbakan Soma'nın acısını yüreğinde hissediyor|publisher=T24|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

Ahmet Davutoğlu became the 26th [[Prime Minister of Turkey]] on 29 August 2014 after his predecessor [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] was [[2014 Turkish presidential election|elected]] as the 12th [[President of Turkey]]. He initially served as acting prime minister between 28 and 29 August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-government-davutoglu-idUSKBN0GS1BY20140828|title=Turkish President Erdogan appoints Davutoglu acting prime minister|date=28 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref> He led the [[Cabinet Davutoğlu I|62nd government of Turkey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/salih-dogan-taptuk-emre-erkoc-ahmet-erdi-ozturk/what-turkey-needs-from-davutoglu-government|title=What Turkey needs from the Davutoglu Government via OpenDemocracy |author=SALIH DOGAN |author2=TAPTUK EMRE ERKOC |author3=AHMET ERDI OZTURK |date=19 September 2014|website=openDemocracy|access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref> His initial nomination to lead the AKP on 21 August was welcomed by Iranian foreign minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif]], who claimed that Davutoğlu was a very easy person to maintain dialogue with.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/27055061.asp|title=İran Dışişleri Bakanı: Davutoğlu çok rahat diyalog kurabildiğim biri: source=DHA|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

Davutoğlu has often been referred to as 'Erdoğan's [[Yıldırım Akbulut]]' due to the similar circumstances of his ascension to the Prime Minister's Office with that of Yıldırım Akbulut in 1989.<ref name="odatv.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.odatv.com/n.php?n=erdoganin-yildirim-akbulutu-belli-oldu--0910121200|title=Erdoğan'ın "Yıldırım Akbulut"u belli oldu|work=odatv.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> Akbulut became prime minister after his predecessor, [[Turgut Özal]] was [[1989 Turkish presidential election|elected President]]. This bears similarity to Davutoğlu becoming prime minister due to his predecessor Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's election as president. In addition, Akbulut is widely perceived to have taken a docile approach during his time in office while President Özal took key political decisions despite occupying a mostly ceremonial office. This too, is claimed to bear similarity to Erdoğan's statements about his continued involvement in political affairs despite his ceremonial position, with Davutoğlu leading a submissive premiership.

===Election as AKP leader===
Upon the election of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as president, the leadership of the AKP became vacant for the first time in the party's history. In a meeting chaired by Erdoğan that lasted three hours, Davutoğlu was put forward by the AKP Central Executive Board (MYK) as a candidate for the leadership on 21 August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/erdogan_yeni_basbakani_acikliyor-1208245|title=Erdoğan: AK Parti'nin yeni genel başkan adayı Ahmet Davutoğlu|publisher=Radikal|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> He was unanimously elected unopposed as party leader in the party's [[2014 Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|first extraordinary congress]] on 27 August, taking 1,382 votes.<ref name="Akşam"/> He thus formed his government on the 29th while Erdoğan took over as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ak-parti-den-olaganustu-kurultay-aciklamasi-hakkari-yerelhaber-349783/|title=AK PARTİ'DEN OLAĞANÜSTÜ KURULTAY AÇIKLAMASI|publisher=Milliyet|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> No other candidate has voiced opposition or has declared intention to run for the party leadership as a rival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/davutoglu-turkey-prime-minister_n_5697822.html|title=Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu Nominated As Turkey's New Prime Minister|work=HuffPost|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>

The AKP MYK's proposal to elect Davutoğlu as party leader has been attributed to several factors. Davutoğlu strongly supported Prime Minister Erdoğan during the [[2013–14 protests in Turkey|2013–14 anti-government protests]] and the [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|17 December government corruption scandal]], and was thus seen as a close ally and partner that could work in harmony with Erdoğan after the latter became president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/davutoglu-designated-as-akp-leader-and-new-prime-minister.aspxPageID=238&NID=70753&NewsCatID=338|title=Davutoğlu designated as AKP leader and new prime minister|work=Hürriyet Daily News|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> Davutoğlu's loyalty and similar foreign policy ideals to Erdoğan, as well as his active involvement in situations such as the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict|Gaza conflict]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]] has resulted in strong support from AKP members and supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28881055|title=Ahmed Davutoglu named as new Turkish Prime Minister|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> Critics of the AKP have put forward the view that Davutoğlu's loyalty to Erdoğan will allow Erdoğan as president to continue pursuing his agenda and controlling the government, through the use of the President's rarely used cabinet-calling powers, while Davutoğlu himself takes a docile approach.<ref name="Fox News"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/11049794/President-elect-Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-names-ally-Ahmet-Davutoglu-as-new-Turkey-PM.html|title=President-elect Recep Tayyip Erdogan names ally Ahmet Davutoglu as new Turkey PM|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/erdogan-allies-likely-dominate-turkeys-cabinet-124139219--business.html|title=Erdogan allies likely to dominate Turkey's new cabinet : source=Reuters|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.cihan.com.tr/news/Davutoglu-pledges-to-toe-the-line-for-Erdogan_6053-CHMTUyNjA1My80|title=Davutoğlu pledges to toe the line for Erdoğan|agency=Cihan News Agency|accessdate=10 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140911111959/http://en.cihan.com.tr/news/Davutoglu-pledges-to-toe-the-line-for-Erdogan_6053-CHMTUyNjA1My80|archivedate=11 September 2014}}</ref>

In contrast, it has also been alleged that Davutoğlu would not take a docile approach based on his strong independence as foreign minister, during which he acted without the direct consent of the Prime Minister while appointing ministerial staff. [[Marmara University]] Assistant Professor Yüksel Taskin is a proponent of this view, claiming that Davutoğlu has planned on becoming prime minister for over 20 years, which would make it seem unlikely that he would consent to acting as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's puppet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/erdogans-first-step-secure-more-power-in-new-role-in-turkey/2432658.html|title=Erdogan's First Step: Secure More Power in New Role in Turkey|work=VOA|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>

===Economic policy===
[[File:Turkey growth rate (2011-2014).png|thumb|Economic growth rate in Turkey between 2011 and 2014]]

Despite controversy over alleged links with [[Fethullah Gülen]], Deputy Prime Minister [[Ali Babacan]] retained his position in Davutoğlu's new cabinet with responsibility over the economy. Babacan, who has been an advocate of neoliberal economic policies and independence for the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish Central Bank]], has been at odds with Erdoğan and other AKP politicians who advocate a more Islamist-orientated economic agenda such as [[Numan Kurtulmuş]] and [[Yiğit Bulut]]. Finance Minister [[Mehmet Şimşek]], a supporter of Babacan, also kept his post in the new cabinet. Although the retainment of the two pro-liberal economy ministers pleased investors, the appointment of Kurtulmuş as another deputy prime minister has also created speculation over a potential economic divide within the new government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ru/originals/2014/08/turkey-economy-babacan-cabinet-interest-rate.html#|title=Market pressure keeps Babacan in new Turkish Cabinet – Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/171088/ali-babacan-to-stay-in-new-cabinet.html |title=Ali Babacan to stay in new cabinet |accessdate=12 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112163611/http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/171088/ali-babacan-to-stay-in-new-cabinet.html |archivedate=12 November 2014 }}</ref>

Davutoğlu became prime minister at a time of economic slowdown and uncertainty, which he blames on the weak global economy, particularly the [[Eurozone]]. The government slashed economic growth forecasts from 4% to 3.3% in 2014, and from 5% to 4% in 2015. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) also lowered its forecasts from 4% to 3.2% in 2015 and estimated 4% growth in 2016. On 6 November 2014, Davutoğlu announced plans to boost the economy through greater global integration. Reform packages included a 9-point plan to boost the technology, energy, health and tourism sectors. With a GDP of $820&nbsp;billion, a budget deficit of 7%, a current account deficit of 7.9% and an unemployment rate of nearly 10% in 2013, Davutoğlu's government will target a GDP of $1.3&nbsp;trillion, a budget deficit of 5.2%, a current account deficit of 5.2% and an unemployment rate of 7% by 2018.{{cn|date=May 2020}} Davutoğlu has also aimed to reduce the country's dependency of foreign energy imports, and pledged to not pursue a populist economic agenda in the run-up to the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_davutoglu-moves-to-ease-populist-spending-concerns_363718.html|title=Davutoğlu moves to ease populist spending concerns|date=6 November 2014|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=7 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604205442/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_davutoglu-moves-to-ease-populist-spending-concerns_363718.html|archivedate=4 June 2015}}</ref>

Economic confidence declined following what was perceived to be an attempt by the government to shut down [[Bank Asya]], which it claims is linked to the Gülen Movement. The government revoked the Bank's ability to collect taxes on behalf of the state, and the bank subsequently lost 25% of its cash deposits after several firms withdrew more than ₺4&nbsp;billion after a smear campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_the-dispute-over-bank-asya-what-lies-ahead-in-erdogans-turkey_361667.html|title=The dispute over Bank Asya: What lies ahead in Erdoğan's Turkey?|date=15 October 2014|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=7 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112115212/http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_the-dispute-over-bank-asya-what-lies-ahead-in-erdogans-turkey_361667.html|archivedate=12 November 2014}}</ref> The bank was banned for five weeks from trading on the [[Borsa Istanbul|stock exchange]], with the decision raising questions over the government's influence over the legally independent stock exchange authority (BİST).

===Government corruption allegations===
Upon becoming prime minister, Davutoğlu inherited a substantial number of corruption claims against the AKP and the [[Cabinet Erdoğan III|previous Erdoğan government]]. On 1 September, Davutoğlu vowed to pursue a strong fight against corruption as part of his government agenda. His true intentions have been disputed by the two main opposition parties, namely the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) and the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP). CHP leader [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] claimed that Davutoğlu had been appointed as prime minister by Erdoğan in order to end the corruption investigations dating from the [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|17 December 2013 scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_kilicdaroglu-davutoglu-yolsuzluk-dosyalarini-kapatmasi-icin-basbakan-oldu_2241311.html|title=Kılıçdaroğlu: Davutoğlu, yolsuzluk dosyalarını kapatması için Başbakan oldu|publisher=Zaman|accessdate=10 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200128/http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_kilicdaroglu-davutoglu-yolsuzluk-dosyalarini-kapatmasi-icin-basbakan-oldu_2241311.html|archivedate=10 September 2014}}</ref> On 2 September, the [[İstanbul]] Attorney General formally dismissed the cases against 96 suspects, while the MHP claimed that the government was behind the decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meltemhaber.com/?haber,11651/25-aralik-yolsuzluk-ve-rusvet-dosyasi-kapandi|title=25 Aralık yolsuzluk ve rüşvet dosyası kapandı|publisher=Meltem Haber|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> The prospect of Davutoğlu's government taking a strong approach against corruption is therefore doubted by political analysts and opposition members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.todayszaman.com/national_little-hope-ak-party-will-fight-corruption-under-davutoglu-rule_357930.html|title=Little hope AK Party will fight corruption under Davutoğlu rule|work=Today's Zaman|accessdate=10 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910032338/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_little-hope-ak-party-will-fight-corruption-under-davutoglu-rule_357930.html|archive-date=10 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Constitutional reform===
[[File:Presidenta Dilma Rousseff durante encontro bilateral com Primeiro-ministro da Turquia, Ahmet Davutoglu (2).jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu with Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] in November 2014.]]

Davutoğlu has stated that his main priority is to draft a new [[Constitution of Turkey|constitution]] after the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20140828216154|title=Davutoglu says Turkey needs new constitution|work=Saudi Gazette|accessdate=10 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215721/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20140828216154|archivedate=10 September 2014}}</ref> He has called for opposition parties to be more engaged in this process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2014/09/07/davutoglu-calls-on-opposition-parties-to-be-more-involved-in-parliament|title=DAVUTOĞLU CALLS ON OPPOSITION PARTIES TO BE MORE INVOLVED IN PARLIAMENT|work=Daily Sabah|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> He claimed that the current constitution did not enshrine necessary checks and balances or guarantee a stable democratic system, nor did it encourage political participation due to its strict centrist approach.

===Workers' rights===
Turkey has the highest number of workers' deaths within Europe, which is the third highest in the world according to the [[International Labour Organization]]. The Turkish Statistics Office claims that 1,754 workers deaths have occurred between 2009 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Sep-08/269973-turkey-promises-action-plan-over-lift-accident-horror.ashx|title=Turkey promises action plan over lift accident horror|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

Especially after the [[Soma mine disaster]] in 2013, Turkish workers' rights and working conditions had come under heavy international and domestic scrutiny. Davutoğlu's government has pledged to improve worker safety in response to the large number of accidents in mines and construction sites. On 10 September 2014, the government passed a long proposed bill which waived the debts of all the family members of those killed in [[Soma, Manisa|Soma]], gave at least one family member the right to work in a state institution while also granting a "death salary" to them. The new law also limited workers to working a maximum of 36 hours a week and 6 hours a day, as well as reducing the retirement age from 55 to 50 while forcing employers to assign job security experts, doctors and health workers for their employees.<ref name="Daily Sabah">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2014/09/10/148article-omnibus-bill-passes-turkish-parliament|title=148-ARTICLE OMNIBUS BILL PASSES TURKISH PARLIAMENT|work=Daily Sabah|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

On 6 September, an industrial lift accident in a construction site at [[Şişli]], [[İstanbul]] which killed 10 workers renewed outrage regarding the lack of job safety.

===Dismantling the 'parallel state' and legal reforms===
{{main|Turkish government – Gülen Movement conflict}}
Having pledged to continue Erdoğan's fight against [[Fethullah Gülen]] and his Cemaat Movement, Davutoğlu's government conducted large-scale arrests of police officers in an attempt to dismantle Gülen's '[[parallel state]]'. The crackdown on the police force led to arrests of several officers accused of plotting a coup, causing uproar due to the alleged legal mishandling of their cases. In July, the number of officers arrested had already reached 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25527721/|title=25 ilde polislere gözaltı|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> Most of the detained officers were discharged shortly after being arrested after their cases collapsed due to a lack of evidence, leading to questions in regard to the government's true motives.

==Resignation as Prime Minister==
On 5 May 2016, Davutoğlu announced his resignation as leader of the AKP, adding that he would call for an [[2nd Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|Extraordinary Party Congress]] on 22 May 2016 to elect a successor. He added that he would not stand for re-election as party leader, thereby effectively announcing his resignation as [[Prime Minister of Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/why-turkish-prime-minister-had-resign-456067?rm=eu|title=Ahmet Davutoğlu Resigns: Why the Turkish Prime Minister Had to Go|date=5 May 2016|work=Newsweek}}</ref> His resignation was a result of a sharp deterioration in relations with President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], who supports an executive presidential system of government that would result in the dissolution or severe reduction of powers of the [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Office of the Prime Minister]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13746679|title=Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Turkey's ruthless president|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Relationship with Erdoğan===
[[File:Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and George Papandreou, Erzurum January 2011 18.jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu and [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] with former Greek Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] and Foreign Minister [[Dimitris Droutsas]]]]

With opinion divided on whether Davutoğlu would be willing to lead a submissive premiership while President Erdoğan took key government decisions, many observers had noted a growing power struggle between the Prime Minister and President in the lead-up to the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]]. Alleged disputes focused foremost on the AKP parliamentary candidate lists, with both Erdoğan and Davutoğlu allegedly drawing up a different list of candidates. In April 2015, the pro-opposition OdaTV reported that Erdoğan had threatened to put Davutoğlu in a position 'worse than [[Bülent Ecevit|Ecevit]]' if Davutoğlu did not remove 23 candidates who were seen as close to outgoing Deputy Prime Minister [[Bülent Arınç]], to which Davutoğlu obliged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egeninsesi.com/191108-erdogandan_davutogluna_cok_sert_cikis_iddiasi_seni_ecevitten_beter_yaparim|title=Erdoğan'dan Davutoğlu'na çok sert çıkış iddiası: Seni Ecevit'ten beter yaparım!|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> Arınç, who was barred from standing as a candidate, openly criticised Erdoğan for getting involved with the government's affairs regarding the [[solution process]] with [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|Kurdish militants]] and caused a public polemic between himself, Erdoğan and [[Ankara]] Mayor [[Melih Gökçek]] as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internethaber.com/bulent-arinc-ve-melih-gokcek-arasinda-ne-oldu-775893h.htm|title=Bülent Arınç ve Melih Gökçek arasında ne oldu?|work=Internethaber|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>

Before the election campaign, Erdoğan chaired a cabinet meeting in January, with a picture of the meeting causing widespread commotion on Twitter due to Davutoğlu perceivably looking grumpy during the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/tr/politika/452014--bakanlar-kurulu-cumhurbaskanligi-sarayinda-toplanacak|title=Bakanlar Kurulu'na Erdoğan başkanlık etti|work=Anadolu Ajansı}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/article-172382-Erdogan-chairs-Turkey-cabinet-for-1st-time-as-president|title=Erdogan chairs Turkey cabinet for 1st time as president – WORLD – geo.tv|date=19 January 2015|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> Despite having the constitutional right, the chairing of a cabinet meeting by a President was a rare ordeal in Turkish history, with the opposition demanding a legitimate reason for why Erdoğan felt the need to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/tr/haberler/443184--bakanlar-kuruluna-baskanlik-eden-cumhurbaskanlari|title=Bakanlar Kurulu'na 5 cumhurbaşkanı başkanlık etmişti|author=Anadolu Ajansı (c) 2011|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> The President's decision to chair the cabinet was attributed to providing 'a greater pool of ideas'. With journalists hinting at a growing rift between Erdoğan and Davutoğlu, Davutoğlu made a statement praising Erdoğan and saying that his power as prime minister had not been weakened by the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/-erdogan-baskanlik-etti-diye/siyaset/detay/1999870/default.htm|title=Erdoğan başkanlık etti diye gücüm azalmaz|date=17 January 2015|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> He added further that individuals who were looking for signs of disagreements within the AKP would 'yet again be disappointed', adding that there was no rift between the government and the presidency.

===April–May 2016 disagreements===
{{main|Pelican files}}
By late April and early May 2016, relations between Davutoğlu and Erdoğan were said to have reached breaking point. An anonymous list produced by Erdoğan supporters on a [[WordPress]] blog, named the ''[[Pelican files]]'', detailed 27 different sources of disagreements between the Prime Minister and President and caused their relations to significantly deteriorate publicly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/erdogan-davutoglu-geriliminde-son-perde-pelikan-dosyasi-1212165/|title=Erdoğan-Davutoğlu geriliminde son perde: Pelikan Dosyası}}</ref> The list included allegations that Davutoğlu was critical of Erdoğan's desire for an executive presidential system of government. The files also indicated that Davutoğlu opposed Erdoğan's policy of pursuing a military-only solution to combating the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK).<ref name="bbc.co.uk1">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36213401|title=Turkey PM Ahmet Davutoglu to quit amid reports of Erdogan rift|work=BBC News}}</ref> Further allegations included disagreements over the AKP's candidate lists for the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|7 June]] and [[November 2015 Turkish general election|1 November]] general elections, as well as the list of Central Executive Decision Committee candidates fielded in the party's [[5th Justice and Development Party Ordinary Congress|5th Ordinary Congress]]. Davutoğlu was also accused of attempting to establish his own media outlet while giving interviews to existing outlets that had been critical of Erdoğan. General disagreements over government legislation, such as a botched Transparency Law, were also identified as sources of disagreement. A journalist alleged that Davutoğlu had already submitted his resignation earlier for unrelated reasons, but that this had been turned down by Erdoğan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.t24.com.tr/haber/fatih-altayli-davutoglu-istifa-etti-erdogan-kabul-etmedi,338755|title=Fatih Altaylı: Davutoğlu istifa etti, Erdoğan kabul etmedi!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/526340/Fatih_Altayli_canli_yayinda_acikladi__Davutoglu_istifasini_verdi....html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi – Fatih Altaylı canlı yayında açıkladı: Davutoğlu istifasını verdi...|date=2 May 2016}}</ref>

In late April, the AKP Central Executive Decision Committee (MKYK) voted to strip the powers of the party leader to appoint provincial and district party executives. Although Davutoğlu claimed that he had long been in favour of the decision, it was alleged that Erdoğan had phoned the Committee members and instructed them to relieve the party leader of this right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1232607-iste-ak-parti-mkykda-alinan-kararin-perde-arkasi|title=İşte AK Parti MKYK'da alınan yetki kararının perde arkası – Gündem Haberleri|date=30 April 2016|work=haberturk.com}}</ref> Following the release of the pelican files and the MKYK's decision, Davutoğlu gave a speech to the party's parliamentary group, claiming that he would not yield to 'games of virtual charlatans' and that he would 'trample over any office' if necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/526619/Basbakan_Davutoglu_ndan_istifa_sinyali.html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi – Başbakan Davutoğlu'ndan istifa sinyali|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> The speech was shorter than usual and was received by some commentators as a 'resignation speech', with politicians close to Erdoğan responding on Twitter with pro-Erdoğan tweets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/akp-grup-toplantisi-12-1213961/|title=AKP grup toplantısı}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/davutoglu-nun-pelikan-cikisi-sonrasi-saray-dan-ilginc-paylasimlar-111075.html|title=Davutoğlu'nun 'Pelikan' çıkışı sonrası Saray'dan ilginç|date=3 May 2016|work=birgun.net}}</ref> It was reported that Erdoğan's staunch refusal to approve bureaucratic appointments made by Davutoğlu as Prime Minister had effectively caused a governmental deadlock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/davutogluna-darbe-uzerine-darbe-1209712/|title=Davutoğlu'na darbe üzerine darbe}}</ref>

===Meeting with Erdoğan and resignation speech===
On 4 May 2016, Davutoğlu met Erdoğan at the [[Presidential Complex]] in what the Presidency described as a 'routine meeting'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karar.com/gundem-haberleri/cumhurbaskanligi-kaynaklari-haftalik-olagan-gorusme-sona-erdi-112048|title=Cumhurbaşkanlığı kaynakları: Haftalık olağan görüşme sona erdi|author=Hazar Şahsuvar|date=4 May 2016|work=Karar.com}}</ref> The meeting lasted for 1 hour and 40 minutes, having been held a day before the usual weekly meeting between the Prime Minister and President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/05/05/cumhurbaskani-erdogan-basbakan-davutoglu-gorusmesi-sona-erdi|title=Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan Başbakan Davutoğlu görüşmesi sona erdi|date=5 May 2016|work=Sabah|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> It was reported that Davutoğlu had been convinced to not submit his resignation at the meeting, though surprised media commentators by arriving at the Presidential Complex without the usual briefcase or documents.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Shortly after the meeting, it was announced that the AKP would hold an Extraordinary Congress in late May and that Davutoğlu would not stand as a candidate, confirming that a last-minute agreement between the two men had not been reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/gazeteler/haber/1932274-erdogan-davutoglu-gorusmesi-dunya-basininda|title=Erdoğan-Davutoğlu görüşmesi dünya basınında|author=Haber7|work=Haber7}}</ref>

A day later, Davutoğlu met with the party's MKYK for a final time before announcing that the party would hold an [[2nd Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|Extraordinary Congress]] on 22 May. He stated that he would not run as a candidate, effectively confirming his resignation as party leader and Prime Minister. He claimed that he would not seek to divide the party after stepping down and continue as an MP, pledging his unwavering support for Erdoğan and his political agenda. In an openly critical statement, he also claimed that his resignation did not arise out of choice, but had become a necessity.

The main opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) referred to the resignation as the '4 May Palace Coup', claiming that Erdoğan had toppled a Prime Minister who had been elected for a four-year term just seven months before with 49.5% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/kilicdaroglu-bu-bir-darbedir-1217624/|title=Darbenin adı 4 Mayıs Saray Darbesi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.com.tr/turkiye/chp-lideri-kilicdaroglu-davutoglunun-kararini-degerlendirdi,-ybFFDLi-UO5lhCMBOYztQ?_ref=infinite|title=Gündem – Türkiye Haberleri ve Gerçek Gündem – NTV|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> Attributing Erdoğan's indifference to the national will to his personal desire for greater power, CHP leader [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] wished Davutoğlu farewell and called for all democrats to 'resist' the coup, though some CHP members of parliament such as [[Sezgin Tanrıkulu]] received Davutoğlu's resignation more critically, denouncing his 21-month premiership as the 'bloodiest in Turkey's history'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/528323/CHP_de_helallik_catlagi.html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi – CHP'de helallik çatlağı|date=5 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/528213/Kilicdaroglu_ndan_direnis_cagrisi.html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi – Kılıçdaroğlu'ndan direniş çağrısı|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>

The [[White House]] made a statement saying that they did not expect any change in [[Turkish-American relations]] due to Davutoğlu's departure, calling him a 'good ally' to the United States while renewing calls for greater freedom of the press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/kultur-sanat/diger/disney-filmlerini-tim-burton-yonetirse?page=1|title=Disney filmlerini Tim Burton yönetirse...|date=5 May 2016|work=CNN Türk}}</ref> General [[John R.

The [[German government]] issued a statement stating that they would work equally well with Turkey's next Prime Minister as they had done with Davutoğlu. A government spokesperson emphasised that the [[EU-Turkey relations#EU-Turkey Deal on Migrant Crisis|EU-Turkey Deal on the Migrant Crisis]] was between Turkey and the EU, not between the EU and Davutoğlu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/alman-hukumetinden-davutoglu-aciklamasi/567720|title=Alman hükümetinden Davutoğlu açıklaması|work=Anadolu Ajansı|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> Following Davutoğlu's resignation, Erdoğan made a statement criticising the [[European Union]] and stated that Turkey would not change their anti-terror laws in return for visa-free entry to [[Schengen Area]], again causing [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|negotiations for EU membership]] to stall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36229468|title=Turkey's Erdogan takes tough EU line after PM quits|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>

The [[Turkish lira]] fell sharply to the US dollar shortly after the announcement. By the end of 4 May, the Lira stood at ₺2.97 to the Dollar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odatv.com/dolar-ucuyor-0405161200.html|title=Dolar uçtu|work=odatv.com}}</ref> The credit agency [[Moody's]] claimed that Davutoğlu's departure, as well as general political instability in Turkey, would negatively effect the country's credit rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zamanamerika.com/haberler/manset/moodysten-davutoglu-istifasi-sonrasi-ilk-aciklama/|title=Moody's'ten Davutoğlu istifası sonrası ilk açıklama – Zaman Amerika|author=Orhan Akkurt|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>

International media commentators overwhelmingly viewed Davutoğlu's resignation as a sign of Erdoğan's intolerance of any dissent towards his aims of turning Turkey into an executive presidency and his desire to exercise greater control over the government despite his current ceremonial position as a non-executive President.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Both Domestic and international journalists agreed that the candidate set to succeed Davutoğlu, with key potential candidates including Erdoğan son-in-law [[Berat Albayrak]] and close supporters [[Binali Yıldırım]], [[Mustafa Şentop]], [[Mehmet Müezzinoğlu]], [[Efkan Ala]] and [[Bekir Bozdağ]], would be far more compliant with Erdoğan's political agenda.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/><ref name="bbc.co.uk1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/527169/_4_Mayis_Saray_darbesi.html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi – No. 4 Mayıs Saray darbesi|date=4 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/527782/Davutoglu_nun_yerine_dort_aday.html|title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi – Davutoğlu'nun yerine dört aday|date=4 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36205210|title=Turkish leadership split spoils the party|work=BBC News}}</ref> Commentators further claimed that Erdoğan's long-desired 'presidential system' had ''de facto'' been implemented after Davutoğlu's resignation, since his successor would be expected to effectively delegate all his or her Prime Ministerial decision-making duties to the President while focusing on policy implementation only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yenimesaj.com.tr/gundem/baskanlik-sistemi-fiilen-basladi-h13027019.html|title=Başkanlık sistemi fiilen başladı|author=YENİ MESAJ|date=5 May 2016|work=YENİ MESAJ}}</ref>

== Future Party ==
{{Main articles|Future Party (Turkey)}}
In December 2019, Davutoğlu founded his own party, the [[Future Party (Turkey)|Future Party]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Gelecek Partisi'', '''GP''') as a center-right conservative party. The party advocates a return to a parliamentary system and a new constitution. 

==Electoral record==
[[File:AKP rally Ümraniye 2015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Davutoğlu speaking at an AKP rally in [[Ümraniye]], [[İstanbul]] on 3 June 2015, ahead of the 2015 general election.]]

As Prime Minister, Davutoğlu contested two general elections. He was an AKP parliamentary candidate in [[2011 Turkish general election|2011]] and the leader of the AKP in both the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015]] and [[November 2015 Turkish general election|November 2015]] general elections.

===General elections===
{{see also|2011 Turkish general election|Turkish general election, June 2015}}
Davutoğlu was made Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2009, despite not being a member of parliament. He was elected as an MP for [[Konya (electoral district)|Konya]] in the 2011 general election as the first candidate on the AKP's provincial party list. His party won just under 70% of the vote, the highest the AKP won in any province, gaining 11 of the 14 seats up for election. He resumed his role as Foreign Minister after [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] formed his [[Cabinet Erdoğan III|third government]].

Elected leader in the [[2014 Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|2014 Extraordinary Congress]], Davutoğlu led the AKP through the 2015 general election. During the campaign, Tayyip Erdoğan (who was then President and therefore constitutionally required to exercise political neutrality) held several rallies under the guise of 'public openings', where he was covertly accused of campaigning for the AKP. As such, media commentators regarded Davutoğlu to be leading only 50% of his party's election campaign. The election results proved to be a disappointment for the AKP, with the party winning 40.87% of the vote (a decrease of almost 9% since 2011) and losing their parliamentary majority for the first time since the party's first election in [[2002 Turkish general election|2002]]. With 258 seats (276 needed for a majority), Davutoğlu nevertheless made a balcony speech declaring victory at the AKP headquarters in [[Ankara]].
