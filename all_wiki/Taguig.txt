'''{{PH wikidata|name}}''' ({{IPA-tl|taˈɡiɡ|pron}}) is the seventh most populous city in the [[Philippines]] with a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}} Located in the western shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the city is known for the [[Bonifacio Global City]], one of the leading financial centers of the Philippines. Originally a fishing village during the Spanish and American colonial periods, the municipality experienced rapid growth when former military reservations were converted by the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA) into mixed-use planned communities and financial centers. Taguig was converted from a municipality into a [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|highly urbanized city]] with the passage of Republic Act No. 8487 in 2004.

The city is politically subdivided into 28 barangays: [[Bagumbayan, Taguig|Bagumbayan]], [[Bambang, Taguig|Bambang]], Calzada, Central Bicutan, [[Central Signal Village]], [[Fort Bonifacio (barangay)|Fort Bonifacio]], Hagonoy, Ibayo Tipas, Katuparan, Ligid Tipas, Lower Bicutan, [[Maharlika Village]], [[Napindan]], [[New Lower Bicutan]], North Daang Hari, North Signal Village, Palingon Tipas, [[Pinagsama]], San Miguel, [[Santa Ana, Taguig|Santa Ana]], South Daang Hari, [[South Signal Village]], Tanyag, [[Tuktukan]], Ususan, [[Upper Bicutan]], Wawa, and [[Western Bicutan]]. The city is also divided into two legislative districts: [[Legislative district of Pateros–Taguig|Pateros & Taguig]] (which includes the [[Pateros|Municipality of Pateros]]) and [[Legislative district of Taguig|Taguig]], for its representation in the [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] and the election of city council members.

==Etymology==

The original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as "''mga taga-giik''," ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "rice thresher") and the settlement as "''pook ng mga taga-giik''." Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found "taga-giik" difficult to pronounce. "Tagui-ig" was later shortened to its current form "Taguig".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>

== History ==
Before the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].

Taguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel López de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate "[[pueblo]]" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.

During that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and "sawali" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, "Kapitan" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.

During the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig "revolutionarios" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.

The defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Biñan]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905, with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.

It was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a {{cvt|25.78|km2}} property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.

The town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.

=== Cityhood ===
In 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004, ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004.

=== Present ===
In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.

In 2011, during 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a “ProbinSyudad” because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.

In 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].

A new, "state-of-the-art" 17-storey Taguig City Hall is currently being built in Barangay Ususan along Cayetano Boulevard and is expected to be completed in 2021.<ref>https://www.taguig.gov.ph/soon-to-rise-new-taguig-city-hall Soon to rise: New Taguig City Hall (City Government of Taguig)</ref> This will replace the current city hall in Barangay Tuktukan that was built in 1959 and was renovated thrice.<ref>https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1146513/new-17-story-taguig-city-hall-to-be-completed-in-2021 New 17-story Taguig city hall to be completed in 2021 (Inquirer.net)</ref>

==Geography==

Taguig is located on the western shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest [[lake]] in the Philippines. Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], runs through the northern half of the city, while the Napindan River, another tributary of Pasig, forms the natural border between Taguig in Pasig. A relatively small area of the city called Ibayo Napindan is located north of the river, adjoining the disputed territories between Pasig, Taguig and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] in [[Rizal (province)|Rizal Province]]. The city has an area of 53.67 square kilometers.

===Climate===

The climate of Taguig is characterized by two types of season: dry season from November to April, and wet season from May to October. Rainfall is less evenly distributed.

===Territorial disputes===

{{see also|Fort Bonifacio boundary dispute}}

[[File:Bonifacio Global City contested between Taguig and Makati.svg|thumb|Contested territories between Makati, Pateros and Taguig.]]

Taguig, [[Makati]] and [[Pateros]] have fought over the jurisdiction of [[Fort Bonifacio]] and nearby places. In 2003, the Pasig Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled that Fort Bonifacio and Pinagsama Village belongs to Taguig. In 2011, the Pasig RTC also ruled that the "embo" barangays (Cembo, South Cembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Comembo, Pembo), as well as Rizal and Pitogo, are part of Taguig since they were formerly part of the military reservation. Pateros also claims the "embo" barangays, parts of Taguig and Fort Bonifacio, but the municipality's petition were dismissed by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeals stopped Taguig from exercising jurisdiction in the said areas in 2013. On 2017, the Court of Appeals upheld its final decision that Fort Bonifacio belongs to Taguig.

Taguig is also involved in a dispute between Pasig and Taytay, Rizal over a large area which covers Ibayo Napindan, Pinagbuhatan, and Lupang Arendra.
