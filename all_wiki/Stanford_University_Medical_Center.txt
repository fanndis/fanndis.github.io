==Stanford Hospital==
Stanford Health Care is located at 500 Pasteur Drive, [[Stanford, California]]. It is consistently ranked as one of the best hospitals in the United States by [[US News and World Report]] and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]]. The facility, located at the north end of the university campus, includes the main hospital building, Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Center, Blake Wilbur Building, Boswell Building, Hoover Pavilion, Neurosciences Health Center, and the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences building, as well as miscellaneous professional offices & departments of the [[Stanford University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] and Stanford Health Care, plus the recent expansions. The roof of the main building contains a landing facility and Life Flight helicopter.<ref name="aboutus"/>

[[Stanford Hospital and Clinics|Stanford Health Care]] provides both general acute care services and tertiary medical care for patients locally, nationally and internationally. Organ transplantation, cancer diagnosis and treatment, cardiovascular medicine and surgery, and neurosciences are clinical specialties of worldwide renown. Among its many achievements, the first combined [[heart-lung transplant]] in the world was successfully completed at Stanford University Medical Center<ref name="aboutus">{{cite web | title = About Us – Stanford Health Care | url = https://stanfordhealthcare.org/about-us.html| accessdate = 2007-06-13}}</ref> in 1981. The hospital plays a key role in the training of physicians and other medical professionals. It provides a clinical environment for the medical school's researchers as they study ways to translate new knowledge into effective patient care. Full-time Stanford faculty and community physicians make up the hospital medical staff.

Stanford Hospital is home to a Level I trauma center. It became a trauma center in 1986 and first received [[American College of Surgeons]] certification as a Level I trauma center in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stanford Hospital & Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford Re-verified as a Level I Trauma Center|url=https://stanfordhealthcare.org/newsroom/articles/2013/lpch-trauma-center.html|website=Stanfordhealthcare.org|date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>

===History===
The hospital's history began with the foundation of the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children (the "Con Home") in 1911. When the Stanford Medical School moved south from [[San Francisco]] in 1959, the Stanford Hospital was established and was co-owned with the city of [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]; it was then known as Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Center. It was purchased by the University in 1968 and renamed.

The [[Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine]] opened in 1989; the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford opened in 1991; the Richard M. Lucas Center for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Imaging opened in 1992.  In 1999, Stanford University approved a $185 million, five-year plan to improve the 40-year-old School of Medicine facility. The Center for Clinical Sciences Research (CCSR) opened in 2000.  The [[James H. Clark Center|Clark Center]] for interdisciplinary research and bioengineering opened in 2004.

In 2009, the Stanford outpatient clinics, which were running out of expansion room, were relocated to the Stanford Medicine Outpatient Center, a large new site in [[Redwood City, California]] formerly occupied by the corporate headquarters of [[Excite@Home]]. The buildings were extensively remodeled for medical use to provide facilities the clinics' old homes lacked. For example, the Sleep Medicine Center's new sleep lab has thorough [[soundproofing]] and can accommodate a few [[morbidly obese]] patients. In 2018, these outpatient facilities were expanded to receive the main campuses outgoing Digestive Health Center and endoscopy suite, to make room for the new expansions/renovations at the main Stanford Hospital, in addition to nearly doubling the existing imaging facilities and adding an external parking structure at the Stanford Outpatient Center.

In 2011 actor [[Gerard Butler]] was rushed to the hospital after suffering a surfing incident in [[Mavericks, California]] during the filming of the movie "[[Chasing Mavericks|Of Men and Mavericks]]."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Harp|first=Justin|date=2011-12-20|title=Gerard Butler injured in surfing accident|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a356840/gerard-butler-injured-while-filming-of-men-and-mavericks-stunt/|access-date=2020-11-10|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB}}</ref> Butler was stable and released from the hospital later that week.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Orzeck|first=Kurt|date=2011-12-20|title=Gerard Butler Hospitalized After On-Set Surfing Accident|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS208038802520111220|access-date=2020-11-10}}</ref>

The inpatient facilities remain on the main campus, which as of 2019, has undergone another round of major expansions, renovations, and revitalization, including a brand-new inpatient structure, renovation of the old inpatient building, renovations of the Cancer Center and Blake Wilbur Building, and brand new emergency facilities, all located on a plot adjacent to the existing hospital. These major renovations are part of Stanford University's long-term master planning for renovation and medical advancement, which have included past projects such as the [[Lucile Packard Children's Hospital|Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford]] and the Stanford Neurosciences Health Center.<ref>Stanford website and master plan booth on campus</ref>

==== Life Flight ====
The Stanford Life Flight program began May 1, 1984. Its aircraft is an [[EC 145]] helicopter that can fly under both visual and instrument flight rules, allowing for response to calls in nearly any weather. The aircraft accommodates two patients with two [[flight nurse]]s, or one patient with up to four caregivers, plus the pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stanfordhealthcare.org/health-care-professionals/lifeflight.html|title=Lifeflight|website=Stanfordhealthcare.org|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>

===Staff===
The hospital's medical staff numbers 1,910 with an additional 850 interns and residents, as well as nearly 1,500 registered nurses and approximately 610 licensed beds. Stanford Clinics, the group practice of most faculty physicians of Stanford University School of Medicine, includes 493 full-time faculty physicians. Their areas of expertise range from primary care to the most advanced medical and surgical specialties. Stanford Clinics offer more than 100 specialty and subspecialty service areas. Under the supervision of faculty physicians, Stanford medical students and residents participate in patient care in most specialties. The clinics participate in preferred provider health care programs as well as Medicare and MediCal.
