In 2008, Greenhouse accepted an offer from ''The Times'' for an early retirement at the end of the Supreme Court session in the summer of 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/5575780.html |title=NYT's Greenhouse Takes Buyout Offer | newspaper = [[Houston Chronicle]] | date = 2008-02-27 |accessdate=2008-02-28 }}</ref><ref name=LegalTimes20080612>{{cite news | url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2008/06/goodbye-to-gree.html | title=A Goodbye for Greenhouse | publisher=[[Legal Times]] | author=Tony Mauro | author-link=Tony Mauro | date=June 12, 2008 | accessdate=2008-06-15 }}</ref> Seven of the nine sitting Justices attended a goodbye party for Greenhouse on June 12, 2008.<ref name=LegalTimes20080612/>  She continues to blog for ''The Times'' in the "Opinionator" section.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/linda-greenhouse/|title=The Opinion Pages - Opinionator - Linda Greenhouse|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2015-03-28}}</ref>

In 2010, Greenhouse and co-author [[Reva Siegel]] put out a book on the development of the abortion debate prior to the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling on the subject: ''Before Roe v. Wade''. This was largely a selection of primary documents, though with some commentary.

Greenhouse criticized US policies and actions at [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Abu Ghraib]], and [[Haditha]] in a 2006 speech at Harvard University.<ref name="folkenflik" /> In it, Greenhouse said she started crying a few years back at a [[Simon & Garfunkel]] concert because her [[Baby Boomers|generation]] hadn't done a better job of running the country than previous generations.<ref name="radcliffe" />

===Awards and prizes===
Greenhouse was awarded the [[Pulitzer prize|Pulitzer Prize in Journalism]] ([[Beat Reporting]]) in 1998 "for her consistently illuminating coverage of the United States Supreme Court."<ref name="pulitzer">{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/year/1998/beat-reporting/bio/|title=Pulitzer Prize Winners 1998: Beat Reporting - Biography|publisher=Pulitzer.org|accessdate=2007-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040858/http://www.pulitzer.org/year/1998/beat-reporting/bio/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref>  In 2004, she received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/presspol/goldsmith_awards/career_award.htm | title = Goldsmith Career Award | accessdate = 2007-10-07 | publisher = The Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, [[Harvard University]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070901104854/http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/presspol/goldsmith_awards/career_award.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-01}}</ref> and the [[John Chancellor Award]] for Excellence in Journalism.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1165270069774/page/1175295287807/simplepage.htm | title = John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism - Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism | accessdate = 2007-10-07 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111110555/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/cs/ContentServer/jrn/1165270069774/page/1175295287807/simplepage.htm | archivedate = 2008-01-11 }}</ref> She was a Radcliffe Institute Medal winner in 2006.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Linda Greenhouse '68 Wins 2006 Radcliffe Institute Medal | publisher = Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, [[Harvard University]] | date = 2006-06-08 | url = http://www.radcliffe.edu/about/news/pr/show_pr.php?pr_name=060608_greenhouse.html | accessdate = 2007-10-07 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901113024/http://www.radcliffe.edu/about/news/pr/show_pr.php?pr_name=060608_greenhouse.html | archivedate = 2006-09-01 }}</ref>

When she was at Radcliffe, she said in a speech given in 2006, "I was the Harvard stringer for the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', which regularly printed, and paid me for, my accounts of student unrest and other newsworthy events at Harvard. But when it came time during my senior year to look for a job in journalism, the ''Herald'' would not even give me an interview, and neither would the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', because these newspapers had no interest in hiring women."<ref name=radcliffe>{{cite web | url = http://www.radcliffe.edu/alumnae/reunions/4and9/greenhouse.php | title = 2006 Radcliffe Institute Medalist Linda Greenhouse '68 | publisher = Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826005101/http://www.radcliffe.edu/alumnae/reunions/4and9/greenhouse.php | archivedate = 2007-08-26 }}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{Undue weight section|date=February 2016}}
Greenhouse has expressed her personal views as an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and critic of conservative religious values,<ref name=folkenflik/> and a 2006 report on [[NPR]] questioned whether this compromised the appearance that she maintains journalistic neutrality on such matters. ''New York Times'' public editor [[Daniel Okrent]] said that he has never received a single complaint of bias in Greenhouse's coverage.<ref name=folkenflik>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6146693|author=Folkenflik, David|title=Critics Question Reporter's Airing of Personal Views|publisher=[[All Things Considered]]|date=26 September 2006|accessdate=2007-08-09}}</ref>

===Journalism conference, 2007===
On August 9, 2007, a television crew from [[C-SPAN]] was forbidden to film a panel discussion at a meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. Greenhouse had told organizers that she would not be able answer questions as fully and frankly if the session were filmed.<ref name="BandC">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/journalism-educators-bar-c-span-cameras/30493|author=John Eggerton|title=Journalism Educators Bar C-SPAN Cameras|magazine=Broadcasting & Cable|date=10 August 2007|accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref> The vice president of programming at C-SPAN, Terence Murphy, questioned the decision: "If professors of journalism and working journalists taking part in a journalism education conference don't stand up for open media access to public policy discussions, who will?"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Beckerman  |first=Gal|date=10 August 2007|title=The Greenhouse Effect (Updated):Hurricane Linda blows C-SPAN cameras away|journal=Columbia Journalism Review|publisher=Graduate School of Journalism, Columbia University|url=https://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_greenhouse_effect.php}}</ref>

===Suggestions of conflict of interest, 2008===
[[M. Edward Whelan III|Ed Whelan]], writing in a blog associated with ''[[National Review]]'', suggested that Greenhouse had an obligation to her readers to inform them when she reported on a Supreme Court case that her husband, [[Eugene Fidell]], had submitted an [[amicus curae|amicus]] brief:<ref name="Bench Memos">{{cite web|url=http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzFlN2IwMWViOTYzYjQ2NDg0MDIyOTlmYWEyNjIzYWU|author=Ed Whelan|author-link=M.

Rumsfeld|''Hamdan'']] case. Fidell also submitted an amicus brief in the [[Boumediene et al v. Bush|''Boumediene'']] case when it was at the D.C. Circuit level before it went to the Supreme Court. [[Clark Hoyt]], the public editor of the ''New York Times'', opined that the paper "should have clued in readers" to Greenhouse's conflict, but defended the neutrality of her coverage.<ref name="NYTPubEd">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/opinion/20pubed.html?pagewanted=all|author=Clark Hoyt|title=Public and Private Lives, Intersecting |newspaper=New York Times|date=20 January 2008}}</ref>

[[Emily Bazelon]] and [[Dahlia Lithwick]], writing in ''[[Slate magazine|Slate]]'', complained that the ''New York Times'' "had failed to stand up" for Greenhouse and defended Greenhouse from Whelan's criticism.<ref name=Slate20080122>{{cite magazine

| quote = Whelan didn't point to any concrete problem with Greenhouse's handling of these cases. That should be easier to do than with almost any other reporter, given that Greenhouse relies primarily on court filings and oral arguments that are publicly available in their entirety, as Yale law professor Judith Resnik points out to us. Unable to point to any actual bias, Whelan resorts to the petulant claim that the effect of Fidell's involvement in the detainee cases 'would be impossible to separate ‚Ä¶ from the broader political bias that pervades so much of Greenhouse's reporting.
