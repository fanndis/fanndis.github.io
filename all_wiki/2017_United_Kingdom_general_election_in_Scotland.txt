The '''2017 United Kingdom general election in Scotland''' was held on Thursday 8 June 2017; all 59 seats were contested under the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] electoral system.

The general election in [[Scotland]] was fought in the aftermath of the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], in which the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) won a third term in government but lost its overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. At that election, the [[Scottish Conservatives]] increased their number of MSPs, overtaking [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] as the largest opposition party. The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU referendum]] was held a month later on Thursday 23 June, and the final result was for the United Kingdom to leave the EU; despite Scotland voting 62.0% for 'Remain'. Negotiations were due to begin shortly since [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] in March 2017, which was expected to dominate the snap general election campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/britain-gears-up-for-one-issue-election-1492536807 |title=Brexit Set to Dominate U.K.'s Snap Election |last=Fidler |first=Stephen |date=18 April 2017 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

In line with the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], an election had not been due until 7 May 2020, but a call for a [[snap election]] by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]] received the necessary [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in a 522-13 vote in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 19 April 2017.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-39628713 |title=Theresa May seeks general election |date=18 April 2017 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=18 April 2017}}</ref> The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which has governed nationally since [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], was defending a majority of 17<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/ |title=Current State of the Parties |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> against the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|official opposition]]. The third-largest party was the SNP, which had won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].

The election resulted in the SNP remaining the largest single party in Scotland, despite losing 21 seats to pro-union candidates. This marked a 13% drop in support for the SNP, down to 36.9% of the vote. The Conservatives, at 28.6%, doubled their share of the vote and won 13 seats, while Labour won seven seats and the Liberal Democrats four seats. The Conservatives recorded their best result in Scotland since [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] (in terms of seats won) or [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]] (in terms of share of the popular vote). Until this election the Conservatives had not been the second-largest party in Scotland since [[1992 United Kingdom general election in Scotland|1992]] and had not been the largest [[Unionism in Scotland|unionist]] party in Scotland since [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]].

Defeated SNP MPs included: former SNP leader and [[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Alex Salmond]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000037 |title=Results for the Gordon constituency |accessdate=2018-04-23 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> SNP Westminster leader [[Angus Robertson]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000046 |title=Results for the Moray constituency |accessdate=2018-04-23 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> SNP Chief Whip [[Mike Weir (politician)|Mike Weir]];<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000004 |title=Results for the Angus constituency |accessdate=2018-04-23 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> as well as [[John Nicolson (politician)|John Nicolson]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000018 |title=Results for the Dunbartonshire East constituency |accessdate=2018-04-23 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> and [[Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000050 |title=Results for Orchil & South Perthshire constituency |accessdate=2018-04-23 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Commentators suggested that the election might reduce the SNP's case for a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second referendum on Scottish independence]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Simon |last2=Henderson |first2=Barney |title=Scotland election results: Alex Salmond defeated and SNP suffer huge losses as Tory chances boosted north of the border |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/08/scotland-election-results-live-will-snp-nicola-sturgeon-do/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=9 June 2017 |date=8 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=General election 2017: SNP lose a third of seats amid Tory surge |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40192707|accessdate=9 June 2017 |date=9 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Natalie |last2=Dickie |first2=Mure |title=Scottish election results strike blow to SNP plans for IndyRef2 |url=https://www.ft.com/content/3bc5642e-4c96-11e7-919a-1e14ce4af89b |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=8 June 2017}}</ref> Following the election, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that her party's plans for a second referendum were 'undoubtedly' a factor in the election results. The SNP also abandoned its fundraiser for a possible referendum after raising only half of its £1,000,000 target, just over a week before its preset deadline.<ref>{{cite news |title=SNP removes independence referendum fundraising page |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40260769 |publisher=BBC News |date=13 June 2017}}</ref>

==Political context==
Following a [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum held on Scottish independence in 2014]] which saw 44.7% of voters in Scotland vote for Scotland to become an independent state and 55.3% vote for Scotland to remain a part of the United Kingdom, the SNP won 56 of the 59 UK Parliamentary seats in Scotland at the 2015 UK general election, campaigning on a manifesto focusing on bringing greater devolved powers to Scotland following [[Smith Commission|a promise]] made by the three main unionist parties in Scotland to bring more devolved powers to the country should it reject independence.<ref name="SNPManifesto2015">{{cite web|title=SNP Manifesto 2015|url=http://votesnp.com/docs/manifesto.pdf|website=SNP|access-date=25 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426063840/http://votesnp.com/docs/manifesto.pdf|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The SNP manifesto at the 2015 general election repeatedly stated that "The SNP will always support independence - but that is not what this election is about".<ref name="SNPManifesto2015" />

Labour only returned a single MP at [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]]; a reduction of 40 seats compared to the previous election. The party lost out heavily to the SNP in working-class areas around the [[Central Belt|Scottish Central Belt]], with Scottish Labour's safest constituency ([[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]]) returning the largest swing at the general election for any seat in the UK with 39.3% from Labour to SNP. The party performed best in more affluent constituencies, with then-Scottish Labour leader [[Jim Murphy]] missing out in his former constituency of [[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]] by just 3,718 votes. Labour's next closest result was at [[Edinburgh North and Leith (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh North and Leith]], where they missed out to the SNP by 5,597 votes, and in [[East Lothian (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]], where the SNP polled ahead of Labour by 6,803 votes.

The Scottish Liberal Democrats lost 10 of their 11 Westminster seats from [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], with their safest seat in the UK - [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] - remaining as the only Liberal Democrat seat in Scotland. They marginally lost out to the SNP in [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dunbartonshire]], where former Lib Dem MP [[Jo Swinson]] lost out to the SNP by 2,167 votes. Among those to lose their seat at the election were: former Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]] and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, [[Danny Alexander]]. The Liberal Democrats finished in third place at [[Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk]] and [[West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (UK Parliament constituency)|West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine]], seats which they had held at the previous election.

The [[Scottish Conservative Party]] had not held a majority of Scottish seats at a general election since [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955]] and lost all Scottish representation at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. Since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], the party had held only one Scottish seat in the House of Commons. In 2005, following the re-organisation of Scottish constituencies, that seat was [[Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale]], a mostly rural constituency near the Scottish Borders. In 2015, its share of the vote in Scotland decreased by 1.8% but managed to retain Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, as its only Scottish seat. It had been reported the party could gain [[Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://may2015.com/ideas/the-tories-could-win-more-seats-in-scotland-than-labour-or-the-lib-dems/|title=The Tories could win more seats in Scotland than Labour or the Lib Dems|work=May2015: 2015 General Election Guide}}</ref> a seat which they lost out to the Scottish National Party by a meagre 0.6% of the vote.

The SNP polled slightly under half of the votes, 49.97%, in Scotland at the 2015 general election; the largest vote share at a general election in Scotland for a party since the Conservatives won a majority of the popular vote, 50.1%, in [[Elections in Scotland#1955|1955]].

The impact of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU referendum]] and a [[proposed second Scottish independence referendum]] was a large theme at the snap 2017 general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39632813 |title=Election 2017: How the battle is different in Scotland |publisher=BBC News |date=2017-04-19 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}</ref> The SNP incorrectly predicted that many pro-union voters would switch allegiance to the party in order to remain within the European Union.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Polling from ''[[YouGov]]'' suggests people moving towards independence as a result of [[Brexit]] would be offset by the number of previously pro-independence Leave voters saying they would vote against independence as a result of Brexit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/why-have-polls-not-shown-shift-towards-scottish-in/ |title=Why have the polls not shown a shift towards Scottish independence? |publisher=YouGov |date=2017-01-27 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}</ref>

A study by Electoral Calculus, published on 14 May 2017, concluded that the Conservatives could win 11 seats in Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aitken|first1=Mark|title=Tories tipped to oust SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson and take 11 seats in General Election|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tories-tipped-oust-snp-deputy-10416592|website=Daily Record|accessdate=16 May 2017|date=14 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Baxter|first1=Martin|title=Full predictions seat-by-seat (Constituency List: Scotland)|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/conlist_scot.html|website=Electoral Calculus|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>

=== Television debates ===
Like the rest of the United Kingdom, Scottish broadcasters hosted television debates. On 21 May, [[BBC Scotland]] announced that they would host a debate on 10 December, two days before the election, which was moderated by [[Sarah Smith (news reporter)|Sarah Smith]]. On 6 June, two days before the election, [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] hosted a television debate from the Tramway theatre in Glasgow with the four main Scottish leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/election-2017-scottish-leaders-debate-on-stv-confirmed-1-4431459|title=Election 2017: Scottish leaders debate on STV confirmed|author=Scott Macnab Email|date=2017-04-27|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=2017-06-09}}</ref> It was originally due to be held the week before but this was postponed until Tuesday 6 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stv.tv/news/politics/1389917-stv-invites-leaders-to-rescheduled-election-debate/|title=STV invites leaders to rescheduled election debate|date=2017-05-30|publisher=Stv.tv|accessdate=2017-06-09}}</ref> The debate was moderated by Bernard Ponsbury.

===Description of results===
At the election the SNP remained the largest party in Scotland, taking the vast majority of seats situated around the more industrial [[Central Belt]] of the country, between [[Balloch, West Dunbartonshire|Balloch]], [[Dundee]], [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], [[Kilmarnock]] and [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]],<ref name="BBCresults" /> where the campaign in favour of Scottish independence performed best at the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 independence referendum]].<ref name="2014referendum">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/results|title=Scotland Votes NO|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> The party also took the most votes and a majority of seats in three out of four major cities in Scotland (Dundee, [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]), however Labour were within 1,200 votes of taking the most votes in Edinburgh and were within 200 votes of gaining two additional seats in Glasgow.<ref name="smallmajorities">{{cite news |last=Gallagher |first=Paul |date=2017-06-09 |title=General election 2017: The smallest majorities of the night |url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/politics/general-election-smallest-majorities-constituencies/ |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref> The SNP failed to win a majority of the vote in any of Scotland's 59 constituencies.<ref name="ElectoralCalculus">{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/conlist_scot.html|title=Constituency List: Scotland|work=Elecotral Calculus}}</ref>

The Scottish Conservatives performed best in areas where the campaign in favour of remaining part of the United Kingdom performed best in at the 2014 independence referendum and in areas where the campaign to leave the European Union performed best in at the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU membership referendum]].<ref name="2014referendum" /><ref name="2016referendum">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results?post_id=10153786362158736_10153786362308736|title=EU Referendum|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> The Conservatives formed the largest party in the south of the country through [[Dumfries and Galloway]], the [[Scottish Borders]] and [[South Ayrshire]], where they won four seats in total. They also gained the [[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]] constituency, an affluent commuter suburb on the outskirts of Glasgow which was the [[Safe seat|safest]] Conservative constituency in Scotland before their collapse at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997 (Scotland)|1997 general election]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/2015guide/renfrewshireeast/|title=UK Polling Report|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref> and gained the [[Ochil and South Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Ochil and South Perthshire]] and [[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling]] constituencies in Central Scotland, coming within 21 votes of gaining [[Perth and North Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and North Perthshire]], the second closest result in Scotland and the third closest across the United Kingdom as a whole.<ref name="smallmajorities" /> Six out of seven constituencies in the North-East of Scotland voted Conservative, including former SNP party leader and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond's constituency of [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]], and the SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson's seat of [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray]]. Two out of three seats covering the city of [[Aberdeen]] returned Conservative MP's.

Scottish Labour retained their [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]] constituency with a significant majority of 15,514 votes (32.4%), making it the safest constituency in Scotland. They also regained a number previously safe Labour working class constituencies in the Central Belt of Scotland, including [[Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (UK Parliament constituency)|Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill]], [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]], [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]] and [[Rutherglen and Hamilton West (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen and Hamilton West]], gaining a further two seats in [[Lothian]] ([[East Lothian (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] and [[Midlothian (UK Parliament constituency)|Midlothian]]). The party were within 1,400 votes of gaining a further six seats from the SNP in [[Greater Glasgow]].<ref name="ElectoralCalculus" />

The Liberal Democrats gained the suburban constituencies of [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dunbartonshire]] and [[Edinburgh West (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh West]] on the outskirts of Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively. The party also regained their former heartland of [[Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (UK Parliament constituency)|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]], a large rural constituency covering the northernmost parts of [[Great Britain]], with [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] again becoming the safest Lib Dem constituency in the UK in vote share terms, with a majority 19.6% of the vote. They lost out to the SNP in the [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Fife]] constituency by just 2 votes (0.0%), the closest result in the United Kingdom at a general election since the result in [[Winchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Winchester]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40214545 | title=General election 2017: SNP wins Fife North East seat by just two votes |publisher=BBC |date=2017-06-09 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}</ref> However, the party's vote collapsed to the Conservatives in [[Aberdeenshire]], the Borders and in parts of the [[Highland (council area)|Highlands]].
