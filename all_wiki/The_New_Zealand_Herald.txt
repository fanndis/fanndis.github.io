== History ==
''The New Zealand Herald'' was founded by William Chisholm Wilson, and first published on 13 November 1863. Wilson had been a partner with [[John Williamson (New Zealand politician)|John Williamson]] in the ''New Zealander'', but left to start a rival daily newspaper as he saw a business opportunity with Auckland's rapidly growing population.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=CL1.DSC&essay=1 |title=The Daily Southern Cross|work=National Library of New Zealand - Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> He had also split with Williamson because Wilson supported the [[invasion of Waikato|war against the Māori]] (which the ''Herald'' termed "the native rebellion") while Williamson opposed it.<ref name=PP_NZH/><ref>{{cite web |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=CL1.NZ&essay=1 |title=New Zealander |work=Papers Past |publisher=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> The ''Herald'' also promoted a more constructive relationship between the North and South Islands.<ref name=PP_NZH>{{cite web |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=CL1.NZH&essay=1 |title=New Zealand Herald |work=Papers Past |publisher=National Library of New Zealand|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>

After the ''New Zealander'' closed in 1866 ''The Daily Southern Cross'' provided competition, particularly after [[Julius Vogel]] took a majority shareholding in 1868. '''''The Daily Southern Cross''''' was first published in 1843 by [[William Brown (New Zealand politician)|William Brown]] as '''''The Southern Cross''''' and had been a daily since 1862.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=CL1.DSC&essay=1 |title=The Daily Southern Cross |work=National Library of New Zealand - Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> Vogel sold out of the paper in 1873 and [[Alfred George Horton|Alfred Horton]] bought it in 1876.<ref name="Southern Cross history">{{cite web |title= Daily Southern Cross |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=CL1.DSC&essay=1 |work=Papers Past |publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]] |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>

In 1876 the Wilson family and Horton joined in partnership and ''The New Zealand Herald'' absorbed ''The Daily Southern Cross''.<ref name="Southern Cross history"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2h49/1|title=Horton, Alfred George|first=Michael|last=Horton|date=1 September 2010|work=[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>

In 1879 the United Press Association was formed so that the main daily papers could share news stories. The organisation became the [[New Zealand Press Association]] in 1942.<ref name="TA1">Mark Derby. 'Newspapers - Growth and expansion, 1860–1900', ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand'', updated 13-Aug-14 
URL: http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/newspapers/page-2</ref> In 1892, the ''New Zealand Herald'', ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', and ''Press'' agreed to share the costs of a London correspondent and advertising salesman.<ref name="TA1"/> The New Zealand Press Association closed in 2011.

The Wilson and Horton families were both represented in the company, known as Wilson & Horton, until 1996 when [[Tony O'Reilly]]'s [[Independent News & Media|Independent News & Media Group]] of [[Dublin]] purchased the Horton family's interest in the company. ''The Herald'' is now owned by [[New Zealand Media and Entertainment]]. That company is owned by [[Sydney]]-based [[APN News & Media]] and the Radio Network, owned by the [[Australian Radio Network]].

=== Notable contributors ===
* Dita de Boni was a columnist for the newspaper, writing her first columns for the NZ Herald in 1995. From 2012 - 2015 she wrote a business and politics column until – after a series of articles increasingly critical of the Key government – the Herald discontinued her column for financial reasons.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Russell|title=Everybody has one|url=http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/everybody-has-one/|website=Public Address|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> 
*[[Gordon Minhinnick]] was a staff cartoonist from the 1930s until his retirement in the 1980s. 
*[[Malcolm Evans (cartoonist)|Malcolm Evans]] was dismissed from his position as staff cartoonist in 2003 after the newspaper received complaints about his cartoons on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.<ref>"Cartoonist Sacked after Being Accused of Anti-Semitism." http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/14/1060588531032.html. New Zealand Press Association, 15 Aug. 2003. Web. 21 Aug. 2015. <http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/14/1060588531032.html>.</ref>
*[[Laurence Clark (cartoonist)|Laurence Clark]] was the daily political cartoonist from 1987 to 1996, and continued to publish cartoons weekly in the ''Herald'' until 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klarc.co.nz/bio.html|title=Bio|work=Klarc.co.nz|accessdate=20 February 2009}}</ref>

=== Format ===
On 10 September 2012, the Herald moved to a [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] format for weekday editions, after 150 years publishing in [[broadsheet]] format. The broadsheet format was retained for the Saturday edition.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10818328 |title=New look Herald smaller and bigger |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>

=== Organisational restructuring ===
In April 2007, APN NZ announced it was outsourcing the bulk of the ''Herald'''s [[copy editing]] to an Australian-owned company, Pagemasters.

In November 2012, two months after the launch of its new compact format, APN News and Media announced it would be restructuring its workforce, cutting eight senior roles from across the ''Herald'''s range of titles.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Eight-jobs-to-go-in-Herald-restructure/tabid/421/articleID/278559/Default.aspx|work=[[3 News NZ]]|title=Eight jobs to go in Herald restructure|date=9 September 2012}}</ref>

== Political stance and editorial opinion ==
''The Herald'' is traditionally a [[centre-right]] newspaper, and was given the nickname "Granny Herald" into the 1990s. This changed with the acquisition of the paper by Independent News & Media in 1996, and today, despite remaining [[free enterprise]] oriented on economic matters such as trade and foreign investment, the Herald is generally editorially [[Progressivism|progressive]] on international geopolitics, diplomacy, and military matters, printing material from British newspapers such as ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'', and more recently, conservative newspapers such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The ''Herald''{{'s}} stance on the Middle East is supportive of Israel, as seen most clearly in its 2003 censorship and dismissal of cartoonist [[Malcolm Evans (cartoonist)|Malcolm Evans]] following his submission of cartoons critical of Israel.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0309/S00002.htm |title=Furore over sacking of Kiwi cartoonist |work=Scoop.co.nz |date=1 September 2003 |accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2007, an editorial strongly disapproved of some legislation introduced by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led government]], the [[Electoral Finance Act]], to the point of overtly campaigning against the legislation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10475416|title=Editorial: Democracy under attack|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=27 January 2010 }}</ref>

== Ethics incident ==
In July 2015, the [[New Zealand Press Council]] ruled that ''Herald'' columnist Rachel Glucina had failed to properly represent herself as a journalist when seeking comment from Amanda Bailey on a complaint she had made about Prime Minister [[John Key]] repeatedly pulling her hair when he was a customer at the cafe in which she worked. The ''Herald'' published Bailey's name, photo, and comments after she had retracted permission for Glucina to do so. The council said there was an "element of subterfuge" in Glucina's actions and that there was not enough public interest to justify her behaviour. In its ruling the council said that, "The NZ Herald has fallen sadly short of those standards in this case." The ''Herald'''s editor denied the accusations of subterfuge. Glucina subsequently resigned from the newspaper.<ref>Australian Associated Press. "New Zealand Herald Used 'subterfuge' to Interview Woman Who Had Hair Pulled by John Key." The Guardian. Guardian News and Media Limited, 2 July 2015.

=== ''Herald on Sunday'' ===
A compact-sized Sunday edition, the ''Herald on Sunday'', was first published on 3 October 2004 under the editorship of Suzanne Chetwin and then, for five years, by [[Shayne Currie]]. It won Newspaper of the Year for the calendar years 2007 and 2009 and is New Zealand's second-highest-circulating weekly newspaper after the more established and conservative broadsheet, ''[[The Sunday Star-Times]]''. In 2010, the ''Herald on Sunday'' started a campaign to reduce the legal blood alcohol limit for driving in New Zealand, called the "Two Drinks Max" campaign. The paper set up a campaign [[Facebook]] page, a [[Twitter]] account, and encouraged readers to sign up to the campaign on its own website.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10682676|title=Editorial: Two Drinks Max: Sign up and make us safer|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=24 October 2010 }}</ref> It is currently edited by [[Stuart Dye]].
