"'''Love Story'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. She produced the song with [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. It was released on September 12, 2008 by [[Big Machine Records]], as the lead single from Swift's second studio album ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). It was written about a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced the play's original [[tragedy|tragic]] conclusion with a [[happy ending]]. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy [[soprano]] voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of [[Juliet]].

The song received widespread critical praise with critics complimenting Swift's writing style and the song's catchiness. It was a massive commercial success, selling over 18 million copies worldwide<!--- DO NOT CHANGE THE GLOBAL SALES FIGURE WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE --->, therefore establishing itself among the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]]. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over 9 million paid digital downloads, becoming Swift's best-selling single to date and was once the best-selling download by a female country solo artist. It is also one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States|best-selling singles in the United States]] and it was once the best-selling digital country single of all time there. The single was certified 8× Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Internationally, "Love Story" became Swift's first number one single in Australia, followed by "[[Shake It Off]]" in 2014. The song has been certified 7x platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). The song is one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles worldwide]], with worldwide sales of more than 15 million units by 2010.<ref name="IFPIlovestory">{{cite web|title=IFPI Digital Music Report 2010|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/dmr2010.pdf|website=IFPI Digital Music Report 2010 – Page 10|accessdate=29 October 2016|archive-date=22 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122170638/http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/dmr2010.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. The video is a [[period piece]] that drew influences from the [[Medieval]], [[Renaissance]], and [[British Regency]] eras. It follows Swift and model [[Justin Gaston]] as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves in a prior era. "Love Story" was promoted through numerous live performances. The song was included on all of Swift's headlining tours, the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009–10), the [[Speak Now World Tour]] (2011–12), [[The Red Tour]] (2013–14), [[The 1989 World Tour]] (2015) and the [[Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour|Reputation Stadium Tour]] (2018). "Love Story" has been [[cover version|covered]] by several artists, including [[Joe McElderry]] and [[Forever the Sickest Kids]].

==Writing and inspiration==
"Love Story" came along late into the production of ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|title=Taylor's Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Jann Wenner|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|archive-date=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69sLygikq?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift wrote "Love Story" about a man who was never officially her [[boyfriend]].

She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the "Love Story"'s second [[refrain]].<ref name="teenvogue">{{Cite web|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/11/taylor-swift-exclusive-interview-with-teen-vogue.html#ixzz1DoAERAPo|title=Taylor Swift Responds!|first=Leigh|last=Bells|date=November 28, 2008|work=[[Teen Vogue]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|accessdate=February 12, 2011|archive-date=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225214935/http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/11/taylor-swift-exclusive-interview-with-teen-vogue.html#ixzz1DoAERAPo|url-status=live}}</ref> All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. "I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a [[tragedy]]." Instead, she chose to write a [[happy ending]].<ref name="latimeswriting">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/26/entertainment/ca-swift26|title=She's writing her future|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|first=Randy|last=Lewis|date=October 26, 2008|accessdate=February 12, 2011|archive-date=September 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913011046/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/26/entertainment/ca-swift26|url-status=live}}</ref> She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved.<ref name="cmtfairytale">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1599049/taylor-swifts-fascination-with-fairy-tales-comes-through-on-new-album.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's fascination with Fairy Tales comes through on new album|first=Lindsey|last=Roznovsky|date=November 10, 2008|work=[[CMT News]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=February 13, 2011|archive-date=October 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020233804/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1599049/taylor-swifts-fascination-with-fairy-tales-comes-through-on-new-album.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself.<ref name="teenvogue" /> "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about.<ref name="cutbycut" /> Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.<ref name="time" />

Swift and her love interest continued their relationship, but then separated because it was hard for them to see each other.<ref name="latimeswriting" /> To Swift, the song resembles much [[optimism]] regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism.<ref name="cmtfairytale" /> She deemed "Love Story" one of her most romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song.<ref name="time" /> In retrospect, Swift said the song is "about a love that you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well", adding "I spun it in the direction of ''Romeo and Juliet''. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on — a love that maybe society wouldn't accept [or] maybe your friends wouldn't accept."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,gac_26063_5937926,00.html|title="Oh, Romeo, Romeo": Taylor Swift's "Love Story"|date=September 15, 2008|work=[[Great American Country]]|publisher=[[Scripps Networks Interactive]]|accessdate=February 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062628/http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,gac_26063_5937926,00.html|archive-date=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Recording==
[[File:Taylor Swift - Fearless Tour - Austin 06.jpg|280px|thumb|left|Swift performing "Love Story" on the [[Fearless Tour]].]]
"Love Story" was recorded in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], alongside record producer [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]] and various personnel.<ref name="proaudio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.proaudioreview.com/article/21158|title=Taylor Swift — Love Story|first=Christopher|last=Walsh|date=March 17, 2009|work=ProAudio Review|publisher=The Wicks Group|accessdate=February 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219201559/http://proaudioreview.com/article/21158|archive-date=December 19, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube [[microphone]], manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and [[audio engineer]] [[Ray Kennedy (country singer)|Ray Kennedy]] for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a "try this for a while" experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, he had not been able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from ''Taylor Swift'', she immediately grew fond of the microphone.<ref name="proaudio" /> "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," Chapman said.<ref name="proaudio" />

"Love Story" was recorded with [[Pro Tools]] and tracking vocals, which Swift sang live with the [[band (music)|band]]. The band consisted of [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[bass guitar]]s, and [[drumkit|drums]].<ref name="proaudio" /> All other instruments were [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] by Chapman. He said, "I think there are nine acoustic guitars on that track, and I stacked several [[background vocals]] — me singing, 'Ah's'."<ref name="proaudio" /> [[Audio engineering]] was executed by Chad Carlson in Blackbird Studios' Studio D, with the usage of the API Legacy Plus equipments: Avantone CV-12, Neve 1073, and Tube-Tech CL-1B. [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|Audio mixing]] done by Justin Niebank and was set in Studio F, with the usage of the console Solid State Logic 9080 K series and Genelec 1032 console. In between, overdubs were executed in Studio E by Chapman.<ref name="proaudio" /> "Love Story", along with the rest of the album, was [[audio mastering|mastered]] by Hank Williams at MasterMix Studios in Nashville, Tennessee.<ref name="liner" /> The song was mixed for mainstream [[airplay]] by Chapman. He pulled Niebank's stems into his [[Mac OS]] laptop and used [[Apple Logic]] to create the pop version. Chapman made mix tweaks and created new elements with his laptop. In order to do so, he muted the country instruments and replaced them with new elements characteristic to [[pop music]], replacing [[banjo]] and [[fiddle]] with [[electric guitar]]. The pop version's opening beat is a Logic loop in the Ultrabeat beat generator. All the new electric guitars were done with the Amplitube Stomp I/O.<ref name="proaudio" />

The accompanying [[music video]] for "Love Story" was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who previously directed the videos for the singles from ''Taylor Swift''. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she had been able to balance both of their ideas for music videos, something Swift appreciated deeply.<ref name="onset">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes at 'Love Story'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The video is a [[period piece]] that draws influence from the [[Medieval]], [[Renaissance]], and [[Regency era|Regency]] eras. Swift had previously desired to film a period piece music video because of its distinctiveness from modern videos and videos she had filmed. When writing the song, she envisioned it in a prior time period, and encoded it with details accordingly.<ref name="cmtreplay">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/misc/316863/video-replay-taylor-swift-love-story.jhtml|title=Video Replay: Taylor Swift – Love Story|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-date=November 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126095235/http://www.cmt.com/videos/misc/316863/video-replay-taylor-swift-love-story.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> She believed "Love Story"'s plot was a timeless scenario: "I think it could happen in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008."<ref name="onset" /> Thus, she searched for a timeless quality in demeanor of her love interest.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'White Horse'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> With six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of ''[[Nashville Star]]'', recommended contestant [[Justin Gaston]]. Swift then looked through his pictures, and concluded he was suitable for the music video.<ref name="latimesgaston">{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2008/10/whos-that-romeo.html|title=Who's that Romeo in Taylor Swift's "Love Story" video?|first=Randy|last=Lewis|date=October 16, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archive-date=February 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206194225/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2008/10/whos-that-romeo.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out, describing him as a "[[Prince Charming]] that could've been alive in the 1800s."<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> However, because Gaston was competing on ''Nashville Star'', he was unable to participate in the music video. Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video.<ref name="onset" /> Swift was very impressed by Gaston's acting skills: "I was so impressed by the way his [expressions] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well."<ref name="latimesgaston" />

A castle was chosen for the video's setting. Personnel researched numerous castles in the United States and were unable to locate one in sufficient condition for filming. They had considered traveling to Europe to find a castle, but were then informed about a castle south of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Named Castle Gwynn, a castle that is part of the Tennessee Renaissance Festival, both located in [[Arrington, Tennessee]], it was built in 1973 and chosen as the video's setting.<ref name="onset" /> Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics, excluding Swift's dress for the balcony scene. The dress was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift.<ref name="onset" /><ref name="cmtreplay" /> "She loves to put her input in her dresses", stated Spika. The two had discussed the dress two months prior to the filming of the video. Accentuates were made on the video set.<ref name="onset" /> The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee. On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were shot. On the set, someone had replaced the [[playback singer|playback]] CD with a high-pitch, altered version of the song. As a result, Swift lent the crew her [[iPod]] to play the original track.<ref name="onset" /> While filming another scene, sunset was about to occur and, therefore, the process was executed rather rapidly. For the scene, Fanjoy suggested a kiss between Swift and Gaston, but Swift refused to because she believed it would make for a sweeter moment. On the second day, scenes at [[Cumberland University]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] and at a ballroom were filmed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_spl/episode/0,,GAC_26200_59982,00.htm|title=Taylor Swift on the Set: Love Story|work=Great American Country|publisher=Scripps Network Interactive|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062635/http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_spl/episode/0,,GAC_26200_59982,00.htm|archive-date=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Swift learned the choreography for the latter in fifteen minutes prior to filming. Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene.<ref name="onset" />

The video commences with Swift, clothed in a black sweater and jeans, walking through a university campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in what seems to be an 18th century castle, where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and sings in a balcony. Afterwards, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other young women. The two, along with others, engage in [[ballroom dancing]]. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Later on, Swift stands in the balcony again, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running towards her and she immediately runs down the castle's staircase to meet him. Swift and Gaston meet in the field right in front of the castle and hold each other. The video then transitions back into the modern-day college campus as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 513 million views on YouTube.

===Video reception===
The video premiered on September 12, 2008 on [[Country Music Television|CMT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1594680/taylor-swift-premiering-new-video-on-cmt.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Premiering New Video on CMT|date=September 12, 2008|work=CMT News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-date=June 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606231546/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1594680/taylor-swift-premiering-new-video-on-cmt.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Mandi Bierly of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was concerned about the video marking Swift's artistic evolution because it seemed too expensive and made her wonder if anything else about Swift would change. However, she stated: "Worry though I might, I can’t resist Taylor Swift’s evolution from '[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]' (2006) to her latest, 'Love Story'." Bierly also compared Swift's acting with that of [[Keira Knightley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2008/09/17/taylor-swift-ju/|title=How much do you love Taylor Swift's 'Love Story' video?|first=Mandi|last=Bierly|date=September 17, 2008|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Time Warner|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archive-date=December 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205185640/http://popwatch.ew.com/2008/09/17/taylor-swift-ju/|url-status=live}}</ref> Fraser McAlpine of [[BBC Online]] believed Swift played a princess in the video and, therefore, said it would make females envious.<ref name="bbc" /> The video was nominated for the "Video of the Year" category at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards|45th Academy of Country Music Awards]], but lost to [[Brad Paisley]]'s "[[Waitin' on a Woman]]" (2008).<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?mediaId=5512&attachment=true|title=Nominations announced for the 44th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Country Music]]|accessdate=March 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311073142/http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?mediaId=5512&attachment=true|archive-date=March 11, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?attachment=true&mediaId=6367|title=Winners announced for the 44th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards|publisher=[[Academy of Country Music]]|accessdate=March 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707080611/http://www.acmcountry.com/cms/upload/getMedia.php?attachment=true&mediaId=6367|archive-date=July 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the 2009 [[CMT Music Awards]], the video won the CMT Music Awards for "Video of the Year" and "Female Video of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-music-awards/2009/nominees.jhtml|title=2009 CMT Music Awards: Winners|work=CMT|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 11, 2011|archive-date=December 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207221528/http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cmt-music-awards/2009/nominees.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> It also won the award for "Music Video of the Year" at the [[Country Music Association Awards|43rd Country Music Association Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cma/2009/nominees.jhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722133420/http://www.cmt.com/microsites/cma/2009/nominees.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title=2009 CMA Awards: Winners|work=CMT|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref> The video won "Favorite International Video" at the Philippine [[Myx Music Awards 2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myxph.com/features/1551/the-myx-music-awards-2010-winners/|title=The MYX Music Awards 2010 Winners|work=MYXph.com|publisher=[[MYX]]|accessdate=March 11, 2011|archive-date=November 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114180551/http://www.myxph.com/features/1551/the-myx-music-awards-2010-winners/|url-status=live}}</ref>
