The '''Norwegian Association for Women's Rights''' ({{lang-no|italic=no|Norsk Kvinnesaksforening}}; '''NKF''') is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[nonpartisan]] [[political advocacy]] organisation and Norway's oldest and preeminent [[women's rights|women's and girls' rights]] organisation. NKF works "to promote [[gender equality]] and women's and girls' [[human rights]] through [[political reform|political]] and [[legal reform]] within the framework of [[liberal democracy]]."<ref name="om" /> Traditionally [[liberal feminism|liberal (or mainstream) feminist]] in orientation, its feminism has been described as Norwegian [[state feminism]], and the association has had a central role in the adoption of most legislation and reforms related to gender equality in Norway since 1884.<ref name="om">{{cite web |title=Hvem vi er |url=http://kvinnesak.no/om/ |publisher=Norwegian Association for Women's Rights|access-date=2020-10-28}}</ref>

It was founded in 1884 on the initiative of [[Gina Krog]] and [[Hagbart Berner]] by 171 prominent [[progressivism|progressive]] women and men, including five Norwegian Prime Ministers. Its basic principle is that full and equal enjoyment of [[human rights]] is due to all women and girls, and it works to advance women's social, economic and political situation in Norway as well as internationally. Originally associated with the then-dominant and governing [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], NKF is today [[Big tent|broadly representative]] of the political spectrum from the [[centre-left]] to the [[centre-right]]. The association has always been Norway's most important [[Liberal feminism|liberal (or mainstream) feminist]] organisation and has successfully campaigned for women’s [[right to education]], the [[women's suffrage|right to vote]], the [[right to work]], the adoption of the 1978 Gender Equality Act and the establishment of what is now the [[Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud]]. In line with its roots in 19th century [[First-wave feminism|first-wave]] liberal feminism, political and legal reform remains its primary focus, and it has always concentrated on lobbying government bodies in a professional way. As a result of its focus on legal reform the association has always attracted many lawyers and other academics. NKF members had key roles in developing the government apparatus and legislation related to gender equality in Norway; during the 1970s the "Norwegian government adopted NKF's [equality] ideology as its own,"<ref>Lønnå (1996) p. 273</ref> and NKF's feminist tradition has been described as Norway's [[state feminism]]—a term coined by NKF member [[Helga Hernes]]—due to the governmental support it enjoyed. Starting with the presidency of [[Eva Kolstad]] from 1956 NKF focused strongly on the [[United Nations]], and NKF members have been appointed to key UN bodies including [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|UNCSW]] and the [[CEDAW Committee]]; the [[CEDAW]] convention remains an important focus of NKF.

In 2020 Professor [[Anne Hege Grung]] was elected President, in succession to Supreme Court Justice [[Karin M. Bruzelius]]. NKF is a member of the [[International Alliance of Women]] (IAW), which has [[general consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]]. NKF is also a member of the [[Norwegian Women's Lobby]] and of the [[Forum for Women and Development]], and initiated the establishment of both organisations. In 1896 NKF also founded the [[Norwegian Women's Public Health Association]], a humanitarian organisation whose membership reached 250,000. Several of NKF's early leaders, among them the noted humanitarian [[Fredrikke Marie Qvam]], were married to Norwegian prime ministers. Its postwar leaders include Liberal Party leader and cabinet minister [[Eva Kolstad]] and the former chairman of UNICEF, [[Torild Skard]]. Its honorary members include [[Camilla Collett]] and Norway's first female Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]. NKF's offices are located at [[Majorstuen]] in [[Oslo]]. NKF has always been open to both women and men. NKF's logo is a [[stylized]] [[sunflower]], adopted in 1894 based on the model of the liberal [[Women's suffrage in the United States|American suffrage movement]].

==History==

The Norwegian Association for Women's Rights was founded in 1884 by 171 prominent Norwegians, led by the liberal politician and women's rights pioneer [[Gina Krog]] and liberal [[Member of Parliament]] and the first editor-in-chief of ''[[Dagbladet]]'' [[Hagbart Berner]]. 

From its establishment and well into the 20th century, the organisation was strongly associated with the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]]; its 171 founders included five Norwegian Prime Ministers, several leaders of the Liberal Party and many liberal Members of Parliament as well as the editors of the large liberal newspapers and public figures such as novelist [[Alexander Kielland]]. Three of the first Presidents of the organisation, [[Anna Stang]], [[Randi Blehr]] and [[Fredrikke Marie Qvam]], were all wives of Norwegian Prime Ministers. Membership has always been open to both men and women. NKF grew out of overlapping milieus connected to the political elite and liberal media in Norway, including the feminist association Skuld, Læseforening for Kvinder (founded by [[Camilla Collett]] in 1874), [[Nissen's Girls' School]], Kristiania Lærerindeforening, the influential political and cultural magazine ''[[Nyt Tidsskrift]]''  and the liberal newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]''.<ref>Moksnes 1984 p. 33</ref> 

Among the important causes that the NKF has campaigned for are [[women's suffrage]] (achieved in 1913), the [[right to work]] (in the 1930s), abolishment of the common taxing for spouses (the 1950s), right to [[women's education|equal schooling]] (the 1960s), the establishment of the Gender Equality Council ({{lang-no|Likestillingsrådet}}) in 1972 and the [[Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud|Gender Equality Ombud]] in 1978, and the adoption of the Gender Equality Act (1979). The government apparatus concerned with gender equality, including both the Gender Equality Council and the Gender Equality Ombud, were largely built by NKF members.

Key NKF members initiated the establishment of the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Norway)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] and the [[Norwegian National Women's Council]]. NKF inherited the former's founding membership in the [[International Alliance of Women]] (IAW) in 1937.

The association also initiated the establishment of the [[Norwegian Women's Public Health Association]] ({{lang-no|Norske Kvinners Sanitetsforening}}), a [[humanitarian]] organisation, which grew to become Norway's largest women's organisation with around 250,000 members at one point. Historically, NKF was the most important association of the Norwegian bourgeois (or liberal) women's movement (associated chiefly with the Liberal Party), in contrast to the labour women's movement (associated with the Labour Party), and was traditionally dominated by liberal women from the upper class.<ref>Lønnå (1996) p. 18</ref> With the increasing reformism of the Labour Party, many Labour politicians joined NKF from the 1930s and especially during the postwar era. Today, NKF is a nonpartisan organisation.

During the presidency of [[Eva Kolstad]] (1956–1968) NKF became strongly involved in international cooperation through the United Nations and contributed significantly to early UN gender equality policies, and Kolstad was elected as a member and vice chair of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] in 1968, the year she stepped down as NKF President, after being nominated as the joint candidate of the Nordic governments. Kolstad later became a cabinet minister in Norway, the leader of the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] and then the world's first [[Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud|Gender Equality Ombud]]. During the 1970s and 1980s the lawyers [[Karin M. Bruzelius]] and [[Sigrun Hoel]] led the organisation; Bruzelius became the first woman to head a government ministry as [[Permanent Secretary]] in 1989 and later became a Supreme Court Justice; Hoel served as the deputy Gender Equality Ombud during Kolstad's tenure and as acting Gender Equality Ombud.

In the early 1980s, NKF was responsible for the government-funded information campaign "Women and the election". In the late 1980s, NKF initiated the [[TV-aksjonen]] campaign to raise funds for "Women in the Third World" and NKF co-founded the campaign's successor [[Forum for Women and Development]] in 1995. During the presidency of diplomat and psychologist [[Torild Skard]] (2006–2013), the former Chairman of [[UNICEF]], NKF renewed its focus on the United Nations, and NKF initiated the establishment of the [[Norwegian Women's Lobby]], the umbrella organisation of the Norwegian women's movement. Skard was succeeded as President by gender violence expert [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] in 2013, by the Norwegian Parliament's First Vice President [[Marit Nybakk]] in 2016, by Supreme Court Justice [[Karin M. Bruzelius]] in 2018<ref name="NTB2018">[https://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/norge/2018/06/17/195407168/hoyesterettsdommer-ny-leder-i-norsk-kvinnesaksforening Høyesterettsdommer ny leder i Norsk Kvinnesaksforening], [[Norwegian News Agency]]</ref> and by Professor [[Anne Hege Grung]] in 2020.

The organisation had its offices in ''Sehesteds gate'' 1 in Oslo for many years, and now has its offices in ''Majorstuveien'' 39 at [[Majorstuen]] in central Oslo.

Elisabeth Lønnå describes NKF by 1970 as "an almost dignified organisation" that had its "origins in the Liberal Party and had a liberal platform, centered on the main idea of equality for all citizens and based on the idea of fundamental human rights." Lønnå notes that NKF had long traditions, a clearly defined form of organisation, an established network and well formulated policies and principles, and that it spent most of its resources on lobbying government bodies in a professional way. While NKF was influenced by the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] during the 1970s, it was the "only feminist organisation that was primarily based on the idea of gender equality." In contrast to the many new feminist organisations that sprung up in the 1970s but quickly lost most of their membership, NKF was strengthened in the 1980s.<ref>Elisabeth Lønnå: ''Stolthet og kvinnekamp: Norsk kvinnesaksforenings historie fra 1913'' (pp. 228–229), Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 1996, {{ISBN|8205244952}}</ref>

Although it grew out of 19th century progressive liberalism, NKF, like modern liberal feminism itself, is not limited to liberalism in a modern party-political sense, and NKF is [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] and broadly representative of the democratic political spectrum from the [[centre-left]] to the [[centre-right]]; its members tend to be affiliated with parties like the social-liberal [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], the social democratic [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]], the reformist socialist [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]], the centrist [[Green Party (Norway)|Green Party]], the liberal-conservative [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] or the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]]. NKF seeks the [[Centrism|centre ground]] and to speak for the majority of women, and has always sought broad political support for reforms aimed at improving women's rights, believing its nonpartisan approach is the most effective way to advocate for women's rights and obtain practical results. Norwegian supreme court justice and two-time NKF President [[Karin Maria Bruzelius]] has described NKF's liberal feminism as "a realistic, sober, practical feminism".<ref name="om" />

==Policies==
NKF's main focus is women's political, legal and [[human rights]]. NKF works "to promote [[gender equality]] and women's and girls' [[human rights]] through [[political reform|political]] and [[legal reform]] within the framework of [[liberal democracy]]" and focuses on "eliminating attitudes, laws and regulations that are discriminatory towards women and girls and which prevent gender equality."<ref name="om" /><ref name="about">{{cite web |title=About us |url=http://kvinnesak.no/english/ |publisher=Norwegian Association for Women's Rights |accessdate=2020-10-24}}</ref> In particular NKF today focuses on the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], on the prevention of [[violence against women]], on women's rights and opportunities in education and working life, on representation of women in politics, and on bringing women's perspectives into foreign policy and international development.<ref name="om" /> NKF supports the ban on buying sexual services in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Behold sexkjøpsloven |url=https://kvinnesak.no/2014/02/behold-sexkjopsloven-ny-tid-14-02/ |publisher=Norwegian Association for Women's Rights |accessdate=18 November 2020}}</ref>

==Logo==
NKF's logo is a [[stylized]] [[sunflower]]. It was adopted in 1894 based on the model of the liberal [[Women's suffrage in the United States|American suffrage movement]] led by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]] from the 1860s; by the late 19th century the sunflower had become the main international symbol of women's suffrage. The logo was also used as the logo of NKF's journal ''[[Nylænde]]'', edited by [[Gina Krog]]. NKF states that the sunflower represents the association's "roots in the first wave of feminism and our systematic work since 1884 to promote gender equality through constructive political reforms within the framework of liberal democracy."<ref>[http://kvinnesak.no/om/solsikken/ Solsikken symboliserer våre røtter i den første bølgen av feminisme].
