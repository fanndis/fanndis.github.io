Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old from [[Allen, Texas]], was arrested shortly after the shooting and charged with [[capital murder]] in connection with the shooting. Police believe a [[manifesto]] with [[white nationalist]] and [[Opposition to immigration to the United States|anti-immigrant]] themes, posted on the online message board [[8chan]] shortly before the attack, was written by Crusius; it cites the year's earlier [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in [[New Zealand]] and the right-wing conspiracy theory known as the [[Great Replacement]] as inspiration for the attack.
