'''Lyndon Baines Johnson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|d|ə|n|_|ˈ|b|eɪ|n|z}}; August 27, 1908{{snds}}January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials '''LBJ''', was an American politician who served as the 36th [[president of the United States]] from 1963 to 1969, and previously as 37th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] from 1961 to 1963. He assumed the presidency following the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Texas]], Johnson also served as a [[United States Representative]] and as the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]] in the [[United States Senate]]. Johnson is one of only four people who have served in all four federal elected positions.{{efn|The other three who have served as president, vice president and who have held office in the House and Senate are [[John Tyler]], [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]].}}

Born in a farmhouse in [[Stonewall, Texas]], Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the US House of Representatives in 1937. Johnson won [[1948 United States Senate election in Texas|election to the United States Senate from Texas in 1948]] after narrowly winning the Democratic Party's nomination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Lyndon_Johnson.htm |title=Lyndon Baines Johnson, 37th Vice President (1961-1963) |website=US Senate |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref> He was appointed to the position of [[Senate Majority Whip]] in 1951. He became the Senate leader of the Democrats in 1953. He became known for his domineering personality and the "Johnson treatment", his aggressive coercion of powerful politicians to advance legislation. Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]]. Although unsuccessful, he became the running mate of the nominee Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] and they went on to win a close election. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] and Johnson [[United States presidential line of succession|succeeded]] him as president. The following year, Johnson won in [[1964 United States presidential election|a landslide]], defeating senator [[Barry Goldwater]] of [[Arizona]]. With 61.1&nbsp;percent of the popular vote, Johnson won the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|largest share]] of the popular vote of any candidate since [[1820 United States presidential election|1820]].

In domestic policy, Johnson's "[[Great Society]]" and "[[War on Poverty]]" programs led to legislation to expand [[civil rights]], [[public broadcasting]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development and public services. Assisted by a [[Post-World War II boom|strong economy]], the War on Poverty helped millions of Americans rise above the poverty line during his administration.<ref name="Califano">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |title=What Was Really Great About The Great Society: The truth behind the conservative myths |first=Joseph A. |last=Califano Jr. |work=[[Washington Monthly]] |date=October 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326175845/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |archive-date=March 26, 2014}}</ref> Unlike the majority of southern politicians, he opposed [[Segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], signing civil rights bills to ban racial discrimination in public facilities, interstate commerce, the workplace and housing. The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] ended the mass disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South, and the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] permitted greater immigration from regions other than Europe. Johnson's presidency marked the peak of [[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] in the United States.

In foreign policy, Johnson escalated American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1964, Congress passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which granted Johnson the power to use military force in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967, many in combat roles. American casualties soared and the peace process stagnated. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war movement]] based chiefly among [[Conscription|draft]]-age students on university campuses. Johnson faced further troubles when summer riots began in major cities in 1965 and crime rates soared, as his right-wing opponents raised demands for [[Law and order (politics)|"law and order"]] policies. While Johnson began his presidency with widespread approval, support for him declined as the public became frustrated with both the war and social unrest. In 1968, he ended his bid for renomination after a [[1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries|disappointing result in the New Hampshire primary]]. He was succeeded by [[Richard Nixon]] in January 1969. Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, where he died of a heart attack four years later.

Johnson is [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] favorably by many historians because of his domestic policies and the passage of many major laws that affected civil rights, [[gun control]], [[Wilderness Act|wilderness preservation]], and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], although he has also drawn substantial criticism for his escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="histeval">{{cite web |last=Dallek |first=Robert |url=http://hnn.us/articles/439.html |title=Presidency: How Do Historians Evaluate the Administration of Lyndon Johnson? |publisher=History News Network |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/president/Lyndon_Johnson.aspx |title=Survey of Presidential Leadership&nbsp;– Lyndon Johnson |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209101510/http://legacy.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/president/Lyndon_Johnson.aspx |archive-date=February 9, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:LBJ Boyhood Home Johnson City Texas 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's boyhood home in [[Johnson City, Texas]]]]
In school, Johnson was an awkward, talkative youth who was elected president of his 11th-grade class. He graduated in 1924 from [[Lyndon B. Johnson High School (Johnson City, Texas)|Johnson City High School]], where he participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball.<ref>{{cite book |title=Yearbook |editor=Patty Greenbaum |editor2=Lisa Lewis |editor3=Anne Drake |editor4=Zazel Loven |year=1990 |publisher=Dolphin |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-385-41625-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/yearbook00newy/page/89 89] |url=https://archive.org/details/yearbook00newy/page/89}}</ref><ref name="Caro 1982">Caro 1982.</ref> At the age of 15, Johnson was the youngest member of his class. Pressured by his parents to attend college, he enrolled at a "sub college" of Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to college. He left the school just weeks after his arrival and decided to move to [[southern California]]. He worked at his cousin's legal practice and in various odd jobs before returning to Texas, where he worked as a day laborer.<ref>Woods 2007, pp. 44–48.</ref>

In 1926, Johnson managed to enroll at SWTSTC (now [[Texas State University]]). He worked his way through school, participated in debate and campus politics, and edited the school newspaper, [[University Star|''The College Star'']].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Student Editorials of Lyndon Baines Johnson |date=1968 |publisher=LBJ Common Experience, Paper 1 |url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/lbjcomex/1 |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> The college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization. For nine months, from 1928 to 1929, Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican–American children at the segregated Welhausen School in [[Cotulla, Texas|Cotulla]], some {{convert|90|mi}} south of [[San Antonio]] in [[La Salle County, Texas|La Salle County]]. The job helped him to save money to complete his education, and he graduated in 1930. He briefly taught at [[Pearsall, Texas|Pearsall]] High School before taking a position as teacher of public speaking at [[Sam Houston High School (Houston, Texas)|Sam Houston High School]] in Houston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/biographys.hom/lbj_bio.asp |title=President Lyndon B.

When he returned to San Marcos in 1965, after signing the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], Johnson reminisced:

{{quote|I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |title=Remarks at Southwest Texas State College Upon Signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 |publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum |accessdate=April 11, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714005531/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |archive-date=July 14, 2007}}</ref>}}

After [[Richard M. Kleberg]] won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the [[United States House of Representatives]], he appointed Johnson as his legislative secretary. Johnson got the position on the recommendation of his father and that of State Senator Welly Hopkins, for whom Johnson had campaigned in 1930.<ref>Woods 2007, pp. 69, 73–75.</ref> Kleberg had little interest in performing the day-to-day duties of a Congressman, instead of delegating them to Johnson.<ref>Woods 2007, pp. 76–80.</ref> After [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]], Johnson became a staunch supporter of Roosevelt's [[New Deal]].<ref>Woods 2007, pp. 87–88.</ref> Johnson was elected speaker of the "Little Congress", a group of Congressional aides, where he cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen, and lobbyists. Johnson's friends soon included aides to President Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Congressman [[Sam Rayburn]].<ref>Woods 2007, pp. 89–90.</ref>

Johnson married [[Lady Bird Johnson|Claudia Alta Taylor]], also known as "Lady Bird", of [[Karnack, Texas]], on November 17, 1934. He met her after he had attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]] for several months. Johnson later quit his Georgetown studies after the first semester in 1934.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tzatzev |first=Aleksi |title=Six Law School Dropouts Who Went On To Become President |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/six-presidents-who-dropped-out-of-law-school-2012-9 |date=2012-09-08 |access-date=2020-10-22}}</ref> During their first date he asked her to marry him; many dates later, she finally agreed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Caro |first=Robert A. |title=The years of Lyndon Johnson |publisher=Alfred A.

In 1935, he was appointed head of the Texas [[National Youth Administration]], which enabled him to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people. He resigned two years later to run for Congress. Johnson, a notoriously tough boss throughout his career, often demanded long workdays and work on weekends.<ref>Woods 2006, p. 131.</ref> He was described by friends, fellow politicians, and historians as motivated by an exceptional lust for power and control. As Johnson's biographer [[Robert Caro]] observes, "Johnson's ambition was uncommon—in the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs."<ref>Caro 1982, p. 275.</ref>

==Career in U.S. House of Representatives (1937–1949)==
In 1937, after the death of thirteen-term Congressman [[James P. Buchanan]], Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for [[Texas's 10th congressional district]], that covered [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and the surrounding hill country. He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife. He served in the House from April 10, 1937, to January 3, 1949.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000160 |title=JOHNSON, Lyndon Baines&nbsp;– Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] found Johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information, particularly about issues concerning internal politics in Texas ([[Operation Texas]]) and the machinations of Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Sam Rayburn]]. Johnson was immediately appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Naval Affairs|Naval Affairs Committee]]. He worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district. Johnson steered the projects towards contractors that he knew, such as [[Kellogg, Brown and Root#Brown & Root|Herman and George Brown]], who would finance much of Johnson's future career.<ref name="Caro 1982"/> In 1941 he ran for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination in a special election, losing narrowly to the sitting [[Governor of Texas]], businessman and radio personality [[W. Lee O'Daniel]]. O'Daniel received 175,590 votes (30.49&nbsp;percent) to Johnson's 174,279 (30.26&nbsp;percent).

===Active military duty (1941–1942)===
[[File:Portrait of Lyndon B. Johnson in Navy Uniform - 42-3-7 - 03-1942.jpg|thumb|upright|LCDR Johnson, March 1942]]
Johnson was appointed a [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on June 21, 1940.

He was sent instead to inspect shipyard facilities in Texas and on the West Coast. In the spring of 1942, President Roosevelt decided he needed better information on conditions in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]], and to send a highly trusted political ally to get it. From a suggestion by Forrestal, Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three-man survey team covering the Southwest Pacific.<ref name="Dallek, Robert pp. 235">Dallek 1991, pp. 235–245.</ref>

Johnson reported to General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in Australia. Johnson and two U.S. Army officers went to the [[22nd Bomb Group (Red Raiders) 5th Army Air Force|22nd Bomb Group]] base, which was assigned the high-risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at [[Lae]] in [[New Guinea]]. On June 9, 1942, Johnson volunteered as an observer for an airstrike on New Guinea by [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] bombers. Reports vary on what happened to the aircraft carrying Johnson during that mission. Johnson's biographer [[Robert Caro]] accepts Johnson's account and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned: the aircraft was attacked, disabling one engine and it turned back before reaching its objective, though remaining under heavy fire. Others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire; this is supported by official flight records.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html |title=In-Depth Specials&nbsp;– The story behind Johnson's Silver Star |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613123509/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html |archive-date=June 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name="theguardian.com">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/06/internationaleducationnews.humanities LBJ's medal for valour 'was sham'] ''[[The Guardian]]'', July 6, 2001</ref> Other airplanes that continued to the target came under fire near the target at about the same time that Johnson's plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase.

Johnson, who had used a movie camera to record conditions,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/war-and-forgiveness-437c52499d02 |title=War and Forgiveness |author=Steve Weintz |date=December 24, 2013 |work=War Is Boring |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref> reported to Roosevelt, to Navy leaders, and Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable: some historians have suggested this was in exchange for MacArthur's recommendation to award the Silver Star.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> He argued that the southwest Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies. The warplanes sent there, for example, were "far inferior" to Japanese planes; and morale was bad. He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a "critical" need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing "greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters". Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee,<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 235.</ref> with a mission similar to that of the [[Truman Committee]] in the Senate. He probed the peacetime "business as usual" inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson's biographer [[Robert Dallek]] concludes, "The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson's personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve a lot of America's fighting men."<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 237.</ref>

In addition to the Silver Star, Johnson received the [[American Campaign Medal]], [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]], and the [[World War II Victory Medal]]. He was released from active duty on July 17, 1942, and remained in the Navy Reserve, later promoted to [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] on October 19, 1949 (effective June 2, 1948). He resigned from the Navy Reserve effective January 18, 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.va.gov/health/newsfeatures/2015/february/list-of-presidents-who-were-veterans.asp |title=List of Presidents who were Veterans |author=Veterans Health Administration |work=va.gov |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref>

==Career in U.S. Senate (1949–1961)==

===1948 U.S. Senate election===

In the [[1948 United States Senate election in Texas|1948 elections]], Johnson again ran for the Senate and won in a highly controversial Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]] against the well-known former governor [[Coke Stevenson]]. Johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented helicopter, dubbed "The Johnson City Windmill". He raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by casting doubts on Stevenson's support for the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] (curbing union power). Stevenson came in first in the primary but lacked a majority, so a runoff election was held; Johnson campaigned harder, while Stevenson's efforts slumped due to a lack of funds.

The runoff vote count, handled by the Democratic State Central Committee, took a week. Johnson was announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295, an extremely narrow margin of victory. However, Johnson's victory was based on 200 "patently fraudulent"<ref name="baum">{{cite journal |title=Lyndon Johnson's Victory in the 1948 Texas Senate Race: A Reappraisal |journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=595–613 |date=Autumn 1994 |author=Dale Baum and James L.

Mayborn of [[Temple, Texas]]. The state Democratic convention upheld Johnson. Stevenson went to court, eventually taking his case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], but with timely help from his friend and future US Supreme Court Justice [[Abe Fortas]], Johnson prevailed on the basis that jurisdiction over naming a nominee rested with the party, not the federal government. Johnson soundly defeated Republican [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]] in the general election in November and went to Washington, permanently dubbed "Landslide Lyndon". Johnson, dismissive of his critics, happily adopted the nickname.<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 346.</ref>

===Freshman senator to majority whip===
[[File:Senator Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|upright|Johnson as U.S. Senator from Texas]]

Once in the Senate, Johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful "courtships" of older senators, especially Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.|Richard Russell]], Democrat from Georgia, the leader of the [[Conservative coalition]] and arguably the most powerful man in the Senate. Johnson proceeded to gain Russell's favor in the same way that he had "courted" Speaker Sam Rayburn and gained his crucial support in the House.

Johnson was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and in 1950 helped create the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee. He became its chairman, and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency. These investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the [[Truman administration]], although it can be said that the committee's investigations reinforced the need for changes. Johnson gained headlines and national attention through his handling of the press, the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports, and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee. He used his political influence in the Senate to receive broadcast licenses from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in his wife's name.<ref name="'70s"/><ref name="new yorker">{{cite news |title=The Johnson Years: Buying And Selling |last=Caro |first=Robert A. |author-link=Robert Caro |date=December 18, 1989 |work=The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/1989/12/18/1989_12_18_043_TNY_CARDS_000356927}}</ref> After the 1950 general elections, Johnson was chosen as Senate Majority Whip in 1951 under the new Majority Leader, [[Ernest McFarland]] of [[Arizona]], and served from 1951 to 1953.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

===Senate Democratic leader===

[[File:Lyndon Johnson and Richard Russell cropped.jpg|thumb|Johnson giving "The Treatment" to Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.|Richard Russell]]]]

In the [[1952 United States Senate elections|1952 general election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] won a majority in both the House and Senate. Among defeated Democrats that year was McFarland, who lost to upstart [[Barry Goldwater]]. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats to be the minority leader; he became the most junior Senator ever elected to this position. One of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees while retaining it for chairmanships. In the [[1954 United States Senate election|1954 election]], Johnson was re-elected to the Senate and, since the Democrats won the majority in the Senate, then became majority leader. Former majority leader [[William Knowland]] became a minority leader. Johnson's duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the Democrats. Johnson, Rayburn and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] worked well together in passing Eisenhower's domestic and foreign agenda.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

During the [[Suez Crisis]], Johnson tried to prevent the U.S. government from criticizing the Israeli invasion of the Sinai peninsula. Along with the rest of the nation, Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' and used his influence to ensure passage of the 1958 [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], which established the civilian space agency [[NASA]].

Historians Caro and Dallek consider Lyndon Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader in history. He was unusually proficient at gathering information. One biographer suggests he was "the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known", discovering exactly where every Senator stood on issues, his philosophy and prejudices, his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote.<ref>Woods 2006, p. 262.</ref> Robert Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips to avoid their dissenting votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/video/lbj_05.html#v230 |title=LBJ |work=American Experience |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> Central to Johnson's control was "The Treatment",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afterimagegallery.com/nytjohnson.htm |title=New York Times, The Johnson Treatment: Lyndon B.

{{quote|The Treatment could last ten minutes or four hours. It came, enveloping its target, at the Johnson Ranch swimming pool, in one of Johnson's offices, in the Senate cloakroom, on the floor of the Senate itself—wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator within his reach.

Its tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint, and the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking and it was all in one direction. Interjections from the target were rare. Johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken. He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from his target, his eyes widening and narrowing, his eyebrows rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, statistics. Mimicry, humor, and the genius of analogy made The Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless.<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Rowland Evans |first1=Rowland |last1=Evans |author-link2=Robert Novak |first2=Robert |last2=Novak |title=Lyndon B.

A 60-cigarette-per-day smoker, Johnson suffered a near-fatal heart attack on July 2, 1955. He abruptly gave up smoking as a result and, with only a couple of exceptions, did not resume the habit until he left the White House on January 20, 1969. Johnson announced he would remain as his party's leader in the Senate on New Year's Eve 1955, his doctors reporting he had made "a most satisfactory recovery" since his heart attack five months prior.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=A7-hzOuI2KQC&dat=19560101&printsec=frontpage |title=Lyndon Johnson To Retain Post |date=January 1, 1956 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=ie8Y0QrpMWAC&dat=19560101&printsec=frontpage |title=Johnson To Continue As Demo Leader |date=January 1, 1956 |newspaper=Times Daily}}</ref>

==Campaigns of 1960==
{{see also|1960 United States presidential election}}
Johnson's success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate; he had been the "[[favorite son]]" candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party's national convention in 1956, and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination. [[James H. Rowe|Jim Rowe]] repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought it better to wait, thinking that John Kennedy's efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited. Rowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration, another move which Johnson thought played into his own strategy.<ref>Dallek 1991, pp. 544–545.</ref>

===Candidacy for president===
Johnson made a late entry into the campaign in July 1960 which, coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington, allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy's endearing qualities of charm and intelligence, as compared to his reputation as the more crude and wheeling-dealing "Landslide Lyndon".<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 560.</ref> Caro suggests that Johnson's hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure.<ref>Caro 2012, Part I (passim).</ref>

Johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy's youth, poor health, and failure to take a position regarding Joseph McCarthy.<ref>Dallek 1991, p. 570.</ref> He had formed a "Stop Kennedy" coalition with [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], [[Stuart Symington]], and [[Hubert Humphrey]], but it proved a failure. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention to Kennedy's 806, and so the convention nominated Kennedy. [[Tip O'Neill]] was a representative from Kennedy's home state of [[Massachusetts]] at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, "Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot." O'Neill replied, "Senator, there's not going to be any second ballot."<ref>{{cite book |title=Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Century: A Biography |author=John A. Farrell |year=2001 |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=978-0-316-26049-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/tiponeilldemoc00farr}}</ref>

===Vice-presidential nomination===
According to Kennedy's Special Counsel [[Myer Feldman]] and Kennedy himself, it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which Johnson's vice-presidential nomination ultimately took place. Kennedy did realize that he could not be elected without the support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson; nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson. AFL-CIO President [[George Meany]] called Johnson "the arch-foe of labor", while Illinois AFL-CIO President [[Reuben Soderstrom]] asserted Kennedy had "made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement".<ref>Caro, Robert (2012). ''The Passage of Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson''. New York: Vintage Books. p. 406. {{ISBN|978-0-375-71325-5}}.</ref><ref>Soderstrom, Carl; Soderstrom, Robert; Stevens, Chris; Burt, Andrew (2018). [http://www.fortygavels.com/ ''Forty Gavels: The Life of Reuben Soderstrom and the Illinois AFL-CIO''.] '''3'''. Peoria, IL: CWS Publishing. pp. 175-176. {{ISBN|978-0998257532}}.</ref> After much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter, Kennedy did offer Johnson the vice-presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&nbsp;am on July 14, the morning after he was nominated, and Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, the facts are in dispute in many respects. (Convention chairman [[LeRoy Collins]]' declaration of a two-thirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed.)<ref>Dallek 1991, pp. 578–582.</ref>

Seymour Hersh stated that [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (known as Bobby) hated Johnson for his attacks on the Kennedy family, and later maintained that his brother offered the position to Johnson merely as a courtesy, expecting him to decline. [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] concurred with Robert Kennedy's version of events, and put forth that John Kennedy would have preferred [[Stuart Symington]] as his [[running-mate]], alleging that Johnson teamed with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] and pressured Kennedy to favor Johnson.<ref>Seymour M. Hersh, ''The Dark Side of Camelot'', 1997, Chapter 12.</ref> Robert Kennedy wanted his brother to choose labor leader [[Walter Reuther]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/ |title=Head to Head: JFK and RFK, Los Angeles, July 1960 |last=Cosgrave |first=Ben |date=May 24, 2014 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref>

Biographer Robert Caro offered a different perspective; he wrote that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close [[1960 U.S. presidential election|election]] against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]]. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry Texas and the [[Southern United States|Southern states]]. Caro's research showed that on July 14, John Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&nbsp;am, John Kennedy asked Robert Kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes "including Texas".<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135.">Caro 2012, pp. 121–135.</ref> Robert called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him. Salinger realized the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own and asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy–Johnson ticket, and Robert replied "yes".<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/> Caro contends that it was then that John Kennedy called Johnson to arrange a meeting; he also called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request that he nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role. According to Caro, Kennedy and Johnson met and Johnson said that Kennedy would have trouble with Kennedy supporters who were anti-Johnson. Kennedy returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy–Johnson ticket to his closest supporters, including northern political bosses. O'Donnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and, after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, Robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson—apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization.<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/>

Caro continues in his analysis that Robert Kennedy tried to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than the vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate; he met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say that Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought "it was a stroke of genius".<ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/> When John and Robert Kennedy next saw their father [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr|Joe Kennedy]], he told them that signing Johnson as running mate was the smartest thing that they had ever done.<ref>Caro 2012, p. 142.</ref>

Another account of how Johnson's nomination came about was told by [[Evelyn Lincoln]], JFK's secretary (both before and during his presidency).  In 1993, in a videotaped interview, she described how the decision was made, stating she was the only witness to a private meeting between John and Robert Kennedy in a suite at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] where they made the decision. She said she went in and out of the room as they spoke and, while she was in the room, heard them say that Johnson had tried to blackmail JFK into offering him the vice-presidential nomination with evidence of his [[John F. Kennedy#Affairs, extramarital relationships and friendships|womanizing]] provided by FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. She also overheard them discuss possible ways to avoid making the offer, and ultimately conclude that JFK had no choice.<ref>The History Channel (2003).

===Re-election to U.S. Senate===
At the same time as his vice presidential run, Johnson also sought a third term in the U.S. Senate. According to Robert Caro, "On November 8, 1960, Lyndon Johnson won an election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy–Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator (he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices). When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961."<ref>Caro 2002, p. 1035.</ref> (In 1988, [[Lloyd Bentsen]], the vice presidential running mate of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Michael Dukakis]], and a [[United States Senate|Senator]] from Texas, took advantage of "Lyndon's law," and was able to retain his seat in the Senate despite Dukakis' loss to [[George H. W. Bush]].)

Johnson was re-elected Senator with 1,306,605 votes (58&nbsp;percent) to Republican [[John Tower|John Tower's]] 927,653 (41.1&nbsp;percent). Fellow Democrat [[William A. Blakley]] was appointed to replace Johnson as Senator, but Blakley lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower.

==Vice president (1961–1963)==
After the election, Johnson was quite concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position. He initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency, since that office made him president of the Senate, but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus, including members whom he had counted as his supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/lyndon_johnson.pdf|title=Vice Presidents of the United States – Lyndon B.

[[File:President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson prior to ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|[[President Kennedy]] and Vice President Johnson outside the [[White House]] prior to a ceremony]]

Johnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch. He drafted an executive order for Kennedy's signature, granting Johnson "general supervision" over matters of national security, and requiring all government agencies to "cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments." Kennedy's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to "review" national security policies instead.<ref>Caro 2012, pp. 170–171.</ref> Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office and to employ a full-time Vice Presidential staff within the White House.<ref>Caro 2012, p. 172.</ref> His lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson's friend [[Sarah T. Hughes]] to a federal judgeship, whereas Johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for Hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency. [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.

Moreover, many members of the Kennedy White House were contemptuous of Johnson, including the president's brother, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] Robert F. Kennedy, and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque, crude manner. Congressman [[Tip O'Neill]] recalled that the Kennedy men "had a disdain for Johnson that they didn't even try to hide. ...

Kennedy, however, made efforts to keep Johnson busy, informed, and at the White House often, telling aides, "I can't afford to have my vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep him happy."<ref>Caro 2012, p. 176.</ref> Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as the head of the President's Committee on [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment Opportunities]], through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities.

Branch notes the irony of Johnson being the advocate for [[civil rights]] when the Kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters. In particular, he notes Johnson's [[Memorial Day]] 1963 speech at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], as being a catalyst that led to more action.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Johnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions, which gave him some insights into global issues, as well as opportunities at self-promotion in the name of showing the country's flag. He attended Cabinet and [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meetings. Kennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas, and appointed him chairman of the President's Ad Hoc Committee for Science.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 15.</ref>

Kennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics and Space Council]]. The Soviets beat the United States with [[Vostok 1|the first manned spaceflight]] in April 1961, and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the state of the U.S. space program and recommending a project that would allow the United States to catch up or beat the Soviets.<ref>Kennedy to Johnson, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo1.pdf "Memorandum for Vice President,"] April 20, 1961.</ref> Johnson responded with a recommendation that the United States gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a [[Apollo program|project to land an American on the Moon in the 1960s]].<ref name="lbjmemo">Johnson to Kennedy, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf "Evaluation of Space Program,"] April 28, 1961.</ref><ref>Ben Evans, ''Foothold in the Heavens: The Seventies'' (2010) p. 193.</ref> Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, but Johnson's appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 16.</ref>

Johnson was touched by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when [[Bobby Baker]], the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a protégé of Johnson's, came under investigation by the [[Senate Rules Committee]] for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President. Baker resigned in October, and the investigation did not expand to Johnson. The negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the upcoming 1964 presidential election. However, on October 31, 1963, a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have Johnson on the ticket the following year. Kennedy replied, "Yes to both those questions."<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0811F93A541A7B93C1AB178AD95F478685F9 "Kennedy Denied Talk of Dropping Johnson"].

==President (1963–1969)==
{{main|Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson}}
{{further|Foreign policy of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration}}
Johnson's presidency took place during a healthy economy, with steady growth and low unemployment. Regarding the rest of the world, there were no serious controversies with major countries. Attention, therefore, focused on domestic policy, and, after 1966, on the Vietnam War.

===Succession===

[[File:Lyndon B. Johnson taking the oath of office, November 1963.jpg|thumb|LBJ is sworn in on ''[[Air Force One]]'' by [[Judge Sarah Hughes]] as Mrs. Johnson and [[Mrs. Kennedy]] look on.]]

Johnson was quickly sworn in as President on ''[[VC-137C SAM 26000|Air Force One]]'' in Dallas on November 22, 1963, just two hours and eight minutes after [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F.

Johnson was convinced of the need to make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock.<ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2003|pp=73–78}}</ref> He and the Secret Service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy,<ref name="Hardesty">{{cite book |last=Hardesty |first=Von |title=Air Force One: The Aircraft that Shaped the Modern Presidency |publisher=Tehabi Books |location=San Diego, CA |year=2003 |pp=76–77}}</ref> and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from Dallas and return him to Washington.<ref name="Hardesty"/> This was greeted by some with assertions that Johnson was in too much haste to assume power.<ref>{{harvnb|Dallek|1998|pp=49–51}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Walsh|2003|p=78}}</ref>

On November 27, 1963, the new president delivered his [[Let Us Continue|Let Us Continue speech]] to a joint session of Congress, saying that "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1963/Transition-to-Johnson/|title=1963 Year in Review – Transition to Johnson |publisher=UPI |date=November 19, 1966 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson's promise to carry out Kennedy's plans and his policy of seizing Kennedy's legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda.

On November 29, 1963, just one week after Kennedy's assassination, Johnson issued an executive order to rename NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center|Apollo Launch Operations Center]] and the NASA/Air Force [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral launch facilities]] as the John F. Kennedy Space Center.<ref>{{cite web |title=The National Archives, Lyndon B.

Also on November 29, Johnson established a panel headed by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], known as the [[Warren Commission]], through [[executive order]] to investigate Kennedy's assassination and surrounding conspiracies.<ref>{{harvnb|Dallek|1998|p=51}}</ref> The commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] acted alone in the assassination. However, the report remains controversial among some [[John F.

Johnson retained senior Kennedy appointees, some for the full term of his presidency. He even retained Robert Kennedy as Attorney General, with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship. Robert Kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in 1964 to run for the Senate.<ref>{{harvnb|Dallek|1998|p=58}}</ref> Although Johnson had no official chief of staff, [[Walter Jenkins]] was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the White House. [[George Reedy]], who was Johnson's second-longest-serving aide, assumed the post of press secretary when John F. Kennedy's own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964.<ref>{{harvnb|Dallek|1998|p=66}}</ref> Horace Busby was another "triple-threat man", as Johnson referred to his aides. He served primarily as a speechwriter and political analyst.<ref>{{harvnb|Dallek|1998|p=67}}</ref> [[Bill Moyers]] was the youngest member of Johnson's staff; he handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.<ref>{{harvnb|Dallek|1998|p=68}}</ref>

===Legislative initiatives===
The new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's primary legislative goals—a tax cut. Johnson worked closely with [[Harry F. Byrd]] of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $100&nbsp;billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the [[Revenue Act of 1964]]. Congressional approval followed at the end of February, and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 73–74.</ref> In late 1963, Johnson also launched the initial offensive of his [[War on Poverty]], recruiting Kennedy relative [[Sargent Shriver]], then head of the [[Peace Corps]], to spearhead the effort. In March 1964, LBJ sent to Congress the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], which created the [[Job Corps]] and the [[Community Action Program]], designed to attack poverty locally. The act also created [[Americorps VISTA|VISTA]], Volunteers in Service to America, a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 76–80.</ref>

===Civil Rights Act of 1964===
{{Main|Civil Rights Act of 1964}}
[[File:Lyndon Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders.jpg|thumb|Meeting with civil rights leaders [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (left), [[Whitney Young]], and [[James Farmer]] in the [[Oval Office]] in 1964]]

President Kennedy had submitted a civil rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which was met with strong opposition.<ref>Reeves 1993, pp. 521–523</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|orig-year=1965|year=2002|title=A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House|page=973}}</ref> Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; but if it were successful, Johnson would receive ample credit.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 115.</ref> Historian [[Robert Caro]] notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past: southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459">Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 459.</ref> In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, to force the bill's supporters to pull it.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/>

Johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic, as he played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/> In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil rights bill was withdrawn.<ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/> Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.<ref name="Caro, Robert p460">Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 460.</ref>

Passing the civil rights bill in the House required getting it through the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]], which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it. Johnson decided on a campaign to use a [[discharge petition]] to force it onto the House floor.<ref name="Caro, Robert p462">Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 462.</ref> Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full House, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 116.</ref> In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil rights senators were left with the [[filibuster]] as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive because their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill.<ref>Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 463.</ref> According to Caro, Johnson ultimately could convince Republican leader [[Everett Dirksen]] to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71–29.<ref>Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 465</ref><ref name="Schlesinger-Pages644-645">{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur Jr.|orig-year=1978|year=2002|title=Robert Kennedy And His Times|pages=644–645}}</ref> Johnson signed the fortified [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] into law on July 2.<ref name="Schlesinger-Pages644-645"/> Legend has it that the evening after signing the bill, Johnson told an aide, "I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come", anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 120.</ref>

Biographer Randall B. Woods has argued that Johnson effectively used appeals to [[Judeo-Christian ethics]] to garner support for the civil rights law. Woods writes that Johnson undermined the Southern filibuster against the bill:

{{quote|LBJ wrapped white America in a moral straitjacket. How could individuals who fervently, continuously, and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just God continue to condone racial discrimination, police brutality, and segregation? Where in the Judeo-Christian ethic was there justification for killing young girls in a church in Alabama, denying an equal education to black children, barring fathers and mothers from competing for jobs that would feed and clothe their families? Was Jim Crow to be America's response to "Godless Communism"? <ref>Randall B. Woods, "The Politics of Idealism: Lyndon Johnson, Civil Rights, and Vietnam." ''Diplomatic History'' 31#1 (2007): pp. 1–18, quote p. 5; The same text appears in Woods, ''Prisoners of Hope: Lyndon B. Johnson, the Great Society, and the Limits of Liberalism'' (2016) p. 89.</ref>}}

Woods states that Johnson's religiosity ran deep: "At 15 he joined the Disciples of Christ, or Christian, church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor, the strong to assist the weak, and the educated to speak for the inarticulate."<ref>Woods, "The Politics of Idealism", p. 3.</ref> Johnson shared the beliefs of his mentor, FDR, in that he paired liberal values to religious values, believing that freedom and social justice served both God and man.<ref>Woods, ''Prisoners of Hope'', p. 90.</ref>

===The Great Society===

Johnson wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965. Eric Goldman, who joined the White House in December of that year, thought Johnson's domestic program was best captured in the title of Walter Lippman's book, ''The Good Society''. Richard Goodwin tweaked it—to "[[Great Society|The Great Society]]"—and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for Johnson in May 1964 at the [[University of Michigan]]. It encompassed movements of urban renewal, modern transportation, clean environment, anti-poverty, healthcare reform, crime control, and educational reform.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 81–82.</ref>

===1964 presidential election===
{{Main|1964 United States presidential election}}

In Spring 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 127.</ref> A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of [[featherbedding]]. Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse-trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances from the IRS, Johnson got an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence as well as his image.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 124–126.</ref>

[[File:Lyndon Johnson at the 1964 Illinois AFL-CIO Convention.jpg|left|thumb|President Lyndon Johnson (left), alongside Illinois AFL-CIO President [[Reuben G. Soderstrom|Reuben Soderstrom]] (center) and Vice President Stanley Johnson (right), speaks to the delegates of the 1964 Illinois AFL-CIO convention.]]

That same year, Robert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy had never liked one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 135–137.</ref> Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 140–142.</ref> Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.<ref name="Dallek 1998, p. 157">Dallek 1998, p. 157.</ref> Johnson, knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 157–159.</ref>

In preparation for the Democratic convention, Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor. The squad's focus narrowed upon the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. The squad's activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room as well as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE). From beginning to end, the squad's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 161–163.</ref>

[[File:ElectoralCollege1964.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|1964 presidential election results]]

Johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation, and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 164.</ref> The convention's Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to "bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote because of their race or color."<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 165.</ref> The MFDP rejected the committee's ruling. The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left; SNCC chairman [[John Lewis]] would call it a "turning point in the civil rights movement."<ref name="lewis">{{cite book|last1=Lewis |first1=John |last2=D'Orso |first2=Michael |author-link2=Mike D'Orso |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace]] |date=1998 |title=Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement |isbn=978-0156007085 |url=https://archive.org/details/walkingwithwinda00lewi }}</ref>

[[File:Daisy (1964).webm|thumb|thumbtime=3|left|"Daisy" advertisement]]

Early in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson's position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, Johnson's campaign managers broadcast the "[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy ad]]". It portrayed a little girl picking petals from a [[Common Daisy|daisy]], counting up to ten. Then a baritone voice took over, counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war. Goldwater's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming "In your heart, you know he's right.". Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson's campaign with bumper stickers that said "In your heart, you know he might" and "In your guts, you know he's nuts".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 170.</ref> Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05&nbsp;percent of the vote, making it the highest ever [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|share of the popular vote]].<ref>Leip, David. ''[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]''</ref> At the time, this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century—more than 15.95&nbsp;million votes—this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]].<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 182.</ref> In the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], Johnson defeated Goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52. Johnson won 44 states, compared to Goldwater's six. Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936—a Senate with a 68–32 majority and a house with a 295–140 Democratic margin.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 184.</ref>

===Voting Rights Act===
{{main|Voting Rights Act of 1965}}
Johnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office, ready to "carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1964/New-Moscow-Khrushchev-Fired/|title=1964 Year in Review – New Moscow: Khrushchev Fired|publisher=UPI|date=November 19, 1966}}</ref> He was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out. Nevertheless, the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately led Johnson to initiate a debate on a voting rights bill in February 1965.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 215.</ref>

[[File:Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. - Voting Rights Act.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|President Lyndon B. Johnson, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Rosa Parks]] at the signing of the [[Voting Rights Act]] on August 6, 1965]]

Johnson gave a congressional speech—Dallek considers it his greatest—in which he said "rarely at any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself ... rarely are we met with the challenge ... to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation."<ref name="Dallek 1998, p.218">Dallek 1998, p. 218.</ref> In 1965, he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the [[Voting Rights Act]], which outlawed discrimination in voting, thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time. Under the act, several states—"seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy" (Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia)—were subjected to the procedure of [[Voting Rights Act of 1965#Preclearance requirement|preclearance]] in 1965, while Texas, then home to the largest African American population of any state, followed in 1975.<ref name="Davidson, C. 1994 p. 3">Davidson, C. & Grofman, B.

After the murder of civil rights worker [[Viola Liuzzo]], Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen implicated in her death. He angrily denounced the Klan as a "hooded society of bigots," and warned them to "return to a decent society before it's too late." Johnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since [[Ulysses S. Grant]] about 93&nbsp;years earlier.{{efn|President Grant, on October 17, 1871, suspended [[habeas corpus]] in nine [[South Carolina]] counties, sent in troops, and prosecuted the Klan in the federal district court.}}<ref>McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 369–371.</ref> He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, thereby mobilizing support from churches North and South.<ref>Woods 2006, pp. 759–787.</ref> At the [[Howard University]] commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve these goals: "To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin. To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong—great wrong—to the children of God ..."<ref>''Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Lyndon B.

In 1967, Johnson nominated civil rights attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]] to be the first African-American [[list of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|justice]] of the Supreme Court. To head the new [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]], Johnson appointed [[Robert C. Weaver]], the first African-American cabinet secretary in any U.S. presidential administration. In 1968, Johnson signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The impetus for the law's passage came from the 1966 [[Chicago Freedom Movement|Chicago Open Housing Movement]], the April 4, 1968, [[assassination of Martin Luther King&nbsp;Jr.]], and the [[King assassination riots|civil unrest]] across the country following King's death.<ref name=Kotz2005P417>{{cite book|last=Kotz|first=Nick|title=Judgment days : Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King,&nbsp;Jr., and the laws that changed America|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-618-08825-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/judgmentdayslynd00kotz/page/417 417]|chapter=14.

With the passage of the sweeping [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the country's immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s were removed. The annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970, and doubled again by 1990, with dramatic increases from Asia and Latin American countries including Mexico.<ref name="'70s"/> Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law, which was not one of his priorities; he had supported the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCarren–Walter Act]] of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Mitchell B.|title=A Companion to Lyndon B.

===Federal funding for education===

Johnson, whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty, and was an essential component of the [[American dream]], especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted budgets from local taxes.<ref>Bernstein 1996, pp. 183–213.</ref> He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, LBJ launched a legislative effort that took the name of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) of 1965. The bill sought to double federal spending on education from $4&nbsp;billion to $8&nbsp;billion;<ref>Dallek 1988, pp. 195–198.</ref> with considerable facilitating by the White House, it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26, and then it remarkably passed without a change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. This was a historic accomplishment by the president, with the billion-dollar bill passing as introduced just 87&nbsp;days before.<ref>Dallek 1988, pp. 200–201.</ref>

For the first time, large amounts of federal money went to public schools. In practice ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities).<ref>Bernstein 1996, p. 195.</ref> For the first time, private schools (most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities) received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12&nbsp;percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 it was reported that less than half of the funds were applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by [[Hugh Davis Graham]] soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], which focused on funding for lower-income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.

Although ESEA solidified Johnson's support among K-12 teachers' unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam.<ref>Woods 2006, pp. 563–568.; Dallek 1988, pp. 196–202.</ref> In 1967, Johnson signed the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|Public Broadcasting Act]] to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks.

In 1965, Johnson also set up the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], to support academic subjects such as literature, history, and law, and arts such as music, painting, and sculpture (as the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] once did).<ref>{{cite web |title=National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, 20 US Code § 952 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/952|website=Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute|accessdate=February 18, 2017}}</ref>

==="War on Poverty" and healthcare reform===

In 1964, at Johnson's request, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1964]] and the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|Economic Opportunity Act]], as part of the [[war on poverty]]. Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and [[Federal Work-Study Program|Work Study]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/751/769950/Documents_Library/eoa1964.htm|title=Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|first=G.

Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort, presenting to Congress in January 1966 the "Demonstration Cities Program". To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to "arrest blight and decay and make a substantial impact on the development of its entire city." Johnson requested an investment of $400&nbsp;million per year totaling $2.4&nbsp;billion. In the fall of 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $900&nbsp;million, which Johnson later called the [[Model Cities Program]]. Changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill; the New York Times wrote 22&nbsp;years later that the program was, for the most part, a failure.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 320–322.</ref>

Johnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Strokes (HDCS). Combined, these diseases accounted for 71&nbsp;percent of the nation's deaths in 1962.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 204.</ref> To enact recommendations of the commission, Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered-down version.

As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 205.</ref> The key player in initiating this program, named [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], was [[Wilbur Mills]], Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. To reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three-layer cake: hospital insurance under Social Security; a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits; and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as [[Medicaid]].<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 208.</ref> The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8.

===Transportation===

In March 1965, Johnson sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Department, which would include the Commerce Department's Office of Transportation, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects; in the house, passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed October 15, 1965.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 315–316.</ref>

===Gun control===
On October 22, 1968, Lyndon Johnson signed the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], one of the largest and farthest-reaching federal gun control laws in American history. Much of the motivation for this large expansion of federal gun regulations came as a response to the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], Robert F. Kennedy, and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

===Space program===

During Johnson's administration, [[NASA]] conducted the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] manned space program, developed the [[Saturn V]] rocket and [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|its launch facility]], and prepared to make the first manned [[Apollo program]] flights. On January 27, 1967, the nation was stunned when the entire crew of [[Apollo 1]] was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad, stopping Apollo in its tracks. Rather than appointing another Warren-style commission, Johnson accepted Administrator [[James E. Webb]]'s request for NASA to do its investigation, holding itself accountable to Congress and the President.<ref>{{cite web |title=James E. Webb – NASA Administrator, February 14, 1961 – October 7, 1968 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/Biographies/webb.html |publisher=NASA |work=History.NASA.gov |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425115407/https://history.nasa.gov/Biographies/webb.html |archive-date=April 25, 2009}}</ref> Johnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy, and the program recovered. The first two manned missions, [[Apollo 7]] and the first manned flight to the Moon, [[Apollo 8]], were completed by the end of Johnson's term. He congratulated the Apollo 8 crew, saying, "You've taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/lj36.html |title=Lyndon B.

===Urban riots===
[[File:Leffler - 1968 Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. riots.jpg|thumb|Aftermath from a race riot in Washington D.C., April 1968]]

Major riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of "long hot summers." They started with a violent disturbance in the [[Harlem Riot of 1964|Harlem riots]] in 1964, and the [[Watts Riots|Watts district]] of Los Angeles in 1965, and extended to 1971. The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of 1965, with the riots in Watts. After 34 people were killed and $35&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|35|1965|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in the property was damaged, the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities, and so the appetite for additional programs in LBJ's agenda was lost.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 222–223.</ref>

[[1967 Newark riots|Newark burned]] in 1967, where six days of rioting left 26 dead, 1,500 injured, and the inner city a burned-out shell. In [[1967 Detroit riot|Detroit in 1967]], Governor [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] sent in 7,400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally, 43 were dead, 2,250 were injured, 4,000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The [[King assassination riots|biggest wave of riots]] came in April 1968, in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this request had little Congressional support. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party.<ref>Woods, Randall (2006), pp. 790–795.; Michael W. Flamm. ''Law And Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s'' (2005).</ref> Johnson created the [[Kerner Commission]] to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor [[Otto Kerner Jr.|Otto Kerner]].<ref name="'70s"/> According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: "What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off."<ref name=Kotz2005P418>{{cite book|last=Kotz|first=Nick|title=Judgment days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., and the laws that changed America|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-618-08825-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/judgmentdayslynd00kotz/page/418 418]|chapter=14.

As a result of rioting in Washington D.C. after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,  President Johnson determined that "a condition of domestic violence and disorder" existed and issued a proclamation and executive order mobilizing combat-equipped troops. ''The New York Times'' reported that 4,000 regular Army and National Guard troops entered into the nation's capital "to try to end riotous looting, burglarizing and burning by roving bands of Negro youths."  Some of the troops were sent to guard the Capital and the White House.<ref>{{cite news |last1=FRANKLIN |first1=BEN A. |title=Army Troops in Capital as Negroes Riot |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/race/040668race-ra.html |accessdate=July 24, 2020 |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=April 6, 1968}}</ref>

===Backlash against Johnson (1966–1967)===
[[File:Marcos visit Johnson 1966.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Bird Johnson]] and LBJ with [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand]] and [[Imelda Marcos]] on September 12, 1966]]
In 1966 the press sensed a "[[credibility gap]]" between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in Vietnam, which led to much less favorable coverage.<ref name="american chronicle">{{cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883|publisher=American Chronicle|date=March 15, 2006|title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference – 93 years young!|first=Robert|last=Rouse|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913094418/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883|archive-date=September 13, 2008}}</ref>

By year's end, the Democratic governor of [[Missouri]], [[Warren E. Hearnes]], warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a margin of 500,000 in 1964. "Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and ... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs"{{uncited quote|date=December 2018}} had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5&nbsp;percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in [[interest rate]]s. Johnson asked for a temporary 6&nbsp;percent surcharge in [[income tax]]es to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50&nbsp;percent; by January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16&nbsp;percent, from 25&nbsp;percent four months before. He ran about even with Republican [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] in trial matchups that spring. Asked to explain why he was unpopular, Johnson responded, "I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don't always please all the people."{{uncited quote|date=December 2018}} Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed "complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to." He also blamed "the preachers, liberals and professors" who had turned against him.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 391–396; quotes on pp. 391 and 396.</ref>
In the [[1966 United States elections|congressional elections of 1966]], the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the [[conservative coalition]] and making it more difficult for Johnson to pass any additional Great Society legislation. However, in the end, Congress passed almost 96&nbsp;percent of the administration's Great Society programs, which Johnson then signed into law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideainfanttoddler.org/pdf/AppA.pdf|title=The Impact of the Great Society Upon The Lives of Families and Young Children|publisher=Infant & Toddler Coordinators Association|date=August 2005|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

===Vietnam War===
{{see also|Vietnam War}}
At Kennedy's death, there were 16,000 American military personnel stationed in [[Vietnam]] supporting [[South Vietnam]] in the war against [[North Vietnam]].<ref name="Vietnam War">{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |title=Brief Overview of Vietnam War |publisher=Swarthmore College Peace Collection |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124531/http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |archive-date=August 3, 2016}}</ref> Vietnam had been partitioned at the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] into two countries, with North Vietnam led by a Communist government. Johnson subscribed to the [[Domino Theory]] in Vietnam and to a [[containment]] policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion.<ref name="scholastic">{{cite news |title=The Sixties |publisher=Junior Scholastic |date=February 11, 1994 |page=4}}</ref> On taking office, Johnson immediately reversed Kennedy's order to withdraw 1,000 military personnel by the end of 1963.<ref>Reeves 1993, p. 613.</ref> In late summer 1964, Johnson seriously questioned the value of staying in Vietnam but, after meeting with Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[Maxwell D.

====1964====
[[File:Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and Lyndon B Johnson Souvenir Poster.jpg|thumb|Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and Queen [[Farah Pahlavi]] with the Johnsons on their visit to the United States]]

In August 1964, allegations arose from the military that two U.S. destroyers had been attacked by some North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin; naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory. Although Johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign, he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the Vietnamese, so he sought and obtained from the Congress the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] on August 7. Johnson was determined to embolden his image on foreign policy, and also wanted to prevent criticism such as Truman had received in Korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action. Responding to the purported attack would also blunt presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish Goldwater camp. The resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander-in-chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of [[SEATO]] requesting assistance. Johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary U.S. goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice, as opposed to any U.S. offensive posture.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 144–155.</ref> The public's reaction to the resolution at the time was positive—48&nbsp;percent favored stronger measures in Vietnam and only 14&nbsp;percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave.<ref name="Dallek 1998, p. 157"/>

In the 1964 presidential campaign, Johnson restated his determination to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea; but privately he had a sense of foreboding about Vietnam—a feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly. Indeed, his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional [[Viet Minh]] attacks on U.S. ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on [[Bien Hoa Air Base]] in South Vietnam.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 240.</ref> Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs, and also after public pollster [[Louis Harris|Lou Harris]] confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 241.</ref> By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam; U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.<ref name="Vietnam War"/>

In the winter of 1964–1965, Johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam; moreover, a plurality in the polls at the time was in favor of military action against the communists, with only 26 to 30&nbsp;percent opposed.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 244.</ref> Johnson revised his priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. He then agreed with [[McGeorge Bundy|Mac Bundy]] and McNamara that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation. Johnson said, "Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what we ought to do. I'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly. General [[Nguyễn Khánh]] (head of the new government) is our boy".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 247.</ref>

====1965====

Johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate U.S. action to avoid defeat; also, the [[Viet Cong]] had just killed eight U.S. advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at [[Pleiku Air Base]]. The eight-week bombing campaign became known as [[Operation Rolling Thunder]]. Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear: there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 249.</ref> Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war. But the short-term expectations were consistent that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered. By limiting the information given out to the public, and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 250–252.</ref>

In March, Bundy began to urge the use of ground forces—air operations alone, he counseled, would not stop Hanoi's aggression against the South. Johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18,000 to 20,000 and the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron, in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions. More significantly, he also authorized a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations; he nevertheless continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 255.</ref>

By the middle of June, the total U.S. ground forces in Vietnam have increased to 82,000 or by 150&nbsp;percent.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 268.</ref> That same month, Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 270.</ref> General Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82,000 to 175,000. After consulting with his principals, Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request. Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices—between sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists. If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached. He continued to insist that his decision "did not imply any change in policy whatsoever". Of his desire to veil the decision, Johnson jested privately, "If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and she has it in the center of her forehead, you don't keep her in the living room".<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 272–277.</ref> By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 284.</ref>

Johnson underwent surgery on November 8, 1965, at the [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] to remove his gallbladder and a kidney stone. Afterward, his doctors reported that the president had come through the surgery "beautifully as expected";<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gilbert |first=Robert E. |title=Presidential Disability and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment: The Difficulties Posed By Psychological Illness |journal=Fordham Law Review |volume=79 |issue=3 |year=2010 |url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol79/iss3/5 |pages=843–879}}</ref> he was able to resume his duties the next day. He met with reporters a couple of days later and reassured the nation that he was recovering well. Although Johnson was incapacitated during surgery, there was no transfer of presidential power to Vice President Humphrey, as no constitutional procedure to do so existed at the time. The [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]], which Congress had sent to the states for [[ratification]] four months earlier, included procedures for the orderly transfer of power in the case of presidential incapacity, but was not ratified until 1967.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Politics and the president's gallbladder |last=Pappas |first=Theodore N. |date=July 1, 2017 |journal=Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons |url=http://bulletin.facs.org/2017/07/politics-and-the-presidents-gallbladder/ |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=The Political Effects of Presidential Illness: The Case of Lyndon B.

====1966====
[[File:Visit of President Johnson in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Awarding a medal to a U.S. soldier during a visit to Vietnam in 1966]]
Public and political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966, and Johnson's approval ratings reached a new low of 41&nbsp;percent. [[Richard Russell Jr.|Sen. Richard Russell]], Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, reflected the national mood in June 1966 when he declared it was time to "get it over or get out".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 364.</ref> Johnson responded by saying to the press, "we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost."<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 365.</ref> In response to the intensified criticism of the war effort, Johnson raised suspicions of communist subversion in the country, and press relations became strained.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 366.</ref> Johnson's primary war policy opponent in Congress was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, [[James William Fulbright]],<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 369.</ref> who convened a series of public hearings in February to question a range of experts on the progress of the war.<ref>[https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-09-28/1966-fulbright-hearings-vietnam-parted-curtains-president-johnsons-conduct-war "The 1966 Fulbright hearings on Vietnam parted the curtains on President Johnson's conduct of the war"], September 28, 2017, PRI.org.</ref> The persistent Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum, oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam, in hopes of accelerating victory.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 372–373.</ref> Humphrey, Rusk, and McNamara all agreed, and the bombing began at the end of June.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 373–374.</ref> In July, polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a five-to-one&nbsp;margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 376.</ref>

In the fall of 1966, multiple sources began to report that progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions. There was no shortage of peace initiatives; nevertheless, among protesters, English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson's policy as "a barbaric aggressive war of conquest", and in June he initiated the [[Russell Tribunal|International War Crimes Tribunal]] as a means to condemn the American effort.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 380.</ref> The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. In August, Johnson appointed [[Averell Harriman]] "Ambassador for Peace" to promote negotiations. Westmoreland and McNamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification; Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 381.</ref> Also in October 1966, to reassure and promote his war effort, Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila—the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians, and New Zealanders.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 383.</ref> The conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 384.</ref> For Johnson it was a fleeting public relations success—confirmed by a 63&nbsp;percent Vietnam approval rating in November.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 385.</ref> Nevertheless, in December, Johnson's Vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s; LBJ had become anxious to justify war casualties, and talked of the need for a decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 386.</ref> In a discussion about the war with former President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] on October 3, 1966, Johnson said he was "trying to win it just as fast as I can in every way that I know how" and later stated that he needed "all the help I can get."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/Press.hom/tape_release_11_2006.shtm |title=LBJ Library releases telephone conversation recordings |publisher=Lbjlib.utexas.edu |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611221222/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/Press.hom/tape_release_11_2006.shtm |archive-date=June 11, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:A2738-19a small.jpg|thumb|Johnson greeting a crowd, 1966]]
By year's end, it was clear that current pacification efforts were ineffectual, as had been the air campaign. Johnson then agreed to McNamara's new recommendation to add 70,000 troops in 1967 to the 400,000 previously committed. While McNamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing, Johnson agreed with CIA recommendations to increase them.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 386–388.</ref> The increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in Saigon, Hanoi, and Warsaw. While the bombing ended the talks, North Vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 390.</ref>

====1967====
[[File:LBJ-and-McNamara.jpg|thumb|Johnson talking with his Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], 1967]]

In January and February 1967, probes were made to assess North Vietnamese's willingness to discuss peace, but they fell on deaf ears. Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the U.S.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 445–447.</ref> A Gallup poll taken in July 1967 showed that 52&nbsp;percent of the country disapproved of the president's handling of the war, and only 34&nbsp;percent thought progress was being made.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 474.</ref> Johnson's anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 461.</ref> Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Kennedy, "I'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months", he shouted. "You'll be dead politically in six months".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 447.</ref> McNamara offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May; the administration could declare its objective in the war—South Vietnam's self-determination—was being achieved and the upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government. The United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome. But Johnson was reluctant, in light of some optimistic reports, again of questionable reliability, which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope for improvement. The CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid, as well as military manpower reductions.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 463–464.</ref>

By the middle of 1967, nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war. In July, Johnson sent McNamara, Wheeler, and other officials to meet with Westmoreland and reach an agreement on plans for the immediate future. At that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a "stalemate". Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction, and that "we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes".<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 470–471.</ref> Though Westmoreland sought many more, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 473.</ref> In August Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs' support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 477.</ref> In September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier, Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation, so Johnson ceased bombing in a 10-mile zone around Hanoi; this was met with dissatisfaction. In a Texas speech, Johnson agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt; this was named the "San Antonio" formula. There was no response, but Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 482–484.</ref>

[[File:Vietnam War protestors at the March on the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Vietnam War protestors march at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 1967. Support for the war was dropping and [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|the anti-Vietnam War movement]] strengthened.]]

With the war still arguably in a stalemate and light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict, Johnson convened a group called the "Wise Men" for a fresh, in-depth look at the war—Dean Acheson, General Omar Bradley, George Ball, Mac Bundy, Arthur Dean, Douglas Dillon, Abe Fortas, Averell Harriman, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Murphy and Max Taylor.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 494.</ref> At that time McNamara, reversing his position on the war, recommended that a cap of 525,000 is placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted since he could see no success. Johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and McNamara's resignation soon followed.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 495.</ref> Except for George Ball, the "Wise Men" all agreed the administration should "press forward".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 496.</ref> Johnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 U.S. election results before deciding to negotiate.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 501.</ref>

On June 23, 1967, Johnson traveled to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser. Thousands of [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protesters]] tried to march past the hotel where he was speaking. The march was led by a coalition of peace protestors. However, a small group of [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] and [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] protestors activists placed themselves at the head of the march and, when they reached the hotel, staged a sit-down. Efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful. Hundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd. The [[Riot Act]] was read and 51 protestors arrested.<ref name="NYT62467">{{cite news |author1=Gladwin Hill |title=51 Protesters Arrested |accessdate=December 12, 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=June 24, 1967 |url=http://nyti.ms/2heLqF0}}</ref><ref name="Marxist5R">{{cite web |author1=Jim Dann and Hari Dillon |title=The Five Retreats: A History of the Failure of the Progressive Labor Party – Chapter 2: The retreat from the anti-war movement 1967–1968 |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/1960-1970/5retreats/chapter2.htm#bk15 |website=Marxist.org |publisher=Marxist.org |accessdate=December 12, 2016 |quote=On June 23, 1967 President Johnson came to Century City, Los Angeles to speak.

In October, with the ever-increasing public protests against the war, Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate, monitor and undermine anti-war activists.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 486–487.</ref> In mid-October there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon; Johnson and Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration, which was refuted by CIA findings.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 489.</ref>

====1968====
[[File:L B Johnson Model Khe Sanh.jpeg|thumb|[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] shows President Lyndon B. Johnson a model of the [[Battle of Khe Sanh|Khe Sanh]] area in February 1968]]

As casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever, Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] cards, and chanted, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"<ref name="scholastic"/> Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], where thousands of [[hippies]], [[yippies]], [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and other opponents of Johnson's policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest.<ref>Frank Kusch, ''Battleground Chicago: The Police and the 1968 Democratic National Convention'' (Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 2008), p. 62.</ref> Thus by 1968, the public was polarized, with the "hawks" rejecting Johnson's refusal to continue the war indefinitely, and the "doves" rejecting his current war policies. Support for Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey. He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election, and personally despised Nixon. One of Johnson's well-known quotes was "the Democratic party at its worst, is still better than the Republican party at its best".<ref>Gould 2010, p. 98.</ref>

On January 30, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese launched the [[Tet Offensive]] against South Vietnam's five largest cities, including Saigon and the U.S. embassy there and other government installations. While the Tet Offensive failed militarily, it was a psychological victory, definitively turning American public opinion against the war effort. Iconically, [[Walter Cronkite]] of [[CBS News]], voted the nation's "most trusted person" in February, opined on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing. Johnson reacted, saying "If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America".<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 505–506.</ref> Indeed, demoralization about the war was everywhere; 26&nbsp;percent then approved of Johnson's handling of Vietnam; 63&nbsp;percent disapproved. Johnson agreed to increase the troop level by 22,000, despite a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs for ten times that number.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 509.</ref> By March 1968, Johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war. [[Clark Clifford]], the new Defense Secretary, described the war as "a loser" and proposed to "cut losses and get out".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 511.</ref> On March 31, Johnson spoke to the nation of "Steps to Limit the War in Vietnam". He then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time. At the close of his speech [[Shermanesque statement|he also announced]], "I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President".<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 513.</ref>

[[File:Boeing B-52 dropping bombs.jpg|thumb|Tens of thousands of civilians were killed during the American bombing of North Vietnam in [[Operation Rolling Thunder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/battlefieldvietnam/timeline/index2.html |title=Battlefield:Vietnam Timeline |publisher=[[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)]]}}</ref>]]

In March, Johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that 90&nbsp;percent of North Vietnam's population and 75&nbsp;percent of its territory was off-limits to bombing. In April he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks, and after extensive negotiations over the site, Paris was agreed to and talks began in May. When the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in Paris.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 538–541.</ref> Two months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 564.</ref> Despite recommendations in August from Harriman, Vance, Clifford, and Bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for Hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks, Johnson refused.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 569.</ref> In October, when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt, Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese, making promises of better terms, to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 584–585.</ref> After the election, Johnson's primary focus on Vietnam was to get Saigon to join the Paris peace talks. Ironically, only after Nixon added his urging did they do so. Even then they argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office.<ref>Dallek 1998, p. 597.</ref>

===The Six-Day War and Israel===
[[File:Glassboro-meeting1967.jpg|thumb|Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] (left) next to Johnson during the [[Glassboro Summit Conference]]]]

In a 1993 interview for the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|Johnson Presidential Library]] oral history archives, Johnson's Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that a [[carrier battle group]], the [[U.S. 6th Fleet]], sent on a training exercise toward [[Gibraltar]], was re-positioned back towards the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to be able to assist Israel during the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967. Given the rapid Israeli advances following their strike on Egypt, the administration "thought the situation was so tense in Israel that perhaps the Syrians, fearing Israel would attack them, or the Soviets supporting the Syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack Israel". The Soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move. In a [[Moscow–Washington hotline|hotline]] message from Moscow, Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] said, "If you want war you're going to get war."<ref name="oralhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/McNamaraR/McNamara-SP1.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010707072726/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/McNamaraR/McNamara-SP1.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2001 |title=LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON LIBRARY ORAL HISTORY COLLECTION |publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum |accessdate=October 8, 2005}}</ref>

As he had served less than 24&nbsp;months of President Kennedy's term, Johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the 1968 presidential election under the provisions of the [[22nd Amendment]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Johnson Can Seek Two Full Terms |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 24, 1963 |page=A2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Moore |first=William |title=Law Permits 2 Full Terms for Johnson |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |date=November 24, 1963 |page=7}}</ref>
Initially, no prominent Democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting president of the Democratic Party. Only Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] of [[Minnesota]] challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire]] [[primary election|primary]], hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, McCarthy won 42&nbsp;percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49&nbsp;percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York entered the race. Internal polling by Johnson's campaign in [[Wisconsin]], the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly. Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign.

By this time Johnson had lost control of the Democratic Party, which was splitting into four generally antagonistic factions. The first consisted of Johnson (and Humphrey), labor unions, and local party bosses led by Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]. The second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy. The third group was Catholics, Hispanics, and African Americans, who rallied behind Robert Kennedy. The fourth group was traditionally segregationist white Southerners, who rallied behind [[George C. Wallace]] and the [[American Independent Party]]. Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party, and Johnson could see no way to win the war<ref name="scholastic"/> and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win re-election.<ref>Gould 2010.</ref>

Also, although it was not made public at the time, Johnson had become more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another four-year term. In 1967, he secretly commissioned an actuarial study that (presciently) predicted he would die at 64.<ref name="LastDays">{{cite news|last1=Janos|first1=Leo|title=The Last Days of the President|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1973/07/the-last-days-of-the-president/376281/|accessdate=February 16, 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]}}</ref> Therefore, at the end of a speech on March 31, 1968, he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: "I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-31-1968-remarks-decision-not-seek-re-election|title=Remarks on Decision not to Seek Re-Election (March 31, 1968)|publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia|accessdate=October 2, 2017|date=October 20, 2016}}</ref>
The next day, his approval ratings increased from 36&nbsp;percent to 49&nbsp;percent.<ref name=Updegrove12>{{cite book|last=Updegrove|first=Mark K.|title=Indomitable will : LBJ in the presidency|year=2012|publisher=Crown|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-88771-9|edition=1st|page=272}}</ref>

Historians have debated the factors that led to Johnson's surprise decision. Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeff|last=Shesol|title=Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud that Defined a Decade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVrRvYV7i78C&pg=PA545|year=1998|publisher=W W Norton |pages=545–547 |accessdate=October 25, 2015|isbn=9780393318555}}</ref>  Gould says that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies and underestimated McCarthy's strength until the last minute, when it was too late for Johnson to recover.<ref>Gould 2010, pp. 16–18.</ref> Woods says Johnson realized he needed to leave for the nation to heal.<ref>Woods 2007, pp. 834–835.</ref> Dallek says that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 518–525.</ref> Bennett, however, says Johnson "had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia."<ref>{{cite book |author=Anthony J.

After [[Robert Kennedy's assassination]], Johnson rallied the party bosses and unions to give Humphrey the nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. Personal correspondences between the President and some in the Republican Party suggested Johnson tacitly supported [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson Rockefeller's]] campaign. He reportedly said that if Rockefeller became the Republican nominee, he would not campaign against him (and would not campaign for Humphrey).<ref>{{cite book |last=Perlstein |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Perlstein |title=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America |title-link=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7432-4302-5}}</ref> In what was termed the [[October surprise]], Johnson announced to the nation on October 31, 1968, that he had ordered a complete cessation of "all air, naval and artillery bombardment of [[North Vietnam]]", effective November 1, should the [[Hanoi]] Government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]]. In the end, Democrats did not fully unite behind Humphrey, enabling Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]] to win the election.

[[File:Thurgood-marshall-2.jpg|thumb|upright|With the appointment of [[Thurgood Marshall]], Johnson placed the first African American on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].]]

Johnson appointed the following Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]:
* [[Abe Fortas]]{{snds}}1965
* [[Thurgood Marshall]]{{snds}}1967 (the first African-American)

Johnson anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures in 1965 and thought it advantageous to have a "mole" in the Supreme Court who he thought could provide him with inside information, as he was able to get from the legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular was the individual that Johnson thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for Ambassador to the UN, with Adlai Stevenson's death; Associate Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] accepted Johnson's offer to transfer to the UN position. Johnson insisted on Fortas assuming Goldberg's seat, over Fortas's wife's objection that it was too early in his career. Mrs. Fortas expressed disapproval to Johnson personally afterward.<ref>Dallek 1998, pp. 233–235.</ref> When [[Earl Warren]] announced his retirement in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and nominated [[Homer Thornberry]] to succeed Fortas as Associate Justice. However, Fortas's nomination was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate.

{{quote|On Inauguration Day (January 20, 1969), Johnson saw Nixon sworn in, then got on the plane to fly back to Texas. When the front door of the plane closed, Johnson pulled out a cigarette—his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955. One of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said, "Daddy, what are you doing? You're going to kill yourself." He took it back and said, "I've now raised you, girls. I've now been President. ''Now it's my time!''" From that point on, he went into a very self-destructive spiral.|Historian [[Michael Beschloss]]<ref>''Decisions That Shook the World'', vol. 1, 38:18–47. Dir. Gerald Rafshoon. Camera Planet/Discovery Productions, 2004.</ref>}}

After leaving the presidency in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by a former aide and speechwriter [[Harry J. Middleton]], who would draft Johnson's first book, ''The Choices We Face,'' and work with him on his memoirs entitled ''The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969,'' published in 1971.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harry J. Middleton Curriculum Vitae|date=February 25, 1971|agency=LBJ Presidential Library Reading Room}}</ref> That year, the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] opened on the campus of [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park]], with the provision that the ranch "remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Marvin |last=Harris |url=https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/615573 |title=Taming the wild pecan at Lyndon B.

Johnson gave Nixon high grades in foreign policy but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U.S. forces too quickly from South Vietnam before the South Vietnamese were able to defend themselves. "If the South falls to the Communists, we can have a serious backlash here at home," he warned.<ref name="theatlantic1973">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/73jul/janos.htm|date=July 1973|title=The Last Days of the President|last=Janos|first=Leo|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref>

During the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], Johnson endorsed Democratic presidential nominee [[George S. McGovern]], a senator from [[South Dakota]], although McGovern had long opposed Johnson's foreign and defense policies. The McGovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him. Nixon could be defeated, Johnson insisted, "if only the Democrats don't go too far left."<ref name="LastDays" /> Johnson had felt [[Edmund Muskie]] would be more likely to defeat Nixon; however, he declined an invitation to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern. Johnson's protégé [[John Connally]] had served as President Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head "[[Democrats for Nixon]]", a group funded by Republicans. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ashman |first=Charles R. |title=Connally: The Adventures of Big Bad John |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |year=1974 |isbn=978-0688002220 |page=[https://archive.org/details/connallyadventur00ashm/page/271 271] |url=https://archive.org/details/connallyadventur00ashm/page/271}}</ref>

=== Heart issues ===
[[File:LBJ At Ranch 1972.jpg|thumb|Wearing a [[Cowboy hat|ten-gallon hat]] at his ranch in Texas, 1972]]

In March 1970, Johnson suffered an attack of [[angina]] and was taken to [[San Antonio Military Medical Center|Brooke Army General Hospital]] in [[San Antonio]]. He had gained more than {{convert|25|lb}} since leaving the White House; he now weighed around {{convert|235|lb}} and was urged to lose considerable weight. He had also resumed smoking after nearly 15&nbsp;years of not smoking. The following summer, again gripped by chest pains, he lost {{convert|15|lb}} in less than a month on a crash diet.

In April 1972, Johnson had a second heart attack while visiting his daughter, Lynda, in Virginia. "I'm hurting real bad",<ref name="LastDays" /> he confided to friends. The chest pains returned nearly every afternoon{{mdashb}}a series of sharp, jolting pains that left him frightened and breathless. A portable oxygen tank was kept by his bed, and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask. He continued to smoke heavily and, although nominally living on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only intermittently. Meanwhile, he began to experience severe abdominal pains, diagnosed as [[diverticulosis]]. His heart condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended, so Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Dr. [[Michael DeBakey]], where he learned his condition was terminal. DeBakey found Johnson's heart to be in such poor condition that although two of his coronary arteries required bypass surgery, the former President was not well enough to consider an attempt and would likely have died in surgery.<ref name="theatlantic1973"/>

==Death and funeral==
[[File:Lyndon Baines Johnson grave cropped.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Johnson's grave]]
Johnson recorded an hour-long television interview with newsman Walter Cronkite at his ranch on January 12, 1973, in which he discussed his legacy, particularly about the civil rights movement. He was still smoking heavily at the time, and told Cronkite that it was better for his heart "to smoke than to be nervous".<ref>{{cite news |title=In His Final Days, LBJ Agonized Over His Legacy |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/lbjs-last-interview |accessdate=April 25, 2019 |work=PBS NewsHour |date=December 4, 2012 |language=en-us}}</ref>

Ten days later, at approximately 3:39&nbsp;p.m. Central Time on January 22, 1973, Johnson suffered a massive heart attack in his bedroom. He managed to telephone the Secret Service agents on the ranch, who found him still holding the telephone receiver, unconscious and not breathing. Johnson was airlifted in one of his planes to San Antonio and taken to Brooke Army Medical Center, where cardiologist and Army colonel Dr. George McGranahan pronounced him dead on arrival. He was 64 years old.<ref>''[[The Age]]'', January 23, 1973, p. 1.</ref>

Shortly after Johnson's death, his press secretary [[Tom Johnson (journalist)|Tom Johnson]] telephoned the newsroom at CBS. Cronkite was live on the air with ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' at the time, and a report on Vietnam was airing. The call was patched through to Cronkite, and while Johnson relayed the information the director cut out of the report to return to the news desk. Cronkite, still on the phone, kept Johnson on the call while he gathered whatever available relevant information, then repeated it to his viewers.<ref>{{YouTube|id=j9mCcfN9iRk|title=Death of LBJ as it broke}}</ref> Johnson's death came two days after [[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's second inauguration]], which followed Nixon's landslide victory in the 1972 election.

Eulogies were given by former Texas governor [[John Connally]] and the Reverend [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], the minister who officiated at the burial rites. The state funeral, the last for a president until [[Death and state funeral of Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] in 1994, was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington, as the [[United States Army Military District of Washington|Military District of Washington]] (MDW) dealt with its second major task in less than a week, beginning with [[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon|Nixon's second inauguration]].<ref name="MDW">{{cite news |last=Elsen |first=William A.|title=Ceremonial Group Had Busy 5 Weeks |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 25, 1973 |page=D3}}</ref> The inauguration affected the state funeral in various ways, because Johnson died only two days after the inauguration.<ref name="Capitol"/><ref name="MDW"/> The MDW and the [[Joint Task Force-Armed Forces Inaugural Committee|Armed Forces Inaugural Committee]] canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration, to allow for a full state funeral,<ref name="MDW"/> and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral.<ref name="MDW"/> It also meant that Johnson's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol, entering through the Senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the House wing steps due to inauguration construction on the East Front steps.<ref name="Capitol"/>

==Personality and public image==
[[File:LBJ National Portrait Gallery.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Johnson's image as it appears in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C.]]
According to biographer Randall Woods, Johnson posed in many different roles. Depending on the circumstances, he could be:

{{quote|"Johnson the Son of the Tenant Farmer, Johnson the Great Compromiser, Johnson the All-Knowing, Johnson the Humble, Johnson the Warrior, Johnson the Dove, Johnson the Romantic, Johnson the Hard-Headed Pragmatist, Johnson the Preserver of Traditions, Johnson the Crusader for Social Justice, Johnson the Magnanimous, Johnson the Vindictive or Johnson the Uncouth, LBJ the Hick, Lyndon the Satyr, and Johnson the Usurper".<ref>Woods, ''LBJ,'' pp. 639, 644–645., quoted in Germany, "Historians and the Many Lyndon Johnsons." p. 1007.</ref>}}

Other historians have noted how he played additional roles, as Kent Germany reports:

{{quote|"the big daddy, the southerner-westerner-Texan, the American dreamer, the politician, the father's son, the rising star, the flawed giant, the Periclean paradox (domestic dreams undone by war), the very human, the tragedy, the pathbreaker, the ascender, and the master."<ref>Germany, "Historians and the Many Lyndon Johnsons." p. 1007.</ref>}}

Johnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was absent of any leisure activities. "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." As President, Johnson vetoed 30 bills; no other President in history vetoed so many bills and never had a single one overridden by Congress.

[[File:Lyndon B. Johnson's family Xmas Eve 1968.jpg|thumb|Johnson with his family in the [[Yellow Oval Room]], Christmas 1968]]
Johnson's cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and genuine love of the rural hill country. From {{convert|250|acre}} of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951, he created a {{convert|2700|acre|adj=on}} working ranch with 400 head of registered Hereford cattle. The [[National Park Service]] keeps a herd of Hereford cattle descended from Johnson's registered herd and maintains the ranch property.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ranching the LBJ Way |url=http://www.nps.gov/lyjo/planyourvisit/lbjranching.htm |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>

Biographer Randall Woods argues that [[Social Gospel]] themes Johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the [[Great Society]] and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to a sort of Christian internationalism and nation-building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940, adding "It would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal."<ref>Randall B. Woods, ''LBJ: Architect of American Ambition'' (2006) pp. 27, 430, 465–466, 486–487.</ref>

History has viewed Johnson both through the lens of his historic legislative achievements, and his lack of success in the Vietnam War. His overall rating among historians has remained relatively steady over the past 35&nbsp;years, and his average ranking is higher than any of the eight presidents who followed him, although similar to Reagan and Clinton.<ref>{{cite web |title=Siena College presidential surveys |url=https://www.siena.edu/centers-institutes/siena-research-institute/social-cultural-polls/us-presidents-study/ |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref>
