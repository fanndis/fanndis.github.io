[[File:Spectrum Center 2018.jpg|thumb|The [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]] in Charlotte, North Carolina, was originally to be the site of the convention.]]

[[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], were mentioned as possible locations for the 2020 RNC due to their locations within "[[swing state]]s." Neither had ever hosted a [[Republican National Convention]], although Charlotte had hosted the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]]. A Charlotte [[television station]], [[WBTV]], reported that Charlotte, Las Vegas, and "another unnamed city in [[Texas]], which sources at the meeting said were likely either [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] or [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]" were finalists to host the convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbtv.com/story/38114520/source-charlotte-named-finalist-to-host-gop-convention-in-2020|title=Source: Charlotte named finalist to host GOP convention in 2020|first=Nick|last=Ochsner|publisher=[[WBTV]]|accessdate=November 6, 2018|archive-date=November 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123190956/http://www.wbtv.com/story/38114520/source-charlotte-named-finalist-to-host-gop-convention-in-2020/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following President Trump's rally in [[Greenville, North Carolina]], the [[Charlotte City Council]] proposed retracting their bid to host the convention. All nine Democrats on the city council voted on a measure calling Trump a racist for his statement ("good people on both sides" of the statue debate).<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlotte, RNC Host, Condemns Trump's 'Racist Language'|url=https://www.wfae.org/post/charlotte-rnc-host-condemns-trumps-racist-language#stream/0|last=Harrison|first=Steve|publisher=WFAE 90.7|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=August 30, 2019|archive-date=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723125800/https://www.wfae.org/post/charlotte-rnc-host-condemns-trumps-racist-language#stream/0|url-status=live}}</ref> The city met in closed sessions with an attorney regarding their contract to host the convention.

===Relocation to Jacksonville and reversal===

On May 25, 2020, Trump raised the possibility of moving the convention out of Charlotte after [[Roy Cooper|North Carolina governor Roy Cooper]] stated that the convention would need to be scaled down due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. On June 2, 2020, after weeks of failed negotiations, Governor Cooper rejected the plans submitted by the Republican Party to host a full-scale convention. Trump announced the cancellation via tweet, stating, "Because of [Cooper], we are now forced to seek another state to host the 2020 Republican National Convention."

RNC officials stressed that the mechanics of the convention would still be held in Charlotte.<ref>{{cite web|last=Steinhauser|first=Paul|date=June 5, 2020|title=RNC broadens search for city to host convention celebration|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-broadens-search-for-city-to-host-convention-celebration|access-date=June 6, 2020|website=Fox News|language=en-US|archive-date=June 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606005109/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-broadens-search-for-city-to-host-convention-celebration|url-status=live}}</ref> "The RNC's Executive Committee has voted unanimously to allow the official business of the national convention to continue in Charlotte. Many other cities are eager to host the president's acceptance of the nomination, and we are currently in talks with several of them to host that celebration," said RNC communications director Michael Ahrens.

Republican National Committee officials reportedly considered cities including [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[New Orleans]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], and even visited some of these cities.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bluestein |first1=Greg |title=Republicans tour Savannah as potential site for RNC meeting |url=https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/republicans-tour-savannah-potential-site-for-rnc-meet/jGDxOuoDe6c6SEmJcNdhPO/ |website=AJC |accessdate=June 12, 2020 |language=english |date=June 8, 2020 |archive-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612060022/https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/republicans-tour-savannah-potential-site-for-rnc-meet/jGDxOuoDe6c6SEmJcNdhPO/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Greenwood |first1=Max |title=RNC to visit potential convention sites in coming days |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/501138-rnc-to-visit-potential-convention-sites-in-coming-days |website=TheHill |accessdate=June 12, 2020 |language=en |date=June 4, 2020 |archive-date=June 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609203609/https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/501138-rnc-to-visit-potential-convention-sites-in-coming-days |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Swan |first1=Jonathan |last2=Treene |first2=Alayna |title=Republican National Convention search expands across Sun Belt |url=https://www.axios.com/republican-national-convention-host-city-search-8bad370a-488d-470e-bafe-6a66897c98e9.html |website=Axios |accessdate=June 15, 2020 |language=en |date=June 4, 2020 |archive-date=June 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612142718/https://www.axios.com/republican-national-convention-host-city-search-8bad370a-488d-470e-bafe-6a66897c98e9.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Selection of pledged delegates===
The base number of pledged delegates that are allocated to each of the 50 states is 10 at-large delegates, plus 3 district delegates for each congressional district. A fixed number of pledged delegates are allocated to Washington D.C., and each of the five U.S. territories. Bonus delegates are awarded to each state and territory based on whether it has elected (if applicable) through December 31, 2019 (after the [[2019 United States elections|2019 off-year elections]]): a Republican governor, Republican majorities in either one or both chambers in its state legislature, one or two Republicans to the U.S. Senate, or a Republican majority in its delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives. A state is also awarded additional bonus delegates if it carried the Republican candidate, Trump, in the 2016 presidential election.<ref name="delegateallocation">{{cite web |url=https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/R-Alloc.phtml |title=The Math Behind the Republican Delegate Allocation 2020 |publisher=[[The Green Papers]] |accessdate=September 19, 2019 |archive-date=September 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082408/http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/R-Alloc.phtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

 |quote    =  [[File:Tim Scott, official portrait, 113th Congress (1).jpg|150px|right]] My grandfather's 99th birthday would have been tomorrow. Growing up, he had to cross the street if a white person was coming. He suffered the indignity of being forced out of school as a third grader to pick cotton, and never learned to read or write. Yet, he lived to see his grandson become the first African American to be elected to both the United States House and Senate. Our family went from Cotton to Congress in one lifetime. And that's why I believe the next American century can be better than the last. There are millions of families like mine across this nation...full of potential seeking to live the American Dream.

And I'm here tonight to tell you that supporting the Republican ticket gives you the best chance of making that dream a reality.

Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class, and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You have seen that.

After that, she talked more about her work with children, including her "Be Best" campaign, and how it should not be a political goal; she mentioned her trip to Africa, and how she was "horrified" after learning about the slave trade. She then talked about the [[George Floyd protests]] and called for peace and mutual understanding between both sides. Melania then talked about Donald Trump's accomplishments in combating religious persecution and opioid addiction, as well as her own future work with children and minority communities, and with restoring the [[People's House]].

Some experts and politicians have questioned the legality of the use of the White House for convention speeches and other portions of the convention.<ref name=Subramaniam1/> The legality is in question, since any federal employees (exempting the president and vice president themselves) who assist in such campaigning activities in such a government building may be violating the Hatch Act.<ref name=Subramaniam1>{{cite news |last1=Subramaniam |first1=Tara |title=Fact Check: Is it legal for Trump to give his convention speech from the White House? |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/politics/hatch-act-rnc-speech-fact-check/index.html |website=CNN |access-date=August 23, 2020 |date=August 6, 2020 |archive-date=August 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825074258/https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/politics/hatch-act-rnc-speech-fact-check/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to a [[Morning Consult]] poll conducted the day after the convention closed, it initially appeared that the convention had given Trump a slight boost.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/rnc-gives-trump-a-boost-as-bidens-lead-narrows-poll-shows/ |title=RNC gives Trump a boost as Biden's lead narrows, poll shows |last=Linge |first=Mary Kay |date=August 29, 2020 |website=New York Post |access-date=August 30, 2020 |archive-date=August 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200831063717/https://nypost.com/2020/08/29/rnc-gives-trump-a-boost-as-bidens-lead-narrows-poll-shows/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, an August 30 ABC poll found no increase in Trump's favorability ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/trumps-favorability-perceptions-covid-19-response-stagnate-post/story?id=72705268 |title=Trump's favorability and perceptions of COVID-19 response stagnate post-convention: POLL – ABC News |last=Karson |first=Kendall |date=August 30, 2020 |website=abcnews |access-date=August 30, 2020 |archive-date=August 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200830234845/https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/trumps-favorability-perceptions-covid-19-response-stagnate-post/story?id=72705268 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further polling indicated that there had been virtually no [[convention bounce]] for either party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Herndon |first1=Astead W. |last2=Karni |first2=Annie |title=The Latest Polls, the Great Non-Tightening: This Week in the 2020 Race |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/politics/trump-biden-polls-election.html?fbclid=IwAR3mw4ed1cgD4ryGa7FGXIXAtm7AmPag3zihluwU6k0yOFG-OxIPn0yiS-k |website=The New York Times |accessdate=6 September 2020 |date=5 September 2020 |archive-date=December 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202050234/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/politics/trump-biden-polls-election.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Mohyeldin |first=Ayman |title=New polls show race virtually unchanged after conventions |url=https://www.msnbc.com/ayman-mohyeldin/watch/new-polls-show-race-virtually-unchanged-after-conventions-91037253526?fbclid=IwAR3mw4ed1cgD4ryGa7FGXIXAtm7AmPag3zihluwU6k0yOFG-OxIPn0yiS-k |website=MSNBC.com |accessdate=6 September 2020 |language=en |date=2 September 2020 |archive-date=September 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928134800/https://www.msnbc.com/ayman-mohyeldin/watch/new-polls-show-race-virtually-unchanged-after-conventions-91037253526?fbclid=IwAR3mw4ed1cgD4ryGa7FGXIXAtm7AmPag3zihluwU6k0yOFG-OxIPn0yiS-k |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Druke |first=Galen |title=A FiveThirtyEight Forecast Update: Was There A Convention Bounce? |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/a-fivethirtyeight-forecast-update-was-there-a-convention-bounce/ |website=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=6 September 2020 |date=2 September 2020 |archive-date=September 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200903201841/https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/a-fivethirtyeight-forecast-update-was-there-a-convention-bounce/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Skelley |first=Geoffrey |title=Trump May Have Gotten A Convention Bounce.

Ahead of, and during, the conventions, various outlets had speculated that significant convention bounces were unlikely for either party.<ref name="bounceCNN">{{cite web |last=Enten |first=Harry |title=Large convention bounces are unlikely In 2020 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/15/politics/conventions-bounce-analysis/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=9 September 2020 |date=15 August 2020 |archive-date=September 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918075311/https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/15/politics/conventions-bounce-analysis/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="washpobidenbounce">{{cite web |last=Tumulty |first=Karen |title=Opinion {{!}} Don't be surprised if Biden doesn't get a convention bounce in the polls.

One was that it had been observed that convention bounces had been more minuscule in recent elections. Per some calculations, convention bounces had averaged just 2 points since 2004, compared to just under 7 points between 1968 and 2000.<ref name="bounceCNN" /> Per other calculations, average bounces since 1996 averaged 3.6 points while bounces between 1962 and 1992 averaged 6.3 points.<ref name="newsweekbounce" /> Another factor cited for why it was seen as unlikely for either party to generate a significant convention bounce in 2020  was that polls in the 2020 race had, in the months prior to the convention, shown a remarkably steady race, with Biden consistently holding an approximately 6-point er exceeding an average lead of 10 points and never slipping below a lead of 4 points. It has been shown that more stable races tend to see smaller convention bounces.<ref name="bounceCNN" /><ref name="LATIMES" /> Another was that the conventions, having been scaled-back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were seen as less likely to generate as much attention as past conventions had, particularly due to the decrease in television viewership .<ref name="bounceCNN" /><ref name="washpobidenbounce" /> Another was that the electorate was already strongly opinionated on the candidates, with more voters holding a strong opinion on Trump than any incumbent since at least 1980, and more voters holding a strong opinion on Biden than any challenger to an incumbent since at least 1980.<ref name="bounceCNN" /> Races where voters hold strong opinions on the candidates tend to see smaller convention bounces.<ref name="bounceCNN" /> Strong partisanship among the electorate was another cited factor.<ref name="LATIMES" />
