'''XM Satellite Radio''' ('''XM''') was one of the three [[satellite radio]] ([[SDARS]]) and [[online radio]] services in the United States and Canada, operated by [[Sirius XM|Sirius XM Holdings]]. It provided pay-for-service radio, analog to cable television. Its service included 73 different music channels, 39 news, sports, talk and entertainment channels, 21 regional traffic and weather channels and 23 [[Sports commentator|play-by-play]] sports channels. XM channels were identified by [[Arbitron]] with the label "XM" (e.g., "XM32" for "[[The Bridge (Sirius XM)|The Bridge]]").

The company had its origins in the 1988 formation of the '''American Mobile Satellite Corporation''' (AMSC), a [[consortium]] of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals. In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the '''American Mobile Radio Corporation''' dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1999. The satellite service officially launched on September 25, 2001.

On July 29, 2008, XM and former competitor [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] formally completed their merger, following U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approval, forming Sirius XM Radio, Inc. with XM Satellite Radio, Inc. as its subsidiary.<ref name="cnet080729">{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/sirius-and-xm-close-merger/ |title=Sirius And XM close merger |work=CNet.com |first=Dawn |last=Kawamoto |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref> On November 12, 2008, Sirius and XM began broadcasting with their new, combined channel lineups.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/11/12/2008-11-12_siriusxm_satellite_merger_brings_changes.html |title=Sirius-XM satellite merger brings changes and cuts |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |work=Daily News |date=November 12, 2008 | location=New York | first=David | last=Hinckley}}</ref> On January 13, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/908937/000095012311014617/y88211e10vk.htm|title=2010 Form 10-K, Sirius XM Radio, Inc.|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission}}</ref>

==Services==
While the satellite receiver radio service was its primary product, XM also operated audio, data and advertising services.

===Satellite radio===
XM's primary business was satellite radio entertainment. XM carried music, news (both simulcast and syndicated programming), sports, talk radio, comedy (both stand-up and radio shows), and radio drama. In addition, XM broadcast local weather and traffic conditions in its larger markets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.twice.com/news/xm-sirius-bow-local-weather-traffic-services-20373|title=XM, Sirius Bow Local Weather, Traffic Services|date=2004-03-08|website=TWICE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hazlett|first=Thomas W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfbBDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA122|title=The Political Spectrum: The Tumultuous Liberation of Wireless Technology, from Herbert Hoover to the Smartphone|date=2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21050-7|location=|pages=122|language=en}}</ref>

===Customer service===
In contrast to its high-quality broadcasts, Sirius/XM's customer service has drawn fire from some state governments. In October 2010, Richard Cordray, Ohio's Attorney General, began investigating complaints regarding Sirius XM's policies on billing, customer solicitation and subscription renewals and cancellations. The company informed shareholders of the probe shortly thereafter. According to news reports, Arizona, Connecticut, Tennessee, Vermont, and the District of Columbia had expressed interest in participating in the inquiry.

According to [[Reuters]], "The investigations come as [[Sirius XM]], home to programs by Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey, has found its footing and distanced itself from years of huge losses and questions about its business model."<ref name="Reuters01">

== Company history ==

=== 1988–2000 ===
The American Mobile Satellite Corporation was founded in 1988.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/26/business/business-people-president-of-skylink-is-closer-to-his-dream.html|title=BUSINESS PEOPLE; President of Skylink Is Closer to His Dream|last=Cuff|first=Daniel F.|date=1988-07-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1991, Lon Levin joined the company. In 1992, the American Mobile Satellite Corporation created a new division known as American Mobile Radio Corp. Later that year, American Mobile brought in [[WorldSpace]] as an investor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

On May 16, 1997, American Mobile Satellite and WorldSpace officially changed the name of American Mobile Radio to XM Satellite Radio. Later that month, Lon Levin became president, a position he would hold until 1998. In October 1997, XM Satellite Radio obtained one of only two [[satellite digital audio radio service]] licenses offered by the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. In 1998, [[Hugh Panero]] President and CEO, joined XM Satellite Radio in the same role.

In June 1999, [[Clear Channel Communications]], [[DirecTV]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and a private investment group invested US$250 million in XM Satellite Radio [[Convertible bond|convertible debt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-09-fi-45601-story.html|title=Pay-Radio Firm Attracts $250 Million in Investments|date=1999-06-09|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1999/06/09/satellite-radio-firm-lands-deal-with-gm/f073469e-c9d4-495c-b511-4cadbe52f71b/|title=Satellite-Radio Firm Lands Deal With GM|last=Schwartz|first=John|date=1999-06-09|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-10-03|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> On June 7, with GM's investment in XM, they entered into a 12-year "Distribution Agreement" between XM and GM subsidiary, [[OnStar]] Corporation. The agreement called for exclusive installation of XM Satellite Radio into GM vehicles from November 12, 2001 until November 2013. OnStar had to meet specific escalating installation rates each year, while XM needed to make extensive payments to OnStar for the installation and sale of XM in their vehicles, while sharing revenue earned from these radios with OnStar, as well as payments on the exclusivity agreement.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

At the same time as the investment, American Mobile Satellite, still XM's parent company, reacquired the stake WorldSpace held in the company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/biz/news/radio-satcaster-xm-tunes-in-250-million-1117502887/|title=Radio satcaster XM tunes in $250 million|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia |last2=Littleton|first2=Cynthia|date=1999-06-09|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> In October 1999, XM Satellite Radio issued 10,241,000 shares of Class A common stock at an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] price of US$12.00 per share.

On September 25, 2001, XM Satellite Radio launched in San Diego and [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78299/marley-song-launches-xm-satellite-radio-feed|title=Marley Song Launches XM Satellite Radio Feed|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> with nationwide expansion plans set for November.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/26/business/media-business-advertising-addenda-xm-satellite-radio-gets-help-falling-stars.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; XM Satellite Radio Gets Help From Falling Stars|last=Fass|first=Allison|date=2001-07-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The initial lineup included 100 channels consisting of sports, talk, children's programming, entertainment and news.<ref name=":0" />

In October 2001, Motient was heading into bankruptcy and spun off their non-XM satellite division into a joint operation with TMI Communications and Company, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of BCE Inc. of Canada. The new venture was known as the ''Mobile Satellite Ventures.'' In November, Motient was in bankruptcy, and sold off their controlling interest in XM to [[Hughes Electronics]], [[SingTel]] and Baron Capital Partners. Hughes Electronics would go on to combine this new interest in with the interest already held by their subsidiary, DirecTV. On November 12, 2001, XM Satellite Radio marked the official launch of its nationwide service.

In January 2003, the company underwent a re-capitalization plan, involving XM exchanging US$300 million in old debt for new debt, while deferring interest for 3-years on the notes. They also restructured payment obligations on the [[General Motors]] installation agreement, issuing a convertible bond to GM, issuing a [[Warrant (finance)|warrant]] for shares to GM, and establishing a revolving credit facility with GM. The plan also included new funding coming from a placement of over US$300 million in 10% [[convertible bond]]s to a group of private investors.

In 2004, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] sold Hughes Electronics to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corp.]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-dec-23-fi-hughes23-story.html|title=GM Spins Off, Sells Stake in Hughes for $3.1 Billion|date=2003-12-23|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref> and sold DirecTV's interest in XM Satellite Radio.

The Acura TL is the first luxury automobile to offer XM radio as "standard" in every vehicle.

On October 4, 2004, "Shock" jocks [[Opie and Anthony]] begin broadcasting on a premium XM Satellite Radio station. Also, former [[National Public Radio]] host [[Bob Edwards]] broadcasts the first ''[[Bob Edwards Show]]'' on XM Public Radio, channel 133. On October 20, XM announces an 11-year, US$650 million deal with [[Major League Baseball]] to broadcast games live nationwide and become the Official Satellite Radio provider of Major League Baseball. The agreement grants XM the rights to use the MLB silhouetted batter logo and the collective marks of all major league clubs. As part of the deal, XM created a 24/7 MLB channel called "[[MLB Home Plate|Home Plate]]". The deal started with the 2005 season and ran through the 2012, with a 3-year option that MLB could pick up.

On January 5, 2005, XM introduced two new XM2go models: Pioneer's AirWare and the Tao from Giant International. On February 28, XM's third satellite, Rhythm, was successful launched. On March 3, XM becomes the exclusive satellite partner of the [[Indy Racing League]] and [[Indianapolis 500]] ([[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]]). On April 11, XM announced that a deal has been reached to be the official satellite radio network of [[Air America Radio]]. On May 28, the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported that XM had been awarded the contract for the XM 5 spacecraft to [[Space Systems/Loral]].

The signal could also be received in the Caribbean Islands and most of Mexico (reports have stated that areas north of [[Acapulco]] were able to receive a steady signal<ref name="Acapulco">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiithreads.com/showpost.php?p=16992&postcount=28 |title=XM radio in Hawaii |work=HawaiiThreads.com |date=December 22, 2004 |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}</ref>), however XM is not yet licensed for reception by paid subscribers living in these areas.

The original satellites, XM-1 ("Rock") and XM-2 ("Roll") suffered from a generic design fault on the [[Boeing 702]] series of satellites (fogging of the solar panels), which means that their lifetimes were shortened to approximately six years instead of the design goal of 15 years.<ref name="SpaceAndTech">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceandtech.com/digest/flash2001/flash2001-082.shtml |title=Boeing 702 Satellites Solar Arrays Possibly Defective |work=SpaceandTech.com |date=September 29, 2001 |accessdate=December 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226225020/http://www.spaceandtech.com/digest/flash2001/flash2001-082.shtml |archivedate=December 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name="ADA430372">{{cite journal |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA430372 |title=Charging of Mirror Surfaces in Space |first=Shu T |last=Lai |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=110 |issue=A1 |year=2005 |accessdate=December 26, 2007 |doi=10.1029/2002JA009447 |pages=A01204 |bibcode=2005JGRA..110.1204L}}</ref> To compensate for this flaw, XM-3 ("Rhythm") was launched ahead of its planned schedule on February 28, 2005 and moved into XM-1's previous location of 85° WL. XM-1 was then moved to be co-located with XM-2 at 115° WL, where each satellite operated only one transponder (thus broadcasting half the bandwidth each) to conserve energy and cut the power consumption in half while XM-4 ("Blues") was readied for launch. Subsequently, XM launched ground-spare XM-4 ("Blues") ahead of schedule on October 30, 2006 into the 115° WL location to complete the satellite replacement program. On December 15, 2006 XM-1 was then powered down and drifted back to its original location at 85° WL, where it will remain as a backup to XM-3. XM-2 as well was powered down and remains as a backup to XM-4.

On June 7, 2005, [[Space Systems/Loral]] announced that it had been awarded a contract for XM-5.<ref name="LoralPR">{{cite press release |url=http://ssloral.com/html/pressreleases/pr20050608.html |title=Space Systems/Loral to Build Next Generation Satellite for XM Satellite Radio |publisher=Space Systems/Loral |date=June 7, 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202232715/http://ssloral.com/html/pressreleases/pr20050608.html |archivedate=February 2, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="SkyrocketXM5">{{cite news |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xm-5.htm |title=XM 5 |work=Skyrocket.de |date=June 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}</ref> XM-5 will feature two large unfurlable antennas. Sirius' Radiosat 5, also to be built by Loral, will have a similar single large antenna.

In American and Canadian metropolitan areas, XM and its Canadian licensee "Canadian Satellite Radio" (CSR) and operating as [[Sirius XM Canada]], owned and operated a network of approximately 900 terrestrial [[repeater]] stations, meant to compensate for satellite signal blockage by buildings, tunnels, and bridges. In the United States XM owned and operated approximately 800 repeater sites covering 60 markets; in Canada CSR was installing approximately 80 to 100 repeaters that was planned to be owned and operated by CSR in the 16 largest Canadian cities. The actual number of repeater sites varies as the signal is regularly tested and monitored for optimal performance. The actual number of sites in the United States has dropped from the original 1,000 installed when the service first launched in 2001. The repeaters transmit in the same frequency band as the satellites. A typical city contains 20 or more terrestrial stations. Typically, the receiver owner is unaware when a terrestrial station is being used, unless he or she checks antenna information from the receiver being used. Due to a FCC filing in October 2006, the latest list of XM's US terrestrial repeater network was made available to the public. <!-- This data is available now in both [http://www.whatsonmyxm.com/gmaps/repeaters.php Google Base] (searchable by zip code or city/state) and [http://www.whatsonmyxm.com/gmaps/xmrepeaters.kml Google Earth] formats. -->

The XM signal used 12.5&nbsp;MHz of the [[S band]]: 2332.5 to 2345.0&nbsp;MHz. XM provided 128 kilobits per second of its bandwidth to [[OnStar]] Corporation for use with XM-enabled [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] vehicles, regardless of whether their owners are XM subscribers. American Honda also retained the right to some of the company's bandwidth to transmit messages to [[Acura]] vehicles via a service known as [[AcuraLink]].

XM NavTraffic, an optional service, transmitted coded traffic information directly to vehicle navigation systems using [[Traffic Message Channel|TMC]] technology.

Audio channels on XM were digitally compressed using the [[HE-AAC|CT-aacPlus (HE-AAC)]] codec from [[Coding Technologies]] for most channels, and the [[Advanced Multi-Band Excitation|AMBE]] codec from Digital Voice Systems for some voice channels, including all of the Traffic and Weather channels.

The XM radio signal was broadcast on 6 separate radio carriers within the 12.5&nbsp;MHz allocation. The entire content of the radio service, including both data and audio content, was represented by only two carriers. The other 4 carriers carried duplicates of the same content to achieve redundancy through [[Diversity combining|signal diversity]]. The data on each carrier is encoded using time-delayed and error-correction schemes to enhance availability. Effectively the total radio spectrum used for content is a little over 4&nbsp;MHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220151/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007}} This XM patent describes the carrier allocation scheme</ref>

Each two-carrier group broadcast 100 8-kilobit-per-second streams in approximately 4&nbsp;MHz of radio spectrum. These streams were combined using a patented process to form a variable number of channels using a variety of bitrates. Bandwidth is separated into segments of 4-kilobit-per-second virtual "streams" which are combined to form audio and data "channels" of varying bitrates from 4 to 64 kilobits-per-second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220151/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7075946-description.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007}} XM Patent Method and apparatus for audio output combining</ref>

XM preprocessed audio content using Neural Audio processors that are optimized for the [[aacPlus]] codec, including [[spectral band replication]] (SBR). Audio was stored digitally in Dalet audio library systems using an industry-standard [[MPEG-1 Layer II]] at 384 kbit/s, sometimes known as [[MUSICAM]]. The audio is further processed by the Neural Audio processors on the way to broadcast.

In the past, the [[Sirius XM Pops]] channel, which aired classical music, was broadcast in [[Surround sound|5.1 surround sound]] audio quality. The technology, titled [[XM HD Surround]], is the result of a partnership between XM and [[Neural Audio Corporation]] which provides content with six discrete channels of digital audio. The former [[XM Live]] channel also broadcast in this format for certain concerts and studio performances. XM manufacturing partners such as [[Denon]], [[Onkyo]], [[Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc.]], and [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] introduced home audio systems capable of playing XM HD Surround. It is not known if the XM HD Surround technology is used on the service in 2015.

==Clear Channel programming agreement==
In 1998, [[Clear Channel Communications]] invested in XM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/1356948/xm-ordered-to-place-ads-on-four-music-channels|title=XM Ordered To Place Ads On Four Music Channels|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-09-05}}</ref> The companies entered into agreements which provided for certain programming and director designation arrangements as long as Clear Channel retained the full amount of its original investment in XM. One positive consequence of this was that XM had (and still has) exclusive programming rights to all Clear Channel content, including popular national shows like [[Coast to Coast AM]], but the shows could only be broadcast inside the bandwidth controlled by Clear Channel. In June 2003, Clear Channel entered into a [[Forward contract|forward sales agreement]] relating to its ownership of XM. During the third quarter of 2005, Clear Channel and XM arbitrated the impact of this agreement on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.asp Operational Assistance Agreement] and the [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091530/000102140803000768/dex106.txt Director Designation Agreement]. The Arbitration Panel decided that the Operational Assistance Agreement would remain in effect, including Clear Channel's right to receive a revenue share of commercial advertising on programming it provides to XM, but declined to enforce the Director Designation Agreement, which forced the Mays family members off the board of directors. Per the original agreement, Clear Channel had the right to program 409.6 kbit/s (or 10%) of XM bandwidth, requiring XM to include commercial advertising on the existing [[Nashville!]], [[KISS-XM|KISS]], [[Mix (XM)|Mix]], and [[Sunny (XM)|Sunny]] (now [[The Music Summit]]). The amount of advertising on the music channels amounts up to 4 minutes per hour, similar to the amount of advertising XM included before going commercial free. Exceptions include syndicated music shows which carry network spots. Clear Channel advertising on XM is handled by its subsidiary, [[Premiere Radio Networks]]. Clear Channel also provided existing talk channel programming ([[Fox Sports Radio]], [[Extreme XM]], [[Talk Radio (XM)|Talk Radio]]). Clear Channel also controlled [[America Right]] (formerly Buzz XM), but through a series of show swaps, most non-Clear Channel content was removed and programming control returned to XM Radio. Plans to introduce new regional based talk channels, which would have featured a regional 5 minute newscast for each area of the country, were canceled. Instead, Clear Channel chose to introduce other music and talk channels. Newer channels including [[ReachMD]], [[America's Talk]] remain on the air. [[The Pink Channel]], [[National Lampoon Comedy Radio]], [[WSIX-FM]], [[WLW]], and [[Rock@Random]] were launched and later removed, and replaced by channels like [[Bollywood & Beyond (radio)|Bollywood & Beyond]], [[The Music Summit]], and [[Sixx Sense]], all of which are on the air today.

Seen as a blow to XM's 100% commercial-free music channel status, XM Executive Vice President of Programming Eric Logan released a [https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.asp programming announcement] to XM subscribers on the company's website that reiterated XM's commitment to commercial-free music while noting that XM still had the most commercial-free music and that more commercial-free music channels will be added in the near future to ensure that XM will still have more commercial-free music than competitor [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]. On April 17, 2006, XM launched US Country (XM17), Flight 26 (XM26), XM Hitlist (XM30) and Escape (XM78) to provide commercial free music in the formats of the Clear Channel programmed music channels which were going to begin airing commercials. In response, Sirius has advertised that they are the only satellite radio provider that has 100% commercial-free music channels. Both XM and Sirius air commercials on their news, talk, and sports channels.

The Clear Channel forward sales agreement with [[Bear Stearns|Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc]] was terminated on August 2, 2006. The termination resulted in Clear Channel Investments, Inc. paying Bear Stearns a total of $83.1 million, which was the value of Clear Channel's stake in XM. The accreted value of the debt was $92.9 million, and the fair value of the collar was an asset of $6.0 million, which resulted in a net gain of $3.8 million for Clear Channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clearchannel.com/Investors/Documents/246.pdf|title=iHeartMedia, Inc.|author=|date=|website=www.clearchannel.com}}</ref>

==PCR and DirectPCR==
At the heart of the TimeTrax controversy was the [[XM PCR]]: a computer-controlled XM Receiver. Unlike the other receivers, which could be used in the car or home stereo, the XM PCR required a computer to run. A software application on the computer acted as the radio's controls and display, which led to a flurry of third party developers, who wanted to make a PCR replacement. Many of them [https://web.archive.org/web/20000301024042/http://www.xmradio.com/have.asp received Cease and Desist letters] from the XM company{{Failed verification|date=August 2016}}. Once the PCR was discontinued, for the reasons listed above, people found that the XM Direct, a receiver intended to be used in satellite-ready car stereos, can be connected to a computer with a very simple adapter cable. Some people have dubbed the entire kit, with receiver, cable, and software, the Direct PCR. While the original PCR software does not control the XM Direct receiver, several community developers have continued to develop PCR replacement software.

==Merger with Sirius Satellite Radio==
{{Main|Sirius XM Radio}}

On February 19, 2007, XM announced a merger deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]. The merger combined the two radio services and created a single Satellite Radio network in the United States and Canada.<ref name="sirius230306">{{cite press release|url=http://investor.sirius.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=230306|title=SIRIUS and XM to Combine in $13 Billion Merger of Equals|publisher=PRNewswire via Sirius.com|date=February 19, 2007|accessdate=February 19, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222221224/http://investor.sirius.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=230306|archivedate=February 22, 2007}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of Justice]] announced on March 24, 2008 that it had closed its investigation of the merger because it "concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that the proposed merger of XM and Sirius was likely to substantially lessen competition."<ref name="DOJ Closing Statement">{{cite press release|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2008/231467.htm |title=Statement of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division on its Decision to Close its Investigation of XM Satellite Ratio Holdings Inc.'s Merger with Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. |publisher=Department of Justice Antitrust Division |date=March 24, 2008 |accessdate=March 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325225258/http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2008/231467.htm |archivedate=March 25, 2008}}</ref>

On June 16, 2008, [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] Chairman [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]] told the Washington Post that he had decided to approve the XM-Sirius Merger after the companies agreed in the previous week to concessions intended to prevent the new company from raising prices or stifling competition. Martin issued an order to approve the merger, according to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' – setting the stage for a final vote which could have occurred any time after his recommendation was circulated.

The XM–Sirius merger gained its final governmental approval from the Federal Communications Commission on July 25, 2008, with Martin and commissioners [[Robert M. McDowell]] and deciding vote [[Deborah Taylor Tate]] voting in the affirmative. As a term of the merger, the combined company will be fined almost $20 million for failing to create and market interchangeable radios capable of receiving signals from both companies prior to the merger.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072503026.html?hpid=topnews |title=Satellite Radio Merger Approved |work=Washington Post |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |first=Kim |last=Hart}}</ref>

==iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry and Android applications==

XM developed a software application for use on the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]] and Apple [[iPod Touch]] devices that allowed XM subscribers to listen to its programming over the Apple devices. The Sirius XM iPhone App became available in the Apple [[iTunes Store]] on June 17, 2009.

All SiriusXM Internet Radio subscribers are able to download the application from the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|iTunes App-Store]] for free. Listening on an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch is included with some subscription packages, a separate fee is required with other packages.

On February 4, 2010, SiriusXM released an app for the [[Research In Motion]] [[BlackBerry]] line of smartphones, including the [[BlackBerry Storm|Storm]] (Series 9500), [[BlackBerry Bold|Bold]] (Series 9000 and 9700), [[BlackBerry Tour|Tour]] (Series 9600) and [[BlackBerry Curve|Curve]] (Series 8500 and 8900). Like the Apple iPhone/iPod Touch application, the [[BlackBerry App World|BlackBerry app]] is free but requires a SiriusXM subscription.

SiriusXM is also available for download on [[Android (operating system)|Android devices]] through [[Google Play]].

The applications carry most of the XM music, talk, sports and entertainment programming, as well as some exclusive Internet-only content. The mobile applications also carry a select number of channels from the "Best of SIRIUS/XM" packages, dependent on the subscriber's subscription level.

==Canada==
{{Main|XM Radio Canada}}

In November 2004, [[Canadian Satellite Radio]] filed an application with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] to bring the XM service to Canada. Along with [[Sirius Canada]] and the consortium of [[CHUM Limited]] and [[Astral Media]], CSR was one of three applications for national [[subscription radio]] services submitted to the CRTC.

On June 16, 2005, the CRTC approved all three applications. The decisions were appealed to the Canadian federal cabinet by a number of broadcasting, labour, and arts and culture organizations, including the [[Friends of Canadian Broadcasting]], [[CHUM Limited]], and the [[National Campus and Community Radio Association]]. The groups objected to the satellite radio applicants' approach to and reduced levels of [[Canadian content]] and French-language programming, along with the exclusion of Canadian non-commercial broadcasting. After a lengthy debate, Cabinet rejected the appeals on September 9, 2005.

XM's Canadian channels appeared on US receivers on November 17, 2005. On November 29, 2005, XM Canada officially launched.
