==History==
[[File:Townsend, Jones Place, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, ca. 1872-1887.jpg|thumbnail|left|George Bradford Brainerd (American, 1845–1887). Townsend, Jones Place, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, ca. 1872–1887. Collodion silver glass wet plate negative. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Cold Spring Harbor was named after the naturally cold freshwater springs that flow in the area. Its economy mainly tied to milling and port activities, it rose in prominence as a [[whaling]] community in the mid-nineteenth century. After the decline of whaling in the 1860s, it became a resort town with several hotels. In the 20th century it became known as the site of [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], although the laboratory itself is located in the adjacent village of [[Laurel Hollow, New York|Laurel Hollow]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], which was called Cold Spring before incorporation.

Today it is primarily a [[bedroom community]] of [[New York City]], with a small central business area running along Route 25A, and is home to many educational and cultural organizations: the [[Cold Spring Harbor Whaling Museum]], the [[Cold Spring Harbor Fish Hatchery and Aquarium]], Dolan DNA Learning Center, the Uplands Farm Sanctuary (home of [[The Nature Conservancy]]'s Long Island chapter), and a museum exhibition gallery run by [http://preservationlongisland.org/ Preservation Long Island].
