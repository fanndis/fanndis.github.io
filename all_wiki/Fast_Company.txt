==History==
''Fast Company'' was launched in November 1995<ref>{{Cite news |last= Vanderbilt |first= Tom |title= The capitalist cell |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date= March 5, 2000 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/05/magazine/the-capitalist-cell.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Alex French|title=The Very First Issues of 19 Famous Magazines|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/50299/very-first-issues-19-famous-magazines|access-date=August 10, 2015|work=Mental Floss}}</ref> by [[Alan Webber]] and [[Bill Taylor (businessman)|Bill Taylor]], two former ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' editors, and publisher [[Mortimer Zuckerman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/103/history.html|title=A Brief History of Our Time|work=Fast Company|date=March 1, 2006|access-date=October 27, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404190540/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/103/history.html|archive-date=April 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fastcompany.com/about-us "About Us"]. ''Fast Company''. Retrieved February 27, 2012.</ref>

The publication's early competitors included ''[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]'', ''[[Business 2.0]]'' and ''[[The Industry Standard]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bercovici|first1=Jeff|title=Business 2.0 is put up for sale|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2001/feb01/feb19/2_tues/news1tuesday.html|access-date=November 25, 2014|work=[[Media Life Magazine]]|date=February 2001|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208080600/http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2001/feb01/feb19/2_tues/news1tuesday.html|archive-date=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1997, ''Fast Company'' created an online social network, the "Company of Friends" which spawned a number of groups that began meeting.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/14/business/cultivating-cult-audience-fast-company-magazine-takes-community-readers-idea-new.html |title=Cultivating A Cult Audience; ''Fast Company'' Magazine Takes 'Community of Readers' Idea To New Extremes|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 5, 2009| author=Alex Kuczynski|date=December 14, 1998}}</ref> At one point the Company of Friends had over 40,000 members in 120 cities, although by 2003 that number had declined to 8,000.<ref name=slow-lane>{{cite news|last1=Carr|first1=David|title=Fast Company's New Life in the Slow Lane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/11/business/the-media-business-advertising-fast-company-s-new-life-in-the-slow-lane.html?pagewanted=all|access-date=November 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=August 11, 2003}}</ref>

In 2000, Zuckerman sold ''Fast Company'' to [[Gruner + Jahr]], majority owned by media giant [[Bertelsmann]], for $550 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=David Cay|title=Bertelsmann to Exit U.S. Magazine Market|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/business/media/bertelsmann-to-exit-us-magazine-market.html|access-date=July 7, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 2005}}</ref> Just as the sale was completed, the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] burst, leading to significant losses and a decline in circulation. Webber and Taylor left the magazine two years later in 2002, and John A. Byrne, previously a senior writer and former management editor with [[BusinessWeek]], was brought in as the new editor. Under Byrne, the magazine won its first [[Gerald Loeb Award]], the most prestigious honor in business journalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fast-company-gets-the-help-it-needed|title=Fast Company finally gets some 'help'|first=Jon|last=Friedman|website=MarketWatch}}</ref> But the magazine could not reverse its financial decline in the wake of the dot-com bust. Although the magazine was not specifically about Internet commerce, advertising pages continued to drop until they were one-third the 2000 numbers.<ref name=slow-lane/>

In 2005, Gruner + Jahr put the magazine, as well as ''[[Inc. magazine]]'', up for sale. Through a contact, Byrne contacted entrepreneur [[Joe Mansueto]] and helped guide him through the sale. A bidding war ultimately ensued, pitting [[The Economist]] against Mansueto's company Mansueto Ventures. Mansueto, the only bidder who promised to keep Fast Company alive, ultimately won the contest, buying both magazine titles for $35 million.<ref>Seelye, Katherine Q. (June 21, 2005).
