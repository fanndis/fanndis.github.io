== Background ==
In [[1982 Bangladesh coup d'état|1982 a coup d'état]] led by [[Army Chief of Bangladesh|Army Chief]] [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] overthrew democratically elected President [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Abdus Sattar]], suspended the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|Constitution]] and imposed [[martial law]]. [[Parliament of Bangladesh|Parliament]] was dissolved and all political parties were banned. Ershad appointed Justice [[A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]] as [[President of Bangladesh|President]] on 27 March 1982, a position which he held until December 1983 when Ershad assumed the presidency himself.<ref name="NYT22">{{cite news |title=Bangladesh Leader in Military Regime Assumes Presidency |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/12/world/bangladesh-leader-in-military-regime-assumes-presidency.html |work=The New York Times |date=12 December 1983}}</ref> In 1983 Ershad promised to hold presidential elections in May 1984 and to restore parliamentary government the following year.<ref name="NYT22" /> However, neither elections were held until 1986.

Amid increasing opposition from the general public, Ershad aimed to legitimise his regime by holding a [[1985 Bangladeshi military rule referendum|referendum in March 1985]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/03/21/Bangladesh-holds-referendum-on-military-rule/2820480229200/|title=Bangladesh holds referendum on military rule|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref> The official result of the referendum was overwhelmingly in support of his regime; however, there were allegations of large-scale vote rigging.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-152587|title=Ershad's desperate bids go in vain|date=28 August 2010|website=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>

Ershad planned to hold a presidential election in early 1986, but was faced with vigorous opposition from the [[Bangladesh Awami League]]-led eight-party alliance, [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]]-backed seven-party alliance and the left-leaning five-party alliance, who demanded the lifting of martial law and the holding of parliamentary elections prior to a presidential election.<ref name=":2" /> Conceding to opposition demands general elections were scheduled for 7 May 1986.

On 1 January 1986 Ershad formed [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] to represent his interests in the elections. The winners of the previous elections, [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]], boycotted the elections but [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]], and the majority of other political parties, contested. At the time of elections, martial law was still in place and Ershad was still [[Army Chief of Bangladesh|Army Chief]].

==Results==
The result was a victory for Ershad's [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]], which won a simple parliamentary majority with 153 of 300 seats.<ref name=":0" /> However the result was controversial, with Awami League accusing the Jatiya Party of election rigging and a British team of observers - consisting of a former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] minister, a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] lawmaker and a [[BBC]] journalist - terming the elections a "tragedy for democracy" and a "cynically frustrated exercise".<ref name=":2" />

==Aftermath==
In August 1986 Ershad resigned from military service and a presidential election was held in [[1986 Bangladeshi presidential election|October 1986]], in which Ershad was declared the victor. However the elections were controversial as they were boycotted by all major opposition candidates and there were reports of irregularities.<ref name="NYT3">{{cite news |title=Bangladesh Chief Claims Vote Victory |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/17/world/bangladesh-chief-claims-vote-victory.html |work=The New York Times |date=17 October 1986}}</ref>

In November 1986, the second session of the third parliament was used for passing the constitution's seventh amendment bill, which primarily protected Ershad and his regime from prosecution for actions taken under his years of military rule, and on 11 November martial law was lifted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/11/11/martial-law-ends-in-bangladesh/2be0301b-5fc2-4e63-93d8-ff368b939a3b/|title=Martial Law Ends in Bangladesh|date=11 November 1986|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2018-12-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

In July 1987, the opposition parties united in opposition of government policies. Ershad declared a state of emergency in November, dissolved parliament in December, and scheduled new parliamentary elections for [[1988 Bangladeshi general election|March 1988]].<ref name=":2" />
