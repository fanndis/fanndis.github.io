A native of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], Hull was a graduate of the [[University of Kansas]] with a degree in education. Hull worked as an elementary school teacher while her husband studied to become an [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]]. She moved to Arizona with her husband, Terry, in 1962 where he began working on the [[Navajo Nation]], while Jane raised the couple's four children and taught English. In 1964, the family moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where she continued to raise her family. A decade later, she started her political career, and became involved with Republican women groups, in addition to volunteering on political campaigns.

In 1978, Hull was elected to her first political office, as a member of the [[Arizona House of Representatives]]. During her tenure in office, she would become House Majority Whip and Speaker of the House. In 1994, she was elected to the office of [[Secretary of State of Arizona]], becoming the first Republican to hold the office in more than six decades. After ascending to the office of Governor of Arizona following Fife Symington's resignation, Hull was [[1998 Arizona gubernatorial election|elected Governor in 1998]] over former [[List of mayors of Phoenix|Mayor of Phoenix]] [[Paul Johnson (American politician)|Paul Johnson]], in a landslide election. Hull was constitutionally barred from running for a second full term in 2002, and retired from public service.

==Legislative career==
Hull entered politics in 1978, being elected to the [[Arizona House of Representatives]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. She served for seven terms, including two as [[Speaker (politics)|speaker of the House]], the first female speaker in Arizona history.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Associated Press |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/jane-hull-first-woman-elected-arizona-governor-dies-84-n1186906 |title=Jane Hull, first woman elected Arizona governor, dies at 84 |publisher=Nbcnews.com |accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In 1991, while she was speaker, the Arizona legislature experienced a major political scandal called [[World Chiropractic Alliance#Lobbying, AzScam scandal, and patient solicitation scheme|AZSCAM]], which resulted in the resignation or removal of ten members of the House and Senate. As a result, Speaker Hull instituted a number of ethics reforms to reestablish public confidence in the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/04/17/former-arizona-governor-jane-dee-hull-and-her-husband-terry-hull-have-died/5152662002/ |title=Former Arizona Gov.

Politically, ''[[On the Issues|On The Issues]]'', a non-profit and non-partisan organization which records politicians' stances on issues, considers Hull to have been a [[Centrism|centrist]] or [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate Republican]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Jane_Dee_Hull.htm|title=Jane Dee Hull on the Issues|last=OnTheIssues.org|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref> Her record is considered to be [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] and socially [[moderate]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/05/us/once-again-arizona-secretary-state-suddenly-thrust-into-job-governor.html|title=Once Again in Arizona, Secretary of State Is Suddenly Thrust Into the Job of Governor|last=Purdum|first=Todd S.|access-date=August 31, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

==Governor of Arizona==
===First term (1997&ndash;1999)===
[[File:Jane Dee Hull 2001.jpeg|right|upright|thumb|Then-Governor Hull during a visit to the Air National Guard's alert detachment facility.]]
Hull was elected Arizona Secretary of State in 1994. After Governor [[Fife Symington]] was forced to resign due to a felony conviction, Hull became governor on September 5, 1997.<ref>{{cite news |last = Purdum| first = Todd S. |title=Arizona Governor Convicted Of Fraud and Will Step Down|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/04/us/arizona-governor-convicted-of-fraud-and-will-step-down.html|work=New York Times |date=September 4, 1997 }}</ref> She was sworn in by [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], herself a former Arizona legislator. Arizona has no [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]], so the secretary of state, if holding office by election, stands first in the line of succession.<ref>[[Arizona Constitution]], art. V, s. 6</ref>

===1998 gubernatorial campaign===
Hull was elected governor in her own right in 1998. This election was particularly significant because it was the first time in the history of the United States that all five of the top elected executive offices in one state were held by women: Hull; [[Betsey Bayless]], secretary of state; [[Janet Napolitano]], [[Arizona Attorney General|attorney general]]; [[Carol Springer]], treasurer; and [[Lisa Graham Keegan]], [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]].<ref>https://apnews.com/3abda7b0813ba234d13a3175437c520e</ref>

===Second term (1999&ndash;2003)===
While she was governor, Hull's relations with home state [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] were strained. During the [[2000 Republican Party presidential primaries|2000 Presidential primary season]] she endorsed his opponent, Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], in the Arizona [[primary election|primary]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Berke, Richard |title=McCain Having to Prove Himself Even in Arizona |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/25/us/mccain-having-to-prove-himself-even-in-arizona.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/H/Hull,%20Jane%20Dee&pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=October 25, 1999 |accessdate=April 21, 2009 }}</ref>

Hull is known for having signed into law the bill that resulted in the "alt-fuels" scandal of 2000. The resulting law promised car buyers up to 60 percent off new vehicles if they were converted to run on alternative fuels like [[propane]] or [[natural gas]], yet it did not properly cap the number of buyers eligible for the program nor did it require buyers to use the new fuels. Instead of the $10&nbsp;million the program was supposed to cost, it ended up costing Arizona $200&nbsp;million before lawmakers changed the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/02/us/costly-plan-to-promote-alternative-fuels-jolts-arizona.html |title=Costly Plan to Promote Alternative Fuels Jolts Arizona - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

==Post-governorship==
Hull was constitutionally barred from running for a second full term in 2002 (the Arizona constitution limits the Governor to two consecutive terms, or parts of terms,<ref>Ariz. Const. Art. V, § 1(a).</ref> even when he or she ascends to the office in the middle of a term), and she was succeeded by Janet Napolitano, who defeated [[Matt Salmon]]. After leaving office, she spent three months in [[New York City]], as a public delegate from the United States to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (2004).<ref name=PBS2007>{{cite news |url=http://www.azpbs.org/goldwater/2007hull.htm |title=Former Governor Jane Dee Hull – Twenty-Five Years in Arizona Government |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |author=[[KAET-TV]] |date=September 23, 2007 |work=2006 Goldwater Lecture Series |publisher=[[Arizona State University]] |location=Phoenix, Arizona |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306121955/http://www.azpbs.org/goldwater/2007hull.htm |archive-date=March 6, 2009}}</ref>

After the death of [[Rose Mofford]] on September 15, 2016, Hull became the oldest living Governor of Arizona, in addition to being the oldest living [[Secretary of State of Arizona]]. An elementary school is named for Hull in [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/125824426/?terms=%22jane%2Bdee%2Bhull%22%2Bchandler%2Belementary |title=22 Nov 2006, Page 242 - Arizona Republic at |publisher=Newspapers.com |date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Hull married Terry Hull, an [[obstetrician]] in 1954. They had four children. Hull died on April 16, 2020 at age 84; her husband had died earlier on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/former-arizona-governor-jane-dee-hull-dies-at-age-84-12-news-has-learned/75-1304f2f4-1be0-464a-8c39-c94e1163169e|title=Former Arizona governor Jane Dee Hull dies at age 84|website=KPNX|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/04/17/former-arizona-governor-jane-dee-hull-and-her-husband-terry-hull-have-died/5152662002/|title=Former Arizona Gov.
