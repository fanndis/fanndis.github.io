The '''Critics' Choice Movie Awards''' (formerly known as the '''Broadcast Film Critics Association Award''') is an awards show presented annually by the [[United States of America|American]]-[[Canada|Canadian]] [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] (BFCA) to honor the finest in cinematic achievement.<ref>[http://www.criticschoice.com/bfca/ "BFCA"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523052737/http://www.criticschoice.com/bfca/ |date=2015-05-23 }}, ''Critics' Choice Awards''. [Accessed 30-05-2019]</ref> Written ballots are submitted during a week-long nominating period, and the resulting nominees are announced in December. The winners chosen by subsequent voting are revealed at the annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards ceremony in January. Additionally, special awards are given out at the discretion of the BFCA Board of Directors.

The awards were originally named simply ''Critics' Choice Awards''. In 2010, the word ''Movie'' was added to their name, to differentiate them from the [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s, which were first bestowed the following year by the newly created Broadcast Television Critics Association. The name ''Critics' Choice Awards'' now officially refers to both sets of awards collectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critics' Choice Awards {{!}} Home|url=http://www.criticschoice.com/|work=Critics' Choice Awards|publisher=The Broadcast Film Critics Association|accessdate=11 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212120329/http://www.criticschoice.com/|archive-date=12 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

From 2006 through 2009, the awards ceremony was held in the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. From 2010 through 2012, it took place in the refurbished, historic [[Hollywood Palladium]]. Broadcasting the ceremony began with the sixth ceremony on [[E!|E! Entertainment Television]] in 2001 for four years, followed by [[The WB Network]] for two years, before returning to E! for a year.  [[VH1]] took over the broadcast in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nordyke |first1=Kimberly |title=VH1 becomes Critics' Choice |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/television-critics-dc-idUSN2137425420070522 |website=[[Reuters]] |date=May 21, 2007}}</ref> The live television broadcast of the event moved from VH1 to [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] in 2013,<ref>{{cite news|last=Weisman|first=Jon|title=CW grabs Critics' Choice Movie Awards|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118061085/|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=22 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228121345/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118061085/|archive-date=28 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> with the 19th ceremony airing on January 16, 2014, live from the [[Barker Hangar]]<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Barker+Hangar+3021+Airport+Ave+%23203%2C+Santa+Monica%2C+CA Barker Hangar 3021 Airport Ave #203, Santa Monica, CA - Google Maps]</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Gelb |first=Andy |title=Critics' Choice Movie Awards |url=http://www.criticschoice.com/movie-awards/ |accessdate=23 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CrNMCA0g?url=http://www.criticschoice.com/movie-awards/ |archivedate=12 December 2012 }}</ref> in Santa Monica, California.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/16/the-cw-to-broadcast-the-critics-choice-movie-awards-critics-choice-television-awards-in-2014/203081/ |title=The CW to Broadcast the 'Critics Choice Movie Awards' & 'Critics Choice Television Awards' in 2014 |work=[[Zap2it]] |publisher=[[The CW]] press release |first=Sara |last=Bibel |date=September 16, 2013 |accessdate=September 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918045639/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/09/16/the-cw-to-broadcast-the-critics-choice-movie-awards-critics-choice-television-awards-in-2014/203081/ |archive-date=September 18, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In October 2014, it was announced that the Critics' Choice Movie Awards would move to [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] for 2015 and 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/07/ae-network-to-televise-the-critics-choice-awards/311958/|title=A&E Network to Televise 'The Critics' Choice Awards'|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=October 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012031321/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/07/ae-network-to-televise-the-critics-choice-awards/311958/|archive-date=October 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>
