'''Caernarfon Castle''' ({{lang-cy|Castell Caernarfon}} {{IPA-cy|kastɛɬ kaɨrˈnarvɔn}}) &ndash; often anglicised as '''Carnarvon Castle''' or '''Caernarvon Castle'''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=H. |title='Caernarvon' |url=http://www.historictownsatlas.org.uk/sites/historictownsatlas/files/atlas/town/caernarvon_text.pdf |access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> &ndash; is a medieval fortress in [[Caernarfon]], [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]] cared for by [[Cadw]], the Welsh Government's historic environment service. It was a [[motte-and-bailey castle]] from the late 11th century until 1283 when King [[Edward I of England]] began to replace it with the current stone structure. The Edwardian town and castle acted as the administrative centre of north Wales, and as a result the defences were built on a grand scale. There was a deliberate link with Caernarfon's Roman past,{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} and the [[castra|Roman fort]] of [[Segontium]] is nearby.

While the castle was under construction, [[Caernarfon town walls|town walls]] were built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the start until the work ended in 1330. Although the castle appears mostly complete from the outside, the interior buildings no longer survive and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were sacked in 1294 when [[Madog ap Llywelyn]] led a rebellion against the English. Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the [[Glyndŵr Rising]] of 1400–1415, the castle was besieged. When the [[Tudor dynasty]] ascended to the English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair. Despite its dilapidated condition, during the [[English Civil War]] Caernarfon Castle was held by [[cavalier|Royalists]], and was besieged three times by [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces. This was the last time the castle was used in war. The castle was neglected until the 19th&nbsp;century when the state funded repairs. The castle was used for the investiture of the [[Prince of Wales]] in 1911 and again in 1969. It is part of the [[World Heritage Site]] "[[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd]]".<ref name="UNESCO site">{{citation |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/374 |title=Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |access-date=2010-08-15}}</ref>

==Background==
{{see also|Segontium}}
The first fortifications at Caernarfon were built by the Romans. Their [[castra|fort]], which they named ''Segontium'', is on the outskirts of the modern town.<ref name="Taylor 4">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=4}}</ref> The fort sat near the bank of the [[River Seiont]]; the fort was probably built here due to the sheltered position and because it could be resupplied via the river Seiont.<ref name="Taylor 5">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=5}}</ref> Caernarfon derives its name from the Roman fortifications. In Welsh, the place was called ''y gaer'' ([[lenition]] of ''caer'') ''yn Arfon'', meaning "the stronghold in the land over against Môn"; Môn is the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for [[Anglesey]].<ref name="Taylor 4"/> Little is known about the fate of Segontium and its associated civilian settlement after the Romans departed from Britain in the early 5th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Taylor 5"/>

==Early castle==
Following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] turned his attention to Wales. According to the [[Domesday Survey]] of 1086, the Norman [[Robert of Rhuddlan]] was nominally in command of the whole of northern Wales. He was killed by the Welsh in 1088. His cousin [[Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester]], reasserted Norman control of north Wales by building three castles: one at an unknown location somewhere in [[Meirionnydd]], one at [[Castell Aberlleiniog|Aberlleiniog]] on Anglesey, and another at Caernarfon.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|pp=6–7}}</ref> This early castle was built on a peninsula, bounded by the River Seiont and the [[Menai Strait]]; it would have been a [[motte-and-bailey|motte and bailey]], defended by a timber [[palisade]] and [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]]. The motte, or mound, was integrated into the later Edwardian castle, but the location of the original bailey is uncertain, although it may have been to the north-east of the motte.<ref name="Taylor 7">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=7}}</ref> Excavations on top of the motte in 1969 revealed no traces of medieval occupation, suggesting any evidence had been removed.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|Hurst|1970|p=179}}</ref> It is likely that the motte was surmounted by a wooden tower known as a [[keep]]. The Welsh recaptured Gwynedd in 1115, and Caernarfon Castle came into the possession of the Welsh princes. From contemporary documents written at the castle, it is known that [[Llywelyn the Great]] and later [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] occasionally stayed at Caernarfon.<ref name="Taylor 7"/>

==Edwardian castle==

[[File:Caernarfon.1610 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Map of Caernarfon in 1610 by [[John Speed]]. The castle was at the south end of the settlement.]]
War broke out again between England and Wales on 22&nbsp;March 1282. The Welsh leader, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, died later that year on 11&nbsp;December. His brother [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] continued to fight against the English, but in 1283 Edward&nbsp;I was victorious.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2004}}</ref> Edward marched through northern Wales, capturing castles such as that at [[Dolwyddelan Castle|Dolwyddelan]], and establishing his own at [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]]. War finally drew to a close in May 1283 when [[Dolbadarn Castle]], Dafydd ap Gruffudd's last castle, was captured. Shortly afterwards, Edward began building castles at [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]] and Caernarfon. The castles of Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech were the most impressive of their time in Wales, and their construction—along with other Edwardian castles in the country—helped establish English rule.<ref name="Taylor 9">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=9}}</ref> The master [[stonemasonry|mason]] responsible for the design and construction of the castle was probably [[James of Saint George]], an experienced architect and military engineer who played an important role in building the Edwardian castles in Wales.<ref name="Taylor 10">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=10}}</ref> According to the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'', during the construction of the castle and planned town, the body of the Roman emperor [[Magnus Maximus]] was discovered, and Edward&nbsp;I ordered its reburial in a local church.<ref name="Taylor 86 78">{{harvnb|Taylor|1986|p=78}}</ref>

The construction of the new stone castle was part of a programme of building which transformed Caernarfon; town walls were added, connected to the castle, and a new quay was built. The earliest reference to building at Caernarfon dates from 24&nbsp;June 1283, when a ditch had been dug separating the site of the castle from the town to the north. A ''bretagium'', a type of [[stockade]], was created around the site to protect it while the permanent defences were under construction. Timber was shipped from as far away as Liverpool.<ref name="Taylor 9"/> Stone was quarried from nearby places, such as from Anglesey and around the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1986|p=94}}</ref> A force of hundreds worked on the excavation of the moat and digging the foundations for the castle. As the site expanded, it began to encroach on the town; houses were cleared to allow the construction. Residents were not paid compensation until three years later. While the foundations for the stone walls were being created, [[timber framing|timber-framed]] apartments were built for Edward&nbsp;I and [[Eleanor of Castile]], his queen. They arrived at Caernarfon on either 11&nbsp;or 12&nbsp;July 1283 and stayed for over a month.<ref name="Taylor 10"/>

Construction at Caernarfon Castle continued over the winter of 1283–84. The extent of completion is uncertain, although architectural historian [[A. J. Taylor|Arnold Taylor]] speculated that when Edward and Eleanor visited again in Easter 1284 the Eagle Tower may have been complete.<ref name="Taylor 10-11">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|pp=10–11}}</ref> The [[Statute of Rhuddlan]], enacted on 3&nbsp;March 1284, made Caernarfon a [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] and the administrative centre of the county of Gwynedd.{{Fix|text=Gwynedd was not a county.}}<ref name="Taylor 13">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=13}}</ref> According to tradition, [[Edward II of England|Edward&nbsp;II]] was born at Caernarfon on 25&nbsp;April 1284.<ref name="Taylor 10-11"/><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/1365/#1373 |title=1900s |publisher=[[National Museum Wales]] |access-date=2010-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521012500/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/1365/#1373 |archive-date=21 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Edward was created [[Prince of Wales]] in 1301, with control over Wales and its incomes. Since then the title has traditionally been held by the eldest son of the monarch. According to a famous legend, the king had promised the Welsh that he would name "a prince born in Wales, who did not speak a word of English" and then produced his infant son to their surprise; but the story may well be apocryphal, as it can only be traced to the 16th century.<ref name="Taylor 12">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=12}}</ref> In 1284, Caernarfon was defended by a garrison of forty men, more than the thirty-strong garrisons at Conwy and Harlech. Even in peace time, when most castles would have a guard of only a few men, Caernarfon was defended by between twenty and forty people due to its importance.<ref name="Friar 124">{{harvnb|Friar|2003|p=124}}</ref>

By 1285, Caernarfon's [[Caernarfon town walls|town walls]] were mostly complete. At the same time work continued on the castle. Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=11}}</ref> Edward&nbsp;I's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329;<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|1992|pp=42–43}}</ref> by 1292 £12,000 had been spent on the construction of Caernarfon's castle—of which the southern façade was furthest along—and town walls. As the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon, the plan was to build the castle's northern façade last.<ref name="Taylor 12"/>

In 1294, Wales broke out in rebellion led by [[Madog ap Llywelyn]], Prince of Wales. As Caernarfon was the centre of administration in Gwynedd and a symbol of English power, it was targeted by the Welsh. Madog's forces captured the town in September, and in the process heavily damaged the town walls. The castle was defended by just a ditch and a temporary barricade. It was quickly taken and anything flammable was set alight.<ref name="Taylor 13"/> Fire raged across Caernarfon, leaving destruction in its wake.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1986|p=85}}</ref> In the summer of 1295, the English moved to retake Caernarfon. By November the same year, the English began refortifying the town. Rebuilding the town walls was a high priority, and £1,195 (nearly half the sum initially spent on the walls) was spent on completing the job two months ahead of schedule. Attention then shifted to the castle and on finishing the work that had halted in 1292.<ref name="Taylor 13"/> Once the rebellion was put down, Edward began building [[Beaumaris Castle]] on the Isle of Anglesey. The work was overseen by James of Saint George;<ref name="Taylor 1986 86">{{harvnb|Taylor|1986|p=86}}</ref> as a result, [[Walter of Hereford]] took over as master mason for the new phase of construction. By the end of 1301, a further £4,500 had been spent on the work; the focus of the work was on the northern wall and towers. The accounts between November 1301 and September 1304 are missing, possibly because there was a hiatus in work while labour moved north to help out with England's war against Scotland.<ref name="Taylor 1997 15">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=15}}</ref> Records show that Walter of Hereford had left Caernarfon and was in Carlisle in October 1300;<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1986|p=90}}</ref> he remained occupied with the Scottish wars until the autumn of 1304 when building at Caernarfon resumed.<ref name="Taylor 1997 15"/> Walter died in 1309 and his immediate subordinate, Henry of Ellerton, took over the position of master mason.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1986|p=92}}</ref> Construction continued at a steady rate until 1330.<ref name="Taylor 1997 15"/>

==Later history==

[[File:Joseph Farington - Caernarvon Castle - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|A painting of Caenarfon castle from the  18th century  by Joseph Farrington]]
For around two centuries after the conquest of Wales, the arrangements established by Edward&nbsp;I for the governance of the country remained in place. During this time the castle was constantly garrisoned, and Caernarfon was effectively the capital of north Wales.<ref name="Taylor 19">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=19}}</ref> There was a degree of discrimination, with the most important administrative jobs in Wales usually closed to Welsh people. Tension between the Welsh and their English conquerors spilled over at the start of the 15th&nbsp;century with the outbreak of the [[Glyndŵr Rising]] (1400–1415).<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1995|pp=68–69}}</ref> During the revolt, Caernarfon was one of the targets of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]'s army. The town and castle were besieged in 1401, and in November that year the [[Battle of Tuthill]] was fought nearby between Caernarfon's defenders and the besieging force.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1995|p=105}}</ref> In 1403 and 1404, Caernarfon was besieged by Welsh troops with support from French forces;<ref name="Taylor 19"/> the garrison at the time was around thirty.<ref name="Friar 124"/> The accession of the [[Tudor dynasty]] to the English throne in 1485 heralded a change in the way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English. As a result, castles such as Caernarfon, which provided secure centres from which the country could be administered, became less important. They were neglected, and in 1538 it was reported that many castles in Wales were "moche ruynous and ferre in decaye for lakke of tymely reparations".<ref name="Taylor 19"/>

[[File:Caernafon Castle Panorama (8074250217).jpg|thumb|left|300px|The King's Gate was one of the few areas of the castle which still had a roof by 1620.]]
In Caernarfon's case the walls of the town and castle remained in good condition, while features which required maintenance—such as roofs—were in a state of decay and much timber was rotten. Conditions were so poor that of the castle's seven towers and two gatehouses, only the Eagle Tower and the King's Gate had roofs by 1620. The domestic buildings inside the castle had been stripped of anything valuable, such as glass and iron. Despite the disrepair of the domestic buildings, the castle's defences were in a good enough state that during the [[English Civil War]] in the mid-17th&nbsp;century it was garrisoned by [[cavalier|Royalists]]. Caernarfon Castle was besieged three times during the war. The [[Castellan|constable]] was [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron]], who surrendered Caernarfon to [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces in 1646. It was the last time Caernarfon Castle saw fighting. Although it was ordered in 1660 that the castle and town walls should be dismantled, the work was aborted early on and may never have started.<ref name="Taylor 19"/>

Despite avoiding [[slighting]], the castle was neglected until the late 19th&nbsp;century. From the 1870s onwards, the government funded repairs to Caernarfon Castle. The deputy-constable [[Llewellyn Turner]] oversaw the work, in many cases controversially restoring and rebuilding the castle, rather than simply conserving the existing stonework.<ref>{{harvnb|Avent|2010|pp=143–148}}</ref> Steps, [[battlement]]s, and roofs were repaired, and the moat to the north of the castle was cleared of post-medieval buildings that were considered to spoil the view, despite the protest of locals. Under the auspices of the [[Office of Works]] and its successors since 1908, the castle was preserved due to its historic significance.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|pp=20–21}}</ref> In 1911, Caernarfon was used for the investiture of the Prince of Wales for the first time for Prince Edward (later [[Edward VIII]]), eldest son of the newly crowned King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]; the ceremony was held there at the insistence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[David Lloyd George]], a Welshman raised in Caernarfonshire.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Windsor|first1=HRH the Duke of|title=A King's Story|date=1951|publisher=Cassell and Co.|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Criccieth Church of Christ and David Lloyd George|url=http://churches-of-christ.ws/Criccieth.htm|website=Churches of Christ|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> In 1969, the precedent was repeated with the investiture of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].<ref name="Taylor 12"/> Although Caernarfon Castle has been the property of [[the Crown]] since it was built, it is currently cared for by ''[[Cadw]]'' ({{lang-en|to keep}}), the [[Welsh Government]]'s historic environment division, responsible for the maintenance and care of Wales' historic buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=21}}</ref><ref name="CADW1">{{cite web|title=About Cadw|url=http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/default.asp?id=3&lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629171439/http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/default.asp?id=3&lang=en|archive-date=2011-06-29|access-date=2008-08-11|publisher=[[cadw|Cadw, a division of the Welsh Government]]|year=2008|work=Cadw website}}</ref> In 1986, Caernarfon was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s as part of the "[[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd]]" in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site.<ref name="UNESCO site"/><ref>{{citation |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15244&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Constitution |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |access-date=2010-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329170647/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D15244%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archive-date=29 March 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The castle houses the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Caernarfon castle interior.jpg|thumb|The ward of Caernarfon Castle, showing (from left to right) the Black Tower, the Chamberlain's Tower, and the Eagle Tower. By the 17th&nbsp;century, the castle's domestic buildings had been stripped of valuable materials such as iron and lead.]]
Caernarfon Castle's design was partly influenced by a desire to make the structure impressive as a symbol of the new English rule in Wales. This was particularly acute as Caernarfon was made the centre of government in the northern part of the country. The Edwardian castle's layout was mostly dictated by the lie of the land, although the inclusion of the previous castle's motte played a part. It is a narrow enclosure,<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1984|p=86}}</ref> roughly in the shape of a figure eight.<ref name="Taylor 25">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=25}}</ref> It was divided into two enclosures, upper and lower "wards", in the east and west respectively, with the eastern containing royal accommodation, although this was never completed. The divide was supposed to be established by a range of fortified buildings, however these too were never built.<ref name="AB 87"/>

[[File:Caernafon Kings Gate.jpg|thumb|left|The unfinished rear of the King's Gate, the main entrance to the castle from the town.]]
[[File:Caernarfon Castle (7332).jpg|thumb|left|The Queen's Gate]]

Studded along the curtain wall are several polygonal towers from which flanking fire could be deployed. There were [[battlement]]s on the tops of walls and towers, and along the southern face were firing galleries; it was intended to include galleries along the northern face but they were never built. In the opinion of military historian Allen Brown, this combined to make Caernarfon Castle "one of the most formidable concentrations of fire-power to be found in the Middle Ages".<ref name="AB 87"/>

Most of the northern towers stand{{clarify|date=September 2019}} had four storeys including a basements.<ref name="Taylor 30">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=30}}</ref> The Eagle Tower at the western corner of the castle was the grandest. It has three turrets which were once surmounted by statues of eagles.<ref name="AB 87"/> The tower contained grand lodgings, and was probably built for Sir [[Otton de Grandson]],<ref name="Taylor 30"/> the first [[justiciar]] of Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1986|p=98}}</ref> A basement level contained a water gate, through which visitors travelling up the River Seiont could enter the castle.<ref name="Taylor 30"/> Water was drawn from a well in the eponymous Well Tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=29}}</ref>

Caernarfon's appearance differs from that of other Edwardian castles through the use of banded coloured stone in the walls and in its polygonal, rather than round, towers. There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatley|2010|p=129}}</ref> Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the [[Walls of Constantinople]]. The conscious use of imagery from the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[Roman Empire]] was therefore an assertion of authority by Edward&nbsp;I, and influenced by the legendary dream of [[Magnus Maximus]], a Roman emperor. In his dream Maximus had seen a fort, "the fairest that man ever saw", within a city at the mouth of a river in a mountainous country and opposite an island. Edward interpreted this to mean Segontium was the city of Maximus' dream and drew on the imperial link when building Caernarfon Castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen Brown|1984|p=88}}</ref> Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was indeed an assertion of Edward's authority, but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion to [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legitimacy for the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheatley|2010|p=136}}</ref>

There were two main entrances, one leading from the town (the King's Gate) and one allowing direct access to the castle without having to proceed through the town (the Queen's Gate). Their form was typical of the time: a passage between two flanking towers.<ref name="AB 87"/> If the King's Gate had been completed, a visitor would have crossed two [[drawbridge]]s, passed through five doors and under six [[portcullis]]es, and negotiated a right-angle turn before emerging into the lower enclosure. The route was overlooked by numerous [[arrowslit|arrow loops]] and [[murder holes]].<ref name="Taylor 26">{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=26}}</ref> A statue of Edward&nbsp;II was erected in a niche overlooking the town, above the entrance to the King's Gate.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=38}}</ref> In the opinion of architectural historian Arnold Taylor, "No building in Britain demonstrates more strikingly the immense strength of medieval fortifications than the great twin-towered gateway to Caernarfon Castle."<ref name="Taylor 26"/> The Queen's Gate is unusual in that its entrance is above ground level; this was due to the integration of the earlier motte, raising the ground level of the interior. Externally, the gate would have been approached by a stone ramp which is no longer present.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=35}}</ref>

While the [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] and its towers survive largely intact, all that remains of the buildings contained within the castle are the foundations.<ref name="Taylor 25"/> While royal lodgings were in the upper ward, the lower ward contained buildings such as the kitchens. The kitchens were located immediately west of the King's Gate. On the basis of their insubstantial foundations, Taylor suggests that the kitchens were not strongly built.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=28}}</ref> The other key feature of the castle's domestic side was the [[Great Hall]]. This abutted the south side of the lower ward and was {{convert|30.5|m}}{{Fix|text=In which dimension?}}. Though only the foundations survive, the Great Hall would have been an impressive building, featuring fine architecture, and used to host royal entertainment.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1997|p=33}}</ref> Had Caernarfon been completed as intended, it could have contained a royal household of several hundred people.<ref>{{harvnb|Brears|2010|p=91}}</ref>
