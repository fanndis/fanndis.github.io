'''Taiwanese people'''{{efn native lang|tw|name=word1}} are people from [[Taiwan]] who share a common [[Culture of Taiwan|culture]], ancestry, and speak [[languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, or indigenous Taiwanese languages]] as a mother tongue. Taiwanese people may also refer to individuals who are ascribed [[cultural identity]] from areas under the control of the [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of Taiwan]] since 1945, including [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Matsu islands]] (see [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]]). At least three competing (occasionally overlapping) paradigms are used to identify someone as a Taiwanese person: nationalist criteria, [[self-identification]] (including the concept of "New Taiwanese") criteria, and socio-cultural criteria. These standards are fluid, and result from evolving social and political issues. The complexity resulting from competing and evolving standards is compounded by a larger dispute regarding Taiwan's identity, the [[political status of Taiwan]], and its potential ''[[de jure]]'' [[Taiwan independence]] or [[Cross-Strait Unification]].

According to government figures, over 95% of Taiwan's population of 23.4 million consists of [[Han Chinese]], while 2.3% are [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]]. Among others originally from the [[mainland Chinese|Mainland]], two main groups were the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and the [[Hakka people|Hakka]].{{sfnp|Copper|2003|pp=12-13}}{{sfnp|Hsiau|2005|p=105}} However, acculturation, intermarriage and assimilation have resulted in the mixing of the Han and indigenous Taiwanese in some degree. Although the concept of the "four great ethnic groups" was alleged to be the deliberate attempt by the Hoklo-dominated [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) to defuse ethnic tensions, this conception has become a dominant frame of reference for dealing with Taiwanese ethnic and national issues.{{sfnp|Makeham|2005|pp=4-5}}

Despite the wide use of the "four great ethnic groups" in public discourse as essentialized identities, the relationships between the peoples of Taiwan have been in a constant state of convergence and negotiation for centuries. The continuing process of cross-ethnic mixing with ethnicities from within and outside Taiwan, combined with the disappearance of ethnic barriers due to a shared socio-political experience, has led to the emergence of "Taiwanese" as a larger [[ethnic group]],{{sfnp|Harrell|Huang|1994|pp=14–15}} except on the island of Kinmen whose populace consider themselves as [[Kinmen]]ese or [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], and as well as inhabitant of [[Matsu Islands]] whereby they also consider themselves as Matsunese or Chinese.<ref name="di Genova">{{cite news |last=di Genova |first=Trista |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/114701.htm |title=Study explores the 'Kinmen Identity' |newspaper=China Post |accessdate=20 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104164106/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/114701.htm |archive-date=4 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="uri.edu">{{cite journal |last=Wei |first=Jian-Feng |url=http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2006v15n1/13%20Jian-Feng%20Wei.pdf |title=An Examination of Cultural Identity of Residents of Quemoy (Kinmen) |journal=Intercultural Communication Studies |date=2006 |volume=15 |number=1 |pages=136–137 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429171612/http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2006v15n1/13%20Jian-Feng%20Wei.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2013 }}</ref>

== Definitions of Taiwanese ==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2011}}

The word "'''Taiwanese people'''" has multiple meanings and can refer to one of the following:

*All citizens of the Republic of China with [[Nationality law of Taiwan|household registration]] in [[Free area of the Republic of China|the Taiwan (+ Streamlined Fujian) Free Area]]. This definition includes people living outside of [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan Province (Republic of China)]], including the peoples of the archipelagos of [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], and [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu (Kinmen)]] (and other territories controlled by the Republic of China). Many of the people living in Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuqiu are opposed to this definition, given that they view themselves as "Chinese from Fujian Province".<ref name="di Genova"/><ref name="uri.edu"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Huang |first=Sandy |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2003/04/06/201011 |title=Cases of mistaken identity perplexing Lienchiang County |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |date=6 April 2003 |accessdate=14 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316183649/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2003/04/06/201011 |archive-date=16 March 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> 
*All people living in Taiwan (or originating from Taiwan) who identify with the "Taiwanese" nationality in some form or another, rather than with the "Chinese" nationality. These people have views which are generally aligned with those of the [[Pan-Green Coalition|Pan-Green (Political) Coalition]]. This definition excludes people who support [[Chinese Unification]] and whose views are aligned with those of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-Blue (Political) Coalition]] (which includes most of the inhabitants of Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuqiu).
*All people living in Taiwan (of [[Han Chinese]] descent) whose ancestors endured [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|life under Japanese colonial rule (in Taiwan)]]. These people are commonly referred to as "Taiwanese Benshengren" within Taiwan (Republic of China), as opposed to "Taiwanese Waishengren" (which are [[Mainland Chinese|Chinese Mainlanders]] who migrated to Taiwan after 1945, as well as their descendants). This definition can also include the various [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples]], who are [[Austronesian peoples|ethnically-Austronesian]].
*All people who have historically lived in Taiwan, including people of [[Japanese people|ethnic-Japanese]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], or [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent (or various other ethnic ancestries) who historically colonized Taiwan or settled in Taiwan back when Taiwan was fully or partially controlled by the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Dutch Empire|Empire of the Netherlands]], or the [[Spanish Empire|Empire of Spain]], respectively.
*Only Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples, who have lived in Taiwan for up to 6000 years. This definition excludes all people groups who have settled in Taiwan in "recent" history (the past 1000 years), including the Han Chinese, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], the Japanese, the Dutch, and the Spanish. This view is generally held by Chinese Mainlanders and by people living in Taiwan (Republic of China) whose views are aligned with the Pan-Blue Coalition, who do not agree with the view that the "Taiwanese Benshengren" should be allowed to self-identify as Taiwanese, given that they are "invaders" in Taiwan, rather than "natives".

== The history of Taiwanese identity ==
The earliest notion of a Taiwanese [[identity politics|group identity]] emerged in the form of a [[national identity]] following the [[Qing Dynasty]]'s ceding of Taiwan to Japan in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895 {{Harvcol|Morris|2002|pp=3–6}}. Prior to Japanese rule, residents of Taiwan developed relationships based on class solidarity and social connections rather than ethnic identity. Although Han often cheated Aborigines, they also married and supported one another against other residents of the same ethnic background. Taiwan was the site of frequent feuding based on ethnicity, lineage and place of origin ({{Harvcolnb|Lamley|1981}}; {{Harvcolnb|Harrell|1990}}{{fix sfn}}; {{Harvcolnb|Shepherd|1993|pp=310–323}}).

=== Japanese era ===
[[File:Honto-Jin Chen Family circa 1930.JPG|thumb|225px|Taiwanese in the Japanese colonial era]]
In the face of the Japanese colonial hierarchy, the people of Taiwan were faced with the unequal binary relationship between [[Colony|colonizer/colonized]]. This duality between "one" and "other" was evident in the seven years of violence between the Japanese and groups of united anti-Japanese Han and Aborigines {{Harvcol|Katz|2005}}. Only later did the Japanese attempt to incorporate Taiwanese into the Japanese identity as "loyal subjects", but the difference between the experience of the colonized and the colonizer polarized the two groups {{Harvcol|Fujii|2006|pp=70–73}}.

The concept of "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]" was utilized as a tool to confirm and facilitate Japanese political policies. A system of household registers ([[koseki]]) based on the notion of race to separate and define groups of subjects. From within the group of "non-Japanese" the government divided Han citizens into "Han" and "Hakka" based on their perception of linguistic and cultural differences. The Japanese also maintained the Qing era classification of [[Taiwanese aborigines|aborigines]] as either "raw" or "cooked" {{Harvcol|Brown|2004|p=8}}, which to the Japanese embodied the social ramification of ethnic origin and perceived loyalty to the empire {{Harvcol|Wolf|Huang|1980|p=19}}.

Japanese ultra-nationalist governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] insulted the Taiwanese, referring to them as [[Sangokujin]]-

:I referred to the "many ''sangokujin'' who entered Japan illegally." I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used ''[[gaikokujin]]'', or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.

:... After World War II, when Japan lost, '''the Chinese of Taiwanese origin''' and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.

:... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.<ref name="TimeInterview">"[http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html 'There's No Need For an Apology': Tokyo's boisterous governor is back in the headlines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091806/http://cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0424/int.ishihara.html |date=2013-04-08 }}," ''TIME Asia'', 24 April 2000.</ref>

===Martial law era===
[[File:中華民國第一位民選首都市長吳三連於1951年勝選後 First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|Non-Kuomintang politician [[Wu San-lien]] (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first-time Taipei city mayoral election in January 1951 with his supporters. Taipei has been the capital of Taiwan since December 1949.]]

In 1945, the Taiwanese faced a new unequal binary relationship when Taiwan entered the political sphere of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC).{{sfnp|Peng|1972|p=45|ps=: "One day I fell into conversation with two Americans in a jeep beside the road (in early occupied Japan), and in passing explained to them that I was not Japanese, but a Chinese from Formosa. It was something of a shock to find myself for the first time openly and proudly making this distinction"}} Shortly following the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) arrival, however, social conflict erupted in the midst of rampant government corruption, soaring inflation and an increasing flow of immigrants from China (see [[February 28 Incident]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. The latter were preferred for jobs in the civil service as opposed to Taiwanese who were regarded as "untrustworthy"{{Harvcol|Phillips|2003|pp=8–9}}. Recurrent violent suppression of dissent also played an important role in enforcing a separate sense of "Taiwanese-ness" {{Harvcol|Gates|1981|pp=253–275}}.

Under the KMT structure, "Taiwanese" became a strong "regional" identity. The term has often been used synonymously with '''benshengren''', a term which covered both Hokkien and Hakka whose ancestors arrived in Taiwan before the Japanese restrictions on immigration in 1895. "Taiwanese" was used in contrast with ''[[waishengren]]'' (mainlanders), who included the people who followed the KMT to Taiwan between 1945 and 1949 and their descendants. The government tended to stress provincial identities, with identification cards and passports issued until the late 1990s displaying one's ancestral province and county. During this period the terms "cooked" and "raw" Aborigines disappeared. The former "raw" Aborigines were termed ''Shandi Tongbao'', ''Gaoshanzu'' (Mountain Race) or ''Gaoshan Tongbao'' (Mountain Compatriots).

=== Democratic era ===
[[File:President Lee teng hui.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Lee Teng-hui]] became the first president of the Republic of China to be born in Taiwan. He was democratically elected in 1996.]]

With Taiwan's political liberalization in the 1970s and 1980s, encouraged by Taiwan's changing international status, the concept of a "Taiwanese people" became politicized by opponents of the KMT. The [[tangwai movement]] deployed concepts of "Taiwanese identity" against the authoritarian KMT government, often using extreme tactics to build a short-term ethno-centric opposition to the KMT {{Harvcol|Edmunson|2002|pp=34–42}}{{fix sfn|date=November 2010}}. The campaign saw resonance with the people of Taiwan and the term "Taiwanese" has been used by politicians of all parties to refer to the electorate in an effort to secure votes. The concept of a separate Taiwanese identity has become such an integral factor to the election culture in Taiwan, that identifying as a Taiwanese has become essential to being elected in Taiwan {{Harvcol|Corcuff|2002|pp=243–249}}.

=== New Taiwanese ===
The term "New Taiwanese" (新臺灣人) was coined by former [[President of the Republic of China]], [[Lee Teng-hui]] in 1995 to bridge the ethnic cleavage that followed the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947 and characterized the frigid relations between ''waishengren'' and ''benshengren'' during forty years of [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]]. Although originally aimed at the successive generations of Taiwanese with mainlander ancestry, it has been further articulated by Lee and other political and social leaders to refer to any person who loves Taiwan and is committed to calling Taiwan home. Although critics have called the "New Taiwanese Concept" a political ploy to win votes from ''benshengren'' who regarded the KMT as an alien regime, it has remained an important factor in the dialectic between ethnic identities in Taiwan. Despite being adopted early on by former Provincial Governor [[James Soong]] (1997) and later by, then Taipei mayoral candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (1999), the term has since been dropped from contemporary political rhetoric {{Harvcol|Corcuff|2002|pp=186–188}}.

=== Multicultural present ===
In contemporary Taiwan the phenomenon of mixed marriages between couples comprising different ethnic groups has grown to include people from the Indian subcontinent{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, southeast Asia, Europe{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands]]. The increasing number of marriages between Taiwanese and other countries creates a problem for the rigid definitions of ethnic identity used by both the ROC and the PRC when discussing Taiwan {{Harvcol|Harrell|1995}}. In one-fourth of all marriages in Taiwan today, one partner will be from another country<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/FDA/PAPERS/24_WenShanYang.pdf|title=Gender Imbalances and the Twisted Marriage Market in Taiwan|website=Cicred.org|access-date=2009-01-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107042045/http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/FDA/PAPERS/24_WenShanYang.pdf|archive-date=2009-01-07|url-status=live}}</ref> and one out of every twelve children is born to a family of mixed parentage. As Taiwan's birthrate is among the lowest in the world, this contingent is playing an increasingly important role in changing Taiwan's demographic makeup. By 2010, this social-cultural group of people is typically known as "'''Taiwan's new resident''' (臺灣新住民 ''lit.'' "New Residents in Taiwan" {{zh|w=Taiwan Hsin Chu-min|p=Xīnzhùmín|first=w}}; {{IPA|[ɕin ʈ͡ʂu min]}}).

In a 2002 poll by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], over 50% of the respondents considered themselves "Taiwanese" only, up from less than 20% in 1991 {{Harvcol|Dreyer|2003}}. In 2006, Wu Nai-teh of Academia Sinica said that "many Taiwanese are still confused about identity, and are easily affected by political, social, and economic circumstances."<ref>{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Rich |date=12 March 2006 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/03/12/2003296948 |title='Taiwan identity' growing: study |newspaper=Taipei Times |access-date=19 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515071111/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/03/12/2003296948 |archive-date=15 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a poll released in December 2006 by the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF), 57% of people on Taiwan consider themselves to be Taiwanese, 23% Chinese and 20% both Chinese and Taiwanese (China Post, 2006).

The sense of a collective Taiwanese identity has continued to increase despite fluctuations in support for pro-independence political parties. This has been cited as evidence that the concept of Taiwanese identity is not the product of local political manipulation, but an actual phenomenon of ethnic and sociopolitical identities ({{Harvcolnb|Corcuff| 2002| pp=137–149, 207}}; {{Harvcolnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=157–170}}).

== Major socio-cultural subgroups ==

[[File:Beauty_of_the_island_Formosa.jpg|thumb|"Beauty of Taiwan" per caption, circa 1900]]
According to governmental statistics, over 95% of Taiwan's 23.4 million people are [[Han Chinese]],{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=36}} of which the majority includes descendants of early [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] immigrants who arrived from [[Fujian]] in large numbers starting in the 17th century.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=47-8}} A significant minority of the Han group are the [[Hakka people]], who comprise about 15% of the total population. The Hakkas emigrated chiefly from eastern [[Guangdong]], speak [[Hakka Chinese]], and originally took up residence in hilly areas.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=48}} The so-called "[[mainland Chinese]]" Han subgroup includes and descends from the 2 million Nationalists who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory in mainland China in 1949. The non-Han Austronesian population of [[Taiwanese aborigines]] comprises about 2.3% of the population and have inhabited the island for millennia.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=49}}

Migration to Taiwan from southern Asia began approximately 12,000 BC, but large-scale migration to Taiwan did not occur until the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century as a result of political and economic chaos in mainland China.{{sfnp|Shepherd|1993}}{{sfnp|Bellwood|2000}}{{sfnp|Blust|1988}} The first large scale migration occurred as a result of the [[Manchu]] invasion and conquest of China, overthrowing the [[Ming dynasty]] and establishing the [[Qing dynasty]], which was established in 1644 and remained until 1911.

In 1624, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established an outpost in modern-day [[Anping, Tainan]] in southern Taiwan after expelling the Spanish. The Dutch soon realized Taiwan's potential as a colony for trading deer hide, [[venison]], rice, and sugar. However, Aborigines were not interested in developing the land and transporting settlers from Europe would be too costly. Due to the resulting labor shortage, the Dutch hired Han farmers from across the [[Taiwan Strait]] who fled the Manchu invasion of Ming dynasty China.{{sfnp|Andrade|2006}}

[[Koxinga]] brought along many more Chinese settlers during the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] in which he expelled the Dutch. Migration of male laborers from [[Fujian]], steadily increased into the 18th and 19th century. In time, this migration and the gradual removal of ethnic markers (coupled with the acculturation, intermarriage and assimilation of [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|plains Aborigines]] with the Han) resulted in the widespread adoption of Han patterns of behavior making Taiwanese Han the ethnic majority.

It was not until the Japanese arrival in 1895 that Taiwanese first developed a collective Taiwanese identity in contrast to that of the colonizing Japanese.{{sfnp|Morris|2002|}} When the [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out between [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang nationalists]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]] in 1945, there was another mass migration of people from mainland China to Taiwan fleeing the communists. These migrants are known as the [[mainland Chinese]].

=== Indigenous peoples ===
{{Main|Taiwanese indigenous peoples}}
[[File:Taiwan aborigine lona children.jpg|thumb|A group of Taiwanese indigenous children]]
Taiwanese indigenous peoples are the [[indigenous people]]s of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. They speak languages that belongs to the [[Austronesian language family]], and are culturally, [[genetically]] and [[linguistically]] closely related to the ethnic groups of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. Their ancestors are believed to have been living on the islands for approximately 8,000 years before major [[Han Chinese]] [[immigration]] began in the 17th century {{Harvcol|Blust|1999}}. Taiwan's Austronesian speakers were traditionally distributed over much of the island's rugged central mountain range and concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains. Today, the bulk of the contemporary Taiwanese indigenous population reside in the mountains and the major cities. The total population of recognized indigenous peoples on Taiwan is approximately 533,600, or approximately 2.28% of Taiwan's population.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=49}} The cities of [[Yilan City|Yilan]], [[Hualien City|Hualien]], and [[Taitung City|Taitung]] are known for their communities. In the 1990s, Taiwanese indigenous peoples, which had traditionally viewed themselves as separate groups, united under the singular ethnonym '{{lang|zh|原住民}}' or 'Indigenous peoples' {{Harvcol|Stainton|1999}}.

=== Hoklo ===
{{Main|Hoklo Taiwanese}}
{{See also|Han Taiwanese|Hoklo people}}

The [[Hoklo people]] of [[Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] speak [[Hokkien]] and mostly originated from Fujian (specifically [[Quanzhou]], [[Zhangzhou]], [[Xiamen]] and [[Kinmen]]). The Hoklos account for about 70% of the total population today. During [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing rule]], some Hoklo men took [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] brides.{{sfnp|Exec. Yuan|2014|p=48}} Some of the [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|plains aboriginals]] also adopted Chinese customs and language so as to be indistinguishable from the Han.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=581}} Thus, many who categorize themselves as Hoklo have some degree of indigenous ancestry.

It is possible to find families where the older members still identify themselves as lowland aborigine, while the rest of the family may identify as Hoklo. Among the Hoklo, the common idiom, "has [[Names of China#Tang|Tangshan]] father, no Tangshan mother" ({{zh|t=有{{linktext|唐山}}公、無唐山媽|poj=Ū Tn̂g-soaⁿ kong, bô Tn̂g-soaⁿ má}})<ref>{{cite book |last=Tai |first=Pao-tsun |title=The Concise History of Taiwan |edition=Chinese-English bilingual |year=2007 |publisher=Taiwan Historica |location=Nantou City |isbn=9789860109504 |page=52}}</ref><ref>{{holodict|60161}}</ref> refers how the Han people crossing the Taiwan Strait were mostly male, whereas their offspring would be through marriage with female Taiwanese aborigines.

Within the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself, differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place, with most pure Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture, which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-m0PGuSUGDMC&pg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false Brown 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427000944/https://books.google.com/books?id=-m0PGuSUGDMC&pg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-04-27 }}. pp. 156-7.</ref> Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J.

=== Hakka ===
{{See also|Han Taiwanese|Hakka people}}
Taiwan's Hakka people descend largely from Hakka who migrated from southern and northern [[Guangdong]] to Taiwan around the end of the [[Ming dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] (ca. 1644).<ref name=ocac>''[http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/lang/hakka/english/a/a.htm The Hakka People] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201142340/http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/lang/hakka/english/a/a.htm |date=2015-02-01 }}'', [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]] (OCAC). [[Taiwan]].</ref>

The Taiwanese [[Hakka people|Hakka]] communities, although arriving to Taiwan from mountains of eastern [[Guangdong]] and western [[Fujian]], have also likely mixed through intermarriage with lowland Aborigines as well. Hakka family trees are known for identifying the male ancestors by their ethnic Hakka heritage while leaving out information on the identity of the female ancestors. Also, during the process of intermarriage and assimilation, many of the lowland Aborigines and their families adopted [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and Hakka family names. Much of this happened in Taiwan prior to the Japanese colonization of Taiwan, so that by the time of the Japanese colonization, most of the population that the Japanese classified as "Chinese" [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and "Chinese" Hakka were in truth already of mixed ancestry. Physical features of both Taiwanese aborigine and Chinese can be found amongst the Taiwanese mainstream today.

It is commonly disputed that Taiwanese are not Chinese despite common or similar societal beliefs. DNA studies have shown mixed results of both Chinese ancestors and Taiwanese Aborigines. This finding would support both views, which does not clear the air any more than it had been already. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Mainlander ===
{{See also|Han Taiwanese}}
"Mainlanders" or "Waisheng Ren" are used by some to refer to the [[post-war]] immigrants (and sometimes also their descendants) who followed the KMT to Taiwan between 1945 and 1950. The descendants of [[Mainlander (China)|mainlanders]] settled first within the heart of large urban centers in Taiwan such as Taipei, Taichung, or Kaohsiung{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. High numbers of government officials and civil servants who followed the KMT to Taiwan and occupied the positions of the colonial government moved into the official dormitories and residences built by the Japanese for civil servants. The ghettoization of mainlander communities exacerbated the divisions imagined by non-mainlander groups, and stymied cultural integration and assimilation into mainstream Taiwanese culture {{Harvcol|Gates|1981}}. Nationalization campaigns undertaken by the KMT established an official "culture", which reflected the KMT government's own preference for what it considered authentic Chinese culture. This excluded many of the local Taiwanese practices and local cultures, including the diverse cultures brought to Taiwan by the mainlanders from all parts of China {{Harvcol|Wachman|1994}}. Unlike, the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] of Taiwan, who felt excluded by the new government, the [[Mainland Chinese|mainlanders]] and their families supported the nationalists and embraced the official "culture" as their own, with "national culture" being taught in school {{Harvcol|Wilson|1970}}. The mainlanders used their embrace of Nationalist culture to identify themselves as the authentic Chinese people of Taiwan.

In addition to the Han people, there were also small numbers of [[Mongolians in Taiwan|Mongols]], [[Islam in Taiwan|Hui]], [[Manchu people in Taiwan|Manchu]] and other [[ethnic groups in China|ethnic minorities]] among the Waishengren.

===Burmese Chinese===
Burmese Chinese have settled mostly in [[Zhonghe District]], located in [[Taipei County]]. The job boom in the factories there has attracted an estimated 40,000 Burmese Chinese immigrants (c. 2008) which are 10% of the city's population. This is "believed to be the largest Burmese Chinese community outside of Burma."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hsin-chun Tasaw Lu|title=Negotiating Ethnicity: Burmese Chinese Migrants in Taiwan|journal=Journal of Burma Studies|date=2008|volume=12|pages=29–62| doi=10.1353/jbs.2008.0001|s2cid=154656569| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236746812}}</ref>

=== New residents or immigrants ===
Taiwan Hsin Chu-min (臺灣新住民 ''lit.''

{{main|Overseas Taiwanese}}
{{See also|Overseas Chinese}}'''Overseas Taiwanese''' ([[Traditional Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 海外臺灣人), also called "'''people of Taiwanese descent'''" ([[Traditional Chinese characters|Chinese]]: 臺裔; [[pinyin]]: ''taiyi''), are people who are living outside of [[Taiwan]] but are of Taiwanese ancestry or descent. Overseas Taiwanese may live in other territories such as the [[People's Republic of China]] and are not necessarily [[Taiwan]] nationals.[[File:Chinese Taipei School (Kuala Lumpur).jpg|thumb|Chinese Taipei School in [[Malaysia]].]]

=== Taiwanese living in China (PRC) ===
{{See also|Taishang}}
Starting the 1980s, some Taiwanese businesspeople (''[[Taishang]]'') started to open factories and moved into the Mainland China for its lower labor-costs and tax-deduction policies enacted by Chinese government towards Taiwanese. Thus, manufacture-intensive cities like [[Kunshan]] and [[Dongguan]] had aggregated a significant amount of Taiwanese population, mostly Taishang and their families since then.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gunter Schubert|title=Assessing political agency across the Taiwan Strait: The case of the taishang|year=2013|doi=10.1177/0920203X12470319}}</ref> In November 2014 the ''[[Taipei Times]]'' cited an estimate of 1 million Taiwanese living within China (PRC), i.e. "mainland China".<ref>{{cite news |last=Shih |first=Hsiao-kuang |date=16 November 2014 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/11/16/2003604555 |title=2014 ELECTIONS: Chinese officials aiding KMT voters: sources |newspaper=Taipei Times |access-date=16 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129014713/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/11/16/2003604555 |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Historically, most Taiwanese people originated from China (under regimes before the PRC). Taiwanese people (of Chinese descent) have traveled between China and Taiwan throughout history. [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|Taiwanese Aborigines]] also have a minor presence in China (PRC). After the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was signed, with Taiwan (previously a Chinese province/prefecture) being ceded by [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]], an [[expatriate]]/[[refugee]] community of Taiwanese in China was created.

The original [[Taiwanese Communist Party]] was closely affiliated with the [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]] prior to the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. The failed party would later evolve into the [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], one of eight officially-recognised political parties within China (PRC) which is ultimately subservient to the CCP. Many members of this party have been Taiwanese people residing in China (PRC), i.e. "mainland China".

=== Taiwanese Japanese ===
{{See also|Chinese people in Japan}}'''''This article merges Taiwanese Japanese with Chinese Japanese. Taiwanese Japanese do not currently have their own Wikipedia article.'''''
From 1895 until 1945, Taiwan was controlled by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] as a [[colony]]/[[Dependent territory|dependency]]. It was known as "[[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Formosa]]". Due to this period of close administrative connection between Taiwan and [[Japan]], many Taiwanese people have been living in Japan for several generations, such as [[Momofuku Ando]], the inventor of "[[Instant noodle|instant ramen (noodles)]]", whose invention has been praised by Japanese people as one of the country's greatest national inventions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/food/instant-ramen-japan-s-greatest-invention-says-japan|title=Instant Ramen Is Japan's Greatest Invention Says Japan|last=Kaufman|first=Noah|date=July 7, 2015|website=Food & Wine|access-date=June 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607052822/https://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/food/instant-ramen-japan-s-greatest-invention-says-japan|archive-date=June 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Taiwanese community in Japan tends to be treated separately from the [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese (PRC) community]], both officially and socially, and is quite close to the local Japanese population. However, controversies have arisen due to [[Multiple citizenship|dual-citizenship]] of ethnic-Taiwanese politicians in Japan, e.g. [[Renhō]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/09/07/national/renho-nationality-accusations-spur-debate-dual-citizenship/#.XPn1AogzY2w|title=Renho nationality accusations spur debate on dual citizenship|last=Shusuke|first=Murai|date=September 7, 2016|work=Japan Times|access-date=June 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421193837/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/09/07/national/renho-nationality-accusations-spur-debate-dual-citizenship/#.XPn1AogzY2w|archive-date=April 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> since Japan doesn't technically recognise the Republic of China on Taiwan as a legitimate country, and since [[Japanese nationality law|Japan doesn't allow dual-citizenship]], especially not in [[Politics of Japan|politics]].

Japanese people tend to have positive views towards Taiwanese people due to shared history, shared culture, shared values, and the [[Japan–Taiwan relations|close ties between Taiwan and Japan]]. Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] in Japan, Taiwan was [[Humanitarian response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|the most prominent humanitarian contributor]], donating US$252 million in combined aid under [[President of the Republic of China|then-ROC-president]] [[Ma Ying-jeou]]'s administration. This is one major reason why Japanese people tend to have favourable views of Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/05/21/national/intricate-bonds-behind-taiwan-aid/#.XPnz_IgzY2w|title=Intricate bonds behind Taiwan aid|last=Ko|first=Shu-ling|date=May 21, 2011|work=Japan Times|access-date=June 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108054108/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/05/21/national/intricate-bonds-behind-taiwan-aid/#.XPnz_IgzY2w|archive-date=January 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically, [[Koxinga|Zheng Cheng-gong (also known as Koxinga)]], who established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in Taiwan, was born to a Japanese mother and Chinese father. [[Chiang Wei-kuo]], the second ([[Adoption|adopted]]) son of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (arguably the most well-known [[Politics of the Republic of China|Taiwanese and ROC politician]] outside of Taiwan/China), was also born to a Japanese mother and Chinese father.

In the [[United States]], there are 230,382 to 919,000 people of Taiwanese descent living there. They are mostly concentrated in [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]].<ref name="USCensus2010">{{cite web |url = http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_PCT7&prodType=table |archive-url = https://archive.today/20200212213039/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_PCT7&prodType=table |url-status = dead |archive-date = 12 February 2020 |title=ASIAN ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ONE OR MORE OTHER RACES, AND WITH ONE OR MORE ASIAN CATEGORIES FOR SELECTED GROUPS |year=2011 |work=[[United States Census Bureau]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Commerce]] |accessdate=18 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ocac.gov.tw/public/public.asp?selno=9429&no=9429&level=C Numbers of Overseas Taiwanese] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916092810/http://www.ocac.gov.tw/public/public.asp?selno=9429&no=9429&level=C |date=2012-09-16 }}, Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission, Taiwan, 2010</ref>

=== Taiwanese Australians ===
{{Main|Taiwanese Australians}}
{{See also|Chinese Australians|Japanese Australians}}
The complete number of Taiwanese Australians is unknown since the Australian Census only records foreign ethnicities for the first two generations (i.e. the number of 3rd-gen Taiwanese Australians and beyond is unknown). However, it is known that there are around 45,000–55,000 Taiwanese Australians who are 1st-gen or 2nd-gen, and these people currently comprise around 90–95% of Australia's ethnically-Taiwanese population. In modern times, Australians of Taiwanese descent are mostly concentrated around the cities of [[Brisbane]], [[Melbourne]], and [[Sydney]], with significant populations in [[List of cities in Australia by population|other major Australian cities]].

== Genetic studies ==
The Hoklo and Hakka linguistic groups, which statistically make up the majority of Taiwan's population, can trace their historical and cultural roots to [[Hokkien]]- and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]-speaking peoples from what is now China, predominantly the southern provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. The original migrations from China were as male labourers under contract to the Dutch, so there was considerable intermarriage with women from [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|plains aboriginal groups]]. The [[human leukocyte antigen]] typing study and [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis performed in recent years show that more than 88% of the Taiwanese population have some degree of aboriginal origin {{Harvcol|Sim|2003}}.

A 2009 doctoral dissertation questions such findings and claims that "the great number of Han immigrants after the 18th century is the main reason to consider that the early genetic contribution from Plains Indigenes to Taiwanese Han has been largely diluted and no longer exists in any meaningful way."<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Chen |first=Shu-Juo |title=How Han are Taiwanese Han? Genetic inference of Plains Indigenous ancestry among Taiwanese Han and its implications for Taiwan identity |degree=Ph.D. |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/33/43/3343568.html |institution=Stanford University |year=2009 |accessdate=11 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014090934/http://gradworks.umi.com/33/43/3343568.html |archivedate=14 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The lack of a totally complete and definite set of genetic record of plains Aborigines, or conclusive understanding of their proto-Austronesian roots, further complicates the use of genetic data {{Harvcol|Blust|1988}}. It is important to mention that most immigrated Chinese are from southern China and that these people already had ancient Austronesian admixture<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.people.cn/200112/14/eng20011214_86696.shtml |title=DNA Analysis Reveals Taiwanese Have Ancestors on Mainland |website=En.people.cn |access-date=2017-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024042636/http://en.people.cn/200112/14/eng20011214_86696.shtml |archive-date=2016-10-24 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Li|first1=Dongna|last2=Li|first2=Hui|last3=Ou|first3=Caiying|last4=Lu|first4=Yan|last5=Sun|first5=Yuantian|last6=Yang|first6=Bo|last7=Qin|first7=Zhendong|last8=Zhou|first8=Zhenjian|last9=Li|first9=Shilin|date=2008-05-14 |title=Paternal Genetic Structure of Hainan Aborigines Isolated at the Entrance to East Asia|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=3|issue=5|pages=e2168|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002168|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2374892|pmid=18478090|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2168L}}</ref> (see [[Baiyue]] people).
