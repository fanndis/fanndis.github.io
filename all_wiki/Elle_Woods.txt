==Background==
In the film, ''Legally Blonde'', Elle Woods is a sorority sister living at the Delta Nu House at the fictional California University Los Angeles (CULA) ([[UCLA]] in the musical) where she maintains a 4.0 GPA. Woods' boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, the son of a U.S. Congressman, breaks up with her the night she expects him to propose, claiming that he needs "to marry a [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie]], not a [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]]." Warner is bound for [[Harvard Law School]], and Woods becomes determined to gain admittance to the school to win him back. Once at Harvard, Woods learns that Warner has a new fiancée, Vivian Kensington, who is a member of the same [[country club]] as Warner's family. Woods is able to exonerate a sorority sister accused of murder, and decides she does not need Warner. In the film's conclusion, Woods gives the commencement address to the law school class after proving herself and earning the respect of her peers, and beginning a relationship with Emmett Richmond.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Scott |first=A.

In the sequel to the original film, Elle is in the middle of planning her wedding while in line for a promotion at work. She decides to track down the birth mother of her beloved dog, Bruiser, and discovers that she is being used for animal testing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} After getting fired for trying to bring up the testing facility, Elle goes to work on [[Capitol Hill]], seeking to advance [[animal rights]]. She begins the film with naïve expectations about the motivations of members of Congress, and although these expectations are dashed, she perseveres and succeeds in the passage of the desired animal rights legislation. At the end of the movie, she marries Emmett in Washington, D.C., and is seen looking at the White House when she is asked where she wants to live.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
