The '''Toronto International Film Festival''' ('''TIFF''', often stylized as '''tiff''') is one of the largest publicly attended [[film festival]]s in the world, attracting over 480,000 people annually. Since its founding in 1976, TIFF has grown to become a permanent destination for film culture operating out of the [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]], located in [[downtown Toronto]]. TIFF's mission is "to transform the way people see the world through film".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/about|title=About TIFF|website=TIFF|language=en|access-date=2019-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021044148/https://www.tiff.net/about/|archive-date=October 21, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Year-round, the TIFF Bell Lightbox offers screenings, lectures, discussions, festivals, workshops, industry support, and the chance to meet filmmakers from Canada and around the world. TIFF Bell Lightbox is located on the north west corner of King Street and John Street in downtown Toronto.

==Background==

Founded by [[Bill Marshall (producer)|Bill Marshall]], [[Dusty Cohl]], and [[Henk Van der Kolk]],<ref name=tstar>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Goffin |title=TIFF co-founder Bill Marshall, 77, remembered as pioneer of Canadian film |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2017/01/01/tiff-co-founder-bill-marshall-77-remembered-as-pioneer-of-canadian-film.html |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=January 1, 2017 |accessdate=January 3, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102173841/https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2017/01/01/tiff-co-founder-bill-marshall-77-remembered-as-pioneer-of-canadian-film.html |archivedate=January 2, 2017 }}</ref> the inaugural event took place from October 18 through 24, 1976. That first year, 35,000 filmgoers watched 127 films from 30 countries presented in ten programmes. [[Piers Handling]] has been the festival's director and CEO since 1994, while [[Noah Cowan]] became co-director of TIFF in 2004. In late 2007, Cowan became the artistic director of [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]], while longtime programmer [[Cameron Bailey]] succeeded as co-director. As of 2013, Bailey is now the artistic director of the Toronto International Film Festival, as well as TIFF Bell Lightbox's year round programming.<ref>[http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/14/cameron-bailey-named-artistic-director-of-toronto-international-film-festival/ "Cameron Bailey named artistic director of Toronto International Film Festival"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150121000908/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/14/cameron-bailey-named-artistic-director-of-toronto-international-film-festival/ |date=January 21, 2015 }}.

TIFF was once centred on the [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] neighbourhood, but the [[Toronto Entertainment District]] later gained a greater level of prominence.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.thestar.com/article/851243 |work = [[Toronto Star]] |first = Raju |last = Mudhar |date = August 25, 2010 |accessdate = September 7, 2010 |title = From mega clubs to mega culture in Entertainment District |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100831074356/http://www.thestar.com/article/851243 |archivedate = August 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.toronto.com/article/696280?bn=1 |work = [[Toronto Star]] |first = Kate |last = Allen |date = August 24, 2011 |accessdate = August 25, 2011 |title = TIFF's great migration |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120323021413/http://www.toronto.com/article/696280?bn=1 |archivedate = March 23, 2012 }}</ref><!-- As of 2013, TIFF maintains extensive connections with the Yorkville area.<ref>{{cite web

In 2010, TIFF opened its permanent headquarters, TIFF Bell Lightbox, a year-round home for the appreciation of film in the heart of downtown Toronto, although TIFF films are still screened at a wider variety of venues, including the [[Scotiabank Theatre Toronto]], rather than exclusively at the Lightbox.

TIFF has grown, steadily adding initiatives throughout the years. [[TIFF Cinematheque]] (formerly Cinematheque Ontario) and the Film Reference Library (FRL) opened in 1990. The TIFF Kids International Film Festival (formerly Sprockets) launched in 1998. Film Circuit began exhibiting independent and Canadian films in under-serviced cities across Canada in 1994.

In 1978, the decision was made to replace the name "Festival of Festivals" with "Toronto International Film Festival" as well as a move to a new location for the festival, moving from the [[Westin Harbour Castle Hotel|Harbour Castle Hotel]] to the Plaza II, and also a new director, with Wayne Clark replacing Marshall. The number of galas increased from one to two per night and the [[Canadian Film Awards]] were incorporated into the festival.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 12, 1978|page=48|title=Toronto Re-Names, Relocates Its Festival; Wayne Clark In}}</ref> From 1994 to 2009, the umbrella organization running TIFF was named "Toronto International Film Festival Group" (TIFFG).

In 2001, Perspective Canada, the programme that had focused on Canadian films since 1984, was replaced by two programmes:
* Canada First!, a forum for Canadian filmmakers presenting their first feature-length work, featuring eight to 15 films, and
* Short Cuts Canada, which includes 30-40 Canadian [[short film]]s.
Otherwise, Canadian films are now simply included alongside international films in the other film programs rather than being grouped as a dedicated Canadian film stream.

In 2004, TIFF was featured as the site of murder mystery in the film ''[[Jiminy Glick in Lalawood]]'', a comedy film starring [[Martin Short]].

In 2007, it was announced that the organization generates an estimated annual impact of $67 million CAD.<ref>{{cite press release|work = [[Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport]]|date = September 7, 2007|title = McGuinty government helps promote Toronto International Film Festival|url = http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/47437/mcguinty-government-helps-promote-toronto-international-film-festival|accessdate = September 10, 2012|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117004200/http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/47437/mcguinty-government-helps-promote-toronto-international-film-festival|archivedate = January 17, 2013|df = mdy-all}}</ref> By 2011, that benefit had grown to $170 million CAD.<ref>{{cite press release |url = http://tiff.net/press/pressreleases/2011/festival-announces |publisher = Toronto International Film Festival |date = August 16, 2011 |title = Festival Announces Boundary-Pushing Visions Titles |accessdate = August 25, 2011 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110912052928/http://tiff.net/press/pressreleases/2011/festival-announces |archivedate = September 12, 2011 }}</ref>

Many Hollywood studios premiere their films in Toronto due to TIFF's easy-going non-competitive nature, relatively inexpensive costs (when compared to European festivals), eager film-fluent audiences and convenient timing.<ref>{{cite news

===TIFF Bell Lightbox===
[[File:Lightbox 2010-09-11 II.JPG|thumb|[[TIFF Bell Lightbox]]]]
In 2007, the Festival Group began construction on [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]], a new facility at the corner of King and John Streets in downtown Toronto, on land donated by [[Ivan Reitman]] and family. The $181 million facility is named for founding sponsor [[Bell Canada]], with additional support from the [[Government of Ontario]] and [[Government of Canada]].

In 2010, the organization opened its new headquarters at TIFF Bell Lightbox. The facility, designed by local firm [[KPMB Architects]], provides extensive year-round galleries, cinemas, archives and activities for cinephiles.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/tiff/interviews-and-features/article1702853.ece | location = Toronto | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | first = Guy | last = Dixon | title = Lightbox aims to draw filmmakers to its facilities - The Globe and Mail | date = September 9, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The five-storey facility contains five cinemas, two gallery spaces, film archives and an extensive reference library, study spaces, film lab facility, and a research centre. There is also a gift shop, two restaurants, a lounge, a cafe, and a three-storey atrium.<ref>{{cite news|title = Let there be lightbox|url = http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=176653|accessdate = August 17, 2012|work = NOW|date = September 9–16, 2010|author = Norman Wilner|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117004724/http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=176653|archivedate = January 17, 2013}}</ref> Cooperatively with Daniels Corporation, there is a 46-storey condominium atop, called the Festival Tower.

The first film screening was [[Bruce McDonald (director)|Bruce McDonald]]'s ''[[Trigger (film)|Trigger]]''. The first exhibition was a retrospective on [[Tim Burton]], organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (New York City). Subsequent exhibitions include Fellini: Spectacular Obsessions, Grace Kelly: From Movie Star to Princess, Designing 007: 50 Years of Bond Style, and [[Stanley Kubrick]]: The Exhibition, all of which were organized by TIFF, as well as one called ''Essential Cinema'', featuring posters, images and props from TIFF's ''The Essential 100'' list of films.<ref>{{cite news|title = No place like home: Toronto film fest opens new HQ|url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/sep/09/no-place-like-home-toronto-film-fest-opens-new-hq/|accessdate = September 16, 2012|work = U-T San Diego News|date = September 9, 2010|first = David|last = Germain|agency = The San Diego Union-Tribune, LLC|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117004159/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/sep/09/no-place-like-home-toronto-film-fest-opens-new-hq/|archivedate = January 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = A look at the Stanley Kubrick Exhibition TIFF 2014|url = http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2014/11/27/stanley-kubrick-tiff-2014/|accessdate = August 3, 2015|work = [[The Vancouver Sun]]|date = November 27, 2014|agency = Canoe Sun Media}}</ref>

The [[Film Reference Library]] (FRL) is a large Canadian film research collection. The library is a free resource for film lovers, filmmakers, students, scholars, and journalists, and is located on the fourth floor of the TIFF Bell Lightbox. An affiliate member of the [[International Federation of Film Archives|International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF)]], the FRL promotes Canadian and global film scholarship by collecting, preserving, and providing access to a comprehensive collection of film prints, and film-related reference resources (including books, periodicals, scripts, research files, movies, press kits, and about 80 special collections.

In 2016, the festival received a donation of 1,400 film prints, and launched a campaign to raise money for the preservation and storage of the films.<ref>[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20161116/282033326780443 "TIFF gains cach of 1,400 film prints"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117065918/https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20161116/282033326780443 |date=November 17, 2016 }}.

===Canada's Top Ten===
Each year, TIFF releases a [[Canada's Top Ten]] list of the films selected by a poll of festival programmers across Canada as the ten best Canadian feature and short films of the year, regardless of whether or not they were screened at TIFF.<ref name=topten>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff-reveals-canadas-top-ten-film-festival-line-up/article27649543/ "TIFF reveals Canada’s Top Ten Film Festival line-up"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222182936/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff-reveals-canadas-top-ten-film-festival-line-up/article27649543/ |date=December 22, 2015 }}. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', December 8, 2015.</ref> The films selected are announced in December each year.

Previously, the winning films were screened at a smaller follow-up "Canada's Top Ten" festival at the Lightbox the following January, with a People's Choice Award then presented for that minifestival.<ref name = topten /> In 2018, TIFF announced a change, under which instead of a dedicated festival, each Top Ten film will receive its own standalone theatrical run at the Lightbox throughout the year.<ref>[https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/tiff-scraps-canadas-top-ten-film-festival/ "TIFF scraps popular Canada's Top Ten Film Festival"]. ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'', November 7, 2018.</ref>

Since 1984, every decade TIFF has also produced a [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]] list. This list is produced from a wider poll of film industry professionals and academics throughout Canada, separately from the annual top-ten list.

==Awards==
The festival's major prize, the [[Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award|People's Choice Award]], is given to a feature-length film. It is not a juried prize, but is given to the film with the highest ratings as voted by the TIFF-going populace.<ref>{{cite news

Each of the People's Choice Awards names first and second runners-up in addition to the winners.

However, TIFF does present juried awards in some other categories. The festival presents three major awards for Canadian films: [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film|Best Canadian Film]], [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian First Feature Film|Best Canadian First Feature Film]], and [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Short Film|Best Canadian Short Film]], as well as awards for [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best International Short Film|Best International Short Film]], two [[FIPRESCI]]-sponsored [[Toronto International Film Festival International Critics' Prizes|International Critics' Prizes]] for the Special Presentation and Discovery programs, and a [[NETPAC]]-sponsored award for the best film from [[Asia]] having its world premiere at the festival.<ref>{{cite web

In 2015, the festival introduced Platform, a juried programme that champions director's cinema from around the world; one film from the stream is selected as the winner of the [[Platform Prize]].

For all of the juried awards, [[honorable mention]]s may also be given, although the juries are expected to select one overall winner.

For 2019, TIFF announced two new awards, the TIFF Impact Award to honour production companies for work that has had an impact on the film industry, and the Mary Pickford Award to honour an emerging female filmmaker.<ref>[https://variety.com/2019/film/awards/toronto-film-festival-expands-tribute-gala-with-new-awards-1203254670/ "Toronto Film Festival Expands Tribute Gala With New Awards"]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', June 27, 2019.</ref> In the same year the festival introduced the TIFF Tribute Awards, a gala ceremony at which distinguished actors and filmmakers are honoured for their lifetime career achievements; unlike most award categories, the Tribute Award honorees are named in advance of the festival.<ref>Michael Rosser, [https://www.screendaily.com/news/anthony-hopkins-chloe-zhao-mira-nair-to-receive-tiff-tribute-awards/5152266.article "Anthony Hopkins, Chloe Zhao, Mira Nair to receive TIFF Tribute awards"]. ''[[Screen Daily]]'', August 12, 2020.</ref>

==Sections==
The hundreds of films screened at the annual festival are divided into sections (referred to by TIFF as "Programmes") based on genre (e.g. [[documentary]], [[children's film]]s), format (e.g. [[short films]], [[television episode]]s), the status of filmmaker (e.g. "masters", first-time directors), and so forth. Up until the early 2010s there were sections reserved for Canadian films, but beginning in 2015 all Canadian films are integrated in sections with films from outside Canada.

Currently the festival's 14 sections are as follows:<ref name=TIFF2017sections/>
* Contemporary World Cinema: [[narrative film|narrative]] feature films by established directors
* Discovery: films that are typically the director's first or second [[feature film]]
* Gala Presentations: high-profile feature films, often featuring international movie stars, presented with a [[red carpet]]
* In Conversation With...: interviews of a director or other figure from the film industry, generally accompanied by brief excerpts from films (up until the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival|2014 festival]], this section was called "Mavericks")
* Masters: feature films by "the world's most influential [[art-house]] filmmakers"
* Midnight Madness: [[Film genre|genre film]]s (traditionally at TIFF each film in this section has one screening scheduled for 11:59pm and another the following afternoon); the section was launched at TIFF in 1988 and was programmed by Colin Geddes from 1998 to 2016,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/tiff-programmer-colin-geddes-steps-down-toronto-international-film-festival-1201778911/ |work=IndieWire |title=TIFF Programmer Colin Geddes Departing After 20 Years |author=Graham Winfrey |date=February 7, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225210306/http://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/tiff-programmer-colin-geddes-steps-down-toronto-international-film-festival-1201778911/ |archivedate=February 25, 2017 }}</ref> now programmed by Peter Kuplowsky
* Platform: a competitive section launched in 2015, named for [[Jia Zhangke]]'s film ''[[Platform (2000 film)|Platform]]'', of films from around the world that do not have distribution in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/07/why-the-toronto-film-festival-is-adding-platform-competition-sidebar-186045/ |title=Why the Toronto Film Festival is Adding ‘Platform’ Competition Sidebar |date=July 15, 2015 |author=Anne Thompson |website=IndieWire |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132235/http://www.indiewire.com/2015/07/why-the-toronto-film-festival-is-adding-platform-competition-sidebar-186045/ |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=The Hollywood Reporter |author=Etan Vlessing |title=Toronto: Natalie Portman's 'Jackie' Biopic, 'Moonlight' From Brad Pitt's Plan B Join Lineup |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-2016-platform-lineup-natalie-918884 |date=August 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811230426/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-2016-platform-lineup-natalie-918884 |archivedate=August 11, 2016 }}</ref> Every year the Platform section has a high-profile international jury which confers a prize of C$25,000; both documentaries and narrative films are eligible for inclusion in the section; prior winners of the Platform Prize are the Canadian documentary ''[[Hurt (2015 film)|HURT]]'' (2015), the biographical drama ''[[Jackie (2016 film)|Jackie]]'' (2016) and ''[[Sweet Country (2017 film)|Sweet Country]]'' (2017).
* Primetime: television episodes making either their world premiere or North American premiere projected cinematically; this section was launched in 2015
* Short Cuts: a section of [[short films]] (usually six to ten short films included at each screening) both Canadian and international; up until [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival|the 2013 festival]] only Canadian short films were screened and the section was called Short Cuts Canada, in [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival|2014]] a new section called Short Cuts International was added, and then in 2015 they were merged into a section called Short Cuts
* Special Presentations: high-profile feature films, usually Canadian premieres if not [[premiere|world premieres]]
* TIFF Cinematheque: unlike the other sections which present new films, the TIFF Cinematheque section has films from all eras of cinema, often classic films that have been newly [[film preservation|restored]]
* TIFF Docs (formerly called Reel to Reel): [[documentary]] films
* TIFF Kids and TIFF Next Wave (formerly called Sprockets): films for children and teenagers; however, this is not a dedicated program in its own right, but a designation added to youth-suitable films that are already in one of the other programs.
* Wavelengths: [[experimental film]]s and [[art film]]s, both feature-length and shorts (this section was named for [[Michael Snow]]'s film ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]'')

In previous years, sections at TIFF have included Perspectives Canada, Canada First!, City to City ([[2009 Toronto International Film Festival#Controversy over Tel Aviv spotlight|2009]] to 2016), Future Projections, Vanguard (up to 2016), and Visions (up to 2011).
