'''''Wú''''' is the [[pinyin]] transliteration of the [[Chinese surname]] [[wikt:吳|吳]] (Simplified Chinese [[wikt:吴|吴]]), which is a common surname (family name) in [[Mainland China]]. Wú (吳) is the sixth name listed in the [[Song Dynasty]] [[Chinese classics|classic]] ''[[Hundred Family Surnames]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/gxrm/gx_bjx.htm |title=百家姓 |trans-title=Hundred Family Surnames |publisher=Guoxue |language=zh |accessdate=2014-01-16}}</ref> In 2019 Wu was the ninth most common surname in Mainland China.<ref>http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/20/676822.html</ref> A 2013 study found that it was the 8th most common surname, shared by 26,800,000 people or 2.000% of the population, with the province having the most being Guangdong.<ref>中国四百大姓, 袁义达, 邱家儒, Beijing Book Co.

The [[Cantonese]] and [[Hakka language|Hakka]] transliteration of 吳 is '''[[Ng (surname)|Ng]]''', a syllable made entirely of a [[nasal consonant]] while the [[Min Nan]] transliteration of 吳 is '''Ngo''', '''Ngoh''', '''Goh''', '''Go''', '''Gouw''', depending on the regional variations in Min Nan pronunciation. [[Shanghainese]] transliteration of 吳 is '''Woo'''.

吳 is also one of the most common surnames in Korea. It is spelled [[O (surname)|오]] in [[Hangul]] and romanized '''O''' by the three major romanization systems, but more commonly spelled '''Oh''' in South Korea. 
It is also related far back in Chinese history with the name "[[Zhou (surname)|Zhou (周)]]" and "[[Ji Clan|Ji (姬)]]". The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] equivalent of the surname is '''[[Ngô]]'''.

Several other, less common Chinese surnames  are also transliterated into English as "Wu", but with different [[Standard_Chinese_phonology#Tone|tones]]: 
[[wikt:武|武]] ''Wǔ'', 
[[wikt:伍|伍]] ''Wǔ'', 
[[wikt:仵|仵]] ''Wǔ'', 
[[wikt:烏|烏]]  ''Wū'' (also ''Wù''), 
[[wikt:鄔|鄔]] ''Wū''
and [[wikt:巫|巫]] ''Wū''.  
 
'''Wu''' (or '''Woo''' or '''Wou''') is also the [[Cantonese]] transliteration of the  Chinese surname 胡 (Mandarin ''[[Hu (surname)|Hu]]''), used in Hong Kong, and by overseas Chinese of Cantonese-speaking areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, and/or Hong Kong/Macau origin.

==History of the surname Wu (吳)==
The name originates from the ancient state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]] in present-day province of [[Jiangsu]].

In the 13th century BC, the state of Zhou (which will later become the [[Zhou Dynasty]]) was ruled by [[King Tai of Zhou|Tai Wang (King Tai of Zhou)]].  His surname was originally [[Ji (surname)|Ji (姬)]].  He had three sons: [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]], [[Zhongyong of Wu|Zhongyong]], and [[King Ji of Zhou|Jili]].  King Tai of Zhou favored the youngest son, Jili to inherit the reins of power, therefore Taibo and his brother Zhongyong voluntarily left Zhou with a group of followers and headed southeast where they established the state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=wu |title=Wu Family History|publisher=[[ancestry.com]]|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200506/21/eng20050621_191464.html |title=History of Chinese surname Wu|work=[[People's Daily]]|date=21 June 2005|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>  Taibo and Zhongyong's descendants eventually adopted Wu (吳) as their surname.  The state of Wu later became a powerful kingdom of its own with the help of Generals [[Wu Zixu]] and [[Sun Tzu]], the latter best known as the author of the military treatise [[The Art of War]], both serving under [[King Helü of Wu]].  King Helü is considered to be one of the [[Five Hegemons]] of China during the Spring and Autumn period.

Taibo and Zhongyong's youngest brother Jili stayed to rule the Zhou state and was the grandfather of [[King Wu of Zhou|Wu Wang (King Wu of Zhou)]] who started the [[Zhou Dynasty]] after successfully overthrowing the [[Shang Dynasty]].  The descendants of Wu Wang eventually changed their surname from Ji (姬) to [[Zhou (surname)|Zhou (周)]] during the [[Qin Dynasty]] to commemorate the merits and virtues of their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200506/17/eng20050617_190843.html |title=Chinese Zhou surname history|work=[[People's Daily]]|date=17 June 2005|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>

Therefore, the surnames Wu (吳), Zhou (周), and Ji (姬) are historically related.
