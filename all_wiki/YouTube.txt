'''YouTube''' is an American [[video hosting service|online video-sharing]] [[web platform|platform]] headquartered in [[San Bruno, California]]. Three former [[PayPal]] employees—[[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]], and [[Jawed Karim]]—created the service in February 2005. [[Google]] bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65&nbsp;billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]].

YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on [[video]]s, and [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|subscribe to other users]]. It offers a wide variety of [[user-generated content|user-generated]] and [[corporate media]] videos. Available content includes [[video clip]]s, [[TV show]] clips, [[music video]]s, [[short film|short]] and [[documentary film|documentary]] films, audio recordings, [[Trailer (promotion)|movie trailers]], [[live stream]]s, and other content such as [[video blog]]ging, short original videos, and [[edutainment|educational videos]]. 

Most of the content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but media corporations including [[CBS]], the [[BBC]], [[Vevo]], and [[Hulu]] offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can watch, but not upload, videos on the site, while registered users are permitted to [[upload]] an unlimited number of videos and add comments to videos. Age-restricted videos are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.

YouTube and selected creators earn advertising revenue from Google [[AdSense]], a program that targets ads according to site content and audience. The vast majority of its videos are free to view, but there are exceptions, including subscription-based premium channels, film rentals, as well as [[YouTube Music]] and [[YouTube Premium]], subscription services respectively offering premium and ad-free music streaming, and ad-free access to all content, including exclusive content commissioned from notable personalities. 

{{As of|2017|2}}, there were more than 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube each minute, and one billion hours of content being watched on YouTube every day. {{As of|2020|10}}, YouTube is the second-most popular website in the world, behind [[Google]], according to [[Alexa Internet]].<ref name=topsites>{{cite web | url=https://www.alexa.com/topsites | title=The top 500 sites on the web | publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]}}</ref>{{As of|2019|5}}, more than 500 hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube every minute.<ref name="500hrs">{{cite news |access-date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/07/number-hours-video-uploaded-to-youtube-per-minute/ |title=More Than 500 Hours Of Content Are Now Being Uploaded To YouTube Every Minute |work=[[TubeFilter]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=May 7, 2019 |author=Loke Hale, James}}</ref> Based on reported quarterly advertising revenue, YouTube is estimated to have {{USD|15 billion}} in annual revenues.

===Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)===
[[File:Youtube founders.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|From left to right: [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]] and [[Jawed Karim]], the founders of YouTube]]

YouTube was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]], and [[Jawed Karim]], who were all early employees of [[PayPal]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Jefferson |last=Graham |title=Video websites pop up, invite postings |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-11-21-video-websites_x.htm |website=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=November 21, 2005 |access-date=March 26, 2017}}</ref> Hurley had studied design at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], and Chen and Karim studied [[computer science]] together at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]].<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube: Sharing Digital Camera Videos |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126 |access-date=November 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111223210/http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126 |archive-date=January 11, 2009}}</ref>

Karim said the inspiration for YouTube first came from [[Janet Jackson]]'s role in 2004 [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl incident]] when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, which led to the idea of a video sharing site.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Hopkins |title=Surprise!

According to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible".<ref name="YouTube gurus">{{Cite magazine |first=John |last=Cloud |title=The YouTube Gurus |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570795,00.html |magazine=Time |date=December 25, 2006 |access-date=March 26, 2017}}</ref>

At the time of the official launch, YouTube did not have much market recognition. It was not the first video-sharing site on the Internet, as [[Vimeo]] was launched in November 2004, though that site remained a side project of its developers from [[CollegeHumor]] at the time and did not grow much either.<ref name="fortune vimeo">{{cite web | url = https://fortune.com/2011/02/23/how-vimeo-became-hipster-youtube/ | title = How Vimeo became hipster YouTube | first = John Patrick | last= Pullen | date = February 23, 2011 | access-date = May 8, 2020 | work = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] }}</ref> The week of YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ran a skit "[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]" by [[The Lonely Island]].

In June 2014, YouTube began to deploy support for [[high frame rate]] videos up to 60 [[frames per second]] (as opposed to 30 before), becoming available for user uploads in October.

YouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ), and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in the [[VP9]] format with stereo [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] audio; if VP9/WebM is not supported in the browser/device or the browser's user agent reports [[Windows XP]], then [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] video with stereo [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio is used instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/109102513 |title=Deploying VP9 at YouTube: a postmortem |author= Steven Robertson |date=October 16, 2014 |access-date=December 9, 2014}}</ref>

==== 2020 picture quality cut ====

On March 18, 2020, [[Thierry Breton]], a European commissioner in charge of digital policy of the [[European Union]] urged streaming services including YouTube to limit their services. The request came as a result of the prevention of Europe's broadband networks from crashing as tens of millions of people started [[telecommuting]], due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Europe]]. According to the EU, the streaming platforms should consider offering only standard definition, rather than high-definition, programs and users should be responsible for their data consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b4ab03db-de1f-4f98-bcc2-b09007427e1b|title= EU warns of broadband strain as millions work from home|work=[[Financial Times]]|location=San Francisco|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref> On March 20, YouTube responded by temporarily downgrading the videos in standard definition across the EU including the traffic in the UK as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/70333747-f180-4887-8a26-27ab6b230299|title=YouTube, Amazon and Netflix cut picture quality in Europe|work=Financial Times|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192384/youtube-video-quality-reduced-hd-broadband-europe-streaming|title=YouTube is reducing its default video quality to standard definition for the next month|first=Julia|last=Alexander|date=March 24, 2020|website=The Verge|access-date=October 20, 2020}}</ref>

==== Annotations ====
From 2008 to 2017, users could add "annotations" to their videos—such as pop-up text messages and hyperlinks. These functions were notably used as the basis for [[interactive video]]s, which used hyperlinks to other videos to achieve branching elements. In March 2017, it was announced that the annotations editor had been discontinued and the feature would be sunset because their use had fallen rapidly, users had found them to be an annoyance, and because they were incompatible with mobile versions of the service. Annotations were removed entirely from all videos on January 15, 2019. YouTube had introduced standardized [[Widget (GUI)|widgets]] intended to replace annotations in a cross-platform manner, including "end screens" (a customizable array of thumbnails for specified videos displayed near the end of the video) and "cards", but they are not backwards compatible with existing annotations, while the removal of annotations will also break all interactive experiences which depended on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-death-of-youtube-annotations/|title=The death of YouTube annotations marks an end for early interactive web video|last=Binder|first=Matt|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/youtube-launches-mobile-friendly-end-screens-feature-to-keep-viewers-watching-more-video/|title=YouTube launches mobile-friendly "End Screens" feature to keep viewers watching more video|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114581/youtube-annotations-discontinued-january-2019|title=YouTube annotations will disappear for good in January|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=November 27, 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/16/14953756/youtube-annotations-feature-discontinue-cards-end-screens|title=YouTube to discontinue video annotations because they never worked on mobile|last=Statt|first=Nick|date=March 16, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref>

In 2017, YouTube began to promote an alternative stereoscopic video format known as VR180, which is limited to a 180-degree field of view but is promoted as being easier to produce than 360-degree video and allowing more depth to be maintained by not subjecting the video to equirectangular projection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/06/youtubes-vr180-format-makes-vr-video-more-accessible/|title=YouTube's "VR180" format cuts down on VR video's prohibitive requirements|work=Ars Technica|access-date=September 26, 2017|language=en-us}}</ref>

Channels that the community tab becomes enabled for, get their channel discussions (the name before March 2013 “One channel layout” redesign finalization: “channel comments”) permanently erased, instead of co-existing or migrating.<ref name=community-help>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7124175?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop|title=Engage with creators on Community posts – Computer – YouTube Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>

===Content accessibility===
YouTube offers users the ability to view its videos on web pages outside their website. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of [[HTML]] that can be used to embed it on any page on the Web.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.athenswalk.net/_/Blog/Entries/2013/7/30_YouTube_embed_code_guide.html|title=YouTube embedded video guide}}</ref> This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in social networking pages and blogs. Users wishing to post a video discussing, inspired by, or related to another user's video can make a "video response". 

On August 27, 2013, YouTube announced that it would remove video responses for being an underused feature.<ref>{{cite web |title=So long, video responses ...

====Platforms====
Most modern [[smartphone]]s are capable of accessing YouTube videos, either within an application or through an optimized website. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] streaming for the video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Chitu |title=Mobile YouTube |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.no/2007/06/mobile-youtube.html |website=Unofficial Google Blog |date=June 15, 2007 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> 

Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products.

YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including [[Apple TV]], [[iPod Touch]] and the [[iPhone]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/20youtube.html |title=YouTube Live on Apple TV Today; Coming to iPhone on June 29 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |date=June 20, 2007 |access-date=January 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228063433/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/20youtube.html |archive-date=December 28, 2008 }}</ref>

In May 2014, before Music Key service was launched, the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were "undervalued" in comparison to other streaming services and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service. In a statement to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in June 2014, [[Robert Kyncl]] confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service "to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms." Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that "while we wish that we had [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience."<ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Popper |title=YouTube will block videos from artists who don't sign up for its paid streaming service |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/17/5817408/youtube-reportedly-block-videos-indie-artists |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 17, 2014 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=guardian-musicpass>{{cite news |title=YouTube subscription music licensing strikes wrong notes with indie labels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/22/indie-labels-youtube-subscription-music |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardian-stall>{{cite news |title=Talks with indie labels stall over YouTube music subscription service |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/23/talks-indie-labels-stall-youtube-music-subscription-service |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardian-indieblock>{{cite news |title=YouTube to block indie labels who don't sign up to new music service |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/youtube-indie-labels-music-subscription |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=June 17, 2014}}</ref> The ''Financial Times'' later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with [[Merlin Network]]—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service.

In August 2008, a US court ruled in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected [[fair use]] of the material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz from Gallitzin, Pennsylvania, who had made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s song "[[Let's Go Crazy]]", and posted the 29-second video on YouTube.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Bob |last=Egelko |title=Woman can sue over YouTube clip de-posting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/20/MNU412FKRL.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 20, 2008 |access-date=August 25, 2008}}</ref> In the case of ''[[Smith v.

In April 2012, a court in Hamburg ruled that YouTube could be held responsible for copyrighted material posted by its users. The performance rights organization [[GEMA (German organization)|GEMA]] argued that YouTube had not done enough to prevent the uploading of German copyrighted music. YouTube responded by stating:

====Content ID====
{{main|Content ID (algorithm)}}
In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright. Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]], which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Kevin J. |last=Delaney |title=YouTube to Test Software To Ease Licensing Fights |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118161295626932114.html |work=Wall Street Journal |date=June 12, 2007 |access-date=December 4, 2011}}</ref> The system, which was initially called "Video Identification"<ref>{{Citation|last=YouTube Advertisers|title=Video Identification|date=February 4, 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWizsV5Le7s|access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://youtube.googleblog.com/2010/12/content-id-turns-three.html|title=Content ID turns three|last=King|first=David|date=December 2, 2010|work=Official YouTube Blog|access-date=August 29, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> and later became known as Content ID,<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube Content ID |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g2U12SsRns |publisher=YouTube |access-date=May 25, 2015 |date=September 28, 2010}}</ref> creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database.

By 2010, YouTube had "already invested tens of millions of dollars in this technology".<ref name=":3" /> 

In 2011, YouTube described Content ID as "very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File".<ref name="youtube" /> 

By 2012, Content ID accounted for over a third of the monetized views on YouTube.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics Press Statistics] YouTube. Retrieved March 13, 2012.</ref>

An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was "surprisingly resilient" in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.<ref>{{cite web |title=Testing YouTube's Audio Content ID System |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/testing-youtubes-aud |date=April 23, 2009 |author=Von Lohmann, Fred |access-date=December 4, 2011}}</ref> The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to [[YouTube copyright issues|controversy]] in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use.<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube's January Fair Use Massacre |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/01/youtubes-january-fair-use-massacre |date=February 3, 2009 |author=Von Lohmann, Fred |access-date=December 4, 2011}}</ref> If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/t/contentid_dispute Content ID disputes] YouTube.

===Controversial videos===
{{See also|Criticism of Google#YouTube|Censorship by Google#YouTube}}
YouTube has also faced criticism over the handling of offensive content in some of its videos. The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's "Community Guidelines".<ref name="guidelines">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines |title=YouTube Community Guidelines |publisher=YouTube |access-date=November 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304150155/https://www.youtube.com/yt/policyandsafety/communityguidelines.html|archive-date=March 4, 2017}}{{better source|date=August 2019}}</ref> YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines.<ref name="guidelines" />

==== Advertiser mass boycott ====
In March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content. The government demanded assurances that its advertising would "be delivered safely and appropriately". ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S. brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content. Google stated that it had "begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear".<ref name="Bloomberg-adsextremist">{{cite web |title=Google Ad Crisis Spreads as Biggest Marketers Halt Spending |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-22/at-t-halts-spending-on-some-google-ads-after-youtube-controversy |website=Bloomberg |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref><ref name="bbc-youtubeadsuk">{{Cite news |title=YouTube: UK government suspends ads amid extremism concerns |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39301712 |newspaper=BBC News |access-date=March 23, 2017|date=March 17, 2017 }}</ref> In early April 2017, the YouTube channel [[h3h3Productions]] presented evidence claiming that a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing [[Johnny Rebel (singer)|Johnny Rebel]] music overlaid on a [[Chief Keef]] music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader.

==== Logan Paul corpse scandal ====
In January 2018, YouTube creator [[Logan Paul]] faced criticism for a video he had uploaded from a trip to Japan, where he encountered a body of a [[suicide]] death in the [[Aokigahara]] forest. The [[corpse]] was visible in the video, although its face was censored. The video proved controversial due to its content, with its handling of the subject matter being deemed insensitive by critics. On January 10—eleven days after the video was published—YouTube announced that it would cut Paul from the [[Google Preferred]] advertising program. Six days later, YouTube announced tighter thresholds for the partner program to "significantly improve our ability to identify creators who contribute positively to the community", under which channels must have at least 4,000 hours of watch time within the past 12 months and at least 1,000 subscribers. YouTube also announced that videos approved for the Google Preferred program would become subject to manual review and that videos would be rated based on suitability (with advertisers allowed to choose).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16899068/youtube-new-monetization-rules-announced-4000-hours|title=YouTube tightens rules around what channels can be monetized|work=The Verge|access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=YouTube Sets Stricter Requirements for Creator Partners in Response to Advertiser Concerns|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-changes-partner-program-google-preferred-advertisers-1202665815/|website=Variety|access-date=17 January 2018|date=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/latest/youtube-logan-paul-cut-ties-suicide-video-1202660515/|title=YouTube Cuts Logan Paul From Preferred Program Over Controversial Video|last=Brockington|first=Ariana|last2=Brockington|first2=Ariana|date=2018-01-11|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>

These changes led to further criticism of YouTube from independent channels, who alleged that the service had been changing its algorithms to give higher prominence to professionally produced content (such as celebrities, music videos, and clips from [[late night talk show]]s), that attract wide viewership and has a lower risk of alienating mainstream advertisers, at the expense of the creators that had bolstered the service's popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/04/05/youtube-creators-relationship-tense-san-bruno/486949002/|title=YouTube's relationship with creators, the source of so much success, has been turbulent|website=USA Today|language=en|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators|title=The golden age of YouTube is over|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2019-04-05|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>

Before 2019, YouTube has taken steps to remove specific videos or channels related to [[Supremacism|supremacist]] content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against [[hate speech]].<ref name="youtubeblog june2019" />

YouTube joined an initiative led by France and New Zealand with other countries and tech companies in May 2019 to develop tools to be used to block online hate speech and to develop regulations, to be implemented at the national level, to be levied against technology firms that failed to take steps to remove such speech, though the United States declined to participate.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/new-zealand-france-unveil-plans-to-tackle-online-extremism-without-us.html | title = New Zealand and France unveil plans to tackle online extremism without the US on board | first =Ryan | last = Browne | date = May 15, 2019 | access-date = April 9, 2020 | publisher = [[CNBC]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/jacinda-ardern-emmanuel-macron-christchurch-call-summit-extremist-violence-online | title = Leaders and tech firms pledge to tackle extremist violence online | first = Kim | last= Willsher | date = May 15, 2019 | access-date = April 9, 2020 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref> Subsequently, on June 5, 2019, YouTube announced a major change to its terms of service, "specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status."

Even for content that appears to be aimed at children and appears to contain only child-friendly content, YouTube's system allows for anonymity of who uploads these videos. These questions have been raised in the past, as YouTube has had to remove channels with children's content which, after becoming popular, then suddenly include inappropriate content masked as children's content.<ref name="wsj kids love"/> Alternative, some of the most-watched children's programming on YouTube comes from channels who have no identifiable owners, raising concerns of intent and purpose.

==== Sexualization of children ====
{{see also|Elsagate}}

Also in November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]]<ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/15/16656706/youtube-videos-children-comments YouTube videos of children are plagued by sexual comments], ''[[The Verge]]'', November 15, 2017</ref><ref name="habits">{{Cite news |last1=Mostrous |first1=Alexi |last2=Bridge |first2=Mark |last3=Gibbons |first3=Katie |title=YouTube adverts fund paedophile habits |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/youtube-adverts-fund-paedophile-habits-fdzfmqlr5 |newspaper=The Times |access-date=November 28, 2017 |date=November 24, 2017 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian.<ref name="habits" /> Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the [[dark web]], and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2016/04/why-youtube-mums-are-taking-their-kids-offline  |title = Why YouTube mums are taking their kids offline | first = Amelia | last = Tait | date = April 24, 2016 | access-date = June 21, 2019 | work = [[New Statesman]] }}</ref>

As a result of the controversy, which added to the concern about "Elsagate", several major advertisers whose ads had been running against such videos froze spending on YouTube.<ref name="forbes" /><ref>Todd Spangler, [https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/youtube-ad-boycott-pedophile-sexual-children-videos-1202622790/ YouTube Faces Advertiser Boycott Over Videos With Kids That Attracted Sexual Predators], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', November 25, 2017</ref> In December 2018, ''[[The Times]]'' found more than 100 grooming cases in which children were manipulated into sexually implicit behavior (such as taking off clothes, adopting sexualised poses and touching other children inappropriately) by strangers.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/paedophiles-grooming-children-live-on-youtube-3fv8gt730|title=Paedophiles grooming children live on YouTube|last=Bridge|first=Harry Shukman, Mark|date=2018-12-10|work=The Times|access-date=2019-02-18|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> After a reporter flagged the videos in question, half of them were removed, and the rest were removed after ''The Times'' contacted YouTube's PR department.<ref name=":5" />

In February 2019, YouTube vlogger Matt Watson identified a "wormhole" that would cause the YouTube recommendation algorithm to draw users into this type of video content, and make all of that user's recommended content feature only these types of videos. Most of these videos had comments from sexual predators commenting with timestamps of when the children were shown in compromising positions, or otherwise making indecent remarks. In some cases, other users had reuploaded the video in unlisted form but with incoming links from other videos, and then monetized these, propagating this network.<ref name="bloomberg mwatson"/> In the wake of the controversy, the service reported that they had deleted over 400 channels and tens of millions of comments, and reported the offending users to law enforcement and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]. A spokesperson explained that "any content—including comments—that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly."<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234494/youtube-child-exploitation-channel-termination-comments-philip-defranco-creators | title = YouTube terminates more than 400 channels following child exploitation controversy | first = Julia | last = Alexander | date = February 21, 2019 | access-date = February 21, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/02/youtube-loses-advertisers-over-wormhole-into-pedophilia-ring/|title=YouTube loses advertisers over "wormhole into pedophilia ring"|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=2019-02-21|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Despite these measures, [[AT&T]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Dr. Oetker]], [[Epic Games]], and [[Nestlé]] all pulled their advertising from YouTube.<ref name="bloomberg mwatson">{{cite web | url =https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-20/disney-pulls-youtube-ads-amid-concerns-over-child-video-voyeurs |title = Nestle, Disney Pull YouTube Ads, Joining Furor Over Child Videos |first1= Mark | last1= Bergen | first2= Gerrit | last2 = de Vynck | first3 = Christopher | last3 = Palmeri | date= February 20, 2019 | access-date = February 20, 2019 | work = [[Bloomberg News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/att-pulls-all-ads-from-youtube-pedophilia-controversy.html | title = As fallout over pedophilia content on YouTube continues, AT&T pulls all advertisements | first1= Todd | last1= Haselton | first2 = Sara | last2  =Salinas |date = February 21, 2019 | access-date= February 21, 2019 | work = [[CNBC]] }}</ref>

Subsequently, YouTube began to demonetize and block advertising on the types of videos that have drawn these predatory comments. The service explained that this was a temporary measure while they explore other methods to eliminate the problem.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/22/youtube-blocking-ads-on-videos-predatory-comments/ | title = YouTube is proactively blocking ads on videos prone to predatory comments | first = Nathan | last = Ingraham | date = February 22, 2019 | access-date = February 22, 2019 | work = [[Engadget]] }}</ref> YouTube also began to flag channels that predominantly feature children, and preemptively disable their comments sections. "Trusted partners" can request that comments be re-enabled, but the channel will then become responsible for moderating comments. These actions mainly target videos of toddlers, but videos of older children and teenagers may be protected as well if they contain actions that can be interpreted as sexual, such as gymnastics. YouTube stated it was also working on a better system to remove comments on other channels that matched the style of child predators.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47408969|title=YouTube bans comments on all videos of kids|last=Fox|first=Chris|date=2019-02-28|access-date=2019-03-02|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18244954/youtube-comments-minor-children-exploitation-monetization-creators | title = YouTube is disabling comments on almost all videos featuring children | first = Julia | last = Alexander | date = February 28, 2019 | access-date = February 28, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref>

A related attempt to algorithmically flag videos containing references to the string "CP" (an abbreviation of [[child pornography]]) resulted in a number of prominent false positives involving unrelated topics using the same abbreviation, including videos related to the mobile video game ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' (which uses "CP" as an abbreviation of the statistic "Combat Power"), and ''[[Club Penguin]]''. YouTube apologized for the errors, and reinstated the affected videos.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47278362| title = YouTube backtracks after Pokemon 'child abuse' ban | first = Tom | last =Gerken | date = February 19, 2019 | access-date = February 20, 2019 | work = [[BBC News]] }}</ref> Separately, online trolls have attempted to have videos flagged for takedown or removal by commenting with statements similar to what the child predators had said; this activity became an issue during the [[PewDiePie vs T-Series]] rivalry in early 2019. YouTube stated they do not take action on any video with these comments but those that they have flagged that are likely to draw child predator activity.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18241925/youtube-creator-comments-weaponized-trolling-child-exploitation-lies-controversy-lies | title = Trolls are lying about child porn to try to get YouTube channels taken down | first = Julia | last = Alexander | date = February 28, 2019 | access-date = February 28, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref>

In June 2019, ''The New York Times'' cited researchers who found that users who watched erotic videos could be recommended seemingly innocuous videos of children.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/americas/youtube-pedophiles.html | title = On YouTube's Digital Playground, an Open Gate for Pedophiles | first1 = Max | last1 = Fisher | first2 = Amanda | last2= Taub | date = June 3, 2019 | access-date = June 6, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> As a result, Senator [[Josh Hawley]] stated plans to introduce federal legislation that would ban YouTube and other video sharing sites from including videos that predominantly feature minors as "recommended" videos, excluding those that were "professionally produced", such as videos of televised talent shows.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/06/senator-youtube-bill-stop-featuring-minors-in-recommendations/ | title = A Senator wants to stop YouTube from recommending videos featuring minors | first = Nathan | last= Ingraham | date = June 6, 2019 | access-date = June 6, 2019 | work = [[Engadget]] }}</ref> YouTube has suggested potential plans to remove all videos featuring children from the main YouTube site and transferring them to the YouTube Kids site where they would have stronger controls over the recommendation system, as well as other major changes on the main YouTube site to the recommended feature and autoplay system.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-under-fire-considers-major-changes-to-kids-content-11560953721 | title = YouTube, Under Fire, Considers Major Changes to Kids' Content | first =Rob | last =Copeland | date = June 19, 2019 | access-date = June 19, 2019 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref>

=== COPPA settlement ===
{{see also|YouTube Kids}}
In April 2018, a coalition of 23 groups (including the CCFC, CDD, as well as [[Common Sense Media]]) filed a complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]], alleging that YouTube collected information from users under the age of 13 without parental consent, in violation of the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-children-data-illegal-tracks-ftc-1202747401/ |title=YouTube Illegally Tracks Data on Kids, Groups Claim in FTC Complaint |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=April 9, 2018 |work=Variety |access-date=April 27, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In September 2019, YouTube was fined $170&nbsp;million by the FTC for collecting personal information from minors under the age of 13 (in particular, viewing history) without parental consent, in order to allow channel operators to serve [[targeted advertising]] on their videos. In particular, the FTC ruled that YouTube was partly liable under COPPA, as the service's [[Content rating|rating]] and curation of content as being suitable for children constituted the targeting of the website towards children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190905/17343942934/ftcs-latest-fine-youtube-over-coppa-violations-shows-that-coppa-section-230-are-collision-course.shtml|title=FTC's Latest Fine Of YouTube Over COPPA Violations Shows That COPPA And Section 230 Are On A Collision Course |first=Masnick |last=Mike |website=Techdirt.|access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref> In order to comply with the settlement, YouTube was ordered to "develop, implement, and maintain a system for Channel Owners to designate whether their Content on the YouTube Service is directed to Children." YouTube also announced that it would invest $100&nbsp;million over the next three years to support the creation of "thoughtful, original children's content".<ref name="verge-coppafine">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848949/google-ftc-youtube-child-privacy-violations-fine-170-milliion-coppa-ads|title=Google will pay $170 million for YouTube's child privacy violations|last=Kelly|first=Makena|date=2019-09-04|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/tech/google-youtube-ftc-settlement/index.html|title=Google and FTC reach $170 million settlement over alleged YouTube violations of kids' privacy|last=Fung|first=Brian|website=[[CNN Business]]|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref>

YouTube began to implement its compliance approach in November 2019, in line with its settlement with the FTC. All channels must declare if their content is "made for kids", either as a blanket claim for their entire channel, or on a per-video basis. The company states that a video is considered "made for kids" if its primary audience is children, or is "directed" to children based on various factors as guidelines (even if they are not the primary audience), including use of child actors, "characters, celebrities, or toys that appeal to children", depictions of "activities that appeal to children, such as play-acting, simple songs or games, or early education", and poems, songs, and stories intended for children, among others. YouTube will employ [[machine learning]] to find videos that they believe are clearly "made for kids" and automatically mark them as such, but will not help or advise content creators for videos that fall into unclear categories, as this constitutes legal advice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9528076?hl=en|title=Determining if your content is made for kids|website=YouTube Help|publisher=Google Inc.|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref name="theverge"/><ref name="pcgamer coppa"/> In order to prevent data to be collected from minors without consent, videos marked as being "made for kids" were automatically reduced in functionality beginning on January 6, 2020. As a result, social and community features such as end screens and other widgets, notification functions, and comments are disabled, and videos can only be monetized with [[contextual advertising]] based on the video's metadata.<ref name="theverge">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules|title=YouTube's new kids' content system has creators scrambling|last=Kelly|first=Makena|date=2019-11-13|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref><ref name="verge-coppafine"/><ref name="pcgamer coppa">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/youtubes-ftc-compliance-system-for-kids-content-angers-and-worries-creators/ | title = YouTube's FTC compliance system for 'kids content' angers and worries creators | first = Tyler | last = Wilde | date = November 20, 2019 | access-date = November 20, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051465/youtube-coppa-children-content-gaming-toys-monetization-ads | title = YouTube officially rolls out changes to children's content following FTC settlement | first = Julia | last = Alexander | date = January 6, 2020 | access-date = January 6, 2020 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref> Further, liability for failing proper marking channels or videos as "made for kids" would fall onto the channel owners, with the FTC able to issue up to $42,000 fines per infringing video, though the FTC clarified that the amount would be based on "a company’s financial condition and the impact a penalty could have on its ability to stay in business".<ref name="variety coppa">{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/youtube-coppa-rules-children-videos-fines-1203413642/ | title = YouTube Creators Worried and Confused Over New Kid-Video COPPA Rules, Potential Fines| first= Todd | last = Spangler | date = November 22, 2019 | access-date = November 22, 2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>

The new policies have faced criticism, with some channel owners having considered YouTube and the FTC's guidance to be unclear in certain edge cases, such as video gaming (where content may typically be directed towards teens and young adults, but may still contain characters that appeal to children). They also noted that according to YouTube, a lack of targeted ads can reduce a video's revenue, and that the lack of social features may impact the ability for their videos to receive promotion.<ref name="theverge"/><ref name="pcgamer coppa"/> Videos marked as "made for kids" are also excluded from Google search engine results, further lowering revenue for content creators.<ref name="variety coppa"/> Content creators who were unsure of whether their content was "made for kids" argued they would either need to preemptively mark their videos as such or make their videos private, or otherwise would be at risk of being fined by the FTC.<ref name="theverge"/><ref name="pcgamer coppa"/>

The legal language of COPPA offered the ability for content to be marked for "mixed audience", which would allow for data collection from the viewers once the viewer had identified themselves of being 13 years or older. YouTube's decision not to include a "mixed audience" as a third option has been criticized, since this option would alleviate content creator concerns.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Silva |first1=Ken |title=Will COPPA kill online content for kids? |url=https://globaldatareview.com/data-privacy/will-coppa-kill-online-content-kids |access-date=25 January 2020 |work=Global Data Review |date=27 November 2019 |ref=GlobalDataReview}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/20/21025139/youtube-kids-coppa-law-ftc-2020 | title = The golden age of kids' YouTube is over.

FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter noted in dissenting remarks that many of the child-directed channels on YouTube were run by owners outside of the U.S., which may fall outside the jurisdiction of COPPA and the FTC's "practical reach".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1542971/slaughter_google_youtube_statement.pdf|title=Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter In the Matter of Google LLC and YouTube, LLC|last=Slaughter|first=Rebecca Kelly|date=September 4, 2019|access-date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> The FTC issued a blog post on November 22, 2019, to clarify what it considered "made for kids" and that several factors will be used to make this determination, and that it recognized that some types of content, like animated programming, can appeal to all ages and would not be immediately become subject to COPPA's requirements. The FTC also directed creators to its original complaint against YouTube, identifying channels and video content that they considered to be under COPPA that was the basis of their case.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/11/youtube-channel-owners-your-content-directed-children | title = YouTube channel owners: Is your content directed to children? | first = Kristin | last = Cohen |date = November 22, 2019 | access-date = November 23, 2019 | publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]] }}</ref>

Most videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the [[Troll (Internet)|negative]] aspects of both their form and content.

On November 6, 2013, Google implemented a comment system oriented on Google+ that required all YouTube users to use a Google+ account in order to comment on videos. The stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments, thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/youtube-comments-trolls-moderation-google "YouTube aims to tame the trolls with changes to its comments section"], Stuart Dredge, ''The Guardian'', November 7, 2013.

{{quote|Perhaps user complaints are justified, but the idea of revamping the old system isn't so bad.

Think of the crude, misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on YouTube without any discernible moderation. Isn't any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot? The system is far from perfect, but Google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate YouTubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity.}}

On July 27, 2015, Google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a Google+ account to post comments to YouTube.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33687110 |title=Google unlinking Google+ from YouTube |work=BBC News |location=London |date=July 28, 2015 |access-date=July 29, 2015}}</ref>

On November 3, 2016, YouTube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve, hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an [[algorithm]] that detects potentially offensive comments.<ref>{{cite web |first=Joan |last=E. Solsman |title=YouTube helps creators blast trolls from comments |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-comments-new-tools-algorithmic-pinned-hearts-usernames/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=November 3, 2016 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> Creators may also choose to keep or delete comments with links or hashtags in order to combat spam.

In May 2020, it was noted that comments in videos and live streams containing the mandarin phrases "[[wikt:共匪|共匪]]" (“communist bandit”) or "[[wikt:五毛|五毛]]" (“50-cent party”) were automatically deleted within 15 seconds.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vincent |first1=James |title=YouTube is deleting comments with two phrases that insult China’s Communist Party |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270290/youtube-deleting-comments-censorship-chinese-communist-party-ccp |access-date=26 May 2020 |work=The Verge |date=26 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Flood |first1=Brian |title=YouTube investigating 'error' that deleted comments offensive to China's Communist Party |url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/youtube-china-error-communist-party |access-date=26 May 2020 |work=Fox News |date=26 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=YouTube Is Removing Chinese Phrases Critical of China's Communist Party |url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtube-is-removing-chinese-phrases-critical-of-chinas-communist-party |work=PCMAG |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rep.

===View counts===
In December 2012, two billion views were removed from the view counts of Universal and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] music videos on YouTube, prompting a claim by ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site's terms of service, which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts. This was disputed by ''Billboard'', which said that the two billion views had been moved to Vevo, since the videos were no longer active on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/youtube-universal-sony-fake-views-black-hat/ |title=YouTube strips Universal and Sony of 2&nbsp;billion fake views |work=[[The Daily Dot]] |date=December 21, 2012 |access-date=January 10, 2014 |first=Chase |last=Hoffberger |publisher=[[Complex Media, Inc.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/28/youtube-video-views-disappear-migrate |title=Two billion YouTube music video views disappear ... or just migrate? |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 28, 2012 |access-date=January 10, 2014 |first=Dan |last=Sabbagh |author-link=Dan Sabbagh |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}</ref> On August 5, 2015, YouTube patched the formerly notorious behaviour which caused a video's view count to freeze at "301" (later "301+") until the actual count was verified to prevent [[Click fraud|view count fraud]].<ref name=numberphile>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIkhgagvrjI |title=Why do YouTube views freeze at 301? |work=[[Numberphile]] |last=Haran |first=Brady |author-link=Brady Haran |date=June 22, 2012 |access-date=August 30, 2018 |via=YouTube}}</ref> YouTube view counts once again updated in real time.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Benjamin |last=Snyder |title=YouTube Finally Fixed This Annoying Feature |url=http://time.com/3987570/youtube-301-views/ |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 6, 2015 |access-date=March 26, 2017 }}</ref>

=== Other algorithm design or implementation issues ===
In 2018, YouTube introduced a system that would automatically add information boxes to videos that its algorithms determined may present conspiracy theories and other [[fake news]], filling the infobox with content from [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] and [[Wikipedia]] as a means to inform users to minimize misinformation propagation without impacting freedom of speech.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17117344/youtube-information-cues-conspiracy-theories-susan-wojcicki-sxsw | title = YouTube will add information from Wikipedia to videos about conspiracies | first = Casey | last= Newton | date = March 13, 2018 | access-date = April 15, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref> In the wake of the [[Notre-Dame de Paris fire]] on April 15, 2019, several user-uploaded videos of the landmark fire were flagged by YouTube' system automatically with an [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] article on the false conspiracy theories around the [[September 11 attacks]]. Several users complained to YouTube about this inappropriate connection. YouTube officials apologized for this, stating that their algorithms had misidentified the fire videos and added the information block automatically, and were taking steps to remedy this.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-15/youtube-flags-notre-dame-fire-as-9-11-conspiracy-in-wrong-call?srnd=technology-vp | title = YouTube Flags Notre-Dame Fire as 9/11 Conspiracy, Says System Made 'Wrong Call' | first = Mark | last =Bergen | date = April 15, 2019 | access-date = April 15, 2019 | work = [[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}</ref>

Five leading content creators whose channels were based on [[LGBTQ+]] materials filed a federal lawsuit against YouTube in August 2019, alleging that YouTube's algorithms diverts discovery away from their channels, impacting their revenue. The plaintiffs claimed that the algorithms discourage content with words like "lesbian" or "gay", which would be predominant in their channels' content, and because of YouTube's near-monopolization of online video services, they are abusing that position.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/14/youtube-discriminates-against-lgbt-content-by-unfairly-culling-it-suit-alleges/ | title = YouTube discriminates against LGBT content by unfairly culling it, suit alleges | first1 = Greg | last1= Bensinger | first2 = Reed | last2 = Albergotti | date = August 14, 2019 | access-date = August 14, 2019 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>

=== Content moderation ===
YouTube contracts companies to hire content moderators, who view content flagged as potentially violating YouTube's content policies and determines if they should be removed. In September 2020, a class-action suit was filed by a former content moderator who reported developing [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) after an 18-month period on the job. The former content moderator said that she was regularly made to exceed YouTube's stated limited of four hours per day of viewing graphic content. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube's contractors gave little to no training or support for its moderator's mental health, made prospective employees sign NDAs before showing them any examples of content they would see while reviewing, and censored all mention of trauma from its internal forums. It also purports that requests for extremely graphic content to be blurred, reduced in size or made monochrome, per recommendations from the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]], were rejected by YouTube as not a high priority for the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/youtube-moderator-sues-over-ptsd-symptoms-lack-of-work-1845143110|title=Content Moderator Exposed to Child Assault and Animal Torture Sues YouTube|work=Gizmodo|last=Kimball|first=Whitney|date=September 22, 2020|access-date=October 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450477/youtube-content-moderator-sues-lawsuit-ptsd-graphic-content-exposure|title=Former YouTube content moderator sues the company after developing symptoms of PTSD|work=The Verge|last=Vincent|first=James|date=September 22, 2020|access-date=October 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/former-youtube-content-moderator-describes-horrors-of-the-job-in-lawsuit.html|title=Former YouTube content moderator describes horrors of the job in new lawsuit|publisher=CNBC|last=Elias|first=Jennifer|date=September 22, 2020|access-date=October 11, 2020}}</ref>

=== Addy A-Game and Street Attraction channels design ===
In October 2019, YouTube deactivated two channels run by "pick-up artists" after a BBC investigation into the online industry. The company added: "YouTube strictly prohibits explicit sexual, graphic or harassing content. Nothing is more important than protecting the safety of our community, and we will continue to review and refine our policies in this area."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-49957059|title=YouTube terminates 'pick-up artists' channels|date=2019-10-07|access-date=2019-10-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>
