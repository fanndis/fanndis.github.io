The '''Order of the Sun of Peru''' (Spanish: ''Orden El Sol del Perú''), formerly known as the '''Order of the Sun''', is the highest award bestowed by the nation of [[Peru]] to commend notable civil and military merit. The award is the oldest civilian award in the [[Americas]], first being established in 1821.

==History==
The Order was originally instituted on 8 October 1821 by [[General José de San Martín]] upon reaching [[Lima]], to recognize those who had distinguished themselves in the campaign against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Royalists]]. The three classes of appointment to the Order were, in descending order of precedence: Founder, Meritorious and Associate.

It was discontinued four years later, after many grantees started to use the award as a [[nobility]] title, similar to the earlier Castile titles awarded by the colonial government. The Congress issued a law abolishing the Order of the Sun on May 9, 1825.

In 1921, the Order was re-established to commemorate the Centennial of Peruvian Independence.

==Classes==
The award consists of the following classes:

*Grand Cross with diamonds
*Grand Cross
*Grand Officer
*Commander
*Officer
*Knight
