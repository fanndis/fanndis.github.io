The '''100-Hour Plan''' was a [[United States]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] political strategy detailing the actions the party pursued upon assuming leadership of the [[110th Congress]] on January 4, 2007. The strategy was announced before the [[2006 midterm elections]]. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] pledged that her party would continue to pursue these goals upon her assumption of leadership.<ref name="2006 Swamp">{{cite news

This period began on the Tuesday (January 9, 2007) after the swearing-in ceremony on January 4. After it passes the House, most legislation still has to pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and receive the [[President of the United States|President's]] signature (or override his veto) to become law.  The elements of the first day's proposals are House rules and therefore do not require any action from the Senate or President.

By January 18, 2007, 87 business hours after the swearing-in, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] had passed every one of the plan's measures in the form that they had been submitted to Congress.<ref>{{cite news

== Origin ==
The origin for the name of the plan is a play-on-words from former Democratic [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]] who promised quick action on the part of government (to combat the [[Great Depression]]) during his [[New Deal#The First 100 Days (1933)|"first hundred days"]] in office. One hundred hours was also the amount of legislative time available to Congress prior to the President's [[2007 State of the Union address]] on Tuesday, January 23.

The plan was promised by Democrats in the days leading up to the [[2006 midterm elections]] in the United States, in which the Democratic Party won control of both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] (in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] by a margin of 233–202 and in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a margin of 51-49—both independent Senators caucus with the 49 Democrats) after twelve years of [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] control (January 1995 to January 2007).  Twelve years earlier, in January 1995, the Republicans had articulated their own legislative plan which they called ''[[Contract with America|The Contract with America]]''.

==Divergence from 9/11 Commission's recommendations==

House Democratic leaders included all but one of the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission in H.R. 1. In particular, the reorganization of Congressional committees with responsibility for funding and oversight of the nation's intelligence agencies was rejected by Democratic leaders as early as November 2006, immediately after the election.<ref name="huh100"/> The Commission also suggested removing term limits in favor of expertise and continuity, but Pelosi explicitly rejected this proposal, invoking terms limits when blocking [[Jane Harman]] from serving as chair of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence Committee]].<ref name="Weisman"/>

== Political responses ==
The plan drew both praise and criticism. One of the 100-Hour Plan's greatest opponents was the preceding Republican House Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]], who said of Speaker Pelosi's intended changes that, "By repealing President Bush's tax relief, she would devastate economic prosperity for Americans and burden taxpayers at all levels."<ref name="Tax policy">{{cite web

The plan was also criticized as being unrealistic, "because the [[United States Senate|Senate's]] rules give the minority party more power than the [[United States House|House]] does to slow down legislation, it could be weeks or months before final action on some of the House's proposed measures takes place."<ref name="3 prong plan"/>
