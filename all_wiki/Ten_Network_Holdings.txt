===Establishment and relationship with The Ten Group===
Ten Network Holdings (TNH) was established in 1998. It allowed shareholders to invest in The Ten Group Pty Limited, the owner of the Ten television network. TNH had a 78.29% shareholding in The Ten Group, representing a 39.14% economic interest in the Group. Canadian media company [[CanWest]] had a 57.5% economic interest in The Ten Group and was the Group's other major owner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten Network Holdings Limited 1998 Annual Report|url=http://tencorporate.com.au/library/documents/TEN_annual_98.pdf|publisher=Ten Network Holdings|accessdate=13 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013141015/http://tencorporate.com.au/library/documents/TEN_annual_98.pdf|archivedate=13 October 2009|pages=2–5|date=1998}}</ref> In June 2007, CanWest decided to convert its stake in The Ten Group into shares in Ten Network Holdings, giving it a 56% shareholding in TNH.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Alberici|first1=Emma|title=CanWest takes control of Ten|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s1956136.htm|accessdate=15 May 2018|work=PM|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=19 June 2007}}</ref> This saw TNH take 99% ownership of The Ten Group and become the central company in Ten's corporate structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Review 2007|url=http://tencorporate.com.au/library/documents/TEN%20AR%20FINAL%202007.pdf|publisher=Ten Network Holdings|accessdate=16 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219105744/http://tencorporate.com.au/library/documents/TEN%20AR%20FINAL%202007.pdf|archivedate=19 February 2011|pages=21–29|date=2007}}</ref> In February 2008, the other shareholders in The Ten Group exchanged their shares in that company for shares in TNH, giving TNH 100% ownership of The Ten Group.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Review 2008|url=http://www.tencorporate.com.au/library/documents/6102%20TEN%20AR%202008.pdf|publisher=Ten Network Holdings|accessdate=16 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321054504/http://www.tencorporate.com.au/library/documents/6102%20TEN%20AR%202008.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2012|page=26|date=2008}}</ref>

===CanWest Sale===
On 24 September 2009, CanWest announced that it was selling its 50.1% stake in Ten Network Holdings for A$680 million (following the 2006 concentration/restriction on Australian media ownership),<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/canwest-sells-ten-network-stake-for-680m/story-e6frg996-1225779014607 | title=CanWest sells Ten Network stake for $680m | date=24 September 2009 | newspaper=The Australian | accessdate=2 August 2015 }}</ref> in order to pay down its significant debt, although it was not enough to save the former parent, which went out of business the next year.

===James Packer share purchase===
During October 2010, [[James Packer]], (through his private for Consolidated Press Holdings) bought 17.88% of shares in Ten Network Holdings.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper =  [[The Wall Street Journal]]  | title =Business: Media & Marketing: Australian Billionaire Packer Buys Ten Network Stake | first = Enda | last = Curran |first2 = Cynthia |last2 =Koons | date = 20 October 2010 | accessdate = 21 October 2010 | url = https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101020-702985.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines}}</ref> Half of this was then bought from Packer by [[Lachlan Murdoch]]; the two are listed as joint owners of 17.88% of the company<ref>{{cite web|last=AAP, REUTERS, Business Day|title=Packer off Ten board as shake-up continues|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/packer-off-ten-board-as-shakeup-continues-20110302-1bdxs.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairax|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

On 26 November mining magnate and Australia's wealthiest woman, [[Gina Rinehart]] was appointed a position of the board after purchasing 10% of the company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Janda|first=Michael|title=Ten CEO sacked, Lachlan Murdoch steps in|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-23/ten-ceo-sacked-lachlan-murdoch-steps-in/1954474?section=justin|work=ABC News Online|publisher=ABC|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>

Speculation surrounds the future of the Packer investment as upcoming changes to sport broadcast regulation and Ten's low share price in a slowly resurgent market are seen as possible drivers for the current stake.

On 23 February 2011, the board of Ten Network Holdings terminated the contract of CEO Grant Blackley. Lachlan Murdoch was appointed acting CEO.<ref>Janda, Michael: [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/23/3146785.htm?section=justin Lachlan Murdoch appointed acting Ten CEO], ''ABC News'', 23 February 2011.</ref> In February 2012, Murdoch was appointed Chairman by the board, replacing Brian Long who became Deputy Chairman, with [[James Warburton (Australian businessman)|James Warburton]] as the company's CEO.<ref>[http://www.tencorporate.com.au/lib/pdf/2012/mf547.pdf Ten Appoints New Chairman], Ten Network Holdings, 10 February 2012.</ref>

On 26 March 2014 Hamish McLennan was appointed Executive Chairman after becoming Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the Company in March 2013 replacing James Warburton. Lachlan Murdoch retired as Chairman and a Director to join [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]] and [[21st Century Fox]] as Non-Executive Co-Chairman.<ref>[http://www.tencorporate.com.au/files/Changes_to_TEN_Board_of_Directors.pdf Changes to TEN's Board of Directors], Ten Network Holdings, 26 March 2014.</ref>

On 27 July 2015, Paul Anderson was appointed Chief Executive Officer, and Non-Executive Director David Gordon was appointed Chairman after Hamish McLennan stepped down from both roles.<ref>[http://images.tenplay.com.au/~/media/Corporate%20Site%20Media/Files/Media%20Releases/2015/Ten%20Network%20Board%20And%20Senior%20Management%20Changes.pdf Ten Network Board And Senior Management Changes.], Ten Network Holdings, 27 July 2015.</ref>

On 11 March 2020, Paul Anderson stepped down from his position and he was not directly replaced with Beverley McGarvey promoted to become Chief Content Officer and Executive Vice President across Ten and ViacomCBS Australia & NZ.<ref>[https://network10.com.au/news-and-insights/viacomcbs-confirms-resignation-of-paul-anderson-as-head-of-combined-operations-in-australia-new-zealand/ ViacomCBS confirms resignation of Paul Anderson as Head of Combined Operations in Australia & New Zealand], ViacomCBS Networks International, 11 March 2020.</ref>

===Foxtel takeover bid===
In 2014, [[News Corp Australia|News Corp]]/[[Telstra]]-owned [[Foxtel]] and U.S. cable company [[Discovery Communications]] made a joint-venture to take a bid on Ten. Other U.S.-based companies and investment firms, such as Anchorage Capital Group and [[Saban Capital Group]], were also on the bidding list. However, this was opposed by [[WIN Corporation]] owner and Ten shareholder [[Bruce Gordon (businessman)|Bruce Gordon]] stating that Ten would remain in the Australian hands.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/discovery-foxtel-takeover-australias-ten-764864 Discovery, Foxtel Takeover of Australia's Ten Network Opposed by Major Shareholder]. [[The Hollywood Reporter]]. Retrieved 07-04-2015.</ref>

On 15 June 2015, Foxtel officially agreed to buyout 15% shares in Ten Network Holdings, pending the approval from the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]. Prior to the acquisition, Discovery backed out from bidding partnership with Foxtel.

There were numerous reports stated that Foxtel will push-through the 15% acquisition of Ten once the Australian government will abolish the restriction on cross-media ownership.

===2017 financial turmoil===
Announcing an AU$232 million half-year loss in 2017, Ten Network Holdings warned that there was "significant doubt on the group's ability to continue" and their future hinged on an extension or renewal of an AU$200 million debt guarantee by three of its largest shareholders Lachlan Murdoch, Bruce Gordon and James Packer which expires on 23 December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-27/ten-network-struggles-to-survive-after-another-big-loss/8475774|title=Ten Network casts 'significant doubt' on its viability after announcing $232m first-half loss|date=27 April 2017|first=Peter|last=Ryan|accessdate=18 May 2017|work=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ten-network-results-idUSL4N1HY70O?feedType=RSS&virtualBrandChannel=11563|title=UPDATE 2-Fate of Australian TV network Ten in hands of billionaire trio|date=27 April 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=18 May 2017|first=Jamie|last=Freed}}</ref> In June 2017, Murdoch, Gordon and Packer withdrew support for a $250 million guaranteed loan that would remedy the expiring $200 million debt guarantee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/network-tens-future-in-doubt-as-billionaire-backers-murdoch-and-gordon-pull-their-support/news-story/a32e1586eab032479eddff2a2782afbe |title=Network Ten's future in doubt as billionaire backers Murdoch and Gordon pull their support |date=13 June 2017 |publisher=Herald Sun |accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mason |first=Max |date=11 June 2017 |title=Ten's billionaire shareholders back away from loan guarantee |url=http://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/tv/tens-billionaire-shareholders-back-away-from-loan-guarantee-20170611-gwp0ro |work=The Australian Financial Review |location=Sydney |accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> In response, Ten requested its shares on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] be placed in a 48-hour [[trading halt]] while it assessed its options concerning receivership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-13/ten-network-fails-to-find-a-financial-backer/8612656 |title=Ten Network in trading halt and facing receivership after failing to secure financial backer |last=Letts |first=Stephen |date=13 June 2017 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skynews.com.au/business/business/company/2017/06/13/network-ten-places-shares-in-trading-halt.html |title=Network Ten places shares in trading halt |date=13 June 2017 |publisher=Sky News Australia |accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> On 14 June, Ten went into voluntary administration.<ref>{{cite news |last=Danckert |first=Sarah |date=14 June 2017 |title=Network Ten heads into voluntary administration |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/network-ten-heads-into-voluntary-administration-20170614-gwqo47.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney |access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pash |first=Chris |date=14 June 2017 |title=The Ten network is in administration |url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-ten-network-is-in-administration-2017-6 |work=Business Insider Australia |location=Sydney |access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Purchase by CBS ===
Upon the news of receivership, Ten's largest shareholders (Murdoch and Gordon) attempted to merge their assets to save Network 10. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission even stated that they will not oppose the said merger bid, which would saw both shareholders enjoying a 50% stake in the network.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-24/ten-takeover-by-murdoch-gordon-gets-accc-green-light/8837964|title=No problem with Murdoch-Gordon Ten takeover, says ACCC|last=Janda|first=Michael|date=24 August 2017|work=ABC News|access-date=28 August 2017|last2=Chau|first2=David|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-05/accc-confirms-network-ten-joint-bid-by-gordon-and-murdoch/8680160|title=Murdoch and Gordon launch takeover bid for Network Ten|last=Chau|first=David|date=5 July 2017|work=ABC News|access-date=28 August 2017|language=en-AU}}</ref>

However, on 28 August 2017, Ten's administrators announced that US media company [[CBS Corporation]] (which has a 33% share in channel Eleven) had entered into a binding agreement to purchase the company for $123 million, subject to approval of the [[Foreign Investment Review Board]]. CBS refinanced Ten's existing debt including guarantor fees to billionaire shareholders James Packer, Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon, and existing loans from the Commonwealth Bank. As a result, once the deal is approved, CBS will take over in full with current shareholders losing their shares and its value.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/us-company-cbs-to-buy-ten-network-20170827-gy5doc.html|title=US broadcaster CBS to buy Ten Network|last=Battersby|first=Lucy|date=28 August 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=28 August 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/cbs-won-because-network-ten-employees-didnt-want-lachlan-murdoch-to-come-back-20170919-gykjmk.html|title=CBS won because Network Ten employees didn't want Lachlan Murdoch to come back|last1=Kruger|first1=Colin|date=20 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref>

Gordon and Murdoch, whose joint bid for the company has not been accepted, went to the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] in an effort to delay CBS's takeover of Ten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/disappointed-underbidders-lachlan-murdoch-and-bruce-gordon-should-not-be-able-to-stall-ten-deal-court-hears-20170907-gychte|title=Billionaire Ten backer Bruce Gordon wins first round in challenge to CBS takeover|last=Whitbourn|first=Michaela|date=7 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US}}</ref> This delayed the administrator's meeting with creditors until 12 September.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tvtonight.com.au/2017/09/administrators-delay-ten-creditors-meeting.html|title=Administrators delay TEN creditors meeting|last=Knox|first=David|date=7 September 2017|work=TV Tonight|language=en-AU}}</ref> At the meeting, creditors overwhelmingly voted in support of CBS' bid, citing concerns over Murdoch's management of Ten over the past years and talk of mass job cuts in the news department under Murdoch ownership.

On 31 October 2018, the network unveiled a new logo, replacing the "ten" wordmark used since 1991 with a stylised circle 10, and the network now referred to in text as "Network 10". The new brand is used across all of Network 10's platforms and services, and was intended to reflect the broadcaster's positioning as an "adventurous alternative" with a "sense of fun". 10 also relaunched its multichannels Eleven and One as [[10 Peach]] and 10 Boss (now [[10 Bold]]), with Bold focusing on dramatic programming and targeting an older adult audience, and Peach continuing to be targeted towards young adults.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bandt.com.au/marketing/network-ten-rebrands-network-10-new-look-logo|title=Network Ten Rebrands As 'Network 10' With New-Look Logo|date=31 October 2018|work=B&T|accessdate=31 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/network-ten-in-2019-what-s-new-what-s-returning-what-s-gone-20181029-p50cp3.html|title=Network Ten in 2019: What’s new, what’s returning, what’s gone?|last=Lallo|first=Michael|date=31 October 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=31 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/ten-reveals-first-major-rebrand-in-27-years-peach-boss-and-10-news-first-549558|title=Ten reveals first major rebrand in 27 years: Peach, Boss and 10 News First|date=31 October 2018|work=Mumbrella|accessdate=31 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mediaweek.com.au/10-upfront-behind-the-rebrand/|title=10 Upfront: Behind the rebrand of Boss, Peach, News and 10 Play|website=Mediaweek|accessdate=31 October 2018}}</ref> In December 2018, the network launched [[Network 10#10 All Access|10 All Access]], a localised version of the American streaming service [[CBS All Access]] with a selection of ad-free programming from both [[CBS]] and Network 10.

===CBS merger with Viacom===
In December 2019, parent company CBS Corporation [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|re-merged]] with [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]], forming [[ViacomCBS]] and making Network 10 a sister to Viacom channels in Australia ([[MTV Australia|MTV]], [[Nickelodeon Australia|Nickelodeon]] etc.) as well as international networks such as [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>https://www.bandt.com.au/viacom-cbs-remerge-13-year-hiatus/</ref>
