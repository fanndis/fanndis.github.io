'''Timothy Stephen Kenneth Yeo''' (born 20 March 1945) is a British politician. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he was the [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the constituency of [[South Suffolk (UK Parliament constituency)|South Suffolk]] between the [[1983 United Kingdom general election]] and that of [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], when he was deselected by his constituency party.

Yeo served as the Minister for the Environment and Countryside from 1993 to 1994 in the government of Prime Minister [[John Major]]. He also served in the [[Shadow Cabinet]] from 1998 to 2005 under Conservative Party leaders [[William Hague]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Michael Howard]].

==Early life==
Yeo was educated at [[Charterhouse School]], before going on to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] where he read History and graduated in 1968. At university he "did no work, got a poor degree and adored it".<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview by Alice Thomson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1446501/Im-stronger-and-possibly-nicer.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 November 2003}}</ref>

From 1970–73, Yeo was Assistant Treasurer of [[Bankers Trust]] Company. Then, from 1975–86, he was a Director of Worcester Engineering Company. From 1980–83, he was Chief Executive of the Spastics Society (now known as [[Scope (British charity)|Scope]]).

The [[Tadworth#The Children.27s Trust|Tadworth Court Children's Hospital]] was founded in 1984 under his chairmanship after [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] had decided to relinquish the building in 1982. He resigned in the early nineties because of his parliamentary workload and was succeeded by [[Archie Norman (businessman)|Archie Norman]].<ref>Andrew Ross, [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] Magazine (2012–2013), pp 83–86</ref>

==Political career==
Yeo contested [[Bedwellty (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedwellty]] in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] before being elected as MP for [[South Suffolk (UK Parliament constituency)|South Suffolk]] in 1983, replacing [[Sudbury & Woodbridge]] MP [[Keith Stainton]] who he defeated in the selection contest for South Suffolk.<ref>[http://barneshistorian.com/vm-stainton.php], 31 December 2008</ref>

===In government===
In 1988, he became the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Home Secretary]], [[Douglas Hurd]] and in 1990 was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary for Housing and Planning. After the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] Yeo became Parliamentary Under Secretary for Health.

In 1993, Yeo was appointed Minister for the Environment and Countryside in [[Second Major ministry|John Major's government]], but was forced to resign after a scandal involving his so-called "love child" with a Conservative councillor, Julia Stent, who was born on 8 July 1993.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/226643.stm A history of Christmas scandal past], BBC, 22 December 1998</ref> Three years earlier, Yeo had said to the branch of [[Relate]] in his constituency, "It is in everyone's interests to reduce broken families and the number of single parents. I have seen from my own constituency the consequences of marital breakdown."<ref>''The Guardian'', 27 December 1993</ref> The story broke on [[Boxing Day]] during a quiet news period and intense coverage was given to the scandal. Yeo resigned on 5 January 1994; he was the first ministerial casualty of the media reaction to John Major's [[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]] campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-yeo-resignation-minister-falls-foul-of-back-to-basics-policy-swift-demise-after-constituency-1398284.html |title=The Yeo Resignation: Minister falls foul of 'back to basics' policy: Swift demise after constituency association released statement |work=The Independent |date=5 January 1994 |first=Patricia |last=Wynn Davies}}</ref>

===In opposition===
After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the party's new leader [[William Hague]] appointed Yeo as a spokesman on the Environment, Transport and the Regions. He was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister of Agriculture in 1998. In 2001, he played a leading role in exposing the Government's mishandling of the Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/key_people/newsid_1179000/1179347.stm "Tim Yeo: Shadow agriculture minister"], BBC News, 10 May 2001.</ref>

Yeo was a member of [[Iain Duncan Smith]]'s Shadow Cabinet as Shadow [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]. In 2003, Yeo was made Shadow Secretary for Education and Health by the party's new leader, [[Michael Howard]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3255441.stm |work=BBC News | title=Howard unveils his top team | date=10 November 2003}}</ref> with responsibility for the party's policy on both schools and hospitals. In 2004, Howard made Yeo the Shadow Secretary for the Environment and Transport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/parliament/0,,-5714,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513095336/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/parliament/0,,-5714,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-13|title=Ask Aristotle|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

Yeo resigned from the shadow cabinet shortly after the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], saying he wished to be free to play a role in rethinking the Conservative Party's future. On 27 August, he ruled himself out of the ensuing party leadership election following Howard's resignation, announcing his backing for former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Kenneth Clarke]]. The contest was won by the then-Shadow [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]], [[David Cameron]].

===Committee Chair===
As Chair of the [[Energy and Climate Change Select Committee]], Yeo was an influential voice on energy policy. Despite his committee releasing a report sceptical of [[hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom]], Yeo revised his personal opinion and supported the use of the technique in the UK. In 2012, he announced that he supported the proposal for a third runway at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], and that his long-held "environmental objections" to expansion were "disappearing".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19394340 | work=BBC News | title=Heathrow third runway not right for UK, says Greening | date=29 August 2012}}</ref> In 2013, he stated that the government reaching an agreement over nuclear power expansion was a "matter of great urgency", and warned that Britain could run out of energy if negotiations were not concluded quickly.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/utilities/article3679253.ece |title=Pay up for nuclear or Britain could run out of energy, families are warned |work=[[The Times]] |date=6 February 2013 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

On 9 June 2013, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' alleged, citing video evidence of a conversation with the MP, that he had helped "coach" a solar energy company executive for an appearance before his parliamentary committee; the parent company pays Yeo. The MP referred himself to the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]], and said that he intended to fight the claims made against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22830707 |title=Tim Yeo rejects committee coaching claim |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=9 June 2013 }}</ref> On 24 November 2015, he lost his [[libel]] action against the newspaper in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], with judge [[Mark Warby|Mr Justice Warby]] saying that the newspaper's reporting was "substantially true" and describing Mr Yeo's evidence as "unreliable" and "untruthful", with one part being "unworthy of belief".<ref name="Telegraph 2015-11-25">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12014863/Ex-MP-Tim-Yeo-loses-High-Court-libel-action-over-lobbying-claims.html |title=Ex-MP Tim Yeo loses High Court libel action over lobbying claims |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=25 November 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2015 }}</ref> ''The Telegraph'' suggested this should also raise questions about [[Kathryn Hudson]]'s performance as Standards Commissioner, as she had previously cleared Mr Yeo of breaching the rules on lobbying ministers for financial reward and of bringing the Commons into disrepute.<ref name="Telegraph 2015-11-25"/>

On 9 June 2013 he temporarily "stepped aside" as the chair of the committee.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/tim-yeo-steps-aside-committee-chair-lobbying | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Patrick | last=Wintour | title=Tim Yeo steps aside as committee chair amid lobbying claims | date=10 June 2013}}</ref> The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Sir Robert Smith, 3rd Baronet|Sir Robert Smith]] replaced him on an interim basis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2274048/breaking-sir-robert-smith-replaces-yeo-as-temporary-chair-of-energy-and-climate-committee |title=Breaking: Sir Robert Smith replaces Yeo as interim chair of Energy and Climate Committee |work=[[Business Green]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Yeo was deselected for the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] in a secret ballot of [[South Suffolk (UK Parliament constituency)|South Suffolk]] Conservative Party members on 29 November 2013.<ref name="Deselection">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25165546 |title=Tim Yeo MP deselected by South Suffolk Tories |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=30 November 2013 |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> He remained the MP for the constituency until the election in May 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/mr-tim-yeo/136|title=Mr Tim Yeo|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>

Yeo had earlier excused himself from the committee, on the grounds that he might be "biased" if he questioned an employee of a company for which he himself worked, and rejected the claims.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22830707 | work=BBC News | title=Tim Yeo rejects committee coaching claim | date=9 June 2013}}</ref>
