'''Leonid Danylovych Kuchma''' ({{lang-uk|Леоні́д Дани́лович Ку́чма}}; born 9 August 1938) is a Ukrainian politician who was the [[President of Ukraine#List of Presidents of Ukraine|second President]] of independent [[Ukraine]] from 19 July 1994 to 23 January 2005. Kuchma took office after winning the [[1994 Ukrainian presidential election|1994 presidential election]] against his rival, the incumbent [[Leonid Kravchuk]]. Kuchma won re-election for an additional five-year term in [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|1999]].

After a successful career in the machine-building industry of the [[Soviet Union]], Kuchma began his political career in [[1990 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1990, when he was elected]] to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament); he was [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|re-elected in 1994]]. He served as [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]] between October 1992 and September 1993.

Kuchma's presidency was surrounded by numerous corruption scandals and the lessening of media freedoms. Corruption accelerated after Kuchma's election in 1994, but in 2000–2001, his power began to weaken in the face of exposures in the media.<ref>Adrian Karatnycky, "Ukraine's Orange Revolution," ''Foreign Affairs,'' Vol. 84, No. 2 (Mar. – Apr., 2005), pp. 35–52 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20034274 in JSTOR]</ref> During his leadership, the [[Economy of Ukraine|Ukrainian economy]] continued to decline until 1999, whereas growth was recorded since 2000, bringing relative prosperity to some segments of urban residents. During his presidency, [[Russia–Ukraine relations|Ukrainian-Russian ties]] began to improve.<ref>Robert S. Kravchuk, "Kuchma as Economic Reformer," ''Problems of Post-Communism'' Vol. 52#5 September–October 2005, pp 48–58</ref>

Between 2014 and 2020, Kuchma was a special presidential representative of Ukraine at the semi-official peace talks regarding the ongoing [[War in Donbass]].

==Early life==
Leonid Kuchma was born in the village of [[Chaikine]] in rural [[Chernihiv Oblast]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Leonid Kuchma {{!}} president of Ukraine|url = http://global.britannica.com/biography/Leonid-Kuchma|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref> His father Danylo Prokopovych Kuchma (1901–1942) was wounded in [[World War II]] and eventually died of his wounds in the field hospital #756 (near the village of Novoselytsia) when Leonid was four.<ref>{{Cite web|title = single {{!}} The Jamestown Foundation|url = http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%255Btt_news%255D=11795&tx_ttnews%255BbackPid%255D=213&no_cache=1#.VlNnVPmrTIU|website = www.jamestown.org|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Engology,Engineer, Leonid Kuchma - President of the Ukraine|url = http://www.engology.com/eng5kuchma.htm|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030923160423/http://www.engology.com/eng5kuchma.htm|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2003-09-23|website = www.engology.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref> His mother Paraska Trokhymivna Kuchma worked at a [[kolhoz]].

==Career==
After graduation, Kuchma worked in the field of [[aerospace engineering]] for the [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]] in [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. At 28 he became a testing director for the Bureau deployed at the [[Baikonur cosmodrome]].

Some political observers suggested that Kuchma's early career was significantly boosted by his marriage to [[:uk:Кучма Людмила Миколаївна|Lyudmila Talalayeva]], an adopted daughter of Gennadiy Tumanov, the [[Yuzhmash]] chief engineering officer and later the Soviet Minister of Medium Machine Building.<ref>[[:uk:Бондаренко Костянтин Петрович|Бондаренко К.]] ''Леонід Кучма: портрет на фоні епохи.'' «Фоліо».

At 38 Kuchma became the Communist party chief at [[Yuzhmash|Yuzhny Machine-building Plant]] and a member of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukraine]]. He was a delegate of the 27th and 28th Congresses of the Communist Party of Soviet Union. By the end of the 1980s, Kuchma openly criticized the Communist Party.<ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2">{{cite web| title=Profile: Leonid Kuchma |publisher=[[BBC]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/486472.stm| date=29 October 1999}}</ref>

In 1982 Kuchma was appointed the first deputy of general [[design engineer]] at Yuzhmash, and from 1986 to 1992, he held the position of the company's general director. [[1990 Ukrainian parliamentary election|From 1990]] to 1992, Kuchma was a member of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukraine's parliament). In 1992 he was appointed as [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].<ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/> He resigned a year later, complaining of "slow pace of reform".<ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/> He was [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|re-elected into parliament in 1994]].<ref name="BBCProfileKuchma">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2283925.stm|title=Profile: Leonid Kuchma|date=26 September 2002|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

==President (1994–2005)==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Kuchma resigned from the position of [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] in September 1993 to run for the [[1994 Ukrainian presidential election|presidency in 1994]] on a platform to boost the economy by restoring economic relations with Russia and faster [[market economy|pro-market reforms]]. Kuchma won a clear victory against the incumbent President [[Leonid Kravchuk]], receiving strong support from the industrial areas in the east and south. His worst results were in the west of the country.<ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/>

Kuchma was [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|re-elected in 1999]] to his second term.<ref name="BBCProfileKuchma"/><ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/> This time the areas that gave him strongest support last time voted for his opponents, and the areas which voted against him last time came to his support.<ref name="BBCProfileKuchma2"/>

===Domestic policy===
In October 1994, Kuchma announced comprehensive economic reforms, including reduced [[subsidies]], lifting of price controls, lower taxes, [[privatization]] of industry and agriculture, and reforms in currency regulation and banking. The parliament approved the plan's main points. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) promised a $360&nbsp;million loan to initiate reforms.

He was re-elected in 1999 to his second term. Opponents accused him of involvement in the killing in 2000 of journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]] (see also [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]], "[[Cassette Scandal]]", [[Mykola Mel'nychenko]]), which he has always denied. Critics also blamed Kuchma for restrictions on press freedom. Kuchma is believed to have played a key role in sacking the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet]] of [[Viktor Yushchenko]] by [[Verkhovna Rada]] on 26 April 2001.

Kuchma's [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] from 2002 until early January 2005 was [[Viktor Yanukovych]], after Kuchma dismissed [[Anatoliy Kinakh]], his previous appointee.

===Foreign policy===

In 2002 Kuchma stated that Ukraine wanted to sign an association agreement with the [[European Union]] (EU) by 2003–2004 and that Ukraine would meet all EU membership requirements by 2007–2011.<ref name=UW28212EUU>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/73494 EU-Ukraine Summits: 16 Years of Wheel-Spinning], ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' (28 February 2012)</ref> He also hoped for a [[free-trade]] treaty with the EU.<ref name=UW28212EUU/>

In his inaugural address Kuchma said:

{{quote|Historically, Ukraine is part of the Euro-Asian cultural and economics space. Ukraine's vitally important national interests are now concentrated on this territory of the former Soviet Union. ... We are also linked with... the former republics of the Soviet Union by traditional scientific, cultural and family ties... I am convinced that Ukraine can assume the role of one of the leaders of Euro-Asian economic integration.<ref>'Leonid Kuchma sklav prysiagu na virnist' ukrains'komu narodovy', Holos Ukrainy, 21 July 1994.</ref>}}

Kuchma signed a "Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership" with Russia, and endorsed a round of talks with the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. Additionally, he referred to Russian as "an official language". He signed a special partnership agreement with [[NATO]] and raised the possibility of membership of the alliance.

After Kuchma's popularity at home and abroad sank as he became mired in corruption scandals, he turned to Russia as his new ally. He said that Ukraine needed a "multivector" foreign policy that balanced eastern and western interests{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

===Kuchma and the Cassette Scandal===
{{see also|Cassette Scandal}}
From 1998 to 2000, Kuchma's bodyguard [[Mykola Melnychenko]] was allegedly eavesdropping Kuchma's office, later publishing the recordings. The release of the tapes – dubbed "Kuchmagate" by the Ukrainian press – supposedly revealed Kuchma's numerous crimes. In particular, his approving the sale of radar systems to [[Saddam Hussein]] (among other illegal arms sales) and ordering Ukraine's police minister to "take care" of the journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]].
[[File:Ukraine Without Kuchma 6 February.jpg|thumbnail|[[Ukraine Without Kuchma]] protests. 6 February 2001.]]
In September 2000, Gongadze disappeared and his headless corpse was found mutilated on 3 November 2000. On 28 November, the opposition politician [[Oleksandr Moroz]] publicised the tape recordings implicating Kuchma in Gongadze's murder. In 2005 the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office instigated criminal proceedings against Kuchma and members of his former administration in connection with the murder of Gongadze.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/10/09/caseagainstkuchma.shtml |title=Criminal Case Instigated Against Ukrainian Ex-President Kuchma |work=Mosnews.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20051213221657/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/10/09/caseagainstkuchma.shtml |archive-date=2005-12-13}}</ref> In 2005 the press reported that Kuchma had been unofficially granted immunity from prosecution in return for his graceful departure from office in 2005.<ref>Crouch, David (6 April 2005).

Critics of the tape point to the difficulty of Melnychenko recording 500 hours of dictaphone tape unaided and undetected, the lack of material evidence of said recording equipment, and other doubts which question the authenticity and motive of the release of the tape. Kuchma acknowledged in 2003 that his voice was one of those on the tapes, but claimed the tapes had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NI1G_9j1AhcC&pg=PA504&dq=Kuchma+edited&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=k6gET6P_DZGSOrKj4aIB&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Kuchma%20edited&f=false ''Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2004''], ([[Europa Publications]]), [[Routledge]], 12 December 2003, {{ISBN|1-85743-187-1}} (page 504)</ref> However, the [[United States ambassador to Ukraine]], [[Carlos Pascual (diplomat)|Carlos Pascual]], revealed that the tapes are genuine, undistorted, unaltered, and not manipulated because of the conclusion from [[FBI]] [[FBI Science and Technology Branch|Electronic Research Facility]]'s analysis of the original recording device and the original recording found that there are not unusual sounds which would indicate a tampering of the recording, the recording is continuous with no breaks, and there is no manipulation of the digital files.<ref name=Danske26112002>{{cite news |url=https://www.danskukrainsk.dk/arkiv_1102_2.html#U.S.%20Ambassador's%20to%20Ukraine%20open%20letter%20to%20the |title=U.S. Ambassador's to Ukraine open letter to the editor of 2000 Newspaper |work=danskukrainsk.dk (Dansk-Ukrainsk Selskab) |last=Pascual |first=Carlos |author-link=Carlos Pascual (diplomat)|date=26 November 2002 |access-date=17 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=KuchmaParallelCabinet12102007>{{cite web | url=http://www.ukrainianstudies.uottawa.ca/pdf/P_Koshiw_Danyliw07.pdf | last=Koshiw | first=J.V. | date=12–13 October 2007 | access-date=17 January 2020 | title=Kuchma's 'Parallel Cabinet' – The center of President Kuchma's authoritarian rule based on the Melnychenko recordings | pages=16–17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120052247/http://www.ukrainianstudies.uottawa.ca/pdf/P_Koshiw_Danyliw07.pdf | archivedate=20 January 2012 }}</ref>

===Role in the election crisis of 2004===
Kuchma's role in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|election crisis of 2004]] is not entirely clear. After the second round on 22 November 2004, it appeared that Yanukovych had won the election by fraud, which caused the opposition and independent observers to dispute the results, leading to the [[Orange Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Kuchma was urged by Yanukovych and [[Viktor Medvedchuk]] (the head of the presidential office) to declare a [[state of emergency]] and hold the inauguration of Yanukovych. He denied the request. Later, Yanukovych publicly accused Kuchma of a betrayal. Kuchma refused to officially dismiss Prime Minister Yanukovych after the parliament passed a [[motion of no confidence]] against the Cabinet on 1 December 2004. Soon after, Kuchma left the country. He returned to Ukraine in March 2005.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Kuchma said in October 2009 he would vote for Victor Yanukovych at the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]].<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/50751 Kuchma says he'll vote for Yanukovych as Ukraine's president], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (16 October 2009)</ref> In a document dated 2 February 2010 uncovered during the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], Kuchma in conversation with [[United States Ambassador to Ukraine]] [[John F. Tefft]], called the voters' choice between Yanukovych and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] during the second round of the 2010 presidential election as a choice between "bad and very bad" and praised (the candidate eliminated in the first round of the election) [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] instead.<ref name="WLKuchmalovesYatsenyuk">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/92047/ "Kuchma: Yanukovych-Tymoshenko contest a choice between 'bad and very bad'"], ''Kyiv Post'' (3 December 2010)</ref>

==Post-presidency==
