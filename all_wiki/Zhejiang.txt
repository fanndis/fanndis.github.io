'''Zhejiang''' ({{zh|labels=no |c=浙江}}, [[Postal romanization|formerly romanized]] as '''Chekiang'''), is an [[East China|eastern]], coastal [[province of China|province]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Hangzhou]]. Zhejiang is bordered by [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shanghai]] to the north, [[Anhui]] to the northwest, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, and [[Fujian]] to the south. To the east is the [[East China Sea]], beyond which lies the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. The population of Zhejiang stands at 57 million, the 10th highest among China. Other notable cities include [[Ningbo]] and [[Wenzhou]]. It has been called 'the backbone of China' due to being a major driving force in the Chinese economy and being the birthplace of several notable persons, including the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and entrepreneur [[Jack Ma]].

The area of Zhejiang was controlled by the [[Yue (state)|Kingdom of Yue]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. The [[Qin Empire]] later annexed it in 222 BC. Under the late [[Ming dynasty]] and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports became important centers of international trade. It was occupied by the [[Empire of Japan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second Sino-Japanese war]] and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. After Japan's defeat, Zhejiang's economy became stagnant under [[Mao Zedong]]'s policies.<ref name="wiley" />

Nevertheless, after [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic reform]], Zhejiang has grown to be considered one of China's wealthiest provinces, ranking [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|fourth in GDP]] nationally and [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|fifth by GDP per capita]], with a nominal GDP of [[Renminbi|CN￥]]5.62 trilion ([[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion) as of 2018. Zhejiang's economy is based on electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials.

Zhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area, with higher altitudes towards the south and the west. Zhejiang has China's longest [[coast]]line. The [[Qiantang River]] runs through the province, from which it derives its name. Included in the province are three thousand islands, the most in China. The capital [[Hangzhou]] marks the end of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and lies on [[Hangzhou Bay]] on the north of Zhejiang, which separates [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. The bay contains many small islands collectively called the [[Zhoushan Islands]].

[[Hangzhou]] is a historically important city of China, and is considered a [[Global city|World City]] with a "Beta+" classification according to [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|title=GaWC - The World According to GaWC 2018|website=www.lboro.ac.uk|access-date=2019-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503165246/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2016t.html|archive-date=3 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> It includes the notable [[West Lake]]. Various [[varieties of Chinese]] are spoken in Zhejiang, the most prominent being [[Wu Chinese]].

==Etymology==
The province's name derives from the [[Zhe River]] ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|浙江}}|p=Zhè Jiāng}}), the former name of the [[Qiantang River]] which flows past [[Hangzhou]] and whose mouth forms [[Hangzhou Bay]]. It is usually understood as meaning "Crooked" or "Bent River," from the meaning of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] {{lang|zh|折}},<ref>''[[People's Daily Online]]''.

===Ancient history===
The area of modern Zhejiang was outside the major sphere of influence of [[Shang dynasty|Shang civilization]] during the second millennium BC. Instead, this area was populated by peoples collectively known as Dongyue and the [[Ouyue]].

The [[kingdom of Yue]] began to appear in the chronicles and records written during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. According to the chronicles, the kingdom of Yue was in northern Zhejiang. [[Shiji]] claims that its leaders were descended from the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] founder [[Yu the Great]]. The "[[Song of the Yue Boatman]]" ({{zh|c=越人歌 |p=Yuèrén Gē |l=Song of the man of Yue}}) was transliterated into Chinese and recorded by authors in north China or inland China of Hebei and Henan around 528 BC. The song shows that the Yue people spoke a language that was mutually unintelligible with the dialects spoken in north and inland China. The [[Sword of Goujian]] bears [[bird-worm seal script]]. [[Yuenü]] ({{zh|c=越女 |p=Yuènǚ |w=Yüeh-nü |l=the Lady of Yue |links=no}}) was a swordswoman from the state of Yue. To check the growth of the [[Wu (state)|kingdom of Wu]], [[state of Chu|Chu]] pursued a policy of strengthening Yue.

Under [[Goujian|King Goujian]], Yue recovered from its early reverses and fully annexed the lands of its rival in {{nowrap|473 BC}}. The Yue kings then moved their capital center from their original home around [[Mount Kuaiji]] in present-day [[Shaoxing]] to the former Wu capital at present-day [[Suzhou]]. With no southern power to turn against Yue, Chu opposed it directly and, in 333&nbsp;BC, succeeded in destroying it. Yue's former lands were annexed by the [[Qin Empire]] in 222&nbsp;BC and organized into a [[commandery (China)|commandery]] named for Kuaiji in Zhejiang but initially headquartered in [[Wu County|Wu]] in [[Jiangsu]].

===Han and the Three Kingdoms===
[[Kuaiji Commandery]] was the initial power base for [[Xiang Liang]] and [[Xiang Yu]]'s rebellion against the [[Qin Empire]] which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but [[Chu-Han contention|eventually fell]] to the [[Han dynasty|Han]]. Under the [[Eastern Han|Later Han]], control of the area returned to the settlement below [[Mount Kuaiji]] but authority over the [[Minyue]] hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures.

At the beginning of the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220–280 CE), Zhejiang was home to the warlords [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Wang Lang]] prior to their defeat by [[Sun Ce]] and [[Sun Quan]], who eventually established the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]]. Despite the removal of their court from Kuaiji to [[Jiankang|Jianye]] (present-day [[Nanjing]]), and they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern China. Industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as [[Manchuria]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] ([[South Vietnam]]).

Zhejiang was part of the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. Wu (229–280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, had been the economically most developed state among the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280 CE). The historical novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] records that Zhejiang had the best-equipped, strong navy force. The story depicts how the states of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] ({{lang|zh|魏}}) and [[Shu (state)|Shu]] ({{lang|zh|蜀}}), lack of material resources, avoided direct confrontation with the Wu. In armed military conflicts with Wu, the two states relied intensively on tactics of camouflage and deception to steal Wu's military resources including arrows and bows.

===Six Dynasties===

Despite the continuing prominence of [[Nanjing]] (then known as Jiankang), the settlement of Qiantang, the former name of [[Hangzhou]], remained one of the three major metropolitan centers in the south to provide major tax revenue to the imperial centers in the north China. The other two centers in the south were Jiankang and [[Chengdu]]. In 589, Qiantang was raised in status and renamed [[Hangzhou]].

Following the fall of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] and the turmoil of the [[Wu Hu uprising]] against the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]], most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refuge in areas south of the Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near [[Hangzhou]]. For example, the clan of [[Zhuge Liang]] (181–234), a chancellor of the state of [[Shu Han]] from [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] in north China during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, gathered together at the suburb of [[Hangzhou]], forming an exclusive, closed village [[Zhuge Village]] (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name "Zhuge." The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] might have taken refuge south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available,  mainly southern [[Jiangsu]], eastern [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Hunan]], [[Anhui]], and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of [[Sichuan]] was another hub for refugees, given that the state of [[Shu (state)|Shu]] had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The [[Eastern Jin|rump Jin state]] or the [[Southern dynasties]] vied against some elite Chinese from the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] and south of the Yangtze River.

===Sui and Tang eras===
Zhejiang, as the heartland of the [[Jiangnan]] (Yangtze River Delta), remained the wealthiest area during the [[Six Dynasties]] (220 or 222–589), Sui, and Tang. After being incorporated into the [[Sui dynasty]], its economic richness was used for the [[Sui dynasty]]'s ambitions to expand north and south, particularly into [[Goguryeo–Sui War|Korea]] and Vietnam. The plan led the [[Sui dynasty]] to restore and expand the network which became the [[Grand Canal of China]]. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the [[Zhe River]] and the shores of [[Hangzhou Bay]]), and from [[Suzhou]], and thence to the [[North China Plain]]. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country. Zhejiang was an important economic center of the empire's [[Jiangnan]] East Circuit and was considered particularly prosperous. Throughout the [[Tang dynasty]], The Grand Canal had remained effective, transporting grains and material resources to [[North China plain]] and metropolitan centers of the empire. As the Tang dynasty disintegrated, Zhejiang constituted most of the territory of the regional kingdom of [[Wuyue]].

===Wuyue era===
[[File:QIAN_Liu_(aka_TSIEN_Liu),_King_of_Wuyue.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Qian Liu]], the King of [[Wuyue]].]]
After the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907, the entire area of what is now Zhejiang fell under the control of the kingdom [[Wuyue]] established by King [[Qian Liu]], who selected [[Hangzhou]] (a city in the modern day area of Zhejiang) as his kingdom's capital. Despite being under Wuyue rule for a relatively short period of time, Zhejiang underwent a long period of financial and cultural prosperity which continued even after the kingdom fell.

After Wuyue was conquered during the reunification of China, many shrines were erected across the former territories of Wuyue, mainly in Zhejiang, where the kings of Wuyue were memorialised, and sometimes, worshipped as being able to dictate weather and agriculture. Many of these shrines, known as "Shrine of the Qian King" or "Temple to the Qian King," still remain today, with the most popularly visited example being that near [[West Lake]] in Hangzhou.
 
China's province of Zhejiang during the 940s was also the place of origin of the [[Hu (surname)|Hú]] family (Hồ in Vietnamese) from which the founder of the [[Hồ Dynasty]] who ruled Vietnam, Emperor [[Hồ Quý Ly]], came from.<ref name="Taylor2013">{{cite book|author=K.

The [[Song dynasty]] re-established unity around 960. Under the Song, the prosperity of South China began to overtake that of North China. After the north was lost to the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jurchen Jin|Jin dynasty]] in 1127 following the [[Jingkang Incident]], Hangzhou became the capital of the Song dynasty under the name [[Hangzhou|Lin'an]], which was renowned for its prosperity and beauty, it was suspected to have been the largest city in the world at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2013-07-19 |access-date=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527095609/http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |archive-date=27 May 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref>

From then on, northern Zhejiang and neighboring southern Jiangsu have been synonymous with luxury and opulence in Chinese culture. The [[Mongol]] conquest and the establishment of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1279 ended Hangzhou's political clout, but its economy continued to prosper. The famous traveler [[Marco Polo]] visited the city, which he called "Kinsay" (after the Chinese ''Jingshi'', meaning "Capital City") claiming it was "the finest and noblest city in the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/polo-kinsay.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=13 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413201403/https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/polo-kinsay.asp|archive-date=13 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Greenware ceramics made from [[celadon]] had been made in the area since the 3rd-century [[Sima Jin|Jin dynasty]], but it returned to prominence&mdash;particularly in [[Longquan]]&mdash;during the Southern Song and Yuan. Longquan greenware is characterized by a thick unctuous glaze of a particular bluish-green tint over an otherwise undecorated light-grey porcellaneous body that is delicately potted. Yuan Longquan celadons feature a thinner, greener glaze on larger vessels with decoration and shapes derived from Middle Eastern ceramic and metalwares. These were produced in large quantities for the Chinese export trade to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and (during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]) Europe. By the Ming, however, production was notably deficient in quality. It is in this period that the Longquan kilns declined, to be eventually replaced in popularity and ceramic production by the kilns of [[Jingdezhen]] in [[Jiangxi]].<ref>Vainker, Shelaugh. <u>Chinese Pottery and Porcelain.</u> London: British Museum Press, 1991.</ref>

===Yuan and Ming eras===
[[File:Ceramic planter from the Ming Dynasty.jpg|thumb|This tripod planter from the [[Ming dynasty]] was found in Zhejiang province. It is housed in the [[Smithsonian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Zhejiang was finally [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|conquered by the Mongols]] in the late 13th century who later established the short lived [[Yuan dynasty]]. Zhejiang became part of the much larger [[Jiangzhe province]].

The [[Ming dynasty]], which drove out the Mongols in 1368, finally established the present day province of Zhejiang with its borders having little changes since this establishment.

As in other coastal provinces, number of fortresses were constructed along the Zhejiang coast during the early Ming to defend the land against [[wokou|pirate]] incursions. Some of them have been preserved or restored, such as [[Pucheng Township|Pucheng]] in the south of the province ([[Cangnan County]]).

===Qing era===
Under the late Ming dynasty and the [[Qing dynasty]] that followed it, Zhejiang's ports were important centers of international trade.

In 1727 the to-min or "idle people " of Cheh Kiang province (a Ningpo name still existing), the yoh-hu or " music people " of Shan Si province, the si-min or "small people " of Kiang Su province, and the tan-ka or "egg-people" of Canton (to this day the boat population there), were all freed from their social disabilities, and allowed to count as free men. So far as my own observations go, after residing for a quarter of a century in half the provinces of China, north, south, east, and west, I should be inclined to describe slavery in China as totally invisible to the naked eye ; personal liberty is absolute where feebleness or ignorance do not expose the subject to the rapacity of mandarins, relatives, or speculators. Even savages and foreigners are welcomed as equals, so long as they conform unreservedly to Chinese custom. On the other hand, the oldfashioned social disabilities of policemen, barbers, and playactors still exist in the eyes of the law, though any idea of caste is totally absent therefrom, and "unofficially" these individuals are as good as any other free men.  Having now taken a cursory view of Chinese slavery from its historical aspect, let us see what it is in practice. Though the penal code forbids and annuls the sale into slavery of free persons, even by a husband, father, or grandfather, yet the number of free persons who are sold or sell themselves to escape starvation and misery is considerable. It is nominally a punishable offence to keep a free man or lost child as a slave; also for parents to sell their children without the consent of the latter, or to drown their girls; but in practice the law is in both cases ignored, and scarcely ever enforced ; ''a fortiori'' the minor offence of selling children, even with their consent. Indeed, sales of girls for secondary wives is of daily occurrence, and, as we have seen, the Emperors Yung-cheng and K'ien-lung explicitly recognized the right of parents to sell children in times of famine, whilst the missionaries unanimously bear witness to the fact that the public sale of children in the streets—for instance, of Tientsin—was frequently witnessed during recent times of dearth. But slave markets and public sales are unknown in a general way. Occasionally old parents sell their children in order to purchase coffins for themselves.

The Duomin ({{zh|s=惰民|hp=duò mín|w=to-min|links=no}}) are a caste of [[Untouchability|outcasts]] in this province.

During the [[First Opium War]], the British navy defeated [[Eight Banners]] forces at [[Ningbo]] and [[Dinghai]]. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], signed in 1843, Ningbo became one of the five Chinese [[treaty ports]] opened to virtually unrestricted foreign trade.  Much of Zhejiang came under the control of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which resulted in a considerable loss of life in the north-western and central parts of the province, sparing the rest of Zhejiang from the disastrous depopulation that occurred. In 1876, [[Wenzhou]] became Zhejiang's second treaty port. [[Jianghuai Mandarin]] speakers later came to settle in these depopulated regions of northern Zhejiang.

=== Republican era===

{{See also|Chekiang Province, Republic of China}}
During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which led into [[World War II]], much of Zhejiang was occupied by Japan and placed under the control of the Japanese puppet state known as the [[Reorganized National Government of China]]. Following the [[Doolittle Raid]], most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] to intimidate the Chinese out of helping downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000 civilians from the area of Hangzhou to [[Nanchang]] and also [[Zhuzhou]] while searching for Doolittle's men.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/ |title=PBS Perilous Flight |publisher=Pbs.org |access-date=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910035849/http://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/ |archive-date=10 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== People's Republic era===

After the People's Republic of China took control of [[Mainland China]] in 1949, the [[Republic of China]] government based in [[Taiwan]] continued to control the [[Dachen Islands]] off the coast of Zhejiang until 1955, even establishing a rival Zhejiang provincial government there, creating a situation similar to Fujian province today. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76), Zhejiang was in chaos and disunity, and its economy was stagnant, especially during the high tide (1966–69) of the revolution. The agricultural policy favoring grain production at the expense of industrial and cash crops intensified economic hardships in the province. Mao's self-reliance policy and the reduction in maritime trade cut off the lifelines of the port cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou. While Mao invested heavily in railroads in interior China, no major railroads were built in South Zhejiang, where transportation remained poor.<ref name=wiley>{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118764017/PDFSTART |title=Regional Inequality in China: A Case Study of Zhejiang Province |doi=10.1111/j.0040-747X.2004.00292.x |date=2004-02-16 |access-date=2013-09-10 |volume=95 |journal=Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie |pages=44–60|last1=Wei |first1=Yehua Dennis |last2=Ye |first2=Xinyue }}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Zhejiang benefited less from central government investment than some other provinces due to its lack of natural resources, a location vulnerable to potential flooding from the sea, and an economic base at the national average. Zhejiang, however, has been an epicenter of capitalist development in China, and has led the nation in the development of a market economy and private enterprises.<ref name=wiley/> Northeast Zhejiang, as part of the Yangtze Delta, is flat, more developed, and industrial.<ref name=wiley/>

Zhejiang consists mostly of hills, which account for about 70% of its total area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2003-10/09/content_336632.htm|title=The physical geography of Zhejiang|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> Altitudes tend to be the highest to the south and west and the highest peak of the province, [[Huangmaojian Peak]] ({{Convert|1929|m|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), is located there. Other prominent mountains include [[Mount Yandang|Mounts Yandang]], [[Mount Tianmu|Tianmu]], [[Mount Tiantai (Zhejiang)|Tiantai]], and [[Mount Mogan|Mogan]], which reach altitudes of {{Convert|700|to|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}.

Valleys and plains are found along the coastline and rivers. The north of the province lies just south of the [[Yangtze Delta]], and consists of plains around the cities of Hangzhou, [[Jiaxing]], and [[Huzhou]], where the [[Grand Canal of China]] enters from the northern border to end at Hangzhou. Another relatively flat area is found along the [[Qu River]] around the cities of [[Quzhou]] and [[Jinhua]]. Major rivers include the [[Qiantang River|Qiangtang]] and [[Ou River, China|Ou River]]s. Most rivers carve out valleys in the highlands, with plenty of rapids and other features associated with such topography. Well-known lakes include the [[West Lake]] of Hangzhou and the [[South Lake, Jiaxing|South Lake]] of Jiaxing.

There are over three thousand islands along the rugged coastline of Zhejiang. The largest, [[Zhoushan Island]], is Mainland China's third largest island, after [[Hainan]] and [[Chongming Island|Chongming]]. There are also many bays, of which [[Hangzhou Bay]] is the largest.
{{anchor|Climate}}
Zhejiang has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons. Spring starts in March and is rainy with changeable weather. Summer, from June to September is long, hot, rainy, and humid. Fall is generally dry, warm and sunny. Winters are short but cold except in the far south. Average annual temperature is around {{convert|15|to|19|C|F}}, average January temperature is around {{convert|2|to|8|C|F}} and average July temperature is around {{convert|27|to|30|C|F}}. Annual precipitation is about {{convert|1000|to|1900|mm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. There is plenty of rainfall in early summer, and by late summer Zhejiang is directly threatened by [[typhoon]]s forming in the Pacific.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|List of administrative divisions of Zhejiang|List of township-level divisions of Zhejiang}}
Zhejiang is divided into eleven [[prefecture-level division]]s: all [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] (including two [[Sub-provincial divisions in the People's Republic of China|sub-provincial cities]]):

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Zhejiang|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The politics of Zhejiang is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in Mainland China. The [[Governor of Zhejiang]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Zhejiang. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor is subordinate to the Zhejiang [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Zhejiang [[CPC Party Chief]]."

Several political figures who served as Zhejiang's top political office of Communist Party Secretary have played key roles in various events in PRC history. [[Tan Zhenlin]] (term 1949-1952), the inaugural Party Secretary, was one of the leading voices against Mao's [[Cultural Revolution]] during the so-called [[February Countercurrent]] of 1967. [[Jiang Hua]] (term 1956-1968), was the "chief justice" on the Special Court in the case against the [[Gang of Four]] in 1980. Three provincial Party Secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level. They include CPC General Secretary and President [[Xi Jinping]] (term 2002-2007), [[National People's Congress]] Chairman and former Vice-Premier [[Zhang Dejiang]] (term 1998-2002), and [[Zhao Hongzhu]] (term 2007-2012), the Deputy Secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], China's top anti-corruption body. Of Zhejiang's fourteen Party Secretaries since 1949, none were native to the province.

Zhejiang was home to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and many high-ranking officials in the [[Kuomintang]], who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Civil War.

Zhejiang is one of the richest and most developed provinces in China. As of 2018, its [[Gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] was [[United States dollar|US$]]849 billion ([[Renminbi|CN￥]] 5.62 trilion), about 6.24% of the country's GDP and ranked [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|4th]] among [[Administrative divisions of China|province-level administrative units]]; the province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth CN￥196.70 billion (US$29.72 billion), CN￥2.3506 trillion (US$355.22 billion), and CN￥3.0724 trillion (US$464.29 billion) respectively. Its nominal GDP per capita was US$14,907 (CN￥98,643) and ranked the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|5th]] in the country. The private sector in the province has been playing an increasingly important role in boosting the regional economy since [[Chinese economic reform|Economic Reform]] in 1978.<ref name="SNA2008"/>

Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, [[textiles]], chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the "Zhejiang model," which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into [[infrastructure]], and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the "Zhejiang spirit" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |title=China Economy @ China Perspective |publisher=Thechinaperspective.com |date=2013-09-06 |access-date=2013-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045925/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/zhejiang-province/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou.<ref name=wiley/> The [[Per-Capita Disposable Income|per capita disposable income]] of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 55,574 yuan (US$8,398) in 2018, an annual real growth of 8.4%.

Traditionally, the province is known as the "Land of Fish and Rice." True to its name, [[rice]] is the main crop, followed by [[wheat]]; north Zhejiang is also a center of [[aquaculture]] in China, and the [[Zhoushan]] fishery is the largest [[fishery]] in the country. The main cash crops include [[jute]] and [[cotton]], and the province also leads the provinces of China in [[tea]] production. (The renowned [[Longjing tea]] is a product of Hangzhou.) Zhejiang's towns have been known for handicraft production of goods such as [[silk]], for which it is ranked second among the provinces. Its many market towns connect the cities with the countryside.

As of 1832, the province was exporting silk, paper, fans, pencils, wine, [[dates (fruit)|dates]], tea and "golden-flowered" [[ham]]s.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=122|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/122/|access-date=16 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016064127/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/122/|archive-date=16 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Waste disposal====
On Thursday, September 15, 2011, more than 500 people from Hongxiao Village protested over the large-scale death of fish in a nearby river. Angry protesters stormed the Zhejiang Jinko Solar Company factory compound, overturned eight company vehicles, and destroyed the offices before police came to disperse the crowd. Protests continued on the two following nights with reports of scuffles, officials said. Chen Hongming, a deputy head of [[Haining City|Haining]]'s environmental protection bureau, said the factory's waste disposal had failed  pollution tests since April. The environmental watchdog had warned the factory, but it had not effectively controlled the pollution, Chen added.<ref>{{cite news

===Languages===
Zhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other [[varieties of Chinese]] are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian. (See [[Hangzhou dialect]], [[Shaoxing dialect]], [[Ningbo dialect]], [[Wenzhou dialect]], [[Taizhou dialect]], [[Jinhua dialect]], and [[Quzhou dialect]] for more information).

Throughout history there have been a series of ''[[lingua franca]]s'' in the area to allow for better communication. The dialects spoken in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo have taken on this role historically. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects, has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout China. As a result, most of the population now can, to some degree, speak and comprehend Mandarin and can [[Code-switching|code-switch]] when necessary. A majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak Mandarin. Urban residents tend to be more fluent in Mandarin than rural people. Nevertheless, a Zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in Mandarin, and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most Zhejiang residents.

===Music===
Zhejiang is the home of [[Yue opera]], one of the most prominent forms of [[Chinese opera]]. ''Yueju'' originated in [[Shengzhou]] and is traditionally performed by actresses only, in both male and female roles. Other important opera traditions include Yongju (of Ningbo), [[Shao opera]] (of [[Shaoxing]]), [[Ouju]] (of Wenzhou), [[Wuju]] (of [[Jinhua]]), Taizhou Luantan (of Taizhou) and Zhuji Luantan (of [[Zhuji]]).

===Cuisine===
[[File:Cangnan - Pacao - P1210261.JPG|thumb|Fish being dried dockside in Pacao Harbor, [[Cangnan County]]]]
Longjing tea (also called dragon well tea), originating in Hangzhou, is one of the most prestigious, if not ''the'' most prestigious Chinese tea. Hangzhou is also renowned for its silk umbrellas and hand fans. [[Zhejiang cuisine]] (itself subdivided into many traditions, including Hangzhou cuisine) is one of the eight great traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]].

===Place names===
Since ancient times, north Zhejiang and neighbouring south Jiangsu have been famed for their prosperity and opulence{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}, and simply inserting north Zhejiang place names (Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc.) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess, a practice followed by many noted poets. In particular, the fame of Hangzhou (as well as [[Suzhou]] in neighbouring Jiangsu province) has led to the popular saying: "Above there is heaven; below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou" ({{zh|s=上有天堂，下有苏杭|labels=no}}), a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities.
