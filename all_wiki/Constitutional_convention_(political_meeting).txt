A '''constitutional convention''' is a gathering for the purpose of writing a new [[constitution]] or revising an existing constitution.<ref name="definitionfromblackslawdictionary">{{cite web | url=http://thelawdictionary.org/constitutional-convention/ | title=Definition of 'Constitutional Convention' from Black's Law Dictionary}}</ref> 
Members of a constitutional convention (sometimes referred to as "delegates" to a constitutional convention) are often, though not necessarily or entirely, elected by popular vote. However, a wholly popularly-elected constitutional convention can also be referred to as a [[constituent assembly]].

==Examples==
===National Conventions===
Examples of constitutional conventions to form or revise the constitution of a nation include:
*'''United States''' :
**The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]] (1787) was convened to revise the United States' original plan of government, the [[Articles of Confederation]]. However, a consensus soon developed to create an entirely new plan. The [[United States Constitution]] was drafted at the convention in 1787, ratified by the states in 1788, and took effect in 1789.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Constitution: How Did it Happen? |url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution/how-did-it-happen |website=archives.gov |publisher=United States National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=3 April 2019 |language=en |date=30 March 2016}}</ref>
*'''Poland''': [[Great Sejm|The Great Sejm]] (also known as ''Four-Year Sejm'') was held between 1788 and 1792. Its principal aim became to restore sovereignty to, and reform, the [[Federation|federative]] Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth politically and economically. These attempts were made by writing [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]] that was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the Commonwealth and its system of [[Golden Liberty|Golden Liberties]].
*'''France''': [[National Convention|The National Convention of 1792]] (commonly referred to as ''The Convention'') convened during [[The French Revolution]] on September 20 with the purpose of writing a Republican Constitution following [[10 August (French Revolution)|the suspension of the French Monarchy]].  The monarchy was officially abolished on September 21 by The Convention.
*'''Canada'''
** [[Quebec Conference, 1864]]
** [[London Conference of 1866]].
*'''[[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|Australia]]''' held four constitutional conventions, one each in 1891, 1897, 1973, and [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998]]
*'''Germany''': [[Parlamentarischer Rat]] (Parliamentary Council) (1948) – Drafted the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law of the Federal Republic]] for ratification by the ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]''.
*'''Northern Ireland''': [[Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention]] (1975–1976) – a failed attempt to find a solution to the status of [[Northern Ireland]].

*'''[[South Africa]]'''
**[[National Convention (South Africa)|National Convention]] (1908-1909) – debated and drafted the basis of the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act (1909)]], leading to the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]].
**[[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|Convention for a Democratic South Africa and the Multiparty Negotiating Forum]] (1991-1993) – negotiated and laid the basis for the [[Constitution of South Africa, 1993|interim Constitution of South Africa]] (1993), in turn leading to the Constitutional Assembly adopting the current [[Constitution of South Africa]] (1996).
*'''European Union''': [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]] (2001) – Drafted the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitution for Europe]] for approval by the [[European Council]] and ratification by the [[List of European Union member states|member state]]s.
*'''[[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Philippines]]'''
**1898 - drafted the 1898 [[Malolos Constitution]], the basic law of the [[First Philippine Republic]], the first constitutional republic in Asia.  The drafted constitution was written by [[Felipe Calderón y Roca]] and Felipe Buencamino as an alternative to a pair of proposals to the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] by [[Apolinario Mabini]] and [[Pedro Paterno]]. After a lengthy debate in the latter part of 1898, it was enacted on 21 January 1899.
**1935 – to draft a constitution to create the autonomous [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under the U.S. [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]]. The constitution was also used in the 3rd Republic (1946) until the passage of the 1973 constitution. Members were elected through the [[1934 Philippine Constitutional Convention election]]
**1971 – to draft a revised constitution to replace the old U.S. customed 1935 Philippine constitution. Members were elected through the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election]]. The system of government changed from presidential to parliamentary to presidential-parliamentary (in 1984 amendment). The constitution lasted until the downfall of [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1986 and [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed members to draft the 1987 Constitution through a [[Constitutional Commission]].
*'''Ireland''': In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Government of the 31st Dáil|government elected in March 2011]] has committed to establishing a "[[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|constitutional convention]]" to recommend [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional amendments]] on six specified issues and others it may consider; the government has separately promised amendments on five other issues.<ref>[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/03/22/00005.asp Dáil debates Vol.728 No.3 p.5] March 22, 2011</ref>

===Smaller Administrative Units===
Constitutional conventions have also been used by constituent states of federations — such as the individual states of the United States — to create, replace, or revise their own constitutions.  Several [[U.S. state]]s have held multiple conventions over the years to change their particular [[State constitution (United States)|state's constitutions]].
*[[Missouri]] has held four,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.asp?id=1085|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070529040453/http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.asp?id=1085|url-status=dead|title=A Celebration of Two Constitutions|date=May 29, 2007|archivedate=May 29, 2007|website=archive.is}}</ref> in 1820, 1865, 1875 and 1945.

Limited Conventions and Constitutional Commissions resulting in revisions were held in 1927, 1945, 1956 and 1968. Subsequently, the state legislature proposes amendments that are ratified in popular referendum.<ref>Dinan, John.
