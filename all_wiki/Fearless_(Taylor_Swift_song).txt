"'''Fearless'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The song was written by Swift, [[Liz Rose]] and [[Hillary Lindsey]], and produced by Swift and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. "Fearless" was released on January 3, 2010 by [[Big Machine Records]] as the fifth and final [[single (music)|single]] from Swift's second studio [[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|album of the same name]] (2008). Swift wrote the [[pop rock]] song while traveling on tour to promote her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] (2006). She wrote "Fearless" in regard to the fearlessness of falling in love and eventually titled her second studio album after the song. Musically, it contains qualities commonly found in pop rock music and, lyrically, is about a perfect first date.

"Fearless" received acclaim from contemporary critics, many of whom complimented it for appealing to different age groups. In the United States, "Fearless" debuted and peaked at number 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was [[RIAA certifications|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and it was the first single to be certified gold by the RIAA before it was officially released as a single. "Fearless" also entered charts in Canada and Spain. Swift performed the song in various venues, some of which were included on the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009–10). Footage from the Fearless Tour performances were used to comprise a [[music video]] for "Fearless", directed by Todd Cassetty. The video features both footage of the tour itself and backstage.

==Production==
"Fearless" was written by Swift in collaboration with [[Liz Rose]] and [[Hillary Lindsey]] and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act in order to promote her eponymous debut album, ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'' (2006).<ref name="cutbycut">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110 |title=Cut By But |first=Taylor |last=Swift |authorlink=Taylor Swift |work=Bigmachinerecords.com |publisher=[[Big Machine Records]] |access-date=May 25, 2010 |archive-date=April 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403025349/http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody."<ref name="cutbycut" /> She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had."<ref name="cutbycut" /> The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about "the fearlessness of falling in love", and "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing "Fearless".<ref name="cutbycut" /> After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word "fearless".<ref name="mtvowed">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1599032/20081110/swift__taylor.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Says She 'Owed It' To Her Fans To Be Open About Joe Jonas Breakup|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=November 11, 2008|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=May 25, 2010|archive-date=March 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312093907/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1599032/20081110/swift__taylor.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> To her, "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof.
