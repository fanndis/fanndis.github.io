==Etymology==
[[File:Hauptbuch Hochstetter vor 1828.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early 19th-century [[ledger]].]]
Both the words accounting and accountancy were in use in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] by the mid-1800s, and are derived from the words ''accompting'' and ''accountantship'' used in the 18th century.<ref name = "LN 2009">Labardin, Pierre, and Marc Nikitin. 2009. “Accounting and the Words to Tell It: An Historical Perspective.” ''Accounting, Business & Financial History'' 19 (2): 149–166.</ref> In [[Middle English]] (used roughly between the 12th and the late 15th century) the verb "to account" had the form ''accounten'', which was derived from the Old French word ''aconter'',<ref name = "B 1984">Baladouni, Vahé. 1984. “Etymological Observations on Some Accounting Terms.” ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' 11 (2): 101–109.</ref> which is in turn related to the [[Vulgar Latin]] word ''computare'', meaning "to reckon". The base of ''computare'' is ''putare'', which "variously meant to prune, to purify, to correct an account, hence, to count or calculate, as well as to think".<ref name = "B 1984"/>

The word "[[accountant]]" is derived from the French word {{lang|fr|compter}}, which is also derived from the Italian and [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|computare}}. The word was formerly written in English as "accomptant", but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced by dropping the "p", became gradually changed both in [[pronunciation]] and in [[orthography]] to its present form.<ref>Pixley, Francis William: Accountancy—constructive and recording accountancy (Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd, London, 1900), p4</ref>

=== Terminology ===
'''Accounting''' has variously been defined as the keeping or preparation of the financial records of transactions of the firm, the analysis, verification and reporting of such records and "the [[Generally accepted accounting principles|principles]] and procedures of accounting"; it also refers to the [[Job (role)|job]] of being an [[accountant]].<ref name = "Cambridge Business Accounting">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/accounting |title=accounting noun - definition in the Business English Dictionary |year=2013 |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press |access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref><ref name = "Cambridge British Accounting">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/accounting?q=accounting |title=accounting noun - definition in the British English Dictionary & Thesaurus |year=2013 |website=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press |access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref><ref name = "MW 2013 accounting">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accounting |title=accounting |year=2013 |website=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref>

===Financial accounting===
{{main article|Financial accounting}}
Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information to external users of the information, such as investors, potential investors and creditors. It calculates and records business transactions and prepares [[financial statement]]s for the external users in accordance with [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).<ref name = "HDF 2006">{{Citation

Financial accounting produces past-oriented reports—for example financial statements are often published six to ten months after the end of the accounting period—on an [[Annual report|annual]] or quarterly basis, generally about the organization as a whole.<ref name = "HDF 2006" />

===Management accounting===
{{main article|Management accounting}}
Management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information that can help managers in making decisions to fulfill the goals of an organization. In management accounting, internal measures and reports are based on [[cost-benefit analysis]], and are not required to follow the generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP).<ref name = "HDF 2006" /> In 2014 CIMA created the [http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs)].

Management accounting produces past-oriented reports with time spans that vary widely, but it also encompasses future-oriented reports such as [[budgets]]. Management accounting reports often include financial and non financial information, and may, for example, focus on specific products and departments.<ref name = "HDF 2006" />

===Auditing===
{{main article|Financial audit|Internal audit}}
Auditing is the verification of assertions made by others regarding a payoff,<ref name = "B 1979">Baiman, Stanley. 1979. “Discussion of Auditing: Incentives and Truthful Reporting.” Journal of Accounting Research 17: 25–29.</ref> and in the context of accounting it is the "[[wiktionary:unbiased|unbiased]] examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization".<ref name = "I 2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp |title=Audit Definition |year=2013 |website=Investopedia |publisher= Investopedia US |access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref> Audit is a professional service that is systematic and conventional.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tredinnick|first1=Luke|title=Artificial intelligence and professional roles|journal=Business Information Review|date=March 2017|volume=34|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1177/0266382117692621|url=http://repository.londonmet.ac.uk/3812/3/OOTB-AI.pdf}}</ref>

An audit of financial statements aims to express or disclaim an independent opinion on the financial statements. The auditor expresses an independent opinion on the fairness with which the financial statements presents the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of an entity, in accordance with the generally acceptable accounting principle  (GAAP) and "in all material respects". An auditor is also required to identify circumstances in which the generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP) has not been consistently observed.<ref name = "SAS 1 Responsibilities">{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00110.pdf |title=Responsibilities and Functions of the Independent Auditor |date=November 1972 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref>

Many accounting practices have been simplified with the help of [[accounting software|accounting computer-based software]]. An [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system is commonly used for a large organisation and it provides a comprehensive, centralized, integrated source of information that companies can use to manage all major business processes, from purchasing to manufacturing to human resources. These systems can be cloud based and available on demand via application or browser, or available as software installed on specific computers or local servers, often referred to as on-premise.

===Tax accounting===
{{main article|Tax accounting}}
Tax accounting in the United States concentrates on the preparation, analysis and presentation of tax payments and tax returns. The U.S. tax  system requires the use of specialised accounting principles for tax purposes which can differ from the [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) for financial reporting.<ref name="autogenerated2010">{{ Citation | last = Droms| first= William G.| last2= Wright| first2= Jay O.| title= Finance and Accounting for nonfinancial Managers: All the Basics you need to Know| publisher= Basic Books, 2010| year= 2010| edition= 6th}}</ref> U.S. tax law covers four basic forms of business ownership: [[sole proprietorship]], [[partnership]], [[corporation]], and [[limited liability company]]. [[Corporate tax in the United States|Corporate]] and [[Income tax in the United States|personal]] income are taxed at different rates, both varying according to income levels and including varying marginal rates (taxed on each additional dollar of income) and average rates (set as a percentage of overall income).<ref name="autogenerated2010"/>

===Forensic accounting===
{{main article|Forensic accounting}}

Forensic accounting is a specialty practice area of accounting that describes engagements that result from actual or anticipated disputes or [[litigation]]. "[[Forensic science|Forensic]]" means "suitable for use in a court of law", and it is to that standard and potential outcome that forensic accountants generally have to work.

=== Political campaign accounting ===

=== Firms ===
{{main article|Accounting networks and associations}}

Accounting firms grew in the United States and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and through several mergers there were large international accounting firms by the mid-twentieth century.

=== Standard-setters ===
{{See also|Accounting standards|Convergence of accounting standards}}
[[Generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) are accounting standards issued by national regulatory bodies. In addition, the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) issues the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) implemented by 147 countries.<ref name = "NP 2013" /> While standards for international audit and assurance, ethics, education, and public sector accounting are all set by independent standard settings boards supported by IFAC.

==Scandals==
{{Main article|Accounting scandals}}
{{See also|Accounting ethics}}
The year 2001 witnessed a series of financial information frauds involving [[Enron]], auditing firm [[Arthur Andersen]], the telecommunications company [[WorldCom]], [[Qwest]] and [[Jarden|Sunbeam]], among other well-known corporations. These problems highlighted the need to review the effectiveness of [[Standard accounting practice|accounting standards]], auditing regulations and [[corporate governance]] principles. In some cases, management manipulated the figures shown in financial reports to indicate a better economic performance. In others, tax and regulatory incentives encouraged over-leveraging of companies and decisions to bear extraordinary and unjustified risk.<ref name="mba.ufm.edu.gt">Astrid Ayala and Giancarlo Ibárgüen Snr.: "A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies" (Journal of Management of Value, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]], March 2006) p. 41, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084545/http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf UFM.edu.gt]</ref>

The [[Enron scandal]] deeply influenced the development of new [[regulations]] to improve the reliability of financial reporting, and increased public awareness about the importance of having accounting standards that show the financial reality of companies and the objectivity and independence of auditing firms.<ref name="mba.ufm.edu.gt"/>

In addition to being the largest [[bankruptcy]] reorganization in American history, the [[Enron scandal]] undoubtedly is the biggest audit failure<ref>Bratton, William W. "Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value" ([[Tulane Law Review]], New Orleans, May 2002) p. 61</ref> causing the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the world. After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in December 2001.<ref>{{cite news | title = Enron files for bankruptcy | work = BBC News | date = 2001-12-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1688550.stm | access-date = 15 March 2008}}</ref>

One consequence of these events was the passage of [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] in the [[United States]] 2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron. The act significantly raises criminal penalties for [[securities fraud]], for destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders.<ref>Aiyesha Dey, and Thomas Z. Lys: "Trends in Earnings Management and Informativeness of Earnings Announcements in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes Oxley Periods ([[Kellogg School of Management]], Evanston, Illinois, February, 2005) p. 5</ref>

== Fraud and error ==
Accounting [[fraud]] is an intentional misstatement or omission in the accounting records by management or employees which involves the use of deception. It is a criminal act and a breach of civil tort. It may involve collusion with third parties.<ref name="IAASB-ISA240">{{Citation | title =2018 Handbook of International Quality Control, Auditing, Review, Other Assurance, and Related Services Pronouncements | publisher =The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board | date =December 2018 }}</ref>

An accounting error is an unintentional misstatement or omission in the accounting records, for example misinterpretation of facts, mistakes in processing data, or oversights leading to incorrect estimates.<ref name="IAASB-ISA240">{{Citation | title =2018 Handbook of International Quality Control, Auditing, Review, Other Assurance, and Related Services Pronouncements | publisher =The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board | date =December 2018 }}</ref> Acts leading to accounting errors are not criminal but may breach civil law, for example, the tort of [[negligence]].

The primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud and errors rests with the entity's management.<ref name="IAASB-ISA240">{{Citation | title =2018 Handbook of International Quality Control, Auditing, Review, Other Assurance, and Related Services Pronouncements | publisher =The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board | date =December 2018 }}</ref>
