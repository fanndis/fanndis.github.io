{{UK general election navigation|2005|2010|2015|2017|2019}}
The '''2015 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday, 7 May 2015 to elect [[List of MPs elected in the 2015 United Kingdom general election|650 members]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. It was the first [[United Kingdom general election|general election]] at the end of a [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|fixed-term Parliament]]. [[2015 United Kingdom local elections|Local elections]] took place in most areas on the same day.

Polls and commentators had predicted the outcome would be too close to call and would result in a second consecutive [[hung parliament]] that would be either similar or more complicated than the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]]. Opinion polls were eventually proven to have underestimated the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] vote as the party unexpectedly won an outright majority, which bore resemblance to its victory at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]]. Having governed [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|in coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] since [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], the Conservatives won 330 seats and 36.9% of the vote share, giving them a small overall majority of 12 seats and their first outright win for 23 years.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Ed Miliband]], saw a small increase in its share of the vote to 30.4%, but incurred a net loss of seats to return 232 MPs. This was its lowest seat tally since the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]]. Senior Labour [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] members, notably [[Ed Balls]], [[Douglas Alexander]], and [[Scottish Labour]] leader [[Jim Murphy]], were defeated. The [[Scottish National Party]], enjoying a surge in support after the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], recorded a number of swings of over 30% from Labour, as it won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats to become the third-largest party in the Commons.

The Liberal Democrats, led by outgoing Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]], had their worst result since their formation in 1988, holding just eight out of their previous 57 seats, with Cabinet ministers [[Vince Cable]], [[Ed Davey]] and [[Danny Alexander]] losing their seats. [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] came third in terms of votes with 12.6%, but won only [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|one seat]], with party leader [[Nigel Farage]] failing to win the seat of [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|South Thanet]]. The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] won its highest-ever share of the vote with 3.8%, and retained [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|its only seat]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/a-victorious-caroline-lucas-has-perfectly-summed-up-how-negative-our-politics-is-10235534.html |title=A victorious Caroline Lucas has perfectly summed up how negative our politics is |date=8 May 2015 |work=The Independent |access-date=9 May 2015 |first=Tom |last=Bawden}}</ref> Labour's Miliband (as national leader) and Murphy (as Scottish leader) both resigned, as did Clegg. In [[United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Northern Ireland)|Northern Ireland]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] returned to the Commons with two MPs after a five-year absence, while the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] lost its only seat despite an increase in total vote share.

==Election process==
{{See also|Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011}}
The [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] (as amended by the [[Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013]]) led to the dissolution of the 55th Parliament on 30 March 2015 and the scheduling of the election on 7 May, the House of Commons not having voted for an earlier date.<ref name="timetable">{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/general/general-election-timetable-2015/ |title=General election timetable 2015 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |access-date=8 December 2014}}</ref> There were [[2015 United Kingdom local elections|local elections]] on the same day in most of England, with the exception of [[Greater London]]. No other elections were scheduled to take place in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, apart from any local by-elections.

All British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over the age of 18 on the date of the election were permitted to vote. In general elections, voting takes place in all [[list of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]] of the United Kingdom to elect members of parliament (MPs) to seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the dominant (historically termed the [[lower house|lower]]) house of Parliament. Each parliamentary constituency of the United Kingdom elects one MP to the House of Commons using the [[Plurality voting|"first-past-the-post" system]]. If one party obtains a majority of seats, then that party is entitled to form the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]]. If the election results in no single party having a majority, then there is a [[hung parliament]]. In this case, the options for forming the Government are either a [[minority government]] or a [[coalition government]].<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epyl-5w1WBQ |title=Another hung Parliament: what next? |date=18 March 2015 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

Although the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] planned the number of parliamentary seats to be reduced from 650 to 600, through the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] under the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the review of constituencies and reduction in seats was delayed by the [[Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013]] amending the 2011 Act.<ref name=engcomm>{{cite web |title=Closure of 2013 Review |url=http://consultation.boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/news/closure-of-2013-review/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623185421/http://consultation.boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/news/closure-of-2013-review/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 June 2013 |publisher=Boundary Commission for England |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=scotcomm>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/6th_westminster/index.asp |title=Sixth Periodic Review&nbsp;– Index |publisher=Boundary Commission for Scotland |access-date=22 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055510/http://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/6th_westminster/index.asp |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=nicomm>{{cite web |title=The Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland |url=http://www.boundarycommission.org.uk/ |publisher=The Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland |access-date=8 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=walescomm>{{cite web |title=Statement Regarding the 2013 Review of Parliamentary Constituencies |url=http://bcomm-wales.gov.uk/news/bcwnews-jan-13/?lang=en |publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales |access-date=8 February 2013 |date=31 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055340/http://bcomm-wales.gov.uk/news/bcwnews-jan-13/?lang=en |archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref> The next boundary review was set to take place in 2018; thus, the 2015 general election was contested using the same constituencies and boundaries as in 2010. Of the 650 constituencies, 533 were in England, 59 in Scotland, 40 in Wales and 18 in Northern Ireland.

In addition, the 2011 Act mandated a [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|referendum in 2011]] on changing from the current "first-past-the-post" system to an [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] (instant-runoff) system for elections to the Commons. The [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement]] committed the coalition government to such a referendum.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8677933.stm |title=Full text: Conservative-LibDem deal |publisher=BBC News |date=12 May 2010 |access-date=3 May 2013}}</ref> The referendum was held in May 2011 and [[Results of the United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|resulted in the retention]] of the existing voting system. Before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|previous general election]] the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] had pledged to change the voting system, and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] pledged to have a referendum about any such change.<ref name="Where They Stand: Guide to party election policies"/> The Conservatives, however, promised to keep the first-past-the-post system, but to reduce the number of constituencies by 10%. Liberal Democrat plans were to reduce the number of MPs to 500, and for them to be elected using a proportional system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consoc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/howstrongisthecaseforreducingthenumberofmps.pdf |title=How Strong is the Case for Reducing the Number of MPs? |publisher=Democratic Audit |access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19166125 |title=Q&A&nbsp;– Boundary Changes |publisher=BBC News |access-date=8 September 2013 |date=29 January 2013}}</ref>

Ministers increased the amount of money that parties and candidates were allowed to spend on the election by 23%, a move decided against [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] advice.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/13/tories-david-cameron-buy-election-campaign-spending?guni=Keyword:news-grid%20main-1%20Main%20trailblock:Editable%20trailblock%20-%20news:Position3 |title=Tories accused of 'trying to buy election' with 23% hike to campaign spending |work=The Guardian |date=13 December 2014 |access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref> The election saw the first cap on spending by parties in individual constituencies during the 100 days before Parliament's dissolution on 30 March: £30,700, plus a per-voter allowance of 9p in county constituencies and 6p in borough seats. An additional voter allowance of more than £8,700 is available after the dissolution of Parliament. UK political parties spent £31.1m in the 2010 general election, of which the Conservative Party spent 53%, the Labour Party spent 25% and the Liberal Democrats 15%.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30477250 |title=2015 election campaign officially begins on Friday |publisher=BBC News |date=18 December 2014 |access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref>

An election is called following the [[dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The 2015 general election was the first to be held under the provisions of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]]. Prior to this, the power to dissolve Parliament was a [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]], exercised by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]] on the advice of the prime minister. Under the provisions of the [[Septennial Act 1716]], as amended by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], an election had to be announced on or before the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the previous parliament, barring exceptional circumstances. No sovereign had refused a request for dissolution since the beginning of the 20th century, and the practice had evolved that a prime minister would typically call a general election to be held at a tactically convenient time within the final two years of a Parliament's lifespan, to maximise the chance of an electoral victory for his or her party.<ref>''Twentieth-Century British Political Facts 1900–2000'', by David Butler and Gareth Butler (Macmillan Press 2000 {{ISBN|0-333-77222-9}}), page 451 ''Use of Royal Power''</ref>

Prior to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats pledged to introduce [[fixed-term election]]s.<ref name="Where They Stand: Guide to party election policies">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8515961.stm#subject=constitution |title=Where They Stand: Guide to party election policies |publisher=BBC News |date=26 March 2010}}</ref> As part of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron ministry]] agreed to support legislation for fixed-term Parliaments, with the date of the next general election being 7 May 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/12/lib-dem-tory-deal-coalition|title=Full text of the Conservative&nbsp;– Liberal Democrat coalition deal|date=12 May 2010|access-date=12 May 2010|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian}}</ref> This resulted in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which removed the prime minister's power to advise the monarch to call an early election. The Act only permits an early dissolution if Parliament votes for one by a two-thirds [[supermajority]], or if a [[vote of no confidence]] is passed by a majority and no new government is subsequently formed within 14 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100705/debtext/100705-0001.htm#10070511000001|title=House of Commons Debate 5 July 2010 c 23|date=5 July 2010|access-date=8 September 2013|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> However, the prime minister had the power, by order made by [[Statutory Instrument (UK)|Statutory Instrument]] under section 1(5) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, to fix the polling day to be up to two months later than 7 May 2015. Such a Statutory Instrument must be approved by each House of Parliament. Under section 14 of the [[Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013]], the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was amended to extend the period between the dissolution of Parliament and the following general election polling day from 17 to 25 working days. This had the effect of moving forward the date of the dissolution of the Parliament to 30 March 2015.<ref name=timetable/>

{{As of|2015|04|9}}, the deadline for standing for the general election, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]'s Register of Political Parties included 428 political parties registered in Great Britain,<ref>{{cite web |title=Party Finance – the Electoral Commission |url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/Search/Registrations?currentPage=1&rows=10&sort=RegulatedEntityName&order=asc&open=filter&et=pp&et=ppm&register=gb&regStatus=registered |date=18 April 2015 |work=Electoral Commission |access-date=18 April 2015}}</ref> and 36 in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/Search/Registrations?currentPage=1&rows=10&sort=RegulatedEntityName&order=asc&open=filter&et=pp&et=ppm&register=ni&regStatus=registered|date=18 April 2015|work=Electoral Commission|access-date=18 April 2015 |title=Search – The Electoral Commission}}</ref> Candidates who did not belong to a registered party could use an "independent" label, or no label at all.

The Conservative Party and the Labour Party had been the two biggest parties since [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], and had supplied all UK prime ministers since 1935. Polls predicted that these parties would together receive between 65% and 75% of votes, and would together win between 80% and 85% of seats;<ref>{{cite web |title=Who is ahead in the polls? |url=http://may2015.com/category/poll-of-polls/ |work=New Statesman |access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="May2015 Pred">{{cite web |title=Can any party win a majority?|url=http://may2015.com/category/seat-calculator/ |publisher=New Statesman |access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref> and that, as such, the leader of one of those parties would be the prime minister after the election. The Liberal Democrats had been the third party in the UK for many years; but as described by various commentators, other parties had risen relative to the Liberal Democrats since the 2010 election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://may2015.com/featured/may2015s-100-graph-guide-to-the-election-every-issue-covered/ |title=May2015's 100-graph guide to the election – every issue covered |work=May2015: 2015 General Election Guide |access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/28/election-polls-point-to-tory-labour-tie-and-three-party-alliance |title=Election polls point to Tory-Labour tie and three-party alliance |first=Alberto |last=Nardelli |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=7 March 2015|date=28 January 2015}}</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' described a "familiar two-and-a-half-party system" (Conservatives, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats) that "appears to be breaking down" with the rise of the [[UK Independence Party|United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] and the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP).<ref>"Refighting old battles", ''The Economist'' (10–16 January 2015), '''414'''(8290):23–4</ref> ''[[Newsnight]]''<ref name="ReferenceA">''Newsnight'', BBC2, 5 January 2015</ref> and ''The Economist''<ref>"The great fracturing", ''The Economist'' (21–7 February 2015), '''414'''(8296):11</ref> described the country as moving into a six-party system, with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, UKIP and Greens all being significant.

Several parties operate in specific regions only. The main national parties, standing for seats across all (or most of) the country, are listed below in order of seats being contested:

* [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]: led by [[David Cameron]], the prime minister. The Conservative Party was the larger party in the coalition government, having won the most seats (306) at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]]. The party stood in 647 seats (every seat except for two in Northern Ireland and the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]'s seat).
* [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]: led by [[Ed Miliband]], the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the opposition]]. Labour had been in power from 1997 to 2010. The party constituted [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition]] (also called the Official Opposition) after the 2010 election, having won 258 seats. It stood in 631 constituencies,<ref group=n>After nominations had closed and ballot papers were printed, the Labour candidate in [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]], Sumon Hoque, was suspended from the Labour Party when he was charged with multiple driving offences, and the Labour candidate in [[Wellingborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Wellingborough]], Richard Garvie, was also suspended after a conviction for fraud</ref> missing only the Speaker's seat. The Labour Party does not stand candidates for election in Northern Ireland.
* [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]: led by [[Nick Clegg]], the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|deputy prime minister]]. The Liberal Democrats were the junior member of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|2010–15 coalition government]], having won 57 seats. They contested the same 631 seats as the Labour Party. The party did not stand candidates in Northern Ireland.
* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP): led by [[Nigel Farage]], a [[Member of the European Parliament]], who had not previously been in parliament but was standing in [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|South Thanet]] in the general election. UKIP won the fourth-most votes at the 2010 election, but failed to win any seats. It subsequently won two seats at by-elections in 2014—both having been sitting Conservative MPs who resigned from the party, stood down voluntarily from their seat to fight a by-election, and won it for their new party - and won the highest share of votes at the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014 European elections]]. It contested 624 seats across the United Kingdom.<ref group=n>After nominations had closed and ballot papers were printed, two UKIP candidates were suspended from the party for offensive comments.</ref>
* Green parties: three distinct but co-operating Green parties operate in the UK: the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] (GPEW), the [[Green Party of Northern Ireland]] and the [[Scottish Green Party]]. The Green Party of England and Wales was led by [[Natalie Bennett]], who had not previously been elected to Westminster, but stood in [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras]] at the general election. The GPEW won the fourth-largest share of votes in the 2014 European elections, ahead of the Liberal Democrats. The Green Party of Northern Ireland was led by [[Stephen Agnew]]. To date, the Green Party has made little impact in general elections in Northern Ireland, though they are generally slightly more successful in [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|South Belfast]] and [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]] and in local elections. The party worked closely with the other Green parties and with the [[Green Party of Ireland]]. The Scottish Green Party is co-led by [[Patrick Harvie]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] and [[councillor]] [[Maggie Chapman]], neither of whom were standing for election to Westminster. [[Caroline Lucas]] was elected as the only Green MP in 2010, in which the three parties received a combined 1% of the vote and were seventh overall. The Greens stood in 573 seats.

====Minor parties====
Dozens of other minor parties stood in 2015. The [[Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition]], founded as an [[electoral alliance]] of socialist parties in 2010, had 135 candidates and was the only other party to have more than forty candidates.<ref name=Crow>{{cite web|title=Party co-founded by Bob Crow to launch manifesto|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2015-04-10/party-co-founded-by-bob-crow-to-launch-election-manifesto/|publisher=ITV.com|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> [[Respect Party|Respect]] came into the election with one MP ([[George Galloway]]), who was elected at the [[2012 Bradford West by-election]], but stood just four candidates. The [[British National Party]], which finished fifth with 1.9% of the vote for its 338 candidates at the 2010 general election, stood only eight candidates following a collapse in support.<ref name="Eardley"/> 753 other candidates stood at the general election, including all independents, Scottish-based, Northern Ireland-based and Wales-based party candidates, and candidates from other parties.<ref name="Eardley"/>

===Northern Ireland===
{{see also|List of political parties in Northern Ireland}}
The main parties in Northern Ireland (which had 18 constituencies) described by Ofcom,<ref name="stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk"/> the BBC<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/2015/election_guidelines|title=Trust launches further consultation on the BBC's guidelines for its coverage of the May 2015 elections – BBC Trust|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> and others, in order of seats won, were:
* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP): the DUP won eight seats in 2010, making it the largest Northern Ireland political party, and the fourth biggest in the UK as a whole. The party also won the [[2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election]], but was second in the [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)#2014|2014 European election]]. It contested 16 Northern Irish constituencies, having entered into an electoral pact with the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] in the remaining two.
* [[Sinn Féin]]: Sinn Féin won the most votes in Northern Ireland in 2010, but came second in seats, winning five constituencies. It was second in the 2011 Assembly elections, but first in the 2014 European elections. Sinn Féin follows an [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] policy with respect to the Commons, and has never so far taken its seats there. The party also operates in the [[Republic of Ireland]], where it does take seats in parliament. It was standing in all 18 Northern Irish constituencies. Michelle Gildernew lost her seat in 2015, which she had held by only 4 votes in 2010, thus reducing the SF MPs from 5 to 4.
* [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP): the SDLP was third in terms of votes and seats in the 2010 and 2011 elections, and fourth in the 2014 European elections. Prior to dissolution, the party had three MPs. The SDLP has a relationship with the Labour Party in Great Britain, with SDLP MPs generally following the Labour whip. The party was expected to have supported Labour in the event of a hung Parliament<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/15/northern-ireland-sdlp-rules-out-general-election-pact-sinn-fein|title=Northern Ireland: SDLP rules out general election pact with Sinn Féin|first=Henry|last=McDonald|work=The Guardian|date=15 November 2014}}</ref> and contested all 18 constituencies at the election.
* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP): in 2010 the UUP shared [[Ulster Conservatives and Unionists|an electoral alliance]] with the Conservative Party, and finished fourth in terms of votes in Northern Ireland, but won no seats. The party has one MEP, having placed third in the 2014 European elections. It was fourth in the 2011 Assembly elections. The UUP contested 15 seats; the party did not run in two seats because of its electoral pact with the DUP, and also did not nominate a candidate against former UUP member and incumbent independent MP [[Sylvia Hermon]].<ref>[http://uup.org/news/3404/Ulster-Unionist-Party-to-back-Lady-Sylvia-Hermon-in-North-Down Ulster Unionist Party to back Lady Sylvia Hermon in North Down] Ulster Unionist Party, 25 February 2015</ref>
* [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]]: the Alliance Party had one MP, [[Naomi Long]], who had been elected for the first time in 2010. (Long lost her seat in 2015.) It was fifth in the 2010 election by vote share, fifth overall in 2011 and sixth in 2014. Alliance has a relationship with the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain: the party's former leader sits in the House of Lords as a Liberal Democrat, but Alliance's one MP elected in 2010 sat on the opposition benches in the Commons and not with the Liberal Democrats on the government benches. The party contested all 18 Northern Irish constituencies in 2015.

Smaller parties in Northern Ireland included [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (standing in seven seats) and the [[Green Party in Northern Ireland]] (standing in five seats). In 2015 TUV and the Greens each held one seat in the [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|Legislative Assembly]]. The [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]] seat was retained by independent [[Sylvia Hermon]]. The [[Northern Ireland Conservatives]] and UKIP fielded candidates, whereas Labour and the Liberal Democrats do not contest elections in Northern Ireland.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/10/ukip-fills-vacuum-left-westminster-parties-northern-ireland Ukip fills a vacuum left by Westminster parties in Northern Ireland] New Statesmen, 27 October 2015</ref>

===Scotland===
{{see also|List of political parties in Scotland}}
* [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP): led by [[Nicola Sturgeon]], who is [[First Minister of Scotland]] and did not stand in the general election. The SNP only contested seats in Scotland and stood in all 59 Scottish constituencies. The party received the second-most votes in Scotland and sixth-most overall in 2010, winning six seats. It won the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 election to the Scottish Parliament]] and had a surge of support since the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence referendum]] in September 2014, in which it was the main political party behind the losing Yes campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commonslibraryblog.com/2015/01/13/voter-trends-in-2014-and-lessons-for-the-2015-general-election/|title=Voter Trends in 2014 and lessons for the 2015 General Election|work=Second reading|access-date=13 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401013305/http://commonslibraryblog.com/2015/01/13/voter-trends-in-2014-and-lessons-for-the-2015-general-election/|archive-date=1 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Most projections suggested that it would be the third-largest party overall after the 2015 election, in terms of seats won, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.<ref name="May2015 Pred"/>

Smaller parties in Scotland include the [[Scottish Libertarian Party]], but none of the smaller parties make much of an impact in general elections in Scotland.

===Wales===
{{see also|List of political parties in Wales}}
* [[Plaid Cymru]]: led by [[Leanne Wood]], who is a [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|member of the Welsh Assembly]] and did not stand in the general election. Plaid Cymru organises only in Wales, where it contested all forty Welsh constituencies. The party has three MPs and was fourth in Wales (eighth overall) by vote share in 2010, later finishing third in the [[2011 National Assembly for Wales election|2011 Welsh Assembly elections]].

Wales has a number of smaller parties which, again, do not tend to make much impact in the general elections. In 2015, the Labour Party continued to dominate Welsh politics at the general elections.

===Pacts and possible coalitions===
Coalitions have been rare in the United Kingdom, because the first-past-the-post system has usually led to one party winning an overall majority in the Commons. However, with the outgoing Government being a coalition and with opinion polls not showing a large or consistent lead for any one party, there was much discussion about possible post-election coalitions or other arrangements, such as [[confidence and supply]] agreements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://may2015.com/featured/heres-what-we-already-know-about-the-24-hours-after-the-election|title=Here's what we already know about the 24 hours after the election|work=May2015: 2015 General Election Guide|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref>

Some UK political parties that only stand in part of the country have reciprocal relationships with parties standing in other parts of the country. These include:
* Labour (in Great Britain) and SDLP (in Northern Ireland)
* Liberal Democrats (in Great Britain) and Alliance (in Northern Ireland)
* SNP (in Scotland) and Plaid Cymru (in Wales)
** Plaid Cymru also recommended supporters in England to vote Green,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/plaid-cymru-urges-supporters-living-8531745|title=Plaid Cymru urges supporters living in England to vote Green|first=David|last=Williamson|date=28 January 2015|work=walesonline|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> while the SNP leader [[Nicola Sturgeon]] said she would vote for Plaid Cymru were she in Wales, and Green were she in England.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-31878269|title=Politics Live – 16 March|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> However, Sturgeon also said that, if their candidate was the most progressive, she would vote for Labour were she in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDNAPE9b59c&t=105|title=Last Leg Meets Nicola Sturgeon - The Last Leg|website=YouTube|date=1 May 2015|access-date=9 January 2020|publisher=The Last Leg}}</ref>
* Green Party of England and Wales (in England and Wales), Scottish Greens (in Scotland) and the Green Party in Northern Ireland (in Northern Ireland)

On 17 March 2015 the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party agreed an election pact, whereby the DUP would not stand candidates in [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] (where [[Michelle Gildernew]], the [[Sinn Féin]] candidate, won by only four votes in 2010) and in [[Newry and Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry and Armagh]]. In return the UUP would stand aside in [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] and [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]]. The SDLP rejected a similar pact suggested by Sinn Féin to try to ensure that an agreed nationalist would win that constituency.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-31558133|title=Arlene Foster says DUP and UUP in election pact talks|publisher=BBC News|access-date=7 March 2015|date=21 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/sdlp-rejects-call-for-electoral-pact-with-sinn-fein-30742293.html|title=SDLP rejects call for electoral pact with Sinn Fein|work=The Belfast Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-31941035|title=Election 2015: SDLP reject Sinn Féin proposal for pact|publisher=BBC News|date=18 March 2015}}</ref> The DUP also called on voters in Scotland to support whichever pro-Union candidate was best placed to beat the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/26/conservative-party-is-losing-our-support-over-scotland-warns-dup|title=Conservative Party is losing our support over Scotland, warns DUP|first=Nicholas|last=Watt|work=The Guardian|date=26 April 2015|access-date=25 September 2015}}</ref>

==Campaign==

===Constitutional affairs===
The Conservative manifesto committed to "a straight in-out referendum on our membership of the European Union by the end of 2017". Labour did not support this, but did commit to a referendum on "[any further] transfer of powers from Britain to the European Union". The Lib Dems also supported the Labour position, but explicitly supported the UK's continuing membership of the EU.

In relation to Scotland, the Conservative manifesto also stated "and the question of Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom is now settled". None of the three major party manifestos supported a second referendum.

===Government finance===
The deficit, who was responsible for it and plans to deal with it were a major theme of the campaign. While some smaller parties opposed austerity,<ref name="partyofwales.org"/> the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP all supported some further cuts, albeit to different extents.

Conservative campaigning sought to blame the deficit on the previous Labour government. Labour, in return, sought to establish their fiscal responsibility. With the Conservatives also making several spending commitments (''e.g.'' on the NHS), commentators talked of the two main parties' "political crossdressing", each trying to campaign on the other's traditional territory.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21648709-both-conservative-and-labour-manifestos-are-triumphs-political-realism-not|work=The Economist|title=The Cross Dressers|date=18 April 2015}}</ref>

===Possibility of a hung Parliament===
[[Hung Parliament]]s have been unusual in post-War British political history, but with the outgoing Government a coalition and opinion polls not showing a large or consistent lead for any one party, it was widely expected and predicted throughout the election campaign that no party would gain an overall majority, which could have led to a new coalition or other arrangements such as [[confidence and supply]] agreements.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://may2015.com/featured/heres-what-we-already-know-about-the-24-hours-after-the-election/ |title=Here's what we already know about the 24 hours after the election |work=May2015: 2015 General Election Guide |access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> This was also associated with a rise in multi-party politics, with increased support for UKIP, the SNP and the Greens.

The question of what the different parties would do in the event of a hung result dominated much of the campaign. Smaller parties focused on the power this would bring them in negotiations; Labour and the Conservatives both insisted that they were working towards winning a majority government, while they were also reported to be preparing for the possibility of a second election in the year.<ref name="channel4.com">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.channel4.com/gary-gibbon-on-politics/hung-parliament-predictions-harden-coalition-recedes/30051 |title=Hung parliament predictions harden, coalition recedes – Gary Gibbon on Politics |access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> In practice, Labour were prepared to make a "broad" offer to the Liberal Democrats in the event of a hung Parliament.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/03/undoing-of-ed-miliband-and-how-labour-lost-election |title=The undoing of Ed Miliband – and how Labour lost the election |work=The Guardian |date=4 February 2015 |access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref> Most predictions saw Labour as having more potential support in Parliament than the Conservatives, with several parties, notably the SNP, having committed to keeping out a Conservative government.<ref>{{cite web |title=Election 2015: Polls suggest Ed Miliband is likely to become Prime Minister |url=http://may2015.com/featured/election-2015-polls-suggest-ed-miliband-is-likely-to-become-prime-minister/ |publisher=May2015 |access-date=6 May 2015}}</ref><ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-tories-are-on-to-a-loser-if-the-election-comes-down-to-horse-trading-10125139.html |title=The Tories are on to a loser if the election comes down to horse trading |work=The Independent |first=John |last=Rentoul |date=22 March 2015}}</ref>

Throughout [[List of Parliaments of the United Kingdom|the 55th parliament of the United Kingdom]], first and second place in the polls without exception alternated between the Conservatives and Labour. Labour took a lead in the polls in the second half of 2010, driven in part by a collapse in Liberal Democrat support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/date/2010/12 |title=end of year roundup labour |publisher=UK Polling Report}}</ref> This lead rose to approximately 10 points over the Conservative Party during 2012, whose ratings dipped alongside an increase in UKIP support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/date/2012/12 |title=Happy New Year |publisher=UK Polling Report}}</ref> UKIP passed the Liberal Democrats as the third-most popular party at the start of 2013.

UKIP received 26.6% of the vote at the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European elections]] in 2014, and though their support in the polls for Westminster never reached this level, it did rise up to over 15% through that year.<ref name="2014 UKPR">{{cite web|title=Six opinion poll findings from 2014|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/date/2014/12|publisher=UK Polling Report|access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref> 2014 was also marked by the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence referendum]]. Despite the 'No' vote winning, support for the [[Scottish National Party]] rose quickly after the referendum, and had reached 43% in Scotland by the end of the year, up 23 points from the 2010 general election, largely at the expense of Labour (&minus;16 points in Scotland) and the Liberal Democrats (&minus;13 points).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Tom|title=Labour set for a bloodbath in Scotland in general election, poll says|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/26/labour-bloodbath-scotland-general-election-2015-snp-westminster|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=5 May 2015|date=26 December 2014}}</ref> In Wales, where polls were less frequent, the 2012–2014 period saw a smaller decline in Labour's lead over the second-placed Conservative Party, from 28 points to 17.<ref name="Wales">{{cite web|last1=Scully|first1=Roger|title=What the Welsh Polls Say (and have said)|url=http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/electionsinwales/2015/04/27/what-the-welsh-polls-say-and-have-said|website=Elections in Wales|access-date=5 May 2015|date=27 April 2015}}</ref> These votes went mainly to UKIP (+8 points) and Plaid Cymru (+2 points).

===Predictions one month before the vote===
The first-past-the-post system used in UK general elections means that the number of seats won is not closely related to vote share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://may2015.com/featured/would-you-like-5-million-votes-and-4-seats-or-1-million-votes-and-56-seats/|title=Would you like 5 million votes and 4 seats, or 1&nbsp;million votes and 56 seats?|work=May2015: 2015 General Election Guide|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> Thus, several approaches were used to convert polling data and other information into seat predictions. The table below lists some of the predictions. ElectionForecast was used by ''[[Newsnight]]'' and [[FiveThirtyEight]]. May2015.com is a project run by the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine.<ref name="harrylambert">{{cite web|url=http://may2015.com/featured/welcome-to-may-2015/|title=Welcome to May2015.com|first=Harry|last=Lambert|publisher=may2015.com}}</ref>

Seat predictions draw from nationwide polling, polling in the constituent nations of Britain and may additionally incorporate [[Opinion polling in United Kingdom constituencies, 2010–15|constituency level polling]], particularly the Ashcroft polls. Approaches may or may not use [[uniform national swing]] (UNS). Approaches may just use current polling, ''i.e.'' a "nowcast" (''e.g.'' Electoral Calculus, May2015.com and ''The Guardian''), or add in a predictive element about how polling shifts based on historical data (''e.g.'' ElectionForecast and Elections Etc.).<ref name="chrishanretty">{{cite web |url=http://www.electionforecast.co.uk |title=ElectionForecast.co.uk |first=Chris |last=Hanretty |publisher=electionforecast.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507021438/http://www.electionforecast.co.uk/ |archive-date=7 May 2015}}</ref> An alternative approach is to use the [[wisdom of the crowd]] and base a prediction on betting activity: the Spreadex and Sporting Index columns below cover bets on the number of seats each party will win with the midpoint between asking and selling price, while FirstPastThePost.net aggregates the betting predictions in each individual constituency. Some predictions cover Northern Ireland, with its distinct political culture, while others do not. Parties are sorted by current number of seats in the House of Commons:

This predicted the Conservatives to be 10 seats short of an absolute majority, although with the 5 predicted Sinn Féin MPs not taking their seats, it was likely to be enough to govern. (In the event, [[Michelle Gildernew]] lost her seat, reducing the number of Sinn Féin MPs to 4.)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32633099|title=Election results: Conservatives win majority|publisher=BBC News|date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

The exit poll was markedly different from the pre-election opinion polls,<ref>''Election 2015'', BBC</ref> which had been fairly consistent; this led many pundits and MPs to speculate that the exit poll was inaccurate, and that the final result would have the two main parties closer to each other. Former Liberal Democrat leader [[Paddy Ashdown]] vowed to "eat his hat" and former Labour "spin doctor" [[Alastair Campbell]] promised to "eat his kilt" if the exit poll, which predicted huge losses for their respective parties, was right.<ref name="Hatkiltcake">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-paddy-ashdown-handed-chocolate-hat-on-question-time-then-alistair-campbell-receives-edible-kilt-10237838.html General Election 2015: Paddy Ashdown handed chocolate hat on Question Time, then Alastair Campbell receives edible kilt] The Independent, 8 May 2015</ref>

As it turned out, the results were even more favourable to the Conservatives than the poll predicted, with the Conservatives obtaining 330 seats, an absolute majority.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11475225/results-time-and-facts.html|title=UK election results – what does it all mean?

With the eventual outcome in terms of both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company [[Survation]] claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% on the day of the election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comres.co.uk/wheres-the-late-swing/|title=Where's the late swing? " ComRes|publisher=comres.co.uk|access-date=14 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925210152/http://comres.co.uk/wheres-the-late-swing/|archive-date=25 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the ''Daily Mirror'') on the concern that it was too much of an outlier with other poll results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/survation-unpublished-poll-general-election-result-2015-5?r=US|title=Survation alleges it called the British General Election 2015 results accurately, didn't publish|date=12 May 2015|work=Business Insider}}</ref>

However, it was reported that pollsters had in fact picked up a late swing to Labour immediately prior to polling day, not the Conservatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20150507-uk-elections-final-polls-show-late-surge-labour-but-hung-parliament-still-likely|title=Europe – UK election: Final polls show late surge for Labour, but hung parliament still likely|publisher=France 24|date=7 May 2015}}</ref> It was reported after the election that private pollsters working for the two largest parties actually gathered more accurate results, with Labour's pollster James Morris claiming that the issue was largely to do with surveying technique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/late-swing-labours-private-polls-showed-tories-ahead-christmas|title=Late swing? Labour's private polls showed Tories ahead before Christmas|work=New Statesman}}</ref> Morris claimed that telephone polls that immediately asked for voting intentions tended to get a high "Don't know" or anti-government reaction, whereas longer telephone conversations conducted by private polls that collected other information such as views on the leaders' performances placed voters in a much better mode to give their true voting intentions.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Another theory was the issue of '[[Shy Tory Factor|shy Tories]]' not wanting to openly declare their intention to vote Conservative to pollsters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/12/polls-shy-tories-left-conservatives|title=If you want more accurate polls, stop shaming shy Tories|first=Lionel|last=Shriver|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> A final theory, put forward after the election, was the 'Lazy Labour' factor, which claimed that Labour voters tend to not vote on polling day whereas Conservative voters have a much higher turnout.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/22/election-2015-who-voted-for-whom-labour-conservatives-turnout Election 2015: who voted for whom], ''The Guardian'', 22 May 2015. Retrieved 25 September 2015.</ref>

The [[British Polling Council]] announced an inquiry into the substantial variance between the opinion polls and the actual election result.<ref>[http://www.britishpollingcouncil.org/general-election-7-may-2015/ General Election: 7 May 2015] British Polling Council, 8 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32652104|title=Election 2015: Inquiry into opinion poll failures|publisher=BBC News| date=8 May 2015}}</ref> The inquiry published preliminary findings in January 2016, concluding that "the ways in which polling samples are constructed was the primary cause of the polling miss".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ncrm.ac.uk/polling/document/FINAL_Polling_Inquiry_Press_Notice_January_2016_final.pdf |title = General Election Opinion Poll Inquiry releases preliminary findings |date = 19 January 2016 }}</ref> Their final report was published in March 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3789/1/Report_final_revised.pdf |title = Report of the Inquiry into the 2015 British general election opinion polls |date = 1 March 2016 }}</ref>

The British Election Study team have suggested that weighting error appears to be the cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-impact/missing-non-voters-and-misweighted-samples-understanding-the-great-british-polling-miss/ |title=Missing non-voters and mis-weighted samples |publisher=British Election Study}}</ref>

Despite most opinion polls predicting that the Conservatives and Labour were neck and neck, the Conservatives secured a surprise victory after having won a clear lead over their rivals and incumbent Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] was able to form a [[Second Cameron ministry|majority single-party government]] with a working majority of 12 (in practice increased to 15 due to [[Sinn Féin]]'s four MPs' [[Abstentionism|abstention]]). Thus the result bore resemblance to [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/db4d60b2-f574-11e4-bc6d-00144feab7de.html |title=It is 1992 all over again for David Cameron's Conservatives|work=Financial Times |access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref> The Conservatives gained 38 seats while losing 10, all to Labour; Employment Minister [[Esther McVey]], in [[Wirral West (UK Parliament constituency)|Wirral West]], was the most senior Conservative to lose her seat. Cameron became the first Prime Minister since [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] in [[1900 United Kingdom general election|1900]] to increase his popular vote share after a full term, and is sometimes credited as being the only Prime Minister other than [[Margaret Thatcher]] (in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]) to be re-elected with a greater number of seats for his party after a 'full term'{{#tag:ref|In the 20th century so few Parliaments lasted the full five-year term that some commentators regarded four years as being a 'full term', thus calling the 1979–83 Parliament a 'full term'|group= n}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1480233/cameron-promises-britain-something-special |title=Cameron Promises Britain 'Something Special' |date=8 May 2015 |publisher=Sky News |access-date=5 January 2016}}</ref>

[[File:2015 UK general election constituency map.svg|thumb|A map of the results, showing each constituency as a hexagon of equal size, with the black lines showing separations in regions]]

The Labour Party polled below expectations, winning 30.4% of the vote and 232 seats, 24 fewer than its previous result in 2010—even though in 222 constituencies there was a Conservative-to-Labour swing, as against 151 constituencies where there was a Labour-to-Conservative swing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.london.gov.uk/blog/the-2015-election-the-numbers-behind-the-result/|title=The 2015 election – the numbers behind the result |author=Gareth Piggott |date=19 May 2015 |work=data.london.gov.uk |access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> Its net loss of seats were mainly a result of its resounding defeat in [[Scotland]], where the [[Scottish National Party]] took 40 of Labour's 41 seats, unseating key politicians such as shadow Foreign Secretary [[Douglas Alexander]] and [[Scottish Labour]] leader [[Jim Murphy]]. Labour also lost a further nine seats to the Conservatives, recording its lowest share of the seats since the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Live election results |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/may/07/live-uk-election-results-in-full |date=7 May 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref> [[Ed Miliband]] subsequently tendered his resignation as Labour leader.

The Scottish National Party had a stunning election, rising from just 6 seats to 56 – winning all but 3 of the constituencies in Scotland and securing 50% of the popular vote in Scotland.<ref name="Results Scotland"/> They recorded a number of record breaking swings of over 30% including the new record of 39.3% in [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]]. They also won [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|the seat]] of former Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]], overturning a majority of 23,009 to win by a majority of 9,974 votes and saw [[Mhairi Black]], then a 20-year-old student, defeat Labour's [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] [[Douglas Alexander]] with a swing of 26.9%.

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who had been in government as coalition partners, suffered the worst defeat they or the previous Liberal Party had suffered since the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/09/electoral-reform-constitution-lords-first-past-post |title=Our democracy has been shown up. We must now work to change it |first=Matthew |last=Oakeshott |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Winning just eight seats, the Liberal Democrats lost their position as the UK's third party and found themselves tied in fourth place with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] of [[Northern Ireland]] in the House of Commons, with [[Nick Clegg]] being one of the few MPs from his party to retain his seat. The Liberal Democrats gained no seats, while losing 49 in the process—of them, 27 to the Conservatives, 12 to Labour, and 10 to the SNP.

The [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) was only able to hold one of its two seats, [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]], gaining no new ones despite increasing its vote share to 12.9% (the third-highest share overall). Party leader [[Nigel Farage]], having failed to win the constituency of [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|South Thanet]], tendered his resignation, although this was rejected by his party's executive council and he stayed on as leader.

In [[United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Northern Ireland)|Northern Ireland]], the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] returned to the Commons with two MPs after a five-year absence, gaining one seat from the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and one from [[Sinn Féin]], while the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] lost its only Commons seat to the DUP, despite an increase in total vote share.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-northern-ireland-32653373 |title=Election 2015: UUP win two seats and make biggest gain |publisher=BBC News |date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

==Aftermath==

===Resignations===
On 8 May, three party leaders announced their resignations within an hour of each other:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/52-minutes-shook-britain-miliband-5661173|title=52 minutes that shook Britain: Miliband, Clegg and Farage all resign in election bloodbath|date = 8 May 2015|access-date=9 May 2015|website=Mirror|last=Bloom|first=Dan}}</ref> [[Ed Miliband]] (Labour) and [[Nick Clegg]] (Liberal Democrat) resigned due to their parties' worse-than-expected results in the election, although both had been re-elected to their seats in Parliament.<ref name="BBC News 8 May 2015 Miliband resignation">{{cite news|title=Labour election results: Ed Miliband resigns as leader|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32633388|author=Staff|date=8 May 2015|publisher=BBC News|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref><ref name="BBC News 8 May 2015 Clegg resignation">{{cite news|title=Election results: Nick Clegg resigns after Lib Dem losses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32633462|author=Staff|date=8 May 2015|publisher=BBC News|access-date=25 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ed Miliband to step down as Labour leader|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/ed-miliband-to-resign-as-labour-leader|work=The Guardian|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/may/08/election-2015-live-labour-and-libdems-crushed-in-shock-election-result|title=Election 2015 Live: Nick Clegg resigns as Lib Dem leader after 'heartbreaking result'|date=8 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref> [[Nigel Farage]] (UKIP) offered his resignation because he had failed to be elected as MP for [[Thanet South]], but said he might re-stand in the resulting leadership election. However, on 11 May, the UKIP executive rejected his resignation on the grounds that the election campaign had been "a great success",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1481942/ukip-rejects-nigel-farages-resignation|title=UKIP Rejects Nigel Farage's Resignation|publisher=Sky News}}</ref> and Farage agreed to continue as party leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/story/2015-05-11/nigel-farage-to-remain-ukip-leader-after-resignation-rejected|title=Nigel Farage to remain Ukip leader after resignation rejected|work=ITV News}}</ref>

[[Alan Sugar]], a Labour peer in the [[House of Lords]], also announced his resignation from the Labour Party for running what he perceived to be an anti-business campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/11/alan-sugar-resigns-from-labour-party-over-shift-to-left|title=Alan Sugar resigns from Labour party over 'shift to left'|first=Damien|last=Gayle|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

In response to Labour's poor performance in [[Scotland]], [[Scottish Labour]] leader [[Jim Murphy]] initially resisted calls for his resignation by other senior party members. Despite surviving a no-confidence vote by 17–14 from the party's national executive, Murphy announced he would step down as leader on or by 16 May.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32760196|publisher=BBC News|title=Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy to resign|date=16 May 2015}}</ref>

===Financial markets===
Financial markets reacted positively to the result, with the pound sterling rising against the Euro and US dollar when the exit poll was published, and the [[FTSE 100]] stock market index rising 2.3% on 8 May. The BBC reported: "Bank shares saw some of the biggest gains, on hopes that the sector will not see any further rises in levies. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group rose 5.75% while Barclays was 3.7% higher", adding: "Energy firms also saw their share prices rise, as Labour had wanted a price freeze and more powers for the energy regulator. British Gas owner Centrica rose 8.1% and SSE shares were up 5.3%." BBC economics editor [[Robert Peston]] noted: "To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory. There are a few reasons. One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted. Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government – and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge. Third, many investors tend to be economically Conservative and instinctively Conservative."<ref name="BBC News 8 May 2015">{{cite news|title=Shares and pound surge on election outcome|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32644523|last=Peston|first=Robert|date=8 May 2015|publisher=BBC News|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

===Electoral reform===
{{See also|Electoral reform#United Kingdom}}
The disparity between the numbers of votes and the number of seats obtained by the smaller parties gave rise to increased calls for replacement of the '[[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]' voting system with a more proportional system. For example, UKIP had 3.9&nbsp;million votes per seat, whereas SNP had just 26,000 votes per seat, about 150 times greater representation for each vote cast. It is worth noting, however, that UKIP stood in 10 times as many seats as the SNP. Noting that UKIP's 13% share of the overall votes cast had resulted in the election of just one MP, [[Nigel Farage]] argued that the UK's voting system needed reforming, saying: "Personally, I think the first-past-the-post system is bankrupt."<ref name="BBC News 8 May 2015 UKIP">{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage resigns as UKIP leader as the party vote rises|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32633719|author=Staff|date=8 May 2015|publisher=BBC News|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

Re-elected Green Party MP [[Caroline Lucas]] agreed, saying: "The political system in this country is broken [...] It's ever clearer tonight that the time for electoral reform is long overdue, and it's only proportional representation that will deliver a Parliament that is truly legitimate and better reflects the people it is meant to represent."<ref name="BBC News 8 May 2015 Greens">{{cite news|title=Election 2015: Greens' Caroline Lucas wins in Brighton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32633718| author=Staff|date=8 May 2015|publisher=BBC News|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

===''Daily Telegraph'' investigation of abuse of Wikipedia===
Following the election, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' detailed changes to Wikipedia pages made from computers with IP addresses inside Parliament raising suspicion that "MPs or their political parties deliberately hid information from the public online to make candidates appear more electable to voters" and a deliberate attempt to hide embarrassing information from the electorate.<ref name=ben>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11574217/Expenses-and-sex-scandal-deleted-from-MPs-Wikipedia-pages-by-computers-inside-Parliament.html|title=Expenses and sex scandal deleted from MPs' Wikipedia pages by computers inside Parliament|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Ben Riley-Smith|date=26 May 2015|access-date=30 May 2015|location=London, UK}}</ref>

On 21 December 2015, the UK [[Information Commissioner's Office]] fined the [[Telegraph Media Group]] £30,000 for sending 'hundreds of thousands of emails on the day of the general election urging readers to vote Conservative&nbsp;... in a letter from Daily Telegraph editor Chris Evans, attached to the paper's usual morning e-bulletin'.

===Party election spending investigations===

The higher fine for the Conservatives reflected both the extent of the wrongdoing (which extended to the 2014 parliamentary by-elections in [[2014 Clacton by-election|Clacton]], [[2014 Newark by-election|Newark]] and [[2014 Rochester and Strood by-election|Rochester and Strood]]) and 'the unreasonable uncooperative conduct by the Party'.<ref>The Electoral Commission, '[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/222935/Report-in-respect-of-the-Conservative-and-Unionist-Party.pdf Investigation in respect of the Conservative and Unionist Party campaign spending returns for the 2014 European Parliamentary Election, and 2015 UK Parliamentary General Election, and in respect of the 2014 parliamentary by-elections in Clacton, Newark and Rochester and Strood]' (16 March 2017), quoting p. 38.</ref><ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> The Commission also found that the Party Treasurer, Simon Day, may not have fulfilled his obligations under the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] and referred him for investigation to the Metropolitan Police Service.<ref>The Electoral Commission, '[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/222935/Report-in-respect-of-the-Conservative-and-Unionist-Party.pdf Investigation in respect of the Conservative and Unionist Party campaign spending returns for the 2014 European Parliamentary Election, and 2015 UK Parliamentary General Election, and in respect of the 2014 parliamentary by-elections in Clacton, Newark and Rochester and Strood]' (16 March 2017), §§10-11.</ref>

At constituency level, related alleged breaches of spending regulations led to 'unprecedented'<ref name="Guy Basnett 2017"/> police investigations for possible criminal conduct of between 20 and 30 Conservative Party MPs. On 9 May 2017, the Crown Prosecution service decided not to prosecute the vast majority of suspects, saying that "in order to bring a charge, it must be proved that a suspect knew the return was inaccurate and acted dishonestly in signing the declaration.
