The '''Super Bowl LI Halftime show''' took place on February 5, 2017 at [[NRG Stadium]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], as part of [[Super Bowl LI]]. [[Lady Gaga]] headlined the show, with no special guests (the first since [[Super Bowl XLIV]]), performing a medley of her hit songs, including material from her then-most recent studio album, ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016). The performance was met with critical acclaim, and received 6 Emmy Award nominations, winning the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special]].

Gaga began rehearsing for the show in January 2017. Her sister gave her the idea of performing from atop the NRG Stadium; Gaga worked on the logistics behind it. She promoted the performance by uploading short clips on her social media accounts. Fashion house [[Versace]] created the wardrobe for the show with a custom jumpsuit for the singer, while designers Bruce Rodgers and LeRoy Bennett did the show's production work with lighting designer Bob Barnhart of 22 Degrees. The stage was created by All Access Staging & Productions, which had also created previous Super Bowl halftime stages. During the introduction scene, Gaga was accompanied by a fleet of 300 [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] provided by [[Intel]], which formed an image of the American flag behind the singer. It marked the first time the drones had been used as part of a television broadcast.

The halftime show was critically acclaimed, with media outlets praising Gaga for demonstrating artistic and musical qualities. Some argued it was one of the top Super Bowl halftime performances in history. The show was also noted for its acknowledgment of the [[LGBT community]], the perceived political undertones, and the technical achievement of the use of drones. With 117.5 million television viewers, it was the second most-watched Super Bowl halftime show after [[Super Bowl XLIX]] and had higher average viewership than the game itself. Gaga's music catalogue benefited from the performance, with sales growth for all her records. The song "[[Million Reasons]]" from ''Joanne'', which was part of the set list, consequently became her 14th top-ten single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.

The halftime show began on the roof of [[NRG Stadium]]. [[Lady Gaga]] started singing "[[God Bless America]]" as drones swarm behind her emitting red, white and blue color. She then sang [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", followed by the ending of the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]: "One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." Gaga then dove from the rooftop as the drones behind her formed the design of the [[Flag of the United States|US flag]]. The singer came down and stood on a tall pillar across the stage, and performed "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" as fireworks lit up behind her. After the first verse and chorus, Gaga, attached to a harness, bounced from the pillar to the main stage. Her dancers joined her as she sang "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]", which included the track's intermediate spoken verse.

As the performance ended, Gaga headed towards one corner of the stage inside a star-shaped structure and sang "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]". A dancer carried her to the main stage where she held a [[keytar]] and performed "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]". The singer moved from the stage to the ground as the song ended. She reached a podium with a piano and began singing "[[Million Reasons]]"; the audience present on the field drifted off in different directions holding light sticks. Continuing the song, she came down from the podium and hugged members of the audience. For the finale of "[[Bad Romance]]", a team of white-clad dancers strutted across the main stage. Gaga joined them wearing a football inspired costume and performed the track. As fireworks erupted heralding the end of the show, Gaga reached the edge of the stage, shouted "Super Bowl 51", dropped her microphone, and jumped off the stage catching a football.

Around August 2016, media outlets began reporting that [[Adele]] was in discussions with the [[National Football League]] (NFL) to perform at the Super Bowl LI halftime show, on February 5, 2017, at Houston's NRG Stadium. [[Pepsi Zero Sugar]] sponsored the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/music/lady-gaga-planning-powerful-super-bowl-halftime-michael-jackson-springsteen/|title=Lady Gaga Hopes to Deliver 'Powerful' Super Bowl Halftime Show Like Greats Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen|last=Nelson|first=Jeff|date=October 4, 2016|access-date=November 9, 2016|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109012421/https://people.com/music/lady-gaga-planning-powerful-super-bowl-halftime-michael-jackson-springsteen/|archive-date=November 9, 2016}}</ref> During her [[Adele Live 2016]] concert tour in Los Angeles, Adele clarified that although she had been asked to perform by the NFL, she had declined since she did not believe she was suitable for the halftime show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/adele-reveals-she-turned-down-super-bowl-51-halftime-gig-w434388|title=Adele Reveals She Turned Down Super Bowl 51 Halftime Gig|date=August 14, 2016|access-date=November 7, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109221133/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/adele-reveals-she-turned-down-super-bowl-51-halftime-gig-w434388|archive-date=November 9, 2016}}</ref> The NFL explained they had not signed any musician and were still in discussions with several artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7469585/nfl-pepsi-adele-super-bowl-halftime-show-offer|title=Adele Did Not Get Super Bowl Halftime Show Offer, Says NFL and Pepsi|last=Iasimone|first=Ashlee|date=August 14, 2016|access-date=November 8, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109152928/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7469585/nfl-pepsi-adele-super-bowl-halftime-show-offer|archive-date=November 9, 2016}}</ref>

In the meantime [[Lady Gaga]] announced that she would be releasing her fifth studio album, ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'', in October 2016. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that the NFL was is discussions with the singer, because of her performance of the [[List of national anthem performers at the Super Bowl|national anthem]] at the [[Super Bowl 50|previous Super Bowl]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7503762/lady-gaga-super-bowl-halftime-show-talks|title=Lady Gaga In Talks to Play Super Bowl Halftime Show: Sources|last=Halperin|first=Shirley|date=September 13, 2016|access-date=November 8, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115203708/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7503762/lady-gaga-super-bowl-halftime-show-talks|archive-date=November 15, 2016}}</ref> On September 29, 2016, Gaga confirmed on her [[Instagram]] account that she would be performing at the halftime show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/arts/music/lady-gaga-super-bowl-halftime.html|title=Lady Gaga to Headline Super Bowl Halftime Show|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last=Coscarelli|first=Joe|date=September 29, 2016|access-date=October 1, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003060508/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/arts/music/lady-gaga-super-bowl-halftime.html|archive-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref> [[Fox Sports]] president and executive producer of the show, John Entz, confirmed Gaga's involvement. He added, "[She] is one of the most electric performers of our generation, and we couldn't be happier with the choice to have her headline the Super Bowl LI Halftime Show... It is going to be an incredible night."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lady-gaga-super-bowl-halftime-show-2017-headline-934058|title=It's Official: Lady Gaga to Headline 2017 Super Bowl Halftime Show|last=Halperin|first=Shirley|date=September 29, 2016|accessdate=November 8, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

According to Emma Quigley, [[Pepsi]]'s North American head of music, and Justin Toman, Pepsi sports marketing director, choosing Gaga to headline the show made sense based on her previous musical output and endeavors. They considered various parameters—social media followers, record sales, trending topic—and then shortlisted her. Toman also took into account the total time it usually takes for the show—seven minutes for set up, 12 minutes for the main show, and another seven minutes to dismantle—and believed the singer could deliver "power, punch, performance, singing, lights" within that time frame. Pepsi sponsored the halftime show for the fifth-consecutive year.<ref name="pepsiexec">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/super-bowl/7678021/super-bowl-halftime-lady-gaga-preview-pepsi-interview|title=Super Bowl Halftime Will Be 'Uniquely Lady Gaga': Pepsi Execs Promise 'One of the Greatest Halftime Shows Ever'|last=Atkinson|first=Katie|date=February 5, 2017|access-date=February 16, 2017|work=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221005701/http://livedesignonline.com/super-bowl-li-2017-halftime-show/super-bowl-li-halftime-show-credits-and-staff|archive-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref>

In October 2016, Gaga told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' she wanted to give "the best show for the football fans, the ones that are watching at home". Although indecisive about the set list, the singer wanted to play a mixture of her past and recent songs. She also confirmed that the NFL heard ''Joanne'' before its release and decided to offer her the halftime performance slot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/21/lady-gaga-joanne-interview-dive-bar-tour-super-bowl|title=Lady Gaga: Joanne sealed my Super Bowl halftime show deal|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Feeney|first=Nolan|date=October 21, 2016|access-date=November 10, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123131002/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/21/lady-gaga-joanne-interview-dive-bar-tour-super-bowl|archive-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref> Her inspiration came from earlier halftime performances by [[Michael Jackson]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]].

===Rehearsals===
By January 2017, Gaga began posting images on her social media accounts, showing her practicing for the show. She built a tent in her backyard where she rehearsed with her dancers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7655356/lady-gaga-preps-for-super-bowl-with-backyard-dance-floor-horse-rides|title=Lady Gaga Preps For Super Bowl Gig with Backyard Dance Floor, Horse Rides|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=January 17, 2017|access-date=January 17, 2017|work=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118094043/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7655356/lady-gaga-preps-for-super-bowl-with-backyard-dance-floor-horse-rides|archive-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> The group rehearsed in it for more than a week, then moved to larger venues in Hollywood to work on the rest of the show. Finally, all the equipment was sent to Houston, where the final rehearsals took place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/7091286-lady-gaga-s-career-spanning-show/|title=Lady Gaga's career spanning show|date=January 29, 2017|access-date=January 31, 2017|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827093658/https://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/7091286-lady-gaga-s-career-spanning-show/|archive-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref> Gaga enlisted vocal coach Don Lawrence to help her [[Belting (music)|belt]] out the correct notes.

Pepsi uploaded a behind-the-scenes video from the rehearsals, where Gaga explained the main challenge was how to make the halftime performance different from the preceding years but keep it still about the music. Choreographer [[Richard Jackson (choreographer)|Richy Jackson]] was shown in the middle of a session with the dancers, displaying the characteristic moves from the song, "[[Bad Romance]]" (2009). Jackson said the dancers were hand-picked and had worked before with the singer. He added the show would unveil a different aspect of Gaga, since she had never had the opportunity to perform on a big world stage like the Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a33483/lady-gaga-superbowl-halftime-show-preview/|title=Here's A First Look At Lady Gaga's Super Bowl Halftime Show|last=Jones|first=Katie|date=January 17, 2017|access-date=January 18, 2017|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119052006/http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a33483/lady-gaga-superbowl-halftime-show-preview/|archive-date=January 19, 2017}}</ref>

As the day of the show approached, the singer kept posting short videos from rehearsals as well as behind-the-scenes. She showed her pre-game dance routines and choreography, [[FaceTime]]ing with her grandmother, warming up for the show, and the onstage activities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/music/2017/02/04/super-bowl-51-lady-gaga-rehearsal-videos/|title=Lady Gaga shares Super Bowl rehearsal videos|last=Romano|first=Nick|date=February 4, 2017|access-date=February 6, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206205427/http://ew.com/music/2017/02/04/super-bowl-51-lady-gaga-rehearsal-videos/|archive-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> Toman explained that they wanted to have fans get "a peek into the journey to halftime, tapping into the artist fanbase—that really works. Doing a behind-the-scenes content program, giving people that glimpse of what it takes to prepare. People love that. So that really worked and we continue to do that."<ref name="pepsiexec"/> In an interview with ''Billboard'', Gaga explained: "I really had a real sense of being in the zone for this performance, worked on it for a really long time, took months, trained hard. Every second I wanted to give the world and my fans what they deserve, a great show.

After the release of ''Joanne'', Gaga wore simple outfits, deviating from her previously outrageous attire. Before the halftime show, there was much speculation about what she would wear for the performance.<ref name="atelier"/> [[Versace]] created all the looks for the show, including the final one inspired by the label's Spring 2017 collection.<ref name="collection"/> The singer wore a custom, Atelier Versace, iridescent colored jumpsuit, beaded all over with [[Swarovski]] crystals, with high shoulder pads and matching knee-length boots.

According to fashion expert [[Cameron Silver]], Gaga's look for the performance of "Bad Romance" was the "most interesting". It consisted of silver hot pants with sequins, with a football shoulder-pad like jacket. ''Billboard'' deemed both the outfits a "customary nod" to Gaga's past adding, "It was a solid balance of glam and sexy without overdoing it [...] [The dress] gave fantasy to her fans.

Designers Bruce Rodgers of Tribe Inc., LeRoy Bennett, and lighting designer Bob Barnhart of 22 Degrees handled the show's production work. All Access Staging & Productions, creators of previous Super Bowl halftime stages, built the stage. Its key features included a main platform, two towers, three star-shaped side stages, a piano dome and a stage lift. The towers were about {{convert|30|ft}} tall and could be carried by carts to the field for set-up. All Access had just over four weeks to create the pieces and the main stage.

While performing on top of NRG Stadium, a fleet of 300 [[Swarm robotics|synchronized]], LED-equipped "[[Shooting Star (drone)|Shooting Star]]" [[quadcopter]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] provided by [[Intel]] accompanied Gaga. They formed an image of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] behind the singer. This marked the first time the drones were used as part of a television broadcast.<ref name="verge-sblidrones"/> According to Intel's senior vice president Josh Walden, "Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before ... The potential for these light show drones is endless."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-drones-light-lady-gaga-021500916.html|title=Intel Drones Light Up Lady Gaga Performance During Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI Halftime Show|date=February 6, 2017|access-date=February 6, 2017|agency=[[Business Wire]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207031701/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-drones-light-lady-gaga-021500916.html|archive-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref> Barnhart explained he had wanted to use drones in the Super Bowl for many years, but never encountered the appropriate technology until Intel's drones. With permission from producer [[Ricky Kirshner]], he reached out to Intel representatives and told them he wanted to use their drone technology for a "large TV show in February. I can't give you money, but I can give you exposure." Knowing that the Super Bowl would expose their technology to over 110 million television sets across the country, Intel agreed.<ref name="lights"/>

Since the drones did not fly indoors, Barnhart wrote a new creative segment for the opening with Gaga singing atop the roof of the stadium and the drones flying behind her.<ref name="lights"/> The segment was filmed earlier in the week due to safety concerns over flying the formation over a live audience. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) forbid the use of drones within a {{convert|34.5|mi|km}} radius of NRG Stadium (which is also located near [[William P. Hobby Airport]]). The production staff obtained special permission from the FAA to perform the drone acrobatics.<ref name="verge-sblidrones">{{cite web|title=The Super Bowl halftime show drones weren't flying live|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/5/14517954/super-bowl-2017-drones-halftime-show-lady-gaga|work=[[The Verge]]|date=February 6, 2017|access-date=February 6, 2017|first=Andrew|last=Liptak|first2=Rich|last2=McCormick|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206043115/http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/5/14517954/super-bowl-2017-drones-halftime-show-lady-gaga|archive-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name="wired"/>

Intel began preparing in early December 2016, working out the logistics. After coming to a consensus with the creative team, they began [[storyboarding]] the drones, finally deciding to display a star array, the American flag and the Pepsi logo. The drones used for the show had a plastic and foam body for soft impacts, were about {{convert|1|ft|m}} square and weighed {{convert|8|oz|lb}}. They were connected wirelessly to a central computer and each executed their unique, individual choreography. The computer checked the GPS signal strength and the drones' battery levels.<ref name="wired">{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga's Halftime Show Drones Have a Bright Future|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/lady-gaga-halftime-show-drones/|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=February 6, 2017|access-date=February 6, 2017|first=Brian|last=Barrett|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206035134/https://www.wired.com/2017/02/lady-gaga-halftime-show-drones/|archive-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref>

Nico Land of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' noted Gaga was the first artist to refer to the [[LGBT community]] during a Super Bowl halftime show when she sang "Born This Way".
