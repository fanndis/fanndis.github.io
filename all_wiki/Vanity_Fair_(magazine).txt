'''''Vanity Fair''''' is a monthly magazine of [[popular culture]], [[fashion]], and [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] published by [[Condé Nast]] in the United States.

The first version of ''Vanity Fair'' was published from 1913 to 1936. The imprint was revived in 1983 and currently includes five international editions of the magazine. As of 2018, the Editor-in-Chief is [[Radhika Jones]].

==History==
===''Dress and Vanity Fair''===
[[File:VanityFairNovember1924.jpg|thumb|Cover of November 1924 issue]]
{{main|Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)}}
[[Condé Montrose Nast]] began his empire by purchasing the men's fashion magazine ''Dress'' in 1913. He renamed the magazine ''Dress and Vanity Fair'' and published four issues in 1913. It continued to thrive into the twenties. However, it became a casualty of the [[Great Depression]] and declining advertising revenues, although its circulation, at 90,000 copies, was at its peak. Condé Nast announced in December 1935 that ''Vanity Fair'' would be folded into ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' (circulation 156,000) as of the March 1936 issue.<ref>{{Citation |title=Vanity Fair Merged With Vogue by Nast |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 30, 1935 |page=21 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16F935551B728DDDA90B94DA415B858FF1D3 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201003/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16F935551B728DDDA90B94DA415B858FF1D3 |archive-date=February 22, 2014  }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Conde Nast Publications To Combine Two Magazines |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 31, 1935 |page=2 }}.</ref>

===Modern revival===

Condé Nast Publications, under the ownership of [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|S.I. Newhouse]], announced in June 1981 that it was reviving the magazine.<ref>{{Citation |title=Conde Nast to Revive Vanity Fair Magazine |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=July 1, 1981 |page=16 }}.</ref> The first issue was released in February 1983 (cover date March), edited by [[Richard Locke]], formerly of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.<ref>{{Citation |first=Sandra |last=Salmans |title=Courting the Elite at Condé Nast |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 6, 1983 |page=F1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/business/courting-the-elite-at-conde-nast.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804221605/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/business/courting-the-elite-at-conde-nast.html |archive-date=August 4, 2017  }}.</ref> After three issues, Locke was replaced by [[Leo Lerman]], veteran features editor of ''Vogue''.<ref>{{Citation |first=Curt |last=Suplee |title=Vanity Fair Editor Fired |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=April 27, 1983 |page=B4 }}.</ref> He was followed by editors [[Tina Brown]] (1984–1992), [[Graydon Carter]] (1992-2017) and [[Radhika Jones]] (2017 to present). Regular writers and [[columnists]] have included [[Dominick Dunne]], [[Sebastian Junger]], [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]], [[Maureen Orth]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]]. Famous contributing photographers for the magazine include [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Mario Testino]] and [[Herb Ritts]], who have all provided the magazine with a string of lavish covers and full-page portraits of current [[celebrities]]. Amongst the most famous of these was the August 1991 Leibovitz cover featuring a naked, pregnant [[Demi Moore]], an image entitled ''[[More Demi Moore]]'' that to this day holds a spot in pop culture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/11/18/1991-vanity-fair-cover-featuring-pregnant-demi-moore-named-1-of-most-influential-images-of-all-time/|title=1991 Vanity Fair cover featuring pregnant Demi Moore named 1 of most influential images of all time|date=November 18, 2016|work=Women in the World in Association with The New York Times - WITW|access-date=November 22, 2017|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043746/http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/11/18/1991-vanity-fair-cover-featuring-pregnant-demi-moore-named-1-of-most-influential-images-of-all-time/|archive-date=December 1, 2017}}</ref>

In addition to its controversial photography, the magazine also prints articles on a variety of topics. In 1996, journalist [[Marie Brenner]] wrote an [[exposé (journalism)|exposé]] on the [[tobacco industry]] titled "[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (article)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]". The article was later adapted into a movie ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' (1999), which starred [[Al Pacino]] and [[Russell Crowe]]. Most famously, after more than thirty years of mystery, an article in the May 2005 edition revealed the identity of [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] ([[W. Mark Felt]]), one of the sources for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' articles on [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], which led to the 1974 resignation of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. The magazine also features candid interviews with celebrities, including a monthly [[Proust Questionnaire]]. Other notable interviews have included: [[Teri Hatcher]], who revealed in the magazine that she was sexually abused as a child; [[Jennifer Aniston]]'s first interview after her divorce from [[Brad Pitt]]; [[Anderson Cooper]], who talked about his brother's death; and [[Martha Stewart]]'s first interview after her release from prison.

Some of the pictorials in ''Vanity Fair'' have attracted criticism. The April 1999 issue featured an image of actor [[Mike Myers]] dressed as a [[Hindu]] deity for a photo spread by [[David LaChapelle]]: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized.<ref>[http://www.saja.org/vf.html SAJA Vanity Fair article], June 9, 2000 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116102721/http://www.saja.org/vf.html |date=January 16, 2006 }}</ref>

The magazine was the subject of [[Toby Young]]'s book, ''[[How to Lose Friends and Alienate People (memoir)|How to Lose Friends and Alienate People]]'', about his search for success in [[New York City]] while working for Graydon Carter's ''Vanity Fair''. The book was made into a [[How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (film)|movie]] in 2008, with [[Jeff Bridges]] playing Carter.<ref>{{Citation|last=Weide|first=Robert B.|title=How to Lose Friends & Alienate People|date=October 3, 2008|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455538/|others=Simon Pegg, Kirsten Dunst, Megan Fox|access-date=January 18, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103160055/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455538/|archive-date=January 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bridges/bridges-agrees-to-alienate-people-idUSN1736725620070518|title=Bridges agrees to "Alienate People"|date=May 18, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=January 18, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120229/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bridges/bridges-agrees-to-alienate-people-idUSN1736725620070518|archive-date=January 19, 2018}}</ref>

In 2005, ''Vanity Fair'' was found liable in a [[lawsuit]] brought in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] by film director [[Roman Polanski]], who claimed the magazine had [[libel]]led him in an article by [[A. E. Hotchner]] published in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/22/pressandpublishing.generalelection2005|title=Polanski wins libel case against Vanity Fair|last=Cozens|first=Claire|date=July 22, 2005|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=February 28, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171010223714/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/22/pressandpublishing.generalelection2005|archive-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref> The article recounted a claim by [[Lewis H. Lapham]], editor of ''[[Harper's]]'', that Polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was traveling to the funeral of his wife, [[Sharon Tate]], in August 1969, claiming that he could make her "the next Sharon Tate". The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4019031.stm Polanski takes appeal to Lords] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305132925/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4019031.stm |date=March 5, 2006 }} [[BBC News]] (online), November 17, 2004</ref> The trial started on July 18, 2005, and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimonies of [[Mia Farrow]] and others, it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous New York restaurant [[Elaine's]] could not possibly have taken place on the date given, because Polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian then-model disputed the accounts that he had claimed to be able to make her "the next Sharon Tate".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/movies/MoviesFeatures/polanski-wins-vanity-fair-libel-suit.html|title=Polanski Wins Vanity Fair Libel Suit|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|date=July 23, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 28, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228223324/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/movies/MoviesFeatures/polanski-wins-vanity-fair-libel-suit.html|archive-date=February 28, 2018}}</ref>

In 2013, [[Condé Nast Entertainment]] struck a deal with [[Discovery Communications]]-owned cable channel [[Investigation Discovery]] for ''Vanity Fair Confidential'', a crime and mystery documentary TV series based on stories from ''Vanity Fair'' magazine.<ref>William Launder (July 29, 2013), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324691204578632661289755592 Condé Nast Pushes Into TV Business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203172249/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324691204578632661289755592 |date=February 3, 2014 }} ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> Condé Nast Entertainment launched a ''Vanity Fair'' [[YouTube]] channel in July 2013.

In January 2014, ''Vanity Fair'' was under fire for allegedly altering the appearance of a celebrity featured in its pages for its February issue, [[Lupita Nyong'o]], an actress known for her role in ''[[12 Years A Slave (film)|12 Years A Slave]]''. In Nyong'o's case, the magazine tweeted the photo and it began with fans accusing the company of altering her complexion. However, some believe that the ''Vanity Fair'' images are simply a product of bright set lighting, rather than deliberate skin lightening. Nyong'o was pleased with the work and saw no harm done to herself; she did not hold ''Vanity Fair'' or the photographer liable. Shortly before the Nyong'o case, ''Vogue'' magazine, a partner and buyer of ''Vanity Fair'' in 1936, was accused of altering actress [[Lena Dunham]]'s photos. Dunham considered the modified photos to be offensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.eonline.com/news/500812/did-vanity-fair-lightening-lupita-nyong-o-s-skin-color-check-out-the-controversial-photo|title=Did Vanity Fair Lighten Lupita Nyong'o's Skin Color?
