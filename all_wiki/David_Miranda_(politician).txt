==Activism and political work==
Miranda led the campaign for the Brazilian government to concede asylum to [[Edward Snowden]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2013/12/1387040-brasileiro-e-ong-iniciam-campanha-por-asilo-a-snowden.shtml|title=Brasileiro e ONG iniciam campanha por asilo a Snowden|publisher=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date= December 17, 2013|language=pt}}</ref> and worked with his husband, United States journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] to publish the revelations contained in Snowden's leaks detailing mass surveillance by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). He met with [[Luciana Genro]], the PSOL candidate for the [[2014 Brazilian general election|2014 Brazilian presidential election]], and obtained her commitment to extend Snowden's asylum if elected. Numerous public Brazilian figures supported the campaign, which however failed to swing the government of [[Dilma Rousseff]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2013/12/1388716-david-miranda-carta-aberta-aos-brasileiros.shtml|title=David Miranda: Carta aberta aos brasileiros|date=22 December 2013|publisher=Folha de S.Paulo|language=pt}}</ref>

In August 2013, Miranda [[Glenn Greenwald#Detention of David Miranda|was detained]] over his work on the NSA program for nine hours by the British government at London's [[Heathrow Airport]] under Schedule 7 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]], after he had flown in from Berlin and was changing to a plane bound for home, in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Charlie|last2=Schwirtz|first2=Michael|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/world/europe/britain-detains-partner-of-reporter-tied-to-leaks.html|title=Britain Detains the Partner of a Reporter Tied to Leaks|work=The New York Times|date=18 August 2013|access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref> His belongings were seized, including an [[external hard drive]] said to contain sensitive documents relevant to [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|Greenwald's reporting]], which was [[Encryption|encrypted]] with [[TrueCrypt]] encryption software. Greenwald described his partner's detention as "clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/david-miranda-detained-uk-nsa|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|first=Glenn|last=Greenwald|title=Glenn Greenwald: detaining my partner was a failed attempt at intimidation|date=August 19, 2013}}</ref> Miranda himself has described his treatment under UK authorities as "psychological torture".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/david-miranda-i-was-subject-to-psychological-torture/a-17039702|title=David Miranda: "I was subject to psychological torture"|date=22 August 2013|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref> In 2014, for an article by Greenwald in ''[[The Intercept]]'', Miranda interviewed [[Jair Bolsonaro]], a former army captain, and then a little known representative.<ref name="Londoño">{{cite news|last=Londoño|first=Ernesto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-greenwald.html|title='The Antithesis of Bolsonaro': A Gay Couple Roils Brazil's Far Right|work=The New York Times|date=July 20, 2019|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref>

In 2016, he was, along with his friend [[Marielle Franco]],<ref name="Bernstein2018" /> elected the first LGBT councilman in Rio's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guiagaysalvador.com.br/5/n--rio-e-sp-terao-vereadores-gays-david-miranda-e-fernando-holiday--03-10-2016--3270.htm|title=Rio e SP terão vereadores gays.|date=3 October 2016|publisher=Guia Gay de Salvador|language=pt}}</ref> He focuses primarily on the issues of the LGBT community and other marginalized segments of the Rio population. Miranda and his family travel in a bulletproof car ever since Franco was assassinated in March 2018.<ref name="Bernstein2018" /> 

In [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018]], Miranda was elected a substitute for deputy [[Jean Wyllys]], both of whom are members of PSOL. When Wyllys, an LGBT member, announced in January 2019 that he left the country due to death threats, Miranda, who had also been on the party list, took Wyllys' place in the Chamber of Deputies. Miranda himself began to receive "hundreds" of death threats after taking his seat.<ref name="Bernstein2018" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Maia|first=Gustavo|date=24 January 2019|title="Negro, gay e favelado": quem é o suplente de Jean Wyllys na Câmara|url=https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2019/01/24/vereador-gay-suplente-jean-wyllys-mandato-camara.htm|work=UOL|location=Brasília|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref> [[Joice Hasselmann]], a representative of the now-President Bolsonaro's party, and who was present when Miranda was sworn in, accused Miranda of buying his seat. In April 2019, Miranda had a breakdown. Greenwald and Miranda only leave their home with armed guards.<ref name="Londoño" />

==Personal life==
Miranda was raised in [[Jacarezinho, Rio de Janeiro]]. His mother died when he was five, and he moved in with an aunt. He left home when he was 13, dropped out of school, and worked in menial jobs for the next 6 years.<ref name="Nugent2019" /><ref name="Londoño">{{cite news|last=Londoño|first=Ernesto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-greenwald.html|title='The Antithesis of Bolsonaro': A Gay Couple Roils Brazil's Far Right|work=The New York Times|date=July 20, 2019|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref> He was playing volleyball on [[Ipanema]] beach in February 2005 when he knocked over the drink of a visiting New Yorker, the attorney [[Glenn Greenwald]].

Soon after they first met, Greenwald encouraged Miranda's return to education and he graduated from [[Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing]] (ESPM) in 2014.<ref name="Nugent2019" /> Both Greenwald and Miranda are [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]], and are married.<ref name="Bernstein2018" /> In 2017, the couple adopted two children who are siblings.

==Controversies==
On 11 September 2019, ''[[O Globo]]'' newspaper reported<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/relatorio-do-coaf-aponta-movimentacoes-atipicas-de-25-milhoes-de-david-miranda-23940950|title=Relatório do Coaf aponta 'movimentações atípicas' de R$ 2,5 milhões de David Miranda|date=2019-09-11|website=O Globo|language=pt-BR|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref> that an investigation by a division of the Brazilian Ministry of the Economy identified R$2.5 million in suspicious transactions in Miranda's personal bank account during a one year period from 2018 to 2019, including deposits from current and former employees. As a result, the [[Public Prosecutor's Office (Brazil)|Public Ministry]] opened an investigation into his finances. According to media reports, investigators suspect Miranda of "concealing the origin" of the funds and participating in an illegal practice known as "''rachadinha,''" in which public servants employed in the offices of elected officials kick back a portion of their salary to their boss.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2019/09/11/coaf-aponta-movimentacao-atipica-de-r-25-milhoes-em-conta-do-deputado-federal-david-miranda.ghtml|title=Coaf aponta 'movimentação atípica' de R$ 2,5 milhões em conta do deputado David Miranda|date=2019-09-11|work=G1|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref> [[Jair Bolsonaro]]'s sons, [[Flávio Bolsonaro|Flavio Bolsonaro]] and Carlos Bolsonaro, are also under investigation for this practice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/entenda-caso-da-quebra-de-sigilo-de-flavio-bolsonaro-e-ate-onde-pode-ir-investigacao.shtml|title=Entenda caso da quebra de sigilo de Flávio Bolsonaro e até onde pode ir investigação|date=2019-05-17|website=Folha de S.Paulo|language=pt-BR|access-date=2019-09-12}}</ref> Miranda denies the charges.  

Glenn Greenwald accused the Brazilian Public Ministry, which represents prosecutors, of launching the investigation and leaking it for political reasons, due to his involvement in [[Vaza Jato|uncovering corruption and political bias among Brazilian prosecutors and judges]] involved in the [[Lava Jato]] operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/coaf-relata-movimentacao-atipica-de-r-25-milhoes-em-conta-de-david-miranda.shtml|title=Coaf relata movimentação atípica de R$ 2,5 milhões em conta de David Miranda|date=2019-09-11|website=Folha de S.Paulo|language=pt-BR|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>

2018 center-left presidential candidate [[Ciro Gomes]] and center-right pundit [[Reinaldo Azevedo]] both described the investigation against Miranda as borne out of a spirit of police state and political persecution.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Miranda, Francenildo, The Intercept Brasil e o estado policial|url=https://reinaldoazevedo.blogosfera.uol.com.br/2019/09/11/david-miranda-francenildo-the-intercept-brasil-e-o-estado-policial/?cmpid=copiaecola|date=11 September 2019|website=Reinaldo Azevedo's UOL webpage|language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{cite website|url=https://twitter.com/cirogomes/status/1171934382061473793?lang=en|website=Twitter|title=Ciro Gomes expresses solidarity with Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda on his official Twitter page|date=11 September 2019}}</ref>

A few days afterwards, Miranda and Greenwald opened their bank accounts for public access, and challenged the Bolsonaro family to follow suit.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-09-13|title=David Miranda aceita expor renda familiar e desafia família Bolsonaro|url=https://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/politica/2019/09/david-miranda-renda-desafia-bolsonaro/|access-date=2020-10-01|website=Rede Brasil Atual|language=pt-BR}}</ref>
