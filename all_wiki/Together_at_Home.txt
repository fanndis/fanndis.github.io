Instead of private individuals, funds were raised from corporations and institutions such as [[Bloomberg Philanthropies]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2020/04/19/the-story-behind-the-worlds-biggest-charity-concert-what-was-it-all-for/|title=The Story Behind The World’s Biggest Charity Concert: What Was It All For?|first=Ollie|last=Williams|website=Forbes}}</ref>
