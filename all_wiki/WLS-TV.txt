'''WLS-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 7 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 22), is an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], United States. The station is owned by the [[ABC Owned Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. WLS-TV's studios are located on [[State Street (Chicago)|North State Street]], across the street from the [[Chicago Theatre]] in the [[Chicago Loop]], and it shares transmitter facilities with [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]]-licensed [[UniMás]] owned-and-operated station [[WXFT-DT]] (channel 60) atop the [[Willis Tower]] on South [[Wacker Drive]].

==History==
The station first signed on the air on September 17, 1948 as '''WENR-TV'''. It was the third television station to sign on in the Chicago market behind [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9), which debuted six months earlier in April, and WBKB (channel 4), which changed from an experimental station to a commercial operation in September 1946. As one of the original ABC-owned stations on channel 7, it was the second station to begin operations after [[WABC-TV|New York City]], and before [[WXYZ-TV|Detroit]], [[KGO-TV|San Francisco]] and [[KABC-TV|Los Angeles]].

The station's original call letters were taken from co-owned radio station WENR (890 AM), which served as an affiliate of the ABC Radio Network (WENR would eventually merge with [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], with which it shared a frequency under a time-sharing arrangement until ABC purchased a 50% interest in WLS in 1954).

In February 1953, ABC merged with [[Plitt Theatres|United Paramount Theatres]] (UPT), the former theater division of [[Paramount Pictures]]. UPT subsidiary [[Balaban and Katz]] owned WBKB (which shared a [[CBS]] affiliation with WGN-TV). The newly merged [[American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres]], as the company was known then, could not keep both stations because of [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations then enforced that forbade the [[duopoly (broadcasting)|common ownership of two television stations]] licensed to the same [[media market|market]]. As a result, WBKB's channel 4 license was sold to CBS, which subsequently changed that station's call letters to [[WBBM-TV]]; that outlet would move to [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2 several months later on July 5, 1953. The old WBKB's on-air and behind-the-scenes staff stayed at the new WBBM-TV, while the '''WBKB''' call letters and management moved to channel 7 (from 1965 to 1968, a "-TV" suffix was included in the station's calls, modifying it to '''WBKB-TV''').

Sterling "Red" Quinlan served as the station's [[general manager]] from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s,<ref>{{cite web|title=My Afternoon With Red|url=http://www.chicagotelevision.com/RED.htm|website=Chicago Television Alumni Club}}</ref> and became a giant in early Chicago television. Quinlan was instrumental in starting the careers of [[Tom Duggan]], [[Frank Reynolds]] and [[Bob Newhart]]. The station courageously aired ''The Tom Duggan Show'' in the mid-1950s, which became the most popular show in the Chicago market, far outdrawing other network competition. Channel 7 had its call letters changed to '''WLS-TV''' on October 7, 1968,<ref>''Television News'' section, [[Chicago Tribune]], October 6, 1968.</ref> named after WLS Radio, which ABC had wholly owned since 1959 when the network bought the 50% interest it did not already hold in the station from the ''[[Prairie Farmer]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite journal|title=AB-PT buys rest of WLS; purchases Prairie Farmer publishing empire|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/59-OCR/1959-11-23-BC-0076.pdf|periodical=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]|page=76|date=November 23, 1959}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Ironically, ABC merged WLS with WENR, its shared-time partner, in 1954.<ref>{{cite journal|title=WDRV, WDRV Chicago merge – now WLS|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/54-OCR/1954-02-08-BC-0052.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting - Telecasting|page=52|date=February 8, 1954}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1963, Al Parker joined the station as an announcer and worked in that capacity for 26 years. Until his departure, he also served as an announcer for ''AM Chicago'' and ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. He died September 30, 2000 at the age of 74.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2000-10-02-0010020153-story.html|title=RADIO BROADCASTER AL PARKER, 74|last=Writer|first=Marla Donato, Tribune Staff|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=September 21, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

WLS-TV had claimed to be "Chicago's first television station" in its [[sign-on and sign-off|sign-ons and sign-offs]] during for its first three decades (implying a connection with the original WBKB on channel 4), but admitted to its true roots with WENR with its 30th anniversary in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=WLS Channel 7 - "Anthem, Sign-On, Reflections & Editorial" (1984)|url=http://www.fuzzymemories.tv/?c=2929|website=FuzzyMemories.tv|publisher=Museum of Classic Chicago Television}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ABC7 celebrates 60 years of broadcasting|url=http://abc7chicago.com/archive/6397505/|author=[[Alan Krashesky]]|website=WDRV-TV|publisher=[[ABC Owned Television Stations]]|date=September 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>http://www.tv-signoffs.com/clips/WLS-signon-1983_1208.htm</ref><ref>http://www.tv-signoffs.com/clips/WLS-signoff-1981_0125.htm</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0J5UxbsxRk</ref>

{{anchor|Tele1st}}On January 17, 1984, WLS-TV launched Tele1st, an ABC-owned overnight [[pay television|subscription television]] service that carried a mix of [[feature film|films]] and lifestyle programs for four hours per night six days a week after the station's [[sign-off]] at 2:00&nbsp;a.m.; the service was similar in format to competitor [[ONTV (pay TV)|ONTV]] (which was carried locally on [[WSNS-TV]], channel 44 (now a [[Telemundo]] owned and operated station)) and other over-the-air pay services that existed during the early and mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cable Notes; Cities are waking up to what were empty promises|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/arts/cable-notes-cities-are-waking-up-to-what-were-empty-promises.html|author=Peter Kerr|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=December 11, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Testing Pay-Tv|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/17/arts/abc-testing-pay-tv.html|author=Sally Bedell Smith|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 17, 1984}}</ref> Tele1st was created with the concept of allowing users to record programming for later viewing; therefore, its decoder boxes were designed to unencrypt the signal only with the aid of a [[video cassette recorder|VCR]]. Scrambling codes that were sent to the box and relayed to the VCR were changed on a monthly basis, requiring subscribers to record additional footage airing immediately before and after that night's schedule to retrieve codes to play back the recorded programs properly; this resulted in any recordings being viewable only during that calendar month. Tele1st was deemed a failure, attributing only 4,000 subscribers at its peak, and ceased operations on June 30, 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tele1st|url=http://chicagotelevision.com/pay2.htm|website=Chicago Television}}</ref>

Prior to February 24, 2011, WLS-DT3 carried ''ABC 7 News NOW'', featuring local news and weather and national/sidebar content from [[The Local AccuWeather Channel]]. The ABC O&Os discontinued their Local AccuWeather channels on February 24, 2011, replacing its programming with a letterboxed [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] [[simulcast]] of their Live Well subchannels, though [[AccuWeather]]'s content/branding agreement with ABCOTS, including WLS-TV, continued unchanged. WLS-DT3 formerly served as a charter affiliate of [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]] diginet from its launch in January 2015. To accommodate the WXFT channel share which took effect in December 2017, WLS-TV discontinued the third Laff subchannel, which shifted over to a subchannel of WXFT's sister station, [[WGBO-DT]]2, and reduced the Live Well feed from a reduced-bitrate [[720p]] broadcast to a [[480i]] format.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WLS-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcast use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations.<ref>{{cite web|title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=March 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf|archive-date=August 29, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

WLS operated its digital signal at low power (4.75 [[kilowatt|kW]]) to protect the digital signal of [[NBC]] affiliate [[WOOD-TV]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] (which also broadcasts on channel 7, but at a much higher radiated power). As a result, many viewers were not able to receive the station.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weigel's Analog Nightlight Could Help Chicago Stations With Reception Issues|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/technology/weigels-analog-nightlight-could-help-chicago-stations-reception-issues/46911|author=John Eggerton|periodical=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=June 17, 2009}}</ref> The FCC sent extra personnel to Chicago, [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]] to deal with difficulties in those cities. WLS had received 1,735 calls just by the end of the day on June 12 (WBBM only received 600), and an estimated 5,000 calls in total by June 16.

WLS-TV was just one station which needed to increase its signal strength or move its frequency to solve its problems, but a power increase required making sure no other stations were affected.<ref>{{cite news|title=DTV Transition Problems Linger; FCC Beefs Up Role|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-wed-dtv-0617-jun17,0,5744081.story|author=Wailin Wong|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 17, 2009|access-date=June 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622082054/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-wed-dtv-0617-jun17,0,5744081.story|archive-date=June 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> WLS received a two-week experimental permit for a power increase late in June.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boise Station Gets Power Boost|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/technology/boise-station-gets-power-boost/46927|author=John Eggerton|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref> WLS had also applied for a permit to construct a low-power fill-in digital translator station on UHF channel 32 (the former analog frequency of [[WFLD]]),<ref>[https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101319886&formid=346&fac_num=73226 BDRTCDT - 20090630AFT]</ref> but abandoned that plan (the channel 32 RF frequency has since been claimed by [[WMEU-CD]]). Eventually the FCC granted it a permit to transmit on a second frequency, UHF channel 44,<ref>[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/pubacc/Auth_Files/1335680.pdf 1335680.pdf]</ref> formerly occupied by WSNS-TV; WLS announced the availability of that frequency on October 31, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC7 is adding a DTV frequency; UHF frequency should help reception|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&id=7091863|website=WLS-TV|publisher=ABC Owned Television Stations|date=October 31, 2009}}</ref>

Throughout construction of the new maximized transmitting facilities at the Willis Tower, WLS operated both channels 7 and 44 from its auxiliary facilities at the [[John Hancock Center]] under an [[Special Temporary Authority|STA]].<ref>[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1363188&Service=DS&Form_id=911&Facility_id=73226 BELDSTA - 20100408ACD]</ref> WLS operated channel 7 as a fill-in translator with a power of 7&nbsp;kW,<ref>[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101370985&formid=911&fac_num=73226 WLS operated channel 7 as a fill-in translator with a power of 7 kW]</ref> and operating their full power operations on channel 44 with a power of [[Megawatt|1 MW]].<ref>[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101360475&formid=911&fac_num=73226 ABC 7 WLS full power operations on channel 44 with a power of 1 MW]</ref> Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]] technology, both operating frequencies were re-mapped and displayed as [[virtual channel]] 7, which would cause some digital tuners to have two versions of virtual channels 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, while tuning sequentially. In October 2012, WLS-TV completed construction from the Willis Tower and its operating channel 44 at the 1 million watt power level.<ref>[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1422856&Service=DT&Form_id=301&Facility_id=73226 BMPCDT - 20110331ABW]</ref> The station continued its dual-frequency operations until 12:03&nbsp;p.m. on March 18, 2013 when WLS-TV formally ceased operations on VHF channel 7, leaving UHF channel 44 as its permanent allotment.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC7 making improvements to over-the-air signal|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&id=9009875|website=WLS-TV|publisher=ABC Owned Television Stations|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref> Since WLS-TV officially moved its full-power operations to channel 44, it is the only ABC-owned station to vacate its former analog allotment for its digital operations and the second ABC O&O to operate its full-power operations on the UHF band, after [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] sister station [[KFSN-TV]].

On June 12, 2017, WLS-TV's parent company [[ABC Owned Television Stations]] and [[Univision Communications]] announced they would enter into a channel sharing agreement following the sale of the over-the-air spectrum of [[UniMás]] owned-and-operated station [[WXFT-DT]] in the FCC's [[spectrum reallocation]] auction for $126.1 million on April 13, 2017; as mentioned above, the transition of WXFT to the WLS-TV spectrum occurred eight months later.

==Programming==

===Station oddities===
* From that program's debut in January 2003, WLS-TV aired ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on a one-hour delay at 12:02&nbsp;a.m. as the station aired [[rerun]]s of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' at 11:02&nbsp;p.m. after ''[[Nightline]]'' (this practice ended after ''Oprah''—by then in reruns, as the daytime talk show aired its last episode that May—discontinued its syndication run on September 9, 2011; ''Kimmel'' was subsequently moved to 11:02&nbsp;p.m. three days later on September 12).

*''Chicagoing'' - a local [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] program hosted by Bill Campbell. Aired on Sunday mornings at 11:30&nbsp;a.m., the program ran its final broadcast on December 26, 2010.

===Former syndicated programming produced in Chicago===
*''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' - nationally syndicated [[film]] [[review]] program, produced at WLS-TV's studios, and syndicated by Disney-ABC Domestic Television. It aired Saturdays 10:35&nbsp;p.m. with reruns Sundays 10:30&nbsp;a.m. The program aired its final original broadcast on August 14, 2010.
*''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' - formerly the local program ''A.M. Chicago'', it retained the name about one year after [[Oprah Winfrey]] became host. The program was originally created by WLS-TV, but was later produced by [[Harpo Productions]] and [[CBS Television Distribution]] at Oprah's Harpo Studios. It aired weekdays at 9:00&nbsp;a.m., in both its local and syndicated incarnations. The program ended with its final original broadcast airing on May 25, 2011. Reruns continued weeknights at 11:02&nbsp;p.m. until September 9, 2011.

===Sports programming===
WLS-TV serves as the local over-the-air broadcaster of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games involving the [[Chicago Bears]], airing simulcasts of the team's [[ESPN]]-televised games (WLS-TV's corporate parent, [[The Walt Disney Company]], holds 80% majority ownership stake in ESPN, and the ABC Owned Television Stations have [[right of first refusal]] for simulcasts of ESPN's [[National Football League|NFL]] telecasts within a team's home market). Because of this, atypical for a network-owned station outside of [[breaking news]] and severe weather coverage necessitating such situations, the station has had to reschedule ABC network programs pre-empted by the telecasts. The preseason and ''MNF'' telecasts mark the only NFL games to have aired on WLS-TV since ABC lost the rights to NFL games in 2006; during the regular season, Bears games are rotated between WBBM-TV (through the ''[[NFL on CBS]]''), [[WMAQ-TV]] (through ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'') and especially WFLD (through the ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' and select telecasts via the [[NFL Network]]'s ''[[Thursday Night Football]]''). Since 2010, however, it has deferred the right of first refusal due to the popularity and live voting requirements of ABC's ''[[Dancing with the Stars (American TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', with [[WCIU-TV]] carrying the ''MNF'' games when the former program's fall season is ongoing (an exception being WLS' carriage of an ''MNF'' Bears game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] on December 9, 2013, when the team honored former head coach [[Mike Ditka]], after [[Dancing with the Stars (American season 17)|the ''DWTS'' fall season had already ended]]).

On December 12, 2014, WLS-TV signed a new five-year broadcast agreement with the [[Chicago Cubs]], in which WLS televised 25 of the [[Major League Baseball]] team's games per year, starting with the [[2015 Chicago Cubs season|2015 season]]. The arrangement partially replaced one with [[WGN-TV]] (which has broadcast Cubs games since its inception in April 1948), which voluntarily pulled out of its existing broadcast deal with the team for the 2015 season and subsequently agreed to carry a reduced slate of 45 games. The WLS broadcasts were seen on [[DirecTV]]'s version of MLB Extra Innings, and the feed provided is the WLS signal seen in the [[Chicago market]] (unlike with the feeds of WGN broadcasts, where [[public service announcement]]s are seen in place of local commercials and station promos).

As ABC has a [[ESPN on ABC#Siphoning|limited sports programming schedule]] during the Major League Baseball season prior to September (when the MLB regular season and [[college football]] season overlap), the station mainly carried the team's weekend daytime games in order to limit pre-emptions of the network's prime time programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-chicago-cubs-wgn-tv-20131106-story.html|title=Cubs exercise option to end WGN-TV contract after next season|author=Robert Channick|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=November 6, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=tribune-closingin>{{cite news|title=It's official: WLS-Ch. 7 to air 25 Cubs games|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/ct-cubs-tv-1212-biz-20141211-story.html|author=Robert Channick|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cubs reach deal with WGN-TV for remaining 45 broadcasts|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2015/01/07/cubs-reach-deal-with-wgn-tv-for-remaining-45.html|newspaper=Chicago Business Journal|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=January 7, 2015|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name=trib-whitesoxwpwr>{{cite news|title=White Sox add WPWR-Ch. 50 to station rotation|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/chi-white-sox-channel-50-20150219-story.html|author=Ed Sherman|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref> The deal (along with all of the Cubs' broadcast television deals) ended after the 2019 season, when the team launched the cable-only [[Marquee Sports Network]] to carry their game telecasts.

WLS-TV also carries the games of the [[Chicago Bulls]] featured as part of their ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' telecasts.

WLS-TV broadcasts 41 hours, 25 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 5 minutes each weekday and 5½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). WLS-TV also contracts with [[iHeartMedia]] to provide weather forecasts for their Chicago market stations, including [[WLIT-FM]] (93.9), [[WCHI-FM]] (95.5), [[WVAZ]] (102.7), [[WKSC-FM]] (103.5), and [[WGCI-FM]] (107.5).

===News department history===
In 1969, WLS-TV adopted the ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' format that the other ABC owned-and-operated stations began implementing in the late 1960s, after the news format was popularized when it originated at New York City flagship WABC-TV. Beginning in 1968, the station's main evening newscasts were co-anchored by [[Fahey Flynn]], a [[bowtie]]-wearing broadcaster who had spent the previous 15 years at WBBM-TV; and [[Joel Daly]], who was hired away by WLS from [[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]] in [[Cleveland]] in 1967. The duo served as the anchors of the station's 6:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts until Flynn's death in August 1983. In 1970, the two were joined by [[John Drury (television anchor)|John Drury]], who helmed the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. By 1973, WLS' ''Eyewitness News'' broadcasts surpassed [[NBC]]-owned WMAQ-TV (channel 5)'s newscasts to become Chicago's top-rated news operation, a lead it held until WBBM-TV surpassed channel 7 for the top spot in 1979. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, it waged a spirited battle for second place in the Chicago news ratings between its two main competitors.

By 1983, a disastrous{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} anchor change had dropped channel 7 into third place. This prompted two major changes to the station's management; ABC brought in Dennis Swanson from WLS-TV's Los Angeles sister station KABC-TV to serve as the station's new general manager. Swanson, in turn, hired Bill Applegate as the station's [[news director]]. In addition, ABC commissioned [[Frank Gari]] to compose an updated version of the ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' "Tar Sequence" theme widely associated with the ''Eyewitness News'' format. The result was "News Series 2000," a theme package that was quickly picked up by other ABC O&Os and affiliates.

Swanson was instrumental{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} in hiring [[Oprah Winfrey]] to host its then low-rated morning talk show, ''AM Chicago'', in 1983. Within a year, the program had moved to first place in the ratings. ''AM Chicago'' entered into national syndication in 1986 and was renamed ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. Channel 7 was the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] for the show, and it, along with most of ABC's other owned-and-operated stations, carried it until it went out of production in September 2011. Swanson also re-hired lead anchor John Drury, who had left for WGN-TV in 1979; and [[Floyd Kalber]], who had led WMAQ-TV to the top of the ratings in the 1960s. Drury and [[Mary Ann Childers]] were a popular anchor team at WLS-TV during the 1980s and 1990s, accompanied by weather anchor Steve Deshler and sports anchor [[Tim Weigel]]. In March 1986, channel 7 passed WBBM-TV as the highest-rated news station in Chicago. It has held the lead ever since, aside from a brief period when WBBM-TV forged a tie for first in the late 1980s.

In 1992, the station replaced the "News Series 2000" package (as the other ABC O&Os did over the following year, due partly to increased royalties for use of the ''Cool Hand Luke'' theme and its variants by the original theme's composer, [[Lalo Schifrin]]) with a new news music package, also produced by Gari, called "News Series 2000 Plus" (since renamed "Stimulus"), which has remained in use by WLS ever since and was updated in 2013. In 1996, WLS-TV dropped the ''Eyewitness News'' brand after 26 years, in favor of the network-centric ''ABC 7 News''; the move was part of a standard branding effort imposed by ABC across its owned-and-operated stations which saw the incorporation of the ABC name into their local brands<ref name=rf-ewn/> (most of the other ABC O&Os retained their existing news branding, as sister stations such as WABC-TV and [[WPVI-TV]] in Philadelphia retained their ''Eyewitness News'' or ''[[Action News]]'' identities).

WLS-TV officially debuted a new street-side studio at its North State Street facility on April 10, 2006, during the station's morning newscast, although the station had begun broadcasting its newscasts from that studio two days earlier on April 8.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lights, cameras ...

On January 6, 2007, WLS-TV became the first Chicago television station to broadcast all of its local programming—including newscasts—in high definition, although most remote field footage remained in [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] standard definition at the time. Since then, WLS-TV upgraded most of its field footage to HD, although some field reports remain in widescreen SD.

On December 23, 2007, a [[Mazda]] [[minivan]] drove through a reinforced studio window at the State Street Studio two minutes into the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, startling anchor [[Ravi Baichwal]] on air and creating a 20° draft as the glass shattered upon the car's impact; no one was injured in the crash. [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]] resident Gerald Richardson was subsequently charged with felony damage to property for the incident.<ref>{{YouTube|title=WLS-TV Studio Car Crash|id=SZqng1s2v9E}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Minivan crashes into ABC7 studio during news|url=http://abc7chicago.com/archive/5852858/|website=WLS-TV|publisher=ABC Owned Television Stations|date=December 24, 2007|access-date=September 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Driver crashes into WLS-CH. 7 studio during news broadcast|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-12-24/news/0712240022_1_newscast-driver-police|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=December 24, 2007|access-date=September 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Driver faces felony in studio crash|url=http://abc7chicago.com/archive/5853137/|website=WLS-TV|publisher=ABC Owned Television Stations|date=December 24, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref> On November 11, 2012, WLS-TV expanded its Sunday 8:00&nbsp;a.m. newscast from 1½ to two hours, leading into ABC's ''This Week''.<ref>{{cite web|title=PROGRAM NOTE: ABC7 Sunday AM broadcast expanding|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&id=8872930|website=WLS-TV|publisher=ABC Owned Television Stations|date=November 4, 2012|access-date=November 9, 2012}}</ref> The 8:00&nbsp;a.m. portion of the Saturday morning newscast was expanded to two hours from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. on August 24, 2013. Nearly a week later on August 30, WLS-TV discontinued its hour-long weekday 11:00&nbsp;a.m. newscast (which originated in 1992 as a half-hour program at 11:30, before it expanded into an earlier, one-hour broadcast on October 6, 2003, following the cancellation of ''[[Port Charles (TV series)|Port Charles]]'') after 21 years, and replaced it on September 2 with ''Windy City Live'', whose original 9:00&nbsp;a.m. slot became occupied by ''Live! with Kelly and Michael'' when it moved to WLS from WGN-TV on that date (as such, it became the first – and currently, the only – ABC owned-and-operated station without a midday newscast). With the move and the midday newscast's cancellation, news and weather cut-ins were incorporated into ''Windy City Live''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Channel 7 is expanding midday news to an hour|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-08-26/news/0308260207_1_port-charles-newscast-midday|author=John Cook|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=August 26, 2003|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="windycitylivemoves">{{cite news|title=Channel 7 to drop 11 a.m. newscast in September|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-20/business/chi-channel-7-local-news-20130620_1_windy-city-live-john-idler-newscast|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 20, 2013}}</ref>

On October 26, 2013, WLS-TV reintroduced the ''Eyewitness News'' brand (as ''ABC 7 Eyewitness News''), as part of an overall rebranding of its newscasts that included new graphics and a modernized update to the "Stimulus" theme. In an interview with media columnist [[Robert Feder]], WLS-TV president/general manager John Idler cited the reasoning behind the restoration of the ''Eyewitness News'' brand, was that it "[still] resonated strongly with [viewers in] the Chicago market," despite being dropped by the station 17 years earlier.<ref name=rf-ewn>{{cite web|title=ABC 7 looks forward to return of 'Eyewitness News'|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2013/10/16/abc-7-looks-forward-to-return-of-eyewitness-news/|author=Robert Feder|website=RobertFeder.com|date=October 16, 2013|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref> On November 2, 2013, WLS expanded the early block of its weekend morning newscasts, with the extension of its hour-long 6:00&nbsp;a.m. newscast on Saturdays and Sundays to two hours at 5:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite news|title=WLS-Channel 7 adding more weekend morning news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2013/10/18/wls-channel-7-adding-more-weekend.html|author=Lewis Lazare|newspaper=[[Chicago Business Journal]]|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=October 18, 2013}}</ref>

On February 10, 2014, WLS-TV entered into a partnership agreement with the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' to include the use of the station's weather team in the newspaper's weather section, replacing WMAQ-TV, whose previous partnership ended the day before; in addition, the station would air a 'look ahead' of the newspaper's front page and stories, with the ''Sun-Times'' promoting WLS's newscasts and programming in turn.

On December 14, 2014, WLS-TV entered into a news share agreement with [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WCIU-TV (channel 26) to produce a weeknight-only 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''ABC 7 Eyewitness News at 7:00 on The U''; the program debuted on January 12, 2015, and is the fifth newscast produced by ABC O&O for a separately owned station in the station's home market (along with existing programs produced by sister stations in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles for [[WLFL]], [[WPHL-TV]], [[KOFY-TV]] and [[KDOC-TV]] in the respective markets, and a since-cancelled newscast produced by KFSN-TV for [[KAIL]] in Fresno).<ref name=trib-wlswciu>{{cite web|title=WLS-Ch. 7 and WCIU-Ch. 26 team up for 7 p.m. news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-wls-wciu-news-biz-1217-20141216-story.html|author=Robert Channick|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=December 14, 2014|accessdate=February 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WLS To Produce 7 P.M.

On June 27, 2016, WLS-TV revived its 11:00&nbsp;a.m. newscasts for the first time since 2013, becoming the fourth television station in Chicago to do so; which completes against with WMAQ-TV (who reviving its midday newscasts in September 2011 and moved to the time period in September 2014), WBBM-TV (who began airing a half-hour 11:00&nbsp;a.m. newscasts in early 2000s), and WGN-TV (who began its midday newscasts in 1984; followed by some expansions in September 2008 and October 2009). In June 2016, after several years of unsuccessful syndicated talk show replacements for the cancelled ''[[All My Children]]'' (including ''[[Katie (talk show)|Katie]]'' and ''[[FABLife]]''), the station moved ''[[General Hospital]]'' to 2 p.m., then ''Windy City Live'' to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. to accommodate the 11 a.m. newscast, with a replay of the latter late night after ''[[Nightline]]''.<ref name=rf-WCL>{{cite web|title=ABC 7 moving 'Windy City Live' to afternoons|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2016/06/07/abc-7-moving-windy-city-live-to-afternoons-restoring-11-a-m-newscast/|author=Robert Feder|website=RobertFeder.com|date=June 7, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>

On July 29, 2019, It was announced that WLS-TV would end its news share agreement with WCIU-TV, ending the weeknight program for that station, the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast ''ABC 7 Eyewitness News at 7:00 on The U'' after 4 years, with the final broadcast on August 30 of that same year. The mutual parting of ways came as WCIU would become the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate on September 1, leaving no room for the newscast otherwise on the station's schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.robertfeder.com/2019/07/29/abc-7-end-7-p-m-newscast-u/|title=ABC 7 to end 7 p.m. newscast on The U|author=Robert Feder|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|publisher=Daily Herald Media Group|date=July 29, 2019|accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref>

===Ratings===
According to the Nielsen local news ratings for the February 2011 sweeps period, WLS-TV remained in first place overall, with the 10 p.m. newscast getting a 9.7 rating share, down a tenth of a point from a 9.8 during the same time the previous year.<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/business/4117157-420/johnson-sullivan-anchor-duo-paying-off-for-wbbm-channel-2.html Johnson-Sullivan anchor duo paying off for WBBM-Channel 2], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', March 4, 2011.</ref> The station remained in second place for its prime-time lead-in.{{Update inline|date=February 2017}}
