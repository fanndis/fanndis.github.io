The '''Superstition Mountains''' ({{lang-yuf-x-yav|'''Wi:kchsawa'''}}) is a range of mountains in [[Arizona]] located to the east of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. They are anchored by [[Superstition Mountain]], a large mountain that is a popular recreation destination for residents of the [[Phoenix, Arizona]], area.

==History==
The mountains were once known in Spanish as '''Sierra de la Espuma''' (~''Foam Mountains'').

== Bounded by roads ==
The Superstition Mountains are bounded roughly by [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|U.S. Route 60]] on the south, [[Arizona State Route 88]] on the northwest, and [[Arizona State Route 188]] on the northeast.

== Wilderness area ==
The mountain range is in the federally designated '''Superstition Wilderness Area''', and includes a variety of natural features in addition to its namesake mountain. [[Weavers Needle]], a prominent landmark and rock climbing destination set behind and to the east of Superstition Mountain, is a tall eroded volcanic remnant<ref name="kollenborn">{{Cite web

As with most of the terrain surrounding the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Superstition Mountains have a desert climate, with high summer temperatures and a handful of perennial sources of water. The elevation in the more remote, eastern portion of the wilderness is higher than the western portion, which lowers temperatures slightly. Numerous hiking trails cross the mountains from multiple access points, including the Peralta Trailhead, the most popular.<ref name="azcentral">{{cite web

[[Peralta Canyon]], on the northeast side of Superstition Mountain, contains a popular trail that leads up to Fremont Saddle, which provides a very picturesque view of Weavers Needle.  [[Miner's Needle]] is another prominent formation in the wilderness and a popular hiking destination.

[[Circlestone]] includes ancient stone monuments.

==Elevation==
The Superstition Mountains have a maximum elevation of {{convert|6,266|ft|abbr=on}} and prominence of {{convert|1,706|ft|abbr=on}} at Mound Mountain in the far eastern section of the range.<ref>{{ Cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=4175 |title=Mound Mountain, East Superstition Mountains |publisher=peakbagger.com |accessdate=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{ Cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=135301 |title=East Superstition Mountains |publisher=peakbagger.com |accessdate=2016-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{ Cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=135300 |title=Superstition Mountains Benchmark, Western section |publisher=peakbagger.com |accessdate=2016-09-02}}</ref>

== Superstition legends ==

The legend of the [[Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine]] centers around the Superstition Mountains. According to the legend, a German immigrant named Jacob Waltz discovered a [[mother lode]] of gold in the Superstition Wilderness and revealed its location on his deathbed in Phoenix in 1891 to Julia Thomas, a boarding-house owner who had taken care of him for many years. Several mines have been claimed to be the actual mine that Waltz discovered, but none of those claims have been verified.<ref name="kollenborn" /> The legends and lore of the Superstition Mountains can be experienced at the ''Superstition Mountain Museum''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superstitionmountainmuseum.org/|title=Superstition Mountain Museum|first=Dave|last=Heim|publisher=}}</ref> on the Apache Trail where artifacts of the Lost Dutchman are on display.

Some [[Apache]]s believe that the hole leading down into the lower world, or hell, is located in the Superstition Mountains.  Winds blowing from the hole are supposed to be the cause of severe dust storms in the metropolitan region.<ref>Vitaliano, Dorothy. 1973.
