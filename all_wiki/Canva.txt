==History==
[[File:Teamcanva.jpg|thumb|Canva Sydney team]]

In its first year, Canva had more than 750,000 users.<ref name=rebekah/> In April 2014, social-media and technology expert [[Guy Kawasaki]] joined the company as chief evangelist (brand promoter).<ref name=techcrunch3/> In 2015, Canva for Work was launched, focusing marketing materials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40514362/graphic-design-startup-canva-just-turned-into-a-unicorn|title=Graphic design startup Canva just turned into a unicorn|date=2018-01-08|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627230754/https://www.fastcompany.com/40514362/graphic-design-startup-canva-just-turned-into-a-unicorn|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 2016-17 financial year, Canva's revenue increased from $AU 6.8m to $AU 23.5m, with a loss of $3.3m. In 2017, the company reached profitability and had 294,000 paying customers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/new-sequoia-china-investment-values-australian-design-company-canva-at-1-billion/|title=New Sequoia China investment values Australian design company Canva at $1 billion – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627230946/https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/new-sequoia-china-investment-values-australian-design-company-canva-at-1-billion/|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
