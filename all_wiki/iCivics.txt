==History==
Justice O’Connor developed the Our Courts project in partnership with [[Georgetown University Law School]] and [[Arizona State University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icivics.org/news/icivics-celebrates-gaming-milestone|title=iCivics Celebrates Gaming Milestone|last=Curley|first=Jeffrey|publisher=iCivics|accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://cabengo.com/projects/our-courts/|title=Cabengo » Our Courts|website=cabengo.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref> In March 2009, Justice O'Connor went on [[The Daily Show]] with [[Jon Stewart]] to promote Our Courts and civics education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=220242&title=sandra-day-o-connor-pt--1|title=Justice O'Connor Interview|last=The Daily Show|publisher=The Daily Show|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/03/04/justice-oconnor-not-only-smart-and-moderate-but-funny/|title=Justice O'Connor: Not Only Smart and Moderate...But Funny!|last=Jones|first=Ashby|date=4 March 2009|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> Our Courts added ''Supreme Decision'' and ''Do I Have A Right?'' to the website in August 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/08/20/01civics.h29.html|title=Celebrities Lend Weight to Promote Civics Education|date=August 25, 2009 |work=[[Education Week]]|publisher=Education Week|author=Zehr, Mary Ann|accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref> It was incorporated as iCivics, inc. in May 2010 as the variety of content and users began to expand more rapidly.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.icivics.org/news/introducing-our-new-site|title=Introducing our new site {{!}} iCivics|website=www.icivics.org|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref> A more comprehensive website was launched, supplementing the gaming modules with classroom lessons on the branches of government.

[[Above the Law (blog)|Above The Law]] sponsored a ''Do I Have A Right?'' challenge in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/the-atl-do-i-have-a-right-challengecongratulations-from-justice-oconnor/|title=The ATL 'Do I Have A Right?'

==Mission==
Justice O’Connor initially envisioned Our Courts as a response to a perceived misunderstanding of the justice system in America.<ref name=":2" /> As keynote speaker at the [[National Council for the Social Studies|NCSS]] annual conference in 2007, she noted “that while two-thirds of Americans know at least two judges on FOX Television’s ‘American Idol’ reality program, less than one in 10 can name the Chief Justice of the United States.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_matters_home/oconnor.html|title=Law Matters Winter 2008 {{!}} Justice O'Connor Addresses NCSS Conference|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref> At present, ourcourts.org maintains this mission,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ourcourts.org/our-approach/|title=Our Approach - Our Courts America|website=ourcourts.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref> but iCivics has a broader mission incorporating education on the legislative and executive branches of government as well as civics at a local level.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=www.guidestar.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25|quote=Self-reported}}</ref>

The organization focuses on broadly improving civics education but also on closing the civics [[Achievement gap in the United States|education gap]].<ref name=":0" /> O'Connor saw the state of civics education as a result of the failure of traditional education methods, as well as funding cuts and lower graduation requirements imposed by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/38146.htm|title=Courting Kids|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref> Our Courts collaborator [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], a professor of literacy at Arizona State University, convinced her that educational games were the key to civics education, due to their capacity to teach problem solving.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/technology/sandra-day-oconnor-supreme-court-video-games.html|title=A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games|last=Singer|first=Natasha|date=2016-03-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref>

iCivics games have been evaluated for their educational effectiveness in a handful of research studies. ''Branches of Power'' was shown to be both engaging and educational for a majority of students in a test group.<ref>Lewis, Carrie, Jason Lancaster, Wilhelmina Savenye, and Nancy Haas. "A Formative Evaluation of the Balance of Power Game and Curriculum." ''The Journal of Applied Instructional Design'' 3, no. 3 (December 2013): 5-16.</ref> A significant number of students also play the games again at home, greatly increasing absorption of concepts and improving test scores.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trevorowens.org/portfolio/owens_Effects%20of%20learning%20from%20a%20civics%20video%20game.doc|title=Effects of learning from a civics video game|last=Owens|first=Trevor|date=December 2010|website=Trevor Owens|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref> The general iCivics curriculum has been shown to be an effective mechanism for education on civics topics as measured by scores on the US citizenship test. It was particularly effective among younger students in grades 4-6 and less effective among high school seniors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=LeCompte|first1=Karen|last2=Moore|first2=Brandon|last3=Blevins|first3=Brooke|date=Fall 2011|title=The Impact of iCivics on Students' Core Civic Knowledge|url=|journal=Research in the Schools|volume=18|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|via=}}</ref> The interactive writing exercise Drafting Board also improved [[persuasive writing]] skills among 8th graders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WP_76_KawashimaGinsberg.pdf|title=Summary of Findings from the Evaluation of iCivics' Drafting Board Intervention|last=Kawashima-Ginsberg|first=Kei|date=December 2012|website=CIRCLE|publisher=THE CENTER FOR INFORMATION & RESEARCH ON CIVIC LEARNING & ENGAGEMENT|access-date=}}</ref>

The organization is currently working on extending its curriculum to high school and reaching more high school educators. It currently serves one in four high school government and history teachers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}</ref>
