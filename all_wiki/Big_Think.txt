== History ==
The company began when the pair met while working with [[Google Video]] to digitize the [[VHS]] archives of the [[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]] show in 2006.<ref name=Melber>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/youtube-smart-people/|title=YouTube for Smart People |last=Melber|first=Ari|date=2008-03-31|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-03-26}}</ref> Brown and Hopkins began contemplating how to organize information into "[[Short form (linguistics)|short-form]] intellectual videos targeting online audiences".<ref name=Melber/> They envisioned "an online platform where the worldâ€™s leading experts could weigh in on current issues".<ref name="Forbes">{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahimkanani/2012/05/24/cofounder-and-president-of-bigthink-talks-getting-smarter-faster/#584983685e77|title=Cofounder and President of BigThink Talks Getting Smarter Faster|last=Kanani|first=Rahim|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-26}}</ref> Hopkins envisioned the platform as being a [[YouTube]] for intellectuals.<ref name=Arango/>

In 2008 they launched with only [[video]] content. The materials involve short clips but with enough content so that they foster thinking, learning, and debate.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The World Is Open: How Web Technology Is Revolutionizing Education|last=Bonk|first=Curtis J.|publisher=Jossey Bass|year=2009|isbn=9780470461303|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=226}}</ref>

In 2009, they branched into [[blog]]s and written content. Their first notable blogger was [[Michio Kaku|Dr. Michio Kaku]]. Other personalities include Angelina Jolie, who joined a panel of experts in a discourse over displaced children in Iraq, and Esther Dyson who talked about the opportunities from space exploration.<ref name=":0" />

In 2012, Big Think started [[Streaming media|live-streaming]] and providing individual and companies with "real-time interaction with notable guests". The platform also serves as a resource for educators and researchers, facilitating online learning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Teaching and Learning Online: New Models of Learning for a Connected World|last=Sutton|first=Brian|last2=Basiel|first2=Anthony|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415528566|location=New York|pages=xi}}</ref> As of March 2012, the Big Think YouTube channel passed 20 million views, and the video archive of the website included more than 12,000 clips from 2000+ experts.<ref name="Forbes" />
