The U.S. '''Equal Employment Opportunity Commission''' ('''EEOC''') is a large federal agency that was established via the 1964 Civil Rights Act to administer and enforce civil rights laws against [[workplace discrimination]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Loo|first=Rory|date=2018-08-01|title=Regulatory Monitors: Policing Firms in the Compliance Era|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/265|journal=Faculty Scholarship}}</ref>'''{{rp|12,21}}''' The EEOC investigates discrimination complaints based on an individual's race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, and retaliation for reporting, participating in, and/or opposing a discriminatory practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/index.cfm|title=Types of Discrimination}}</ref>

==History==
On March 6, 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed [[Executive Order 10925]], which required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Executive_Order_10925|title=Executive Order 10925|last=States|first=President of the United}}</ref> It established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, which then Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] was appointed to head. This was the forerunner of the EEOC.

The EEOC was established on July 2, 1965; its mandate is specified under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]] (ADEA),<ref>29 U.S.C. 621 et seq., as amended</ref> the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) of 1990, and the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008]]. The EEOC's first complainants were female flight attendants.<ref name="Collins2009">{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Gail|author-link=Gail Collins|title=When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780316059541|url-access=registration|date=14 October 2009|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]]|isbn=978-0-316-07166-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780316059541/page/59 59]–}}</ref> However, the EEOC at first ignored sex discrimination complaints, and the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment went unenforced for the next few years.<ref name="google5">{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Barry|author-link=Barry E.

All Commission seats and the post of general counsel to the commission are filled by the US President, subject to confirmation by the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/42/21/VI/2000e-4|title=42 U.S.C. § 2000e-4 – Equal Employment Opportunity Commission}}</ref> [[Stuart J.

On March 27, 2010, President Obama made [[recess appointment]]s of three Commission posts: Berrien, Feldblum, and [[Victoria Lipnic]]. With the appointments, the Commission had its full five Commissioners: Ishimaru, Berrien, Feldblum, Lipnic, and [[Constance Barker]], who was confirmed by the Senate in 2008 to be a Commissioner. President Obama also made a [[recess appointment]] of [[P. David Lopez]] to be the EEOC's General Counsel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-recess-appointments-key-administration-positions |title=President Obama Announces Recess Appointments to Key Administration Positions &#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2010-03-27 |accessdate=2013-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022015004/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-recess-appointments-key-administration-positions |archivedate=2013-10-22 }}</ref>

On December 22, 2010, the Senate gave full confirmation to Berrien, Feldblum, Lipnic, and Lopez. In 2014, President Obama renominated Lopez and he was reconfirmed by the Senate the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/10-11-16.cfm|title=EEOC General Counsel David Lopez to Depart Agency|website=www.eeoc.gov}}</ref>

In 2011, the Commission included "sex-stereotyping" of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals, as a form of sex discrimination illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<ref name="discrimination1">{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/otherprotections.cfm|title=Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation, Status as a Parent, Marital Status and Political Affiliation|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt|title=EEOC Request No. 0520110649|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}</ref> In 2012, the Commission expanded protection provided by Title VII to transgender status and gender identity.<ref name="discrimination1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt|title=Macy v.

After the departure of Ishimaru, the commission returned to its full five commissioners on April 25, 2013, with the Senate confirmation of Jenny Yang.

In 2015, it concluded that for Title VII, sex discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Dale |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/07/16/anti-gay-discrimination-is-sex-discrimination-says-the-eeoc/ |title=Anti-gay discrimination is sex discrimination, says the EEOC |work=The Washington Post |date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tatectate |first=Curtis |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article27469123.html |title=EEOC: Federal law bans workplace bias against gays, lesbians, bisexuals &#124; Miami Herald Miami Herald |publisher=Miamiherald.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}</ref>

However, the rulings, while persuasive, are not binding on courts and would need to be addressed by the Supreme Court for a final decision. The Commission also mediates and settles thousands of discrimination complaints each year prior to their investigation.  The EEOC is also empowered to file civil discrimination suits against employers on behalf of alleged victims and to adjudicate claims of discrimination brought against federal agencies.<ref>See {{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/42/21/VI/2000e-2|title=42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 – Unlawful Employment Practices}} and {{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/42/21/VI/2000e-3|title=42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3 – Other Unlawful Practices}}</ref><ref>

In addition, the EEOC, the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Civil Service Commission and the Office of [[Revenue Sharing]] have adopted Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures to assist employers in complying with federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.{{cite web|url=http://www.uniformguidelines.com/uniformguidelines.html#129|title=Uniform Guidelines On Employee Selection Procedures|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>

== Staffing, workload, and backlog ==
In 1975, when the backlog reached more than 100,000 charges to be investigated, President [[Gerald Ford]]'s full requested budget of $62 million was approved. A "Backlog Unit" was created in [[Philadelphia]] in 1978 to resolve the thousands of federal equal employment complaints inherited from the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]]. In 1980, [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] began re-characterizing the backlog cases as "workload" in her reports to Congress, thus fulfilling her promise to eliminate the backlog.<ref>"Enforcing the Civil Rights Act: Fighting Racism, Sexism and the Ku Klux Klan. The Story of the Miami EEOC's First Class Action Trial."  James Keeney, 2012 Civil Rights Publishing, Sarasota, FL</ref>

In June 2006, civil rights and labor union advocates publicly complained that the effectiveness of the EEOC was being undermined by budget and staff cuts and the outsourcing of complaint screening to a private contractor whose workers were poorly trained. In 2006, a partial budget freeze prevented the agency from filling vacant jobs, and its staff had shrunk by nearly 20 percent from 2001. A Bush administration official stated that the cuts had been made because it was necessary to direct more money to defense and homeland security.<ref name="wapo06-13-06">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/13/AR2006061301418.html|title=EEOC Is Hobbled, Groups Contend: Case Backlog Grows as Its Staff Is Slashed, Critics Say| last =  Lee|first=Christopher|work=Washington Post|date=June 14, 2006}}</ref> By 2008, the EEOC had lost 25 percent of its staff over the previous eight years, including investigators and lawyers who handle the cases. The number of complaints to investigate grew to 95,400 in fiscal 2008, up 26 percent from 2006.<ref name="WPost20090331">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033002901.html|title=EEOC Willfully Violated Pay Law, Arbitrator Rules|last=Vogel|first=Steve|work=Washington Post|date=March 31, 2009|page=A15}}</ref>

Although full-time staffing of the EEOC was cut between 2002 and 2006, Congress increased the commission's budget during that period, as it has almost every year since 1980. The budget was $303 million in fiscal year 2001<ref name="eeoc budget and staff">{{cite web|url=http://archive.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/plan/budgetandstaffing.html|title=EEOC Budget and Staffing History|date=May 12, 2009|work=Archives|publisher=EEOC.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209025619/http://archive.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/plan/budgetandstaffing.html|archivedate=December 9, 2009}}</ref> to $327 million in fiscal year 2006.<ref name="WPost20090331"/>

The outsourcing to Pearson Government Solutions in Kansas cost the agency $4.9 million and was called a "huge waste of money" by the president of the EEOC employees' union in 2006.<ref name="wapo06-13-06"/>

The EEOC uses monetary fines as the primary form of deterrence and, as the fines have not adjusted for inflation, the backlog of EEOC cases illustrates a decline in its effectiveness.

== Race and ethnicity ==

The EEOC requires employers to report various information about their employees, in particular their [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial/ethnic categories]], to prevent discrimination based on race/ethnicity. The definitions used in the report have been different at different times.

In 1997, the [[Office of Management and Budget]] gave a [[Federal Register]] Notice, the "Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity," which defined new racial and ethnic definitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html|title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity|publisher=}}</ref> As of September 30, 2007, the EEOC's EEO-1 report must use the new racial and ethnic definitions in establishing grounds for racial or ethnic discrimination.<ref>[http://www.eeoc.gov/eeo1/index.html Final Revisions of the Employer Information Report (EEO-1)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813053315/http://www.eeoc.gov/eeo1/index.html |date=August 13, 2009 }} by the EEOC. The page contains links to [[FAQ]]s, forms and instructions</ref> If an employee identifies their ethnicity as "Hispanic or Latino" as well as a race, the race is not reported in EEO-1, but it is kept as part of the employment record.

A person's skin color or physical appearance can also be grounds for a case of racial discrimination.<ref name=Discrimination>The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. "Race/Color Discrimination." August 15, 2007. "We may use this for the purpose of race and ethnicity."{{cite web |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/types/race.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812231006/http://eeoc.gov/types/race.html |archivedate=2009-08-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kalev|first1=Alexandra|last2=Dobbin|first2=Frank|last3=Kelly|first3=Erin|date=2006-08-01|title=Best Practices or Best Guesses?

==Investigative compliance policy==
EEOC applies an investigative compliance policy when respondents are uncooperative in providing information during an investigation of a charge. If a respondent fails to turn over requested information, field offices are to subpoena the information, file a direct suit on the merits of a charge, or use the legal principle of [[adverse inference]], which assumes the withheld information is against the respondent.<ref>AAjing</ref>

==Increase in disability-based charges==
In 2008, disability-based charges handled by the EEOC rose to a record 19,543, up 10.2 percent from the prior year and the highest level since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/eeoc-cases.html|title=''Ability Magazine: BAD BOYS – EEOC Tackles Job Discrimination"'' (2009)|accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

That may again be showing that because the EEOC has not adjusted many of their initial 1991 fines for inflation, the backlog of EEOC cases illustrates erosion of deterrence.

==Home Depot disability discrimination suit==
In September 2012, [[Home Depot]] agreed to pay $100,000 and furnish other relief to settle a [[disability]] discrimination lawsuit filed by the EEOC for the alleged failure to provide [[reasonable accommodation]] for a cashier with cancer at its [[Towson, Maryland]], store and for later purportedly firing her because of her condition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Depot to Pay $100,000 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Suit| url =  http://www.natlawreview.com/article/home-depot-to-pay-100000-to-settle-eeoc-disability-discrimination-suit |publisher=U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |work=The National Law Review|date=2012-09-10|accessdate=September 23, 2012}}</ref>

==2012 profile==

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced that it received 99,412 private sector workplace discrimination charges during fiscal year 2012, down slightly from the previous year. The year-end data also show that retaliation (37,836), race (33,512), and sex discrimination (30,356), which includes allegations of sexual harassment and pregnancy were the most frequently filed charges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/index.cfm |title=Enforcement and Litigation Statistics |accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref>

Additionally, the EEOC achieved a second consecutive year of a significant reduction in the charge inventory, something not seen since fiscal year 2002.  Due to a concerted effort, the EEOC reduced the pending inventory of private sector charges by 10 percent from fiscal year 2011, bringing the inventory level to 70,312.  This inventory reduction is the second consecutive decrease of almost ten percent in charge inventory.  Also this fiscal year, the agency obtained the largest amount of monetary recovery from private sector and state and local government employers through its administrative process — $365.4 million.
	
In fiscal year 2012, the EEOC filed 122 lawsuits, including 86 individual suits, 26 multiple-victim suits, with fewer than 20 victims, and 10 systemic suits. The EEOC's legal staff resolved 254 lawsuits for a total monetary recovery of $44.2 million.
	
EEOC also continued its emphasis on eliminating alleged systemic patterns of discrimination in the workplace. In fiscal year 2012, EEOC completed 240 systemic investigations which in part resulted in 46 settlements or conciliation agreements. These settlements, achieved without litigation, secured 36.2 million dollars for the victims of unlawful discrimination. In addition, the agency filed 12 systemic lawsuits in fiscal year 2012.

Overall, the agency secured both monetary and non-monetary benefits for more than 23,446 people through administrative enforcement activities – mediation, settlements, conciliations, and withdrawals with benefits. The number of charges resolved through successful conciliation, the last step in the EEOC administrative process prior to litigation, increased by 18 percent over 2011.

==Successes==

On May 1, 2013, a [[Davenport, Iowa]] jury awarded the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissission damages totaling $240 million &mdash; the largest verdict in the federal agency's history &mdash; for disability discrimination and severe abuse.<ref name="EEOC">{{cite web|title=Jury Awards $240 Million for Long-Term Abuse of Workers with Intellectual Disabilities|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/5-1-13b.cfm|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=29 April 2018|language=en|date=1 May 2013}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

The jury agreed with the EEOC that Hill County Farms, doing business as Henry's Turkey Service subjected a group of 32 men with intellectual disabilities to severe abuse and discrimination for a period between 2007 and 2009, after 20 years of similar mistreatment.<ref name="EEOC"/> This victory received international attention and was profiled in the New York Times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/09/us/the-boys-in-the-bunkhouse.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/09/us/the-boys-in-the-bunkhouse.html|title=The 'Boys' in the Bunkhouse|first=Dan|last=Barry|date=8 March 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

On June 1, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held in an 8-1 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia that an employer may not refuse to hire an applicant if the employer was motivated by avoiding the need to accommodate a religious practice. Such behavior violates the prohibition on religious discrimination contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<ref name="EEOC 2">{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Rules in Favor of EEOC in Abercrombie Religious Discrimination Case|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/6-1-15.cfm|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=29 April 2018|language=en|date=1 June 2015}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

EEOC General Counsel David Lopez hailed the decision. "At its root, this case is about defending the quintessentially American principles of religious freedom and tolerance," Lopez said. "This decision is a victory for our increasingly diverse society and we applaud Samantha Elauf's courage and tenacity in pursuing this matter.”<ref name="EEOC 2"/>

== Criticism ==
Some employment-law professionals criticized the agency after it issued advice that requiring a high school diploma from job applicants could violate the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]. The advice letter stated that the longtime lowest common denominator of employee screening must be "job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity." A [[Ballard Spahr]] lawyer suggested, "There will be less incentive for the general public to obtain a high school diploma if many employers eliminate that requirement for job applicants in their workplace."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/1/eeoc-high-school-diploma-might-violate-americans-w/|title=EEOC: High school diploma requirement might violate Americans with Disabilities Act|newspaper=Washington Times|author=Dave Boyer|date=1 January 2012}}</ref>

The EEOC has been criticized for alleged heavy-handed tactics in their 1980 lawsuit against retailer [[Sears, Roebuck & Co.]] Based on a statistical analysis of personnel and promotions, EEOC argued that Sears both was systematically excluding women from high-earning positions in [[Commission (remuneration)|commission sales]] and was paying female management lower wages than male management. Sears, represented by lawyer [[Charles Morgan, Jr.]], counter-argued that the company had encouraged female applicants for sales and management, but women preferred lower-paying positions with more stable daytime working hours, as compared to commission sales, which demanded evening and weekend shifts and featured drastically-varying paychecks, depending on the numbers of sales in a given pay period. In 1986, the court ruled in favor of Sears on all counts and noted that the EEOC had neither produced a single witness who alleged discrimination nor identified any Sears policy that discriminated against women.<ref>EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 628 F. Supp. 1264 (N.D. Ill. 1986) (Sears II).</ref><ref>Possley, Maurice (1986).

In a 2011 ruling against the EEOC, Judge [[Loretta A. Preska]] declared that It relied too heavily on [[anecdotal]] claims rather than on hard data, in a lawsuit against [[Bloomberg, L.P.]] that alleged discrimination against pregnant employees. In a ruling described in the ''New York Times''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/nyregion/discrimination-suit-against-bloomberg-lp-is-dismissed.html|title=Discrimination Suit Against Bloomberg L.P. Is Dismissed|first=David W.|last=Chen|date=17 August 2011|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref> as "strongly worded," Preska wrote, "the law does not mandate 'work-life balance' and added that while Bloomberg had expected high levels of dedication from employees, the company did not treat women who took pregnancy leave differently from those who took leave for other reasons.

In recent years, the EEOC has come under criticism for being ineffective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/28/18241973/workplace-discrimination-cpi-investigation-eeoc|title=Workplace discrimination is illegal.
