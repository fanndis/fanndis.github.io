{{US 2016 presidential elections series}}
In March 2016, the personal [[Gmail]] account of [[John Podesta]], a former [[White House chief of staff]] and chair of [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], was compromised in a [[data breach]] accomplished via a [[spear-phishing]] attack, and some of his emails, many of which were work-related, were hacked. [[Cybersecurity]] researchers as well as the [[United States government]] attributed responsibility for the breach to the Russian [[cyber spying]] group [[Fancy Bear]], allegedly two units of a [[GRU (G.U.)|Russian military intelligence agency]].<ref name="Motherboard" />

Some or all of the '''Podesta emails''' were subsequently obtained by [[WikiLeaks]], which published over 20,000 pages of emails, allegedly from Podesta, in October and November 2016.<ref name="SteinVox">{{Cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/20/13308108/wikileaks-podesta-hillary-clinton |title=What 20,000 pages of hacked WikiLeaks emails teach us about Hillary Clinton |last=Stein |first=Jeff |work=Vox |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref> Podesta and the Clinton campaign have declined to authenticate the emails.<ref name="CBS slogans tpp" /> Cybersecurity experts interviewed by [[PolitiFact]] believe the majority of emails are probably unaltered, while stating it is possible that the hackers inserted at least some doctored or fabricated emails.

Podesta's emails, once released by WikiLeaks, shed light on the inner workings of the Clinton campaign, suggested that CNN commentator [[Donna Brazile]] had shared audience questions with the Clinton campaign in advance of town hall meetings, and contained excerpts from Hillary Clinton's speeches to Wall Street firms. Since many of the emails contained bizarre references to "hot dogs" and "pizza," they also formed the basis for [[Pizzagate]], a [[conspiracy theory]] that posited that Podesta and other Democratic Party officials were involved in a [[child trafficking]] ring based out of pizzerias in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html |title=Dissecting the #PizzaGate Conspiracy Theories |last1=Huang |first1=Gregor Aisch, Jon |date=December 10, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210112745/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html |archive-date=December 10, 2016 |last2=Kang |first2=Cecilia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4590255/pizzagate-fake-news-what-to-know/ |title=What to Know About Pizzagate, the Fake News Story With Real Consequences |last=Samuelson |first=Kate |date=December 5, 2016 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207204808/http://time.com/4590255/pizzagate-fake-news-what-to-know/ |archive-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref>

Researchers from the Atlanta-based [[cybersecurity]] firm [[SecureWorks|Dell SecureWorks]] reported that the emails had been obtained through a [[Data breach|data theft]] carried out by the hacker group [[Fancy Bear]], a group of [[Russian Intelligence Community|Russian intelligence]]-linked hackers that were also responsible for [[cyberwarfare by Russia|cyberattacks]] that [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|targeted the Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) and [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC), resulting in WikiLeaks publishing emails from those hacks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/russia-responsible-podesta-wikileaks-hack-230095 |title=Russian hackers infiltrated Podesta's email, security firm says |last=Geller |first=Eric |date=October 20, 2016 |website=Politico |access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name="PerlrothShear">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/private-security-group-says-russia-was-behind-john-podestas-email-hack.html |title=Private Security Group Says Russia Was Behind John Podesta's Email Hack |last1=Perlroth |first1=Nicole |date=October 20, 2016 |work=The New York Times |last2=Shear |first2=Michael D.}}</ref>

SecureWorks concluded Fancy Bear had sent Podesta an email on March 19, 2016, that had the appearance of a Google security alert, but actually contained a misleading link&mdash;a strategy known as [[spear-phishing]]. (This tactic has also been used by hackers to break into the accounts of other notable persons, such as [[Colin Powell]]).

SecureWorks had tracked the activities of Fancy Bear for more than a year before the [[cyberattack]], and in June 2016 had reported the group made use of malicious Bitly links and fake Google login pages to trick targets into divulging their passwords.<ref name="PerlrothShear" /> However, the hackers left some of their Bitly accounts public, allowing SecureWorks to trace many of their links to e-mail accounts targeted with spear-phishing attacks.<ref name="PerlrothShear" /> Of this list of targeted accounts, more than one hundred were policy advisors to Clinton, or members of her presidential campaign, and by June, twenty staff members had clicked on the phishing links.<ref name="PerlrothShear" />

On December 9, 2016, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] told U.S. legislators the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] concluded that the Russian government [[Russian involvement in the 2016 United States presidential election|was behind]] the hack, and gave to [[WikiLeaks]] a collection of hacked emails from John Podesta.<ref name="secretcia">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html |title=Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House |last=Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller |date=December 9, 2016 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=December 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name="ciareportrussiatrump">{{Cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-russia-helped-trump-win-us-election-2016-12 |title=The CIA says it has evidence that Russia tried to help Trump win the US election |last1=Sanchez |first1=Chris |date=December 9, 2016 |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 13, 2018 |last2=Logan |first2=Bryan}}</ref><ref name="russiahelpeddonald">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/russia-helped-donald-trump-win-white-house-report-article-1.2905442 |title=Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the White House: report |last=Sommerfeldt |first=Chris |date=December 9, 2016 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

Cybersecurity experts interviewed by [[PolitiFact]] believe that while most of the emails are probably unaltered, it is possible the hackers inserted some doctored or fabricated material into the collection.<ref name="Carroll" />

[[Jeffrey Carr]], CEO of the cybersecurity company Taia Global, stated: "I've looked at a lot of document dumps provided by hacker groups over the years, and in almost every case you can find a few altered or entirely falsified documents. But only a few. The vast majority were genuine. I believe that's the case with the Podesta emails, as well."<ref name="Carroll" /> Jamie Winterton of the [[Arizona State University]] Global Security Initiative stated, "I would be shocked if the emails weren't altered," noting the longstanding Russian practice of promoting [[disinformation]].<ref name="Carroll" />

Cybersecurity expert Robert Graham described the contents of some of the emails as authentic by using the [[DomainKeys Identified Mail]] (DKIM) contained in these emails' signatures.<ref name="Fox News">{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/24/tech-blogger-finds-proof-dnc-chiefs-emails-werent-doctored-despite-claims.html |title=Tech blogger finds proof DNC chief's emails weren't 'doctored' despite claims |date=October 24, 2016 |publisher=Fox News |access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref> However, not all of the emails have these keys in their signature, and thus could not be verified with this method.<ref name="Carroll" />

In the October 2016 presidential debate, Clinton voiced her support for a "no-fly" zone in Syria. In a 2013 speech, Clinton had discussed the difficulties involved.

=== Presidential debate questions shared by Donna Brazile ===
On October 11, 2016, WikiLeaks released the text of an email sent by [[Donna Brazile]] on March 12, 2016, to Clinton communications director [[Jennifer Palmieri]] with the subject header "From time to time I get questions in advance." The email included a question about the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/10/11/then-cnn-contributor-donna-brazile-to-clinton-camp-sometimes-i-get-the-questions-in-advance/ |title=Then-CNN contributor Donna Brazile to Clinton camp: Sometimes 'I get the questions in advance' |last=Wemple |first=Erik |date=October 11, 2016 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> The following day Clinton received a similar question from the Townhall host, Roland Martin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/11/media/donna-brazile-wikileaks-question/ |title=Wikileaks mystery: How did town hall question get to Clinton campaign? |last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=October 12, 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref> Brazile initially denied coordinating with the Clinton campaign, and a CNN spokesperson said "CNN did not share any questions with Donna Brazile, or anyone else for that matter, prior to the town hall" and that "we have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand". According to [[CNNMoney]], the debate moderator [[Roland Martin (journalist)|Roland Martin]] did not deny that he shared questions with Brazile.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/11/media/donna-brazile-wikileaks-question/ |title=Wikileaks mystery: How did town hall question get to Clinton campaign? |last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=October 11, 2016 |website=CNNMoney |access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref> In another leaked email, Brazile wrote: "One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]]." At a debate in Flint the following day, a woman whose "son had developed a rash from the [[Flint water crisis|contaminated water]]" asked Clinton: "If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in government?" In a third email, Brazile added: "I'll send a few more."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/donna-brazile-leaked-question-hillary-clinton-cnn-debate-2016-10 |title=Hacked email suggests Donna Brazile leaked question to Hillary Clinton campaign ahead of CNN primary debate |last=Darcy |first=Oliver |date=October 31, 2016 |website=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

=== Saudi Arabia and Qatar ===

==Reactions==
The American public's interest in WikiLeaks in October roughly coincided with a tightening presidential race between Trump and Clinton. According to an analysis of opinion polling by Harry Enten of ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', the release of the emails roughly matched Clinton's decline in the polls, though it did not seem to have an effect on public perceptions of her trustworthiness. Enten concluded that WikiLeaks' activities were "among the factors that might have contributed to [Clinton's] loss."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wikileaks-hillary-clinton/ |title=How Much Did Wikileaks Hurt Hillary Clinton? |last=Enten |first=Harry |date=December 23, 2016 |website=FiveThirtyEight |access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>

Sociology professor [[Zeynep Tufekci]] criticized how WikiLeaks handled the release of these emails, writing, "Taking one campaign manager's email account and releasing it with zero curation in the last month of an election needs to be treated as what it is: political sabotage, not whistle-blowing."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/opinion/what-were-missing-while-we-obsess-over-john-podestas-email.html |title=WikiLeaks Isn't Whistleblowing |last=Tufekci |first=Zeynep |date=November 4, 2016 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> In an op-ed for ''The Intercept'', [[James Risen]] criticized the media for its reporting on emails, arguing that the hacking of the emails was a more significant story than the content of the emails themselves.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/trump-russia-election-hacking-investigation/ |title=Is Donald Trump a Traitor? |last=Risen |first=James |date=February 16, 2018 |website=The Intercept |access-date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> [[Thomas Frank]], writing in an editorial column for ''The Guardian'', argued that the emails gave an "unprecedented view into the workings of the elite, and how it looks after itself".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/the-podesta-emails-show-who-runs-america-and-how-they-do-it |title=Forget the FBI cache; the Podesta emails show how America is run |last=Frank |first=Thomas |date=October 31, 2016 |work=The Guardian |access-date=March 11, 2018}}</ref>

Glen Caplin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, "By dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing [Vladimir] Putin's dirty work to help elect Donald Trump."<ref name="Politico 80 pages">{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/hillary-clinton-wall-street-speeches-podesta-emails-229689 |title=Hacked 80-page roundup of paid speeches shows Clinton 'praising Wall Street' |last=Cheney |first=Kyle |date=October 12, 2016 |website=Politico |access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref> When asked to comment on the emails release, president Vladimir Putin replied that Russia was being falsely accused.
