==History==
[[File:Time Out Hong Kong Magazine Launch Cover.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|''Time Out Hong Kong'' launch cover]]

''Time Out'' was first published  in 1968 as a London listings magazine by [[Tony Elliott (publisher)|Tony Elliott]], who used his birthday money to produce a one-sheet pamphlet,<ref name=ft>{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/419e3992-0665-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0.html | title=Time Out abandons its cover price| author = Robert Budden| date= 24 September 2012| newspaper= Financial Times| accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> with [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]] as co-editor.<ref>''Old Grey Whistle Test'' DVD Vol 3; Bob Harris speaking before Track 3</ref>  The first product was titled ''Where It's At'', before being inspired by [[Dave Brubeck]]'s album ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]''.<ref name=refb>{{cite web| url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/57/Time-Out-Group-Ltd.html| title=Time Out Group Ltd.| publisher=Reference for business| accessdate=16 June 2015| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618151622/http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/57/Time-Out-Group-Ltd.html| archivedate=18 June 2015| df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''Time Out'' began as an alternative magazine alongside other members of the [[underground press]] in the UK, but by 1980 it had abandoned its original collective decision-making structure and its commitment to equal pay for all its workers, leading to a strike and the foundation of a competing magazine, ''[[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]]'', by former staffers. By now its former radicalism has all but vanished.<ref>Phillips, A. (2007). "The Alternative Press". In K. Coyer, T. Dowmunt & A. Fountain (eds.), ''The Alternative Media Handbook'' (p. 54). London; New York: Routledge.</ref> As one example of its early editorial stance, in 1976 London's ''Time Out'' published the names of 60 purported [[CIA]] agents stationed in England.<ref name="'70s 51">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/51 51]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/51}}</ref> Early issues had a print run of around 5,000 and would evolve to a weekly circulation of 110,000 as it shed its radical roots.<ref name=adweek>{{cite web| url= http://www.adweek.com/news/press/can-time-out-s-tony-elliott-weather-storm-132910?page=1| title= Can Time Out's Tony Elliott weather the storm?

The flavour of the magazine was almost wholly the responsibility of its designer, Pearce Marchbank: <blockquote>Marchbank was invited by Tony Elliott to join the embryonic ''Time Out'' in 1971. Turning it into a weekly, he produced its classic logo, [and] established its strong identity and its editorial structure—all still used worldwide to this day.  He also conceived and designed the first of the ''Time Out'' guide books. ... He continued to design for ''Time Out'' for many years. Each week, his powerful, witty ''Time Out'' covers became an essential part of London life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pearcemarchbank.com/pearcemarchbankb.html|title=Pearce Marchbank – Biography|website=www.pearcemarchbank.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027062056/http://pearcemarchbank.com/pearcemarchbankb.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

Elliott launched ''Time Out New York'' (''TONY''), his North American magazine debut, in 1995. The magazine hired young and upcoming talent to provide cultural reviews for young New Yorkers at the time.<ref name = adweek/> The success of ''TONY'' led to the introduction of ''Time Out New York Kids'', a quarterly magazine aimed at families. The expansion continued with Elliott licensing the Time Out brand worldwide spreading the magazine to roughly 40 cities including Istanbul, Dubai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Lisbon.<ref name = adweek/>

Additional Time Out products included travel magazines, city guides, and books.<ref name = adweek/> In 2010, Time Out became the official publisher of travel guides and tourist books for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]].<ref name=book>{{cite web| url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/carlton-wiley-and-time-out-official-publishers-london-olympics| title=Carlton, Wiley and Time Out official publishers for London Olympics| author=Catherine Neilan| date=17 March 2010| publisher=The Bookseller| accessdate=16 June 2015| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085417/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/carlton-wiley-and-time-out-official-publishers-london-olympics| archivedate=4 March 2016| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

''Time Out''{{’}}s need to expand to [[Electronic publishing|digital platforms]] led to Elliott, sole owner of the group until November 2010, to sell half of ''Time Out'' London and 66 percent of ''TONY'' to private equity group Oakley Capital, valuing the company at £20 million.<ref name=bbc20101126>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11844925|title=Time Out publisher sells 50% stake|publisher=BBC News|date=26 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127044834/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11844925|archivedate=27 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The group, founded by [[Peter Dubens]], was owned by Tony Elliott and Oakley Capital until 2016, the agreement provided capital for investment to expand the brand. ''Time Out'' has subsequently launched websites for an additional 33 cities including Delhi, Washington D.C., Boston, Manchester and Bristol.<ref name = adweek/> when it was listed on London's [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM stock exchange]].<ref name="ft"/><ref name="bbc20101126"/> In June 2016, Time Out Group underwent an [[IPO]] and is listed on London's AIM stock exchange trading under the ticker symbol 'TMO'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-timeout-ipo-idUKKCN0YV1MF|title=Time Out to Raise £90 Million in London Listing|publisher=Reuters|first=Noor Zanib|last=Hussain|date=9 June 2016|access-date=22 September 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923111529/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-timeout-ipo-idUKKCN0YV1MF|archivedate=23 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], ''Time Out'' ceased producing paper copies of the magazine and switched to an [[Digital edition|online-only model]]. Temporarily [[rebranding]] as ''Time {{Strikethrough|Out}} In'', the publication also refocused its editorial content towards virtual events for people staying at home during the [[2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom#Late_March_2020|lockdown]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/coronavirus-time-out-and-stylist-free-magazines-go-digital-only-as-readers-stay-home/|title=Coronavirus: Time Out and Stylist free magazines go digital-only as readers stay home|last=Tobbitt|first=Charlotte|date=23 March 2020|work=[[Press Gazette]]|accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>
