The '''krone''' ({{IPA-da|ˈkʰʁoːnə}}; plural: ''kroner''; [[currency sign|sign]]: '''kr.'''; [[ISO 4217|code]]: '''DKK''') is the official [[currency]] of [[Denmark]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Faroe Islands]], introduced on 1 January 1875.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.kgl-moent.dk/DKM/UK/RoyalMint.nsf/side/History_of_Danish_coinage!OpenDocument |title=History of Danish coinage |publisher=Denmarks Nationalbank |accessdate=12 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730153248/http://www.kgl-moent.dk/DKM/UK/RoyalMint.nsf/side/History_of_Danish_coinage%21OpenDocument |archive-date=2012-07-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Both the ISO code "DKK" and currency sign "kr." are in common use; the former precedes the value, the latter in some contexts follows it. The currency is sometimes referred to as the '''Danish [[Crown (currency)|crown]]''' in [[English language|English]], since ''krone'' literally means [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]. Historically, krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century.

One krone is subdivided into 100 ''øre'' ({{IPA-da|ˈøːɐ}}; singular and plural), the name ''øre'' is probably derived from the Roman word for gold.<ref>[https://ordnet.dk/ddo_en/dict?select=%C3%B8re,2&query=%C3%B8re "Øre"]. The Danish Dictionnary. Retrieved 23 January 2020.</ref> Altogether there are eleven denominations of the krone, with the smallest being the [[Fifty øre (Danish coin)|50 øre]] coin (one half of a [[krone (Danish coin)|krone]]). Formerly there were more øre coins, but those were discontinued due to inflation.

The krone is pegged to the [[euro]] via the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|ERM II]], the European Union's exchange rate mechanism. Adoption of the euro is favoured by some of the major political parties, however a [[2000 Danish euro referendum|2000 referendum]] on joining the [[Eurozone]] was defeated with 53.2% voting to maintain the krone and 46.8% voting to join the Eurozone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu.dk/da/danmark-i-eu/de-danske-forbehold |title=Folkeafstemning om euroen den 28. september 2000 |date=8 August 2006 |publisher=Folketinget |language=da |accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref>

Jens Christian Moesgaard, [http://www.danskmoent.dk/artikler/blaatandnnum2009.pdf Hvorfor er der så få enkeltfund af Harald Blåtands mønter?] (2009).</ref>
Organised minting in Denmark was introduced on a larger scale by [[Canute the Great]] in the 1020s. 
[[Lund]], now in Sweden, was the principal minting place and one of Denmark's most important cities in the Middle Ages, but coins were also minted in Roskilde, Slagelse, Odense, Aalborg, Århus, Viborg, Ribe, Ørbæk and Hedeby. For almost 1,000 years, Danish kings – with a few exceptions – have issued coins with their name, monogram and/or portrait.<ref name="history" /> Taxes were sometimes imposed via the coinage, such as by the compulsory substitution of coins handed in by new coins handed out with a lower silver content.<ref name="history" />

Danish coinage was generally based on the [[Carolingian Renaissance#Carolingian currency|Carolingian silver standard]]. Periodically, the metal value of the minted coins was reduced, and thus did not correspond to the face value of the coins. This was mainly done to generate income for the monarch and/or the state. As a result of the debasement, the public started to lose trust in the respective coins. Danish currency was overhauled several times in attempts to restore public trust in the coins, and later issued in paper money.<ref name="history" />

In 1619 a new currency was introduced in Denmark, the krone (crown). One krone had the value of {{frac|1|1|2}} [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler species]] accounting for 96 kroneskillinger, later for 144 common skillinger.<ref>Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, vol. 11. Leipzig 1907, p. 732 ([http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Krone+%5B5%5D online verfügbar]); accessed Oktober 29, 2013</ref>

Until the late 18th century, the krone was a denomination equal to 8 [[Mark (money)|mark]], a subunit of the Danish rigsdaler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfinancialdata.com/index.php3?action=showghoc&country_name=DENMARK |title=Global Financial Data |publisher=Global Financial Data |accessdate=2009-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103102/http://www.globalfinancialdata.com/index.php3?action=showghoc&country_name=Denmark |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref> A new krone was introduced as the currency of Denmark in January 1875. It replaced the rigsdaler at a rate of 2 kroner = 1 rigsdaler.  This placed the krone on the [[gold standard]] at a rate of 2,480 kroner = 1 kilogram fine gold. The latter part of the 18th century and much of the 19th century saw expanding economic activity and thus also a need for means of payment that were easier to handle than coins. Consequently, banknotes were increasingly used instead of coins.<ref name="history" />

The introduction of the new krone was a result of the [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]], which came into effect in 1873 (with the coins being adopted two years later) and lasted until [[World War I]]. The parties to the union were the three [[Scandinavia]]n countries, where the name was ''krone'' in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] and ''krona'' in [[Sweden]], a word which in all three languages literally means ''crown''. The three currencies were on the [[gold standard]], with the krone/krona defined as {{frac|2480}} of a kilogram of pure gold.{{citation needed|date = January 2019}}

The Scandinavian Monetary Union came to an end in 1914 when the gold standard was abandoned. Denmark, Sweden and Norway all decided to keep the names of their respective and now separate currencies.{{citation needed|date = January 2019}}

Denmark returned to the gold standard in 1924 but left it permanently in 1931. Between 1940 and 1945, the krone was tied to the [[German Reichsmark]]. Following the end of the German occupation, a rate of 24 kroner to the [[British pound]] was introduced, reduced to 19.34 (4.8 kroner = 1 [[US dollar]]) in August the same year. Within the [[Bretton Woods System]], Denmark devalued its currency with the pound in 1949 to a rate of 6.91 to the dollar. A further devaluation in 1967 resulted in rates of 7.5 kroner.{{citation needed|date = January 2019}}

In 2014, it was decided to stop printing of the Krone in Denmark, but the work would be outsourced, and on 20 December 2016, the last notes were printed by the [[Danmarks Nationalbank|National Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barsøe|first1=Frederik|title=Today Ends a 1000 Year Old Tradition|url=http://www.bt.dk/danmark/i-dag-er-det-slut-med-1.000-aar-gammel-tradition-det-er-da-med-et-vist-vemod-at-vi|website=bt.dk|publisher=Berlingske Media|accessdate=20 December 2016|language=da|date=20 December 2016}}</ref>

==Current status==

===Relationship to the euro===
{{main|Denmark and the euro}}
Denmark has not introduced the [[euro]], following a rejection by [[2000 Danish euro referendum|referendum in 2000]], but the Danish krone is pegged closely to the euro in [[ERM II]], the EU's exchange rate mechanism. Denmark borders one eurozone member, [[Germany]], and one other EU member, [[Sweden]], which is legally obliged to join the euro in the future (though [[Sweden and the euro|Sweden maintains that joining ERM II is voluntary]], thus avoiding euro adoption for the time being).

===Faroe Islands and Greenland===
{{main|Faroese króna|Greenlandic krone}}
[[The Faroe Islands]] uses a localized, non-independent version of the Danish krone, known as the ''[[Faroese króna]]'' pegged with the Danish krone at par, using the Danish coin series, but have their own series of distinct banknotes, first being issued in the 1950s and later modernized in the 1970s and the 2000s.

[[Greenland]] adopted the Act on Banknotes in Greenland in 2006 with a view to introducing separate Greenlandic banknotes. The Act entered into force on 1 June 2007. In the autumn of 2010, a new Greenlandic government indicated that it did not wish to introduce separate Greenlandic banknotes and [[Danmarks Nationalbank]] ceased the project to develop a Greenlandic series. Still, Greenland continues to use Danish kroner as sole official currency.
Historically, [[Greenland]] under the colonial administration issued distinct banknotes between 1803 and 1968, together with coins between 1926 and 1964 (see [[Greenland rigsdaler]] and [[Greenland krone]]).

Faroe Islands and Greenland have their own [[IBAN]] codes (FO and GL, while Denmark has DK). Transfers between the countries count as international with international fees, outside EU rules.

==Coins==

===Alloys and colour scheme===

}}
The design of the coin series is intended to ensure that the coins are easy to distinguish from each other:

The series is therefore divided into three sequences, each with its own metal colour. This division into colours has its roots in history. In earlier times, the value of the coins was equivalent to the value of the metal from which they were minted: gold was used for the coins of the highest denominations, silver for the next-highest, and copper for the lowest coin denominations. This correlation between colour and value has been retained in the present coin series (see examples to the right). The 50-øre coins are thus minted from copper-coloured bronze, the 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins from a silver-coloured cupronickel alloy, and the 10- and 20-krone coins from golden aluminium bronze.

The coins differ in terms of size, weight and rim. Within each sequence the diameter and weight of the coins increase with their value. The 50-øre and 10-krone coins have smooth rims, while the rims of the 1- and 5-krone coins are milled. The rims of the 2- and 20-krone coins have interrupted milling. The 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins have a hole in the middle. Use of these various characteristics makes it easy for the blind and sight-impaired to tell the coins apart.

===Commemoratives and thematic coins===
{{main|Commemorative coins of Denmark}}

The coins of the programme have the same size and metal composition as the regular coins of their denomination.

The first series, 20-krone coins featuring towers in Denmark, ran between 2002 and 2007 and spawned ten different motifs. Upon selecting the towers, importance had been attached not only to display aesthetic towers, but also towers with different form, functions and from different regions of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The last coin depicting the [[Copenhagen City Hall]] was issued in June 2007, marking the end of the series.
A second series of 20-krone coins, starting in 2007 with twelve different planned motifs and ten already released by November 2011, shows Denmark as a maritime nation in the world, featuring iconic Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic ships and like the previous series of tower coins, the series reflect various landmarks in shipbuilding in the three countries.

In 2005, Danmarks Nationalbank issued the first in a series of five 10-krone commemorative coins with motifs from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tales. The motifs depicted on the coins were chosen to illustrate various aspects and themes central to the fairy tales with the fifth and final fairy tale coin inspired by [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]] being issued on 25 October 2007.<ref>[http://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/banknotes_and_coins/thematic%20coins/Pages/Fairytale-coins.aspx Fairy Tale coins<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
In 2007, as the fairy tale series ended, a second series of three 10-krone commemorative coins was introduced, celebrating the [[International Polar Year]]. Featuring motifs of a polar bear, [[Slædepatruljen Sirius|the Sirius Sledge Patrol]] and the [[Aurora Borealis]], the coins aimed to accentuate scientific research in the backdrop of Greenlandic culture and geography. The third and final coin entitled 'Northern Lights' marked the completion of the series in 2009.<ref>[http://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/banknotes_and_coins/thematic%20coins/Pages/Polar-coins.aspx Polar coins<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Banknotes==
{{further|Banknotes of Denmark, 1972 series|Banknotes of Denmark, 1997 series|Banknotes of Denmark, 2009 series}}

Most Danish banknotes (with a few exceptions) issued after 1945 are valid as payment. Banknotes have since 1945 been issued with the values: 5 kroner, 10 kroner, 20 kroner, 50 kroner, 100 kroner, 200 kroner, 500 kroner & 1000 kroner.

===Portrait and landscape series===

===Bridge series===
The process of designing the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank.<ref>[http://banknotenews.com/files/tag-denmark.php www.banknotenews.com]</ref> The theme of the new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between the past and the present. The present is represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a window thread ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.

==Nicknames==
Within context, some of the banknotes have figurative meanings with the 100-krone note sometimes referred to as a ''hund'' (dog) shortening the word ''hundrede'' (a hundred). The 500-krone note can be referred to as a ''plovmand'' (ploughman) because previous circulations of the note featured a picture of a man with a plough and the 1000-krone note, too, can be referred to as a ''tudse'' (toad) taken from a wordplay on the word ''tusinde'' meaning a ''thousand''. The 1000-krone note may also be referred to as an ''egern'' (squirrel) because the 1972 series version of the note featured a squirrel.{{cn|date=November 2020}}
