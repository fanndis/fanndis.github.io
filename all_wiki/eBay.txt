'''eBay Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|b|eɪ}} {{respell|EE|bay}}, stylized '''ebay''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[e-commerce]] corporation based in [[San Jose, California]], that facilitates [[consumer to consumer|consumer-to-consumer]] and [[business to consumer|business-to-consumer]] sales through its website. eBay was founded by [[Pierre Omidyar]] in 1995, and became a notable success story of the [[dot-com bubble]]. eBay is a multibillion-dollar business with operations in about 32 countries, as of 2019.<ref name="10-K"/><ref name="Global Trade: 1. Finding International Items On eBay"/> The company manages the eBay website, an [[online auction]] and shopping website in which people and businesses buy and sell a wide variety of [[goods and services]] worldwide. The website is free to use for buyers, but sellers are charged fees for listing items after a limited number of free listings, and again when those items are sold.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seller fees & invoices|url=http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/sell/seller-fees.html|work=eBay|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref>

In addition to eBay's original [[auction]]-style sales, the website has evolved and expanded to include: instant "Buy It Now" shopping; shopping by [[Universal Product Code]], [[ISBN]], or other kind of [[Stock Keeping Unit|SKU]] number (via [[Half.com]], which was shut down in 2017); online classified advertisements (via [[Kijiji]], or eBay Classifieds); online event ticket trading (via [[StubHub]]); and other services. eBay previously offered online money transfers as part of its services (via [[PayPal]],<ref name="Skype and PayPal – A Different Set of Rules"/> which was a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay from 2002 to 2015).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/13222445/1/paypal-spinoff-day-is-here--what-does-it-mean-for-investors.html|title=PayPal Spinoff Day Has Arrived -- What Does It Mean for Investors?|last=Borison|first=Rebecca|date=July 20, 2015|work=TheStreet|access-date=December 1, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
===1990s===
The AuctionWeb was founded in [[California]] on September 3, 1995, by French-born [[Iranian-American]] computer programmer [[Pierre Omidyar]] as part of a larger personal site.<ref name="cohen"/> One of the first items sold on AuctionWeb was a broken [[laser pointer]] for $14.83. Astonished, Omidyar contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the laser pointer was broken; the buyer explained: "I'm a collector of broken laser pointers."<ref name="el_history"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen, Adam (Adam Seth)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49887399|title=The perfect store : inside eBay|date=2002|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|isbn=0-316-15048-7|edition=1st|location=Boston|oclc=49887399}}</ref> It soon became the first [[online auction]] site allowing person-to-person [[online transactions|transactions]], and its popularity boomed.<ref name="Bunnell">{{cite book |last1=Bunnell |first1=David |title=The ebay Phenomenon: Business Secrets Behind the World's Hottest Internet Company |date=2001 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9780471436799 |pages=71–81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnict8L-_iYC&pg=PA71 |chapter=The eBay Business Model}}</ref>

Reportedly, eBay was simply a hobby for Omidyar until his Internet service provider informed him he would need to upgrade to a business account due to his high website traffic. The monthly price increase from $30 to $250 prompted him to start charging eBay users, who did not object.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Chris Agarpao was eBay's first additional employee to process mailed check payments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/16/books/chapters/the-perfect-store.html|title=The Perfect Store|last=Cohen|first=Adam|date=June 16, 2002|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref>
[[File:Pomidyarji.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre Omidyar]], founder and chairman of eBay]]

[[Jeffrey Skoll]] was hired as the first new president of the company in early 1996. In November 1996, the [[Ecommerce platform|E-Commerce platform]] entered into its first third-party licensing deal, with a company called Electronic Travel Auction, to use SmartMarket Technology to sell plane tickets and other travel products. Growth was phenomenal: from {{formatnum:250000}} auctions during all of 1996 to {{formatnum:200000}} in January 1997 alone.<ref>page 36, ''The eBay Phenomenon'' by Elen Lewis publ2008 by [[Marshall Cavendish]] books</ref><ref name="cohen" />

The company officially changed the name of its service from AuctionWeb to eBay in September 1997, after Echo Bay Technology Group, Omidyar's consulting firm. The domain name [[Echo Bay Mines|echobay.com]] was already taken by a gold mining company,<ref name="Echobay Partners LTD"/> so Omidyar shortened it to eBay.com.<ref name="The history of ebay"/> In 1997 the company received $6.7 million in funding from the venture capital firm [[Benchmark Capital]].<ref name="eBoys: The First Inside Account of Venture Capitalists at Work"/>

The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar's fiancée trade [[Pez]] candy dispensers was fabricated in 1997 by [[public relations]] manager [[Mary Lou Song]] to give the media a [[human-interest story]] more appealing than Omidyar's original vision of a "[[perfect market]]".<ref name="Berkun2010" /><ref name="cohen" /> The Pez dispenser myth generated enormous publicity and led to explosive early growth among toy collectors.

The leader in the toy category quickly became [[Beanie Babies]] manufactured by [[Ty, Inc.]], the most difficult toys to find in retail stores. As collectors internationally were trying to complete their collection of Beanie Babies, Ty set up the [[Ty Inc.#First business-to-consumer Website|first business-to-consumer Web site]], a secondary-market online trading post where people could trade their Beanie Babies. However, it was overwhelmed with unsortable listings, creating an urgent demand for a more efficient online trading system.<ref name="DarkSide">{{cite book|last=Bissonnette|first=Zac|date=March 2015|title=The Great Beanie Baby Bubble: Mass Delusion and the Dark Side of Cute|publisher=Penguin Books|chapter=The Efficient Market| pages=122–125|isbn=978-1591846024}}</ref><ref name="BeaniesFortune">{{cite news |title=Lessons from the Great Beanie Babies Crash |url=http://fortune.com/2015/03/11/beanie-babies-failure-lessons/ |work=Fortune |author=Anne Vandermey |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=July 11, 2018 }}</ref> Beanie Babies quickly became the dominant product on eBay, accounting for 10% of all listings in 1997, as collectors thronged eBay's user-friendly interface to search for specific Beanie Babies.

[[Meg Whitman]] was hired by the board as eBay president and [[CEO]] in March 1998. At the time, the company had 30 employees,<ref name="eBay founder factchecks John McCain" /> half a million users and revenues of $4.7 million in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|date=April 15, 2011|title=The history of eBay: How the internet auctioneer rose to the top|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/8451898/The-history-of-eBay.html|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}</ref>

On September 21, 1998, eBay went public.<ref name="eBay Inc. - MSN Fact Sheet" /> In the risk factors section of the annual report filed with the [[US Securities and Exchange|US Securities and Exchange Commission]] in 1998, Omidyar notes eBay's dependence on the continued strength of the Beanie Babies market.<ref name="DarkSide" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2004-12-05/pierre-m-dot-omidyar-the-web-for-the-people |title=Pierre M.

===2000s===
As the company expanded product categories beyond collectibles into almost any saleable item, business grew quickly.<ref name="el_history"/>  In 2000, eBay had 12 million registered users and a cyberinventory of more than 4.5 million items on sale on any given day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Flea Market at Your Fingertips |author=Lisa Hoffman |newspaper=Citizens Voice |location=Wilkes-Barre, PA |pages=38 |date=July 6, 2000 | url-access=subscription |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/508413379 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate = December 23, 2018 }}</ref> In 2001, eBay had the largest userbase of any [[e-commerce]] site.<ref name="Bunnell" /> In February 2002 the company purchased iBazar, a similar European auction web site founded in 1998,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/8451898/The-history-of-eBay.html|title=The history of eBay|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=July 24, 2017|language=en}}</ref> and then bought [[PayPal]] on October 3, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/its-official-ebay-weds-paypal/|title=It's Official: eBay Wed PayPal|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=October 3, 2002|accessdate=October 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612164750/https://www.cnet.com/news/its-official-ebay-weds-paypal/|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

By early 2008 the company had expanded worldwide, counting hundreds of millions of registered users as well as {{formatnum:15000}} employees and revenues of almost $7.7 billion. After nearly ten years at eBay, Whitman decided to enter politics. On January 23, 2008, the company announced that Whitman would step down on March 31, 2008, and [[John Donahoe]] was selected to become president and CEO.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Whitman remained on the board of directors and continued to advise Donahoe through 2008. In late 2009 eBay completed the sale of [[Skype]] for $2.75 billion, but still owned 30% equity in the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/19/AR2009111903725.html |title=Breaking: eBay Completes Skype Sale At $2.75 Billion Valuation |work=The Washington Post |date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |first=Robin |last=Wauters}}</ref>

On September 30, 2014, eBay announced it would spin off PayPal into a separate publicly traded company, a demand made nine months prior by activist hedge fund magnate [[Carl Icahn]]. The spinoff completed on July 18, 2015. eBay's then chief executive, John Donahoe, stepped down from that role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=De La Merced|first1=Michael|last2=Sorkin|first2=Andrew|title=EBay to Spin Off PayPal, Adopting Strategy Backed by Icahn|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/ebay-to-spin-off-paypal-adopting-strategy-backed-by-icahn/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Supantha|title=EBay follows Icahn's advice, plans PayPal spinoff in 2015|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/30/us-ebay-divestiture-idUSKCN0HP13D20140930|agency=Reuters|accessdate=September 30, 2014|date=September 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|title=eBay, PayPal to split into separate companies in 2015|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ebay-to-split-paypal-into-separate-company-in-2015/|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=September 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612164755/https://www.cnet.com/news/ebay-to-split-paypal-into-separate-company-in-2015/|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Flipkart and eBay entered into a strategic partnership in 2017 under which eBay Inc acquired a 5.44% stake in Flipkart in exchange for its eBay India business for $211 Mn and a $514 Mn cash investment.

On January 31, 2018, eBay announced that they would replace PayPal as its primary payments provider with Netherlands-based start-up [[Adyen]]. The transition was set to be completed by 2021, but PayPal would remain an acceptable payment option on the site until further notice.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/01/why-ebay-abandoned-paypal-for-a-smaller-european-competitor.html|title=Why eBay abandoned PayPal for a smaller European competitor|last=Browne|first=Ryan|date=February 1, 2018|publisher=CNBC|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>

===Logo===
In September 2012, eBay introduced a new logo set in the [[Univers]] typeface, but using a thinner variation of it,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/ebay_settles_for_lowest_bid.php |title=Brand New: eBay Settles for Lowest Bid. |publisher=Brand New |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205162405/http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/ebay_settles_for_lowest_bid.php |archive-date=February 5, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> installed on the website on October 10, 2012. It replaced the logo with a thicker variation of Univers which had been used since its establishment in 1995.  An all red, eBay logo with the same type set was also introduced to be used temporarily for various holidays.

===Profit and transactions===
eBay generates revenue by a complex system of fees for services, listing product features, and a ''final value fee'' for sales proceeds by sellers. As of 2019 the US-based eBay.com charges [[United States Dollar|$]]0.35 as an insertion fee for a basic listing without any adornments. The final value fee is 10-12% of the total amount of the sale, which is the price of the item plus shipping charges.<ref>{{cite web|title=eBay selling fees|url=https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4364|access-date=August 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141725/https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/selling-fees?id=4364|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Reduced final value fees are available to business registered customers. Other eBay websites follow a similar fee structure, but with different cost charges.

Under US law before 2018, a state cannot require sellers located outside the state to collect a [[sales tax]], which made making purchases on eBay more attractive to American buyers. Sellers that operate as a business do follow state tax regulations on eBay transactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/articles/ebays_history_the_owner_of_paypal |title=Ebay's history – know your roots! |work=Ecommerce Journal |accessdate=February 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326182138/http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/articles/ebays_history_the_owner_of_paypal|archive-date=March 26, 2008}}</ref><ref name="eBay Guides - Tickets Buying Guide"/> Since 2018, changes to tax law in the United States force eBay (and other large marketplaces) to collect sales tax on any eBay purchase shipped to certain states.<ref>{{cite web|title=eBay sales tax collection|url=https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/taxes-import-charges?id=4121#section4}}</ref>

eBay runs an affiliate program under the name eBay Partner Network.<ref name="eBay Partner Network"/> eBay affiliate marketers were originally paid a percentage of the eBay seller's transaction fees, with commissions ranging from 50% to 75% of the fees paid for an item purchased. In October 2009, eBay changed to an affiliate payout system that it calls Quality Click Pricing, in which affiliates are paid an amount determined by an undisclosed algorithm. The total earnings amount is then divided by the number of clicks the affiliate sent to eBay and is reported as Earnings Per Click, or EPC. In October 2013, ePN launched a new pricing model. The new model is more transparent and is based on category-level base commission rates with bonuses available for referring new and reactivated buyers.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebaypartnernetworkblog.com/en/2013/09/new-pricing-to-launch-on-october-1st|title=New Pricing to Launch on October 1st|publisher=eBay Inc.|access-date=January 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423072417/http://www.ebaypartnernetworkblog.com/en/2013/09/new-pricing-to-launch-on-october-1st/|archive-date=April 23, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Environmental record===
On May 8, 2008, eBay announced the opening of its newest building on the company's North Campus in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], which is the first structure in the city to be built from the ground up to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold standards.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> The building, the first the company had built in its 13-year existence, uses an array of 3,248 solar panels, spanning {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}}, and providing 650 kilo[[watt]]s of power to eBay's campus.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The array can supply 15–18% of the company's total energy requirements, reducing the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that would be produced to create that energy by other means.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> [[SolarCity]], the company responsible for designing the array, estimates that the solar panels installed on eBay's campus will prevent 37 million pounds of [[carbon dioxide]] from being released into the environment as a result of replaced power production over the next three decades. Creating an equivalent impact to remove the same amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would require planting {{convert|322|acre|km2}} of trees.

The design of the building also incorporates other elements to reduce its impact on the environment. The building is equipped with a lighting system that detects natural ambient light sources and automatically dims artificial lighting to save 39% of the power usually required to light an office building. eBay's newest building also reduces demand on local water supplies by incorporating an eco-friendly irrigation system, and low-flow showerheads and faucets. Even during construction, more than 75% of the waste from construction was recycled. eBay also runs buses between San Francisco and the San Jose campus to reduce the number of commuting vehicles.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> In 2014, eBay and several other Oregon businesses signed the Oregon Business Climate Declaration to promote local job growth and slow carbon pollution.<ref name=bizjournal>{{cite web|last1=Giegerich|first1=Andy|title=Intel, eBay in forefront as Oregon tech companies join fight against climate change|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/sbo/2014/09/intel-ebay-in-forefront-as-oregon-tech-companies.html|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref>

====Craigslist====
In the summer of 2004, eBay acknowledged that it had acquired 25% of classified listings website [[Craigslist]]. Former Craigslist executive Phillip Knowlton was the seller, and he insisted that his former employer was aware of his plans to divest his holdings. Initially, eBay assured Craigslist that eBay would not ask Craigslist to change the way it did business.

In March 2005, eBay launched the classifieds service [[Kijiji]]. In April 2008, eBay sued Craigslist to "safeguard its four-year financial investment", claiming that in January 2008, Craigslist took actions that "unfairly diluted eBay's economic interest by more than 10%".<ref name="EBay sues Craigslist ad website"/> Craigslist countersued in May 2008 "to remedy the substantial and ongoing harm to fair competition" that Craigslist claimed was constituted by eBay's actions as a Craigslist shareholder.<ref name="Craigslist strikes back at eBay"/> In September 2010, Delaware Judge [[William B. Chandler III|William Chandler]] ruled that the actions of Craigslist were unlawful and that the actions were taken by Craigslist founders [[Jim Buckmaster]] and [[Craig Newmark]] had "breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty", and restored eBay's stake in the company to 28.4% from a diluted level of 24.85%.<ref name="Market Watch"/> However, the judge dismissed eBay's objection to a staggered board provision, citing that Craigslist has the right to protect its own trade secrets.<ref name="eBay Gets Partial Win in Craigslist Poison Pill Lawsuit"/><ref name="Ruling Restores Ebay's Stake in Craigslist"/> eBay spokesman Michael Jacobson stated "We are very pleased that the court gave eBay what it sought from the lawsuit."<ref name="Market Watch"/>

====Qoo10.jp====
In April 2018, eBay acquired the Japanese division of [[Qoo10]], a market place driven by Giosis and having the 4th GMV in Japan, for a reported $573 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/20/ebay-qoo10/|title=EBay paid $573M to buy Japanese e-commerce platform Qoo10, filing reveals|work=TechCrunch|access-date=November 15, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> With the close of the transaction, eBay also has relinquished its investment in Giosis’ non-Japanese businesses.  This acquisition expands eBay's footprint in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. eBay made an initial investment in Giosis Pte. Ltd. in 2010.  Since then, Giosis has established dynamic marketplace businesses across Asia. eBay's Japan business, including Giosis’ Japan business, will report into Jooman Park, senior vice president of eBay's Asia Pacific region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-completes-acquisition-of-giosis-japan-business/|title=eBay Completes Acquisition of Giosis' Japan Business|date=May 2, 2018|website=ebayinc.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref>

==Use for data analysis==
eBay is a publicly visible market which has attracted interest from economists, who have used it to analyze aspects of buying and selling behavior, auction formats, etc., comparing them with previous theoretical and empirical findings.

Computer information systems researchers have also shown interest in eBay. Michael Goul, Chairman of the Computer Information Systems department of the [[W. P. Carey School of Business|W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University]], published an academic case based on eBay's [[big data]] management and use in which he discusses how eBay is a data-driven company that processes 50 [[petabyte]]s of data a day.<ref name="knowwpc">{{cite web|url=http://knowwpcarey.com/article.cfm?cid=25&aid=1171 |title=eBay Study: How to Build Trust and Improve the Shopping Experience |publisher=Knowwpcarey.com |date=May 8, 2012 |accessdate=June 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619040218/http://knowwpcarey.com/article.cfm?cid=25&aid=1171 |archive-date=June 19, 2012 }}</ref>

eBay uses a system that allows different departments in the company to check out data from their data mart into sandboxes for analysis. According to Goul, eBay has already experienced significant business successes through its data analytics. eBay employs 5,000 data analysts to enable data-driven decision making.<ref name="knowwpc"/>

===Third party===
In 2006 the accounting software company [[Intuit]] launched a web-based donation tracking service called ItsDeductible. The service uses data from eBay to help users assign a [[market value]] to the items they donate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elmblad|first=Shelley|title=ItsDeductible Online Tracks Charitable Contributions All Year|url=http://financialsoft.about.com/od/taxdeductionsforcharity/p/ItsDeductibleOL.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Visual search===
In July 2017 eBay released an image search capability allowing users to find listings on the site that match an item depicted in a photo, using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/ebay-to-launch-visual-search-tools-for-finding-products-using-photos-from-your-phone-or-web/|title=Ebay to launch visual search tools for finding products using photos from your phone or web|work=TechCrunch|last=Perez|first=Sarah|access-date=July 28, 2017}}</ref>

===GCHQ===
UK's [[GCHQ]] has a suite of tools for monitoring target use of eBay, named ELATE.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/14/manipulating-online-polls-ways-british-spies-seek-control-internet/|title=Hacking Online Polls and Other Ways British Spies Seek to Control the Internet|work=The Intercept|date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

===Items===
Millions of [[collectable|collectibles]], [[interior design|decor]], [[Home appliance|appliances]], computers, [[furniture|furnishings]], [[tool|equipment]], [[domain name]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doeswhat.com/2011/04/08/ipadtrilogy-com-for-sale-gbp-3-mil/ |title=eBay domain name sellers: ipadtrilogy.com for sale £3,000,000?!|publisher=DoesWhat |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref> vehicles, and other miscellaneous items are listed, bought, or sold daily on eBay. In 2006, eBay launched its Business & Industrial category, breaking into the industrial surplus business. Generally, anything can be auctioned on the site as long as it is not illegal and does not violate the eBay Prohibited and Restricted Items policy.<ref name="Prohibited and Restricted Items - Overview"/> Services and [[intangible asset|intangibles]] can be sold, too. Large international companies, such as [[IBM]], sell their newest products and offer services on eBay using competitive auctions and fixed-priced storefronts. Separate eBay sites such as eBay US and eBay UK allow the users to trade using the local currency. Software developers can create applications that integrate with eBay through the [[eBay API]] by joining the eBay Developers Program.<ref name="eBay Developers Program"/> In June 2005, there were more than 15,000 members in the eBay Developers Program, comprising a broad range of companies creating software applications to support eBay buyers and sellers as well as eBay Affiliates.

Numerous government and police agencies<ref>{{cite web|title=government Auctions|url=http://governmentauctionsuk.com/page/police-auction|website=Police and Government Auctions|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> around the world now use eBay as well as traditional [[auction]]s to dispose of seized and confiscated goods.

Controversy has arisen over certain items put up for bid. For instance, in late 1999 a man offered one of his [[kidney]]s for auction on eBay, attempting to profit from the potentially lucrative (and, in the United States, illegal) market for [[organ transplant|transplantable human organs]].<ref name="kidney">{{cite news|author=Harmon, Amy |publication-date= September 3, 1999 |title= Auction for a kidney pops up on Ebay's site |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |at=nytimes.com |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/03/us/auction-for-a-kidney-pops-up-on-ebay-s-site.html|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref>

Beginning in August 2007, eBay required listings in "Video Games" and "Health & Beauty" to accept its payment system [[PayPal]] and sellers could only accept PayPal for payments in the category "Video Games: Consoles".<ref name="August 10, 2007, 10:38&nbsp;am BST post to eBay announcement board by eBay's staff"/> Starting January 10, 2008, eBay said sellers can only accept PayPal as payment for the categories "Computing > Software", "Consumer Electronics > MP3 Players", "Wholesale & Job Lots > Mobile & Home Phones", and "Business, Office & Industrial > Industrial Supply / MRO".<ref name="December 21, 2007 12:10&nbsp;pm GMT General announcement by eBay"/> eBay announced that starting in March 2008, eBay had added to this requirement that all sellers with fewer than 100 feedbacks must offer PayPal and no [[merchant account]] may be used as an alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ebay.co.uk/businesshub/index.php?page=safe_payments |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215143942/http://web.ebay.co.uk/businesshub/index.php?page=safe_payments |archive-date=February 15, 2008 |title=Announcement posted in a section on eBay called Changes in 2008 |date=February 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="eBay February 2008 announcement board posted on February 28, 2008 02:49&nbsp;pm GMT"/> This is in addition to the requirement that all sellers from the United Kingdom have to offer PayPal.<ref name="eBay announcement March 24, 2008 09:00&nbsp;am GMT"/>

Further, and as noted below, it was a requirement to offer PayPal on all listings in Australia and the UK. In response to concerns expressed by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]], however, eBay has since removed the policy on the eBay.com.au website requiring sellers to offer PayPal as a payment option.

On April 24, 2006, eBay opened its new eBay Express site, which was designed to work like a standard Internet shopping site for consumers with United States addresses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125526/article.html|title=eBay Previews New eBay Express|first=Juan Carlos|last=Perez|work=[[PC World]]|date=April 24, 2006|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}</ref> Before it closed in 2008, selected eBay items were mirrored on eBay Express, where buyers used a traditional digital shopping cart to purchase from multiple sellers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/business/12giants.html|title=Amid the Gloom, an E-Commerce War|last=Stone|first=Brad|date=October 11, 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref> The UK version was launched to eBay members in mid-October 2006, but on January 29, 2008, eBay announced its intention to close the site.<ref name="January 2008"/> The German version, eBay Express Germany,<ref name="eBay - eine der größten deutschen Shopping-Websites"/> was also opened in 2006 and closed in 2008.

At the 2008 eBay Developer's Conference, eBay announced the Selling Manager Applications program (SM Apps).<ref name="eBay Developer's Conference Highlights"/> The program allows approved developers to integrate their applications directly into the eBay.com interface.<ref name="Selling Manager Applications"/> The applications created by developers are available for subscription by eBay members who also subscribe to Selling Manager.

eBay maintains a number of specialty sites including the discussion boards, groups, answer center, chat rooms, and reviews and guides. eBay's mobile offerings include [[Short message service|SMS]] alerts, a [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] site, [[Java ME]] clients, and mobile applications for [[Windows Phone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android OS]], and Apple iPhone.

The initiative [[Choice in eCommerce]] was founded on May 8, 2013, by several online retailers in [[Berlin]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tamebay.com/2013/07/petition-for-choice-in-ecommerce.html|title=Petition for Choice in Ecommerce|publisher=Tamebay.com|date=July 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newrooms.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/choice-in-ecommerce/|title=Choice in eCommerce|work=The newroomsonline blog|date=July 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jean-Marc |last=Noel |date=August 9, 2013 |url=http://www.trustedshops.co.uk/news/online-retailers-prepare-to-fight-the-sales-ban/ |title=Online retailers prepare to fight the sales ban - Ecommerce News Blog |publisher=Trustedshops.co.uk |accessdate=May 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529153720/http://www.trustedshops.co.uk/news/online-retailers-prepare-to-fight-the-sales-ban/ |archive-date=May 29, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toyworldmag.co.uk/news/2013/07/ebay-asks-retailers-to-back-choice-in-ecommerce-campaign |title=eBay lobbies to ban sales restrictions |work=Toy World Magazine |accessdate=May 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221205130/http://www.toyworldmag.co.uk/news/2013/07/ebay-asks-retailers-to-back-choice-in-ecommerce-campaign |archive-date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webretailer.com/news/1765-choice-in-ecommerce-campaigns-for-resale.asp |title=Choice in eCommerce Campaigns for Resale Rights |publisher=Web Retailer |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222134312/http://www.webretailer.com/news/1765-choice-in-ecommerce-campaigns-for-resale.asp |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webretailer.com/news/1777-choice-in-ecommerce-interview.asp |title=Choice in eCommerce Interview |publisher=Web Retailer |date=September 21, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222134314/http://www.webretailer.com/news/1777-choice-in-ecommerce-interview.asp |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>BILD, Online-Händler kämpfen gegen Hersteller-Boykott, July 16, 2013</ref><ref>eCommerce Magazin 7-2013, Online-Handel gründet Initiative gegen Verkauftsverbot, July 17, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/unternehmen/aufstand-gegen-adidas-und-co-online-haendler-stemmen-sich-gegen-verkaufsverbote_aid_1043835.html|title=Aufstand gegen Adidas und Co.: Online-Händler stemmen sich gegen Verkaufsverbote|date=July 16, 2013|work=FOCUS Online}}</ref> The cause was, in the view of the initiative, sales bans and online restrictions by individual manufacturers.

====Unusual items====
{{Main|Unusual eBay listings}}
Many unusual items have been placed for sale on eBay, including at least two previously undiscovered species, including the ''[[Coelopleurus exquisitus]]'' [[sea urchin]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/outriders/2006/09/an_equisite_new_species_found.shtml|title=BBC - Outriders: An Exquisite New Species found on Ebay|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="Insect expert discovers new species on eBay">{{cite web|url=http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/corporate/PressReleases/PressReleases.php?PRID=48 |title=Insect expert discovers new species on eBay |date=August 19, 2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121228223514/http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/PressReleases.php?PRID=48 |archive-date=December 28, 2012 }}</ref>

====Prohibited or restricted items====
In its earliest days, eBay was nearly unregulated. However, as the site grew, it became necessary to restrict or prohibit auctions for various items. Note that some of the restrictions relate to eBay.com (the US site), while other restrictions apply to specific European sites (such as Nazi paraphernalia). Regional laws and regulations may apply to the seller or the buyer. Generally, if the sale or ownership of an item is regulated or prohibited by one or more states, eBay will not permit its listing. Among the hundred or so banned or restricted categories:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|

}}

===Bidding===

====Auction-style listings====
{{Main|Proxy bid}}
Bidding on eBay (old or new)'s auction-style listing is called proxy bidding and is essentially equivalent to a [[Vickrey auction]] (sealed-bid), with the following exceptions.
* The winning bidder pays the second-highest bid plus one bid increment amount (that is, some small predefined amount relative to the bid size), instead of simply the highest bid. However, since the bid increment amounts are relatively insignificant compared to the bid size, they are not considered from a strategic standpoint.<ref name="eBay's explanation of bid increments"/>
* The highest bidder's bid is sealed, as in a Vickrey auction, but the current winning bid (second highest plus one increment) is displayed throughout the auction to allow [[price discovery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aucx.com/|title=Domain Name Auctions |publisher=AUCX.com}}</ref>
* Because eBay's auction-style listings are sealed-bid, it is usually to all bidders' advantage that bids are made only at the very end of the auction (except for an initial minimum bid, that cancels out a "Buy It Now" option, or prevents the seller from ending the listing early). Early bids will usually not increase the bidder's chance of winning the auction, and will often raise the item's final price (winning bid) for the eventual winner.
* eBay also allows sellers to offer a "Buy it Now" price that will end the auction immediately. The Buy It Now price is available until someone bids on the item, or until the reserve price is met. When the Buy It Now option disappears, the auction-style listing proceeds normally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fixed-price.html|title=Selling using a fixed price|publisher=ebay.com}}</ref>

====Seller ratings====
In 2008, eBay implemented a system of seller ratings with four categories. Buyers are asked to rate the seller in each of these categories with a score of one to five, with five being the highest rating. Unlike the overall feedback rating, these ratings are anonymous; neither sellers nor other users learn how individual buyers rated the seller. The listings of sellers with a rating of 4.3 or below in any of the four rating categories appear lower in search results. Power Sellers are required to have scores in each category above 4.5.<ref name="February 2008"/><ref name="January 20081"/><ref name="Upcoming Changes to Feedback"/><ref name="Fees 2008 Overview"/><ref name="January 20082"/>

In a reversal of roles, on January 24, 2010, Auctionbytes.com held an open survey in which sellers could rate eBay, as well as competing auction and marketplace sites.<ref name="survey"/> In the survey, users were asked to rank 15 sites based on five criteria: profitability, customer service, communication, ease of use, and recommendation.

eBay was ranked 13th,<ref name="auctionbytes13"/> after other large sites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[Craigslist]], as well as lesser-known selling sites such as [[Atomic Mall]], [[eCRATER]], and [[Ruby Lane]]. In individual category rankings, eBay was rated the worst of all the 15 sites on customer service and communication, and average on ease of use. Some respondents stated they would have given eBay a rating of 10, three to five years ago. eBay was rated twelfth out of fifteen in the Recommended Selling Venue category.

====Charity auctions====
Using [[MissionFish]] as an arbiter, eBay allows sellers to donate a portion of their auction proceeds to a charity of the seller's choice.<ref>[https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/09/ebay-update-adds-a-sell-for-charity-option-for-us-and-uk-markets/ "eBay update adds a Sell for Charity option for US and UK markets"].

Some high-profile charity auctions have been advertised on the eBay home page.<ref>2008 Jeffrey Carpenter, Jessica Holmes and Peter Hans Matthews Charity Auctions: A field of Experiment, The Economic Journal, Vol118 p92-93, Royal Economic Society, London- Blackwell Publishing January 2008.</ref> As of June 2010, the highest successful bid on a single item for charity was for the annual "Power Lunch"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/12/buffett-lunch-auction-idUSN1115876120100612 |title=UPDATE 1-Warren Buffett lunch sells for $2.63 mln on eBay |agency=Reuters  |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> with investor [[Warren Buffett]] at the famous [[Smith & Wollensky]] Steakhouse in New York. The winning bid was $2.63 million with all of the proceeds going to the [[Glide Foundation]]. The winning bidder was not made public, but was able to bring up to seven friends to the lunch. In 2012, a higher bid, of $3.46 million, also going to the Glide Foundation, won a lunch with Buffet.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/story/2012-06-09/cost-lunch-warren-buffett/55476718/1|title=Cost to lunch with Warren Buffett: $3.5 million |agency=Associated Press |date=June 9, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> In 2016 an anonymous bidder won a $3.45 million lunch with Warren Buffett and the money raised from the auction was given to Glide Foundation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mystery-bid-of-3-456-789-wins-lunch-with-warren-buffett-1465648848|title=Warren Buffett Lunch Auction Won by Mystery Bidder for $3,456,789|last=Das|first=Anupreeta|date=June 11, 2016|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref>

The previous highest successful bid on a single item for charity was for a letter<ref name="eBay Update: High Bidder on Reid Letter Will Own Historic Document"/> sent to Mark P. Mays, CEO of [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] (parent company of [[Premiere Radio Networks]] the production company that produces ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' and ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'') by Senator [[Harry Reid]] and forty other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senators, complaining about comments made by conservative talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]]. The winning bid was $2,100,100, with all of the proceeds going to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, benefiting the education of children of men and women who have died serving in the armed forces. The winning bid was matched by Limbaugh in his largest charity donation to date.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/washington/20letter.html?em&ex=1193025600&en=044964c8f9169d02&ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=Critical Letter to Limbaugh Fetches $2 Million | first=Stephanie | last=Strom | date=October 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

In 2007; eBay Canada partnered with Montreal-based digital branding agency CloudRaker to develop a campaign to raise money for Sainte-Justine children's hospital in Montreal. They aligned themselves with Internet phenomenon [[Têtes à claques]] to create an eBay auction based on popular T-A-C character Uncle Tom, an infomercial host who pitches absurd products. eBay and CloudRaker reproduced Uncle Tom's imaginary products, The Body Toner Fly Swatter, The Willi Waller Potato Peeler, and the LCD Shovel and sold them online. In six weeks, they raised $15,000 for Hôpital St-Justine with one fly swatter, one potato peeler, and one shovel, a world record. The Body Toner Fly Swatter sold for $8,600, the Willi Waller Potato Peeler sold for $3,550, and the LCD Shovel sold for $2,146.21.

===Shipping===
During auction setup, eBay provides shipping-method choices to sellers: ordinary mail, [[express mail]], and/or courier service. The seller may choose to offer only one shipping method to buyers, or the seller may offer buyers a choice of options.

Very-low-value items shipped directly from China are sometimes shipped by [[surface mail]] (seamail), which is inexpensive but takes one to two months.<ref>{{cite web|title=China Travel Tips » Postal Service|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/essential/postal-service/|website=Travel China Guide website|publisher=Xian Marco Polo International Travel Service Co., Ltd|accessdate=February 19, 2017|quote=Surface mail takes one to two months. ... The postage for an airmail is almost twice as much as surface mail.}}</ref> If the buyer is in a hurry, he or she might be able to pay an extra fee to upgrade to second-class [[Surface Air Lifted]] shipping or to first-class [[airmail]] shipping.

Since 2012, eBay has been enlisting sellers into its "Global Shipping Program". If a seller uses the program, non-domestic buyers pay a fee to [[Pitney Bowes]]. The seller sends the item to a Pitney Bowes facility in the US (or the UK), which then forwards it to the buyer, taking care of all international shipping requirements. The program is claimed to enhance the product selection available to international buyers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Re: eBay Global shipping program|url=http://community.ebay.ca/topic/Seller-Central/Ebay-Global-Shipping/3000008345|work=eBay Seller Central forum|accessdate=May 1, 2013|date=February 8, 2013|at=Post 13}}</ref>

==Controversies and criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of eBay}}
Common eBay criticisms involve the policy of requiring the use of [[PayPal]] for payments and concerns over fraud, forgeries and intellectual property violations in auction items.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} There are also issues of how negative feedback after an auction can offset the benefits of using eBay as a trading platform.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} eBay has been criticized for not paying UK taxes: the ''Sunday Times'' reported in October 2012 that eBay paid only £1.2m in tax on sales of over £800m.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20022365 |title=EBay 'pays £1.2m in UK tax' on sales of £800m |date=October 21, 2012 |accessdate=January 4, 2014 |work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

===2014 security breach===
On May 21, 2014, the company revealed that the consumer database of usernames, passwords, phone numbers, and physical addresses had been breached between late February and early March. Users were advised to change their passwords; to expedite this, a "change password" feature was added to profiles of users who had not yet done so. The [[Syrian Electronic Army]] took responsibility for the attack. The SEA said that even though the hack revealed millions of users' banking details to them, they would not misuse the data. They had replaced the front pages of the websites with their own logo, called "[[Website defacement|Defacing]]" in technical terms. The hack caused eBay's share price to crash in intra-day trade as a result of the breach of security.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/05/21/technology/security/ebay-passwords/index.html | title=EBay customers must reset passwords after major hack | publisher=CNN | accessdate=May 21, 2014| date=May 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/05/21/ebay-breach/9368969/ | title=EBay urging users to change passwords after breach | date=May 21, 2014 | work=USA Today | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/21/us-ebay-password-idUSBREA4K0B420140521 | title=EBay asks 145 million users to change passwords after cyber attack | agency=Reuters | date=May 21, 2014 | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2014/05/21/ebay-suffers-massive-security-breach-all-users-must-their-change-passwords/ | title=eBay Suffers Massive Security Breach, All Users Must Change Their Passwords | work=Forbes | date=May 21, 2014 | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref>

=== Stalking scandal ===
{{main|eBay stalking scandal}}
A [[cyberstalking]] and harassment campaign conducted in 2019 against an online newsletter led to charges made public in 2020 against seven members of eBay's global security team, as well as arrests of two of those charged. Following the publication of an article in online newsletter ''EcommerceBytes'' about eBay's litigation against Amazon, CEO Devin Wenig texted an EBay communications executive, saying, "If you are ever going to take [an ECommerceBytes writer] down... now is the time." Thereafter, a team of EBay employees launched a cyberstalking and harassment campaign against the newsletter's authors. Wenig, the company's CEO at the time of the harassment campaign, has not been not charged.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Durkin Richer |first1=Alanna |title=Feds: eBay staff sent spiders, roaches to harass couple |url=https://apnews.com/786117108cdfefb40e691b1b3420c689 |agency=Associated Press |date=June 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Heater |first1=Brian |title=US attorney details eBay employees’ harassment campaign, including live roaches and a pig fetus |url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/us-attorney-details-ebay-employees-harassment-campaign-including-live-roaches-and-a-pig-fetus/ |work=TechCrunch |date=June 15, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Streitfeld">{{cite news |last1=Streitfeld |first1=David |title=Inside eBay’s Cockroach Cult: The Ghastly Story of a Stalking Scandal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/technology/ebay-cockroaches-stalking-scandal.html |accessdate=September 26, 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=September 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kwan|first=Campbell|title=Four former eBay employees set to plead guilty to cyberstalking charges in US|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/four-former-ebay-employees-set-to-plead-guilty-to-cyberstalking-charges-in-us/|access-date=September 29, 2020|publisher=ZDNet|language=en}}</ref>
