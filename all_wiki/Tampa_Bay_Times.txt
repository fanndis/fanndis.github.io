==History==
[[File:St. Petersburg Times (2009-08-27).svg|left|thumb|Logo of the ''St. Petersburg Times'' in 2009]]
The newspaper traces its origins to the ''West Hillsborough Times'', a weekly newspaper established in [[Dunedin, Florida]] on the [[Pinellas]] peninsula in 1884. At the time, neither St. Petersburg nor [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]] existed; the peninsula was part of [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]]. The paper was published weekly in the back of a pharmacy and had a circulation of 480. It subsequently changed ownership six times in seventeen years.<ref name="History">{{cite web |title=Times History |url=http://company.tampabay.com:2052/company/about-us/times-history |publisher=Times Publishing Company |access-date=June 13, 2018 |date=2015}}</ref> In December 1884 it was bought by A. C. Turner,<ref name="history2" /> who moved it to [[Clear Water Harbor]] (modern [[Clearwater, Florida]]).<ref name="History" /> In 1892 it moved to St. Petersburg,<ref name="History" /> and by 1898 it was officially renamed the ''St. Petersburg Times''.<ref name=Deggans>{{cite news |title= The St. Petersburg Times will become the Tampa Bay Times on Jan. 1 |author= Deggans, Eric |url= http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/media/content/st-petersburg-times-will-become-tampa-bay-times-jan-1 |work= St. Petersburg Times |date= November 1, 2011 |access-date= April 3, 2012 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120208201000/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/media/content/st-petersburg-times-will-become-tampa-bay-times-jan-1 |archive-date= February 8, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

The ''Times'' became [[Bi-weekly newspaper|bi-weekly]] in 1907, and began publication six days a week in 1912. Paul Poynter, a publisher originally from Indiana, bought the paper in September 1912 and converted to a seven-day paper, though it was rarely financially stable. Paul's son, [[Nelson Poynter]], became editor in 1939 and took majority control of the paper in 1947, and set about improving the paper's finances and prestige. Nelson Poynter controlled the paper until his death in 1978, when he willed the majority of the stock to the non-profit [[Poynter Institute]].<ref name="History" /> In November 1986, the ''[[Evening Independent]]'' was merged into the ''Times''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Poynter was succeeded as editor by [[Eugene Patterson]] (1978–1988),<ref name="History" /> Andrew Barnes (1988–2004),<ref name="History" /> [[Paul Tash]] (2004–2010; chair of the Times Publishing Company since 2004 and the Poynter Institute since 2007)<ref>http://www.tampabay.com/company/about-us/times-executives/bios/ptash</ref><ref name="History" /> Neil Brown (2010–2017),<ref>http://www.tampabay.com/company/about-us/times-executives/bios/nbrown</ref> and Mark Katches (2018–present).<ref>http://company.tampabay.com:2052/company/about-us/times-executives/bios/mkatches</ref>

On January 1, 2012, the '''''St. Petersburg Times''''' was renamed the '''''Tampa Bay Times'''''; this stemmed from a 2006 decision of a lawsuit with [[Media General]], at the time the publishers of the ''Times''{{'}} competing newspaper, ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]'', which allowed that paper to keep its exclusive right to use the name of its defunct sister paper, ''The Tampa Times'', for five years after the decision.<ref name="Deggans" />

As the newly rechristened ''Tampa Bay Times'', the paper's weekday tabloid ''tbt*'', a free daily publication and which used "(* Tampa Bay Times)" as its subtitle, became just ''tbt'' when the name change took place.<ref name=Deggans/> The ''St. Pete Times'' name lives on as the name for the ''Times''{{'}} neighborhood news sections in southern [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]] (formerly ''Neighborhood Times''), serving communities from [[Largo, Florida|Largo]] southward.

[[File:Tampa Bay Times tbt (2009-08-27).svg|thumb|Logo of the free tabloid ''tbt*'' in 2009]]
The ''Times'' has also done significant investigative reporting on the [[Church of Scientology]], since the church's acquisition of the [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] in 1975 and other holdings in [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]]. The ''Times'' has published special reports and series critical of the church and its current leader, [[David Miscavige]].<ref name="TruthRunDown">{{cite news | author1 = Tobin, Thomas C. | author2 = Childs, Joe | title = The Truth Run Down | url = http://www.tampabay.com/news/article1012148.ece | work = St. Petersburg Times | date = June 23, 2009 | access-date = June 23, 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130209040134/http://www.tampabay.com/news/article1012148.ece | archive-date = February 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2010, the ''Times'' published an investigative report questioning the validity of the [[United States Navy Veterans Association]], leading to significant reaction and official investigations into the group nationwide.<ref name="rt1">{{Cite news | author1 = Casey, Dan | author2 = Sluss, Michael | title = Fla.

On May 3, 2016, the ''Times'' acquired its longtime competitor ''The Tampa Tribune'', with the latter publication immediately ceasing publishing<ref name=WFLA>{{cite news |author1=Sunde Farquhar |title=Tampa Bay Times buys, shutters Tampa Tribune |url=http://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/tampa-bay-times-buys-tampa-tribune/1052099560 |work=WFLA |date=May 3, 2016}}</ref> and ''Tribune'' features and some writers expected to be merged into the ''Times''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/05/03/tampa-bay-times-buys-ends-rival-tampa-tribune/83888058/ | title='Tampa Bay Times' buys, shuts down rival 'Tampa Tribune' | work=USA Today | date=May 3, 2016 | access-date=May 3, 2016}}</ref> As reported by other local media outlets in the Tampa Bay area at the time of this acquisition, for many years the ''Tampa Tribune'' was considered to be the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] newspaper in the region, while the ''Tampa Bay Times'' was thought of as more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]].<ref name="WFLA" />

The ''Times''{{'}} purchase of ''The Tribune'' also allowed its circulation area to be expanded into [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]], placing it in competition with other newspapers such as ''[[The Ledger|The Lakeland Ledger]]'' and ''[[The Polk County Democrat]]'', as well as into the south central region of the state known as the [[Florida Heartland]].  In the case of the latter, the ''Times'' published ''[[Highlands Today]]'', which was a daily news supplement of ''The Tribune'' for readers in [[Highlands County, Florida|Highlands County]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highlandstoday.com/hi/local-news/a-note-from-our-publisher-20160504/|work=[[Highlands Today]]|title=A note from our publisher|date=May 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506055720/http://www.highlandstoday.com/hi/local-news/a-note-from-our-publisher-20160504/ |archive-date=May 6, 2016}}</ref> The ''Times'' sold the paper in 2016 to Sun Coast Media Group.

==PolitiFact.com==
{{main|PolitiFact.com}}
The newspaper created [[PolitiFact.com]], a project in which its reporters and editors "fact-check statements by members of Congress, the White House, lobbyists and interest groups…"<ref>{{cite web| title = PolitiFact.com| work = St. Petersburg Times| url = http://www.politifact.com | access-date = August 27, 2009}}</ref> They publish original statements and their evaluations on the PolitiFact.com website, and assign each a "Truth-O-Meter" rating, with ratings ranging from "True" for completely true statements to "Pants on Fire" (from the taunt "Liar, liar, pants on fire") for false and ridiculous statements. The site also includes an "Obameter",<ref>{{cite web |title=The Obameter |publisher=Politifact |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/ |access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> tracking [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s performance with regard to his campaign promises. PolitiFact.com was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] in 2009 for "its fact-checking initiative during the 2008 presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than 750 political claims, separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters."<ref name=Pulitzer2009>{{cite web |title=2009 Pulitzer Prize Winners & Finalists |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2009 |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes |access-date=June 13, 2018}}</ref> The ''Times'' sold PolitiFact.com to its parent company, the Poynter Institute, in 2018.
