"'''Begin Again'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012). Swift co-produced the song with [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]] and [[Dann Huff]]. Initially released as a [[promotional recording|promotional single]] on September 25, 2012 by [[Big Machine Records]], the song served as the second official [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Red'' on October 1, 2012. "Begin Again" is a [[Country music|country]] song, with the lyrical content finding Swift falling in love again after a failed relationship.

The song was widely acclaimed by music critics, many of whom praised Swift's songwriting and complimented for coming back to her country roots for the close of the album. The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Philip Andelman]], who also directed the music video for Swift's "[[Safe & Sound (Taylor Swift song)|Safe & Sound]]". "Begin Again" was commercially successful, and it became Swift's second top ten hit from ''Red'' on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|US]] and [[Canadian Hot 100|Canadian]] music charts following the hit single "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]", debuting and peaking at numbers seven and four respectively. The single has been certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). "Begin Again" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] at the [[56th Grammy Awards]].

==Background and release==
Swift quipped that the song is "about when you've gotten through a really bad relationship and you finally dust yourself off and go on that first date after a horrible breakup, and the vulnerability that goes along with all that".<ref name="theboot.com">{{cite web|title=Taylor Swift 'Begin Again' Lyrics Tell Sweet Story of First Date|url=http://www.theboot.com/2012/09/25/taylor-swift-begin-again-lyrics/|work=The Boot|accessdate=September 25, 2012|date=September 25, 2012|archive-date=May 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515085358/http://www.theboot.com/2012/09/25/taylor-swift-begin-again-lyrics|url-status=live}}</ref> She previewed it on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on September 24, 2012,<ref>{{cite web|title=Taylor Swift's 'Begin Again' Previewed On 'Good Morning America' [UPDATE]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/24/taylor-swift-begin-again_n_1909027.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL|Aol, Inc]]|accessdate=September 25, 2012|date=September 24, 2012|archive-date=November 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011701/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/24/taylor-swift-begin-again_n_1909027.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and was released digitally on [[iTunes]] the next day, September 25.<ref name="digital">{{cite web|title=Begin Again - Single by Taylor Swift|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/begin-again-single/id564931599|work=[[iTunes Store]]|publisher=[[Apple, Inc.|Apple, Inc]]|accessdate=September 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927235046/http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/begin-again-single/id564931599|archivedate=September 27, 2012}}</ref> The song initially served as a [[promotional recording|promotional single]], the first of four tracks to be released during the four weeks preceding the release of her fourth studio album ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williott|first=Carl|title=Taylor Swift's 'Red' Nabs Countdown Campaign With iTunes & 'Good Morning America'|url=http://idolator.com/6927062/taylor-swift-red-countdown-itunes-good-morning-america|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|accessdate=September 25, 2012|date=September 21, 2012|archive-date=July 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702225832/http://www.idolator.com/6927062/taylor-swift-red-countdown-itunes-good-morning-america|url-status=live}}</ref> It was later announced that the song would be the second single from ''Red''.

The Boot noted that the story Swift painted was "sweet" and it's a "beautiful ballad".<ref name="theboot.com"/> Justin Proper of Under The Gun Review praised Swift for knowing "how to keep her core audience happy, and that is exactly what “Begin Again” accomplishes", also saying that the song gave him a "sensation of relief".<ref>{{cite web|last=Proper|first=Justin|title=STREAM: TAYLOR SWIFT – BEGIN AGAIN|url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2012/09/25/stream-taylor-swift-begin-again/|work=Under The Gun Review|accessdate=September 25, 2012|date=September 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607225309/http://www.underthegunreview.net/2012/09/25/stream-taylor-swift-begin-again/|archive-date=2013-06-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[MuchMusic]] lauded Swift, stating "while she is more than capable of releasing the carefree, jump-around-your-room-with-a-hairbrush break up songs like "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," she also has the pen of a poet and knows how to craft emotionally gut-wrenching songs that speak to her millions of fans."<ref>{{cite web|last=Music|first=Much|title=TAYLOR SWIFT OPENS UP IN NEW SONG BEGIN AGAIN|url=http://blog.muchmusic.com/taylor-swift-opens-up-in-new-song-begin-again/?album=6&gallery=657|work=MuchMusic Blog|accessdate=September 25, 2012|date=September 25, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E1yQ9MGQ?url=http://blog.muchmusic.com/taylor-swift-opens-up-in-new-song-begin-again/?album=6&gallery=657|archive-date=2013-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave a mixed review, giving the song a grade "B". He lamented how Swift's songs never leave the topic of boys, saying "as Swift continues to grow older, it’s becoming more troublesome that her sense of self-worth and happiness is always inextricably linked to whatever man is currently the object of her affection."<ref>{{cite web|last=John Coyne|first=Kevin|title=Single Review: Taylor Swift, "Begin Again"|url=http://www.countryuniverse.net/2012/09/28/single-review-taylor-swift-begin-again/|work=Country Universe|accessdate=September 28, 2012|date=September 28, 2012|archive-date=September 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035038/http://www.countryuniverse.net/2012/09/28/single-review-taylor-swift-begin-again/|url-status=live}}</ref> "Begin Again" was included in ''Billboard''{{'}}s list of Best songs of 2012 where it was ranked at number six.

==Music video==

===Synopsis===
The video starts with Swift standing on a bridge while pensively gazing across the water and remembering a lost love. She then takes a walk along the [[Île de la Cité]] in [[Paris]],{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} wearing a Red dress with white flower appliques and blue peep toes and sits beside the river Seine. The video draws comparison to that of singer [[Adele]]'s music video "[[Someone like You (Adele song)|Someone Like You]]" and Swift's own "[[Back to December]]" (only much happier).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474495/taylor-swift-decides-to-begin-again-in-paris-watch-new-video|title=Taylor Swift Decides To 'Begin Again' in Paris: Watch New Video |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 25, 2012 |accessdate=November 25, 2012 |first=Jason |last=Lipshutz}}</ref> She then rides a bicycle, wearing a blue and white floral skirt with white cat flats with sun glasses on and bikes down a [[Cobblestone|Cobblestone street]]. She goes shopping and tries on new clothes, which is spliced with shots of Swift singing to a man (Vladimir Perrin). In a flashback, she recalls her first meeting with the man at a café while sipping cappuccino. He starts taking snapshots of her with his [[Leica M6]]. They then have a bitter-sweet conversation, laughing and giggling at each other. The following clips shows Swift sitting at a park and sampling pastries. It also shows Swift walking by the [[Seine]]. The clip ends with the two walking side by side, as Swift allows herself to "begin again."

=== Deviation from lyrics ===
Directed by [[Philip Andelman]] and produced by Arthur Cantin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://imvdb.com/video/taylor-swift/begin-again|title=Taylor Swift - Begin Again (2012) {{!}} IMVDb|website=IMVDb|access-date=2016-10-08}}</ref> the story in the video deviates from the song's lyrical narrative in several respects. While the lyrics recount the narrator's (Swift) trepidation of a first date after a bad breakup, the video instead relates a chance meeting in a cafe in Paris.  In the video, Swift is seated at a booth, doodling in a small notebook when a Frenchman at another table takes interest and introduces himself. Missing from the video are the Swift's initial moments in the cafe, where her date has arrived early to wait for her, greets her, then helps her into her chair, displaying kindness and respect that was apparently absent from her former relationship. Late in the song, the restaurant encounter draws to a conclusion while the couple walks to Swift's car. The song lyrics describe a touching moment when Swift feels an urge to talk about her previous relationship, but before she can, her date starts describing his family's Christmas movie watching tradition. It is the pivotal moment in "Begin Again", where Swift realizes she is no longer bound to her old relationship, "And for the first time, what's past is past". In the video, instead of a clear end to the date, Swift is shown walking her bike alongside her new friend down a cobblestone road. The couple apparently is not walking to her car as described in the song lyrics, as she walks with her bike. In the video, it is clear that Swift is feeling love for her new friend, while the song lyrics leave it to the listener to decide whether Swift is finding love in her new friend, or is more generally reclaiming her ability to love through the experience of this date.

===Reception===
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' thought the video was “another classic bittersweet Swift joint,” writing: “Though her boyfriend doesn't laugh at her jokes and bores her with stories about his family’s [[Christmas]] movie-watching traditions, she finds the ultimate salve: Wandering through the streets of Paris, chuckling with handsome dudes in a café (and probably snacking on snails or something). It’s a lovely clip, but a little bit sleepy. Also, there’s something about it that recalls ’[[Back to December]]’ — is it the color palette, or just the general moodiness?”.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://idolator.com/7218672/taylor-swift-begin-again-video-review-revue | title=Taylor Swift's "Begin Again" Video: Review Revue | date=October 24, 2012 | work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] | accessdate=April 28, 2013 | first=Sam | last=Lansky | archive-date=September 2, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902004251/http://www.idolator.com/7218672/taylor-swift-begin-again-video-review-revue | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/10/24/taylor-swift-begin-again-video/ |title=Taylor Swift's 'Begin Again' video: The French connection! |journal=Entertainment Weekly |first=Kyle |last=Anderson |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |archive-date=January 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123051629/http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/10/24/taylor-swift-begin-again-video/ |url-status=live }}</ref> To date, the video has over 180 million views on [[YouTube]].
