During the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], Bill Clinton promised that his administration would "support Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel" and criticized President [[George H. W. Bush]] for having "repeatedly challenged Israel’s sovereignty over a united Jerusalem." However, after the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] in 1993, the Clinton administration did not proceed with their plans in order not to disturb the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.<ref name="Never_ending_Story">{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.769498 |title=From Bill Clinton to Trump: The Never-ending Story of the Jerusalem Embassy Move |newspaper=Haaretz Daily |date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>

In 1995, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which declared that "Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel."<ref name="Jerusalem_Embassy_Act_of_1995">Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USPL|104|45}}, November 8, 1995, 109 Stat. 398.</ref> The bill also stated that the American embassy should move to Jerusalem within five years.<ref name="Never_ending_Story" /> Backing the legislation was viewed by some as reflecting American domestic politics.

During the 2000 election campaign, [[George W.

However, once he took office, he backed down on his promise.<ref name="Never_ending_Story" />

In 2008, Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] called Jerusalem the 'capital of Israel'. On June 4, 2008, Obama told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), in his first foreign policy speech after capturing the Democratic nomination the day before, that "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided." However, he backtracked almost immediately, saying "Well, obviously, it's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/what-have-past-presidents-said-about-israel-and-jerusalem/9234736 |title=Donald Trump: What past US presidents have said about recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital |newspaper=ABC News |date=December 6, 2017}}</ref>

==Announcement==
[[File:President Trump Gives a Statement on Jerusalem, December 2017.webm|thumb|President Trump's statement on Jerusalem, December 6, 2017]]
On December 6, 2017 President Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from [[Tel Aviv]] to Jerusalem. In his statement Donald Trump did not mention [[East Jerusalem]] as the capital of a future Palestinian state, but he did say that United States recognition did not resolve the dispute over Jerusalem's borders. President Trump explicitly stated his support for maintaining the [[Status quo of Holy Land sites|status quo of the holy sites]] within the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]].<ref name=nyt271206>{{Cite news |issn=0362-4331 |last=Landler |first=Mark |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |date=December 6, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}</ref> Following the announcement, Trump signed the waiver, delaying the move by at least another six months.<ref name=tti271207>{{Cite news |title=After Jerusalem recognition, Trump signs waiver delaying embassy move |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=December 24, 2017 |date=December 7, 2017 |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-jerusalem-recognition-trump-signs-waiver-delaying-embassy-move/}}</ref>

Following Trump's announcement, American embassies in Turkey, Jordan, Germany and Britain issued security alerts for Americans traveling or living in those countries. The United States also issues a general warning for Americans abroad about the possibility of violent protests. The American consulate in Jerusalem has restricted travel of government employees to Jerusalem's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. The US Embassy in Jordan banned employees from leaving the capital and children of embassy employees were told to stay home from school.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=staff |first1=T. O.

Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] later clarified that the President's statement "did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem" and "was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide."<ref name=TillersonStatement/> State Department officials said on December 8 that there will not be any immediate practical changes in how the US deals with Jerusalem, including its policy of not listing a country on the passports of citizens born in Jerusalem.

===American domestic reactions===
====Former US ambassadors to Israel====
Out of 11 former US ambassadors to Israel, nine were critical of Trump's policy change. [[Ogden R. Reid]] who served as an ambassador to Israel from 1959 to 1961 was one of the exceptions, saying, "I think it's the right decision." [[Edward S. Walker Jr.]] who served from 1997 to 1999 also supported recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital: "It's really a question of what are the lines, the borders, to be drawn around the state of Israel and the ultimate state of Palestine." [[Daniel C. Kurtzer]] noted America's international isolation in his remarks and [[Richard H. Jones]] expressed concerns that moving the embassy would fuel further violence. A number of former ambassadors, such as [[Martin S. Indyk]] stated that they were open to recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, provided Israel would agree to slow settlement construction and recognize [[East Jerusalem]] as the Palestinian capital.<ref>{{Cite news |issn=0362-4331 |last=Chan |first=Sewell |title=Nearly Every Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Disagrees With Trump's Jerusalem Decision |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |date=December 7, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/world/middleeast/israel-jerusalem-ambassadors-state-trump.html}}</ref>

====American Christian organizations====
[[American Christian]] organizations were divided: the [[National Council of Churches]] (NCC) which represents 38 different denominations issued a statement saying the change in policy was likely to exacerbate regional conflict and cost lives, while the [[Liberty Counsel]], a right wing [[evangelical]] organization supported the decision.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cohen |first=Debra Nussbaum |title=American Christian Organizations Split in Response to Trump's Jerusalem Move |work=Haaretz |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |date=December 7, 2017 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-1.827412}}</ref> The move had been supported by many [[conservative]] American evangelical organizations and leaders including [[American Christian Leaders for Israel]], [[Jerry Falwell]], and [[Mike Huckabee]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Intense push by US evangelicals helped set stage for Trump's decision on Jerusalem – Israel News – Jerusalem Post |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Intense-push-by-US-evangelicals-helped-set-stage-for-Trumps-decision-on-Jerusalem-517293}}</ref> [[Johnnie Moore Jr.|Johnnie Moore]], one of Trump's evangelical advisers, said the announcement fulfilled a campaign promise to Trump's evangelical voter base.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Burke |first=Daniel |title=Why evangelicals are 'ecstatic' about Trump's Jerusalem move |work=CNN |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/politics/american-evangelicals-jerusalem/index.html}}</ref> It was also welcomed by Rabbi [[Yechiel Eckstein]], the founder of the [[International Fellowship of Christians and Jews]].<ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction" />

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] said recognition was "important and long overdue", while continuing to express support for a [[two state solution]]. AIPAC expressed its support for an "undivided Jerusalem" but also said that relocating the American embassy to Jerusalem would not "prejudge the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process". [[Morton Klein]], who heads the [[Zionist Organization of America]], said that Trump was "finally recognizing the obvious". The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] said Trump's announcement "will right an historic wrong".<ref name=jewishgroups>{{Cite news |title=U.S. Jewish Groups Divided in Reactions to Trump's Jerusalem Announcement |work=Haaretz |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |date=December 6, 2017 |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.827377}}</ref> The announcement was also welcomed by the [[Republican Jewish Coalition]].<ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction">{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/How-US-Jewish-groups-are-reacting-to-Trumps-recognition-of-Jerusalem-as-Israels-capital-517280 |title=How US Jewish Groups Are Reacting To Trump's Recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital |work=The Jerusalem Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/238974 |title=Jewish organizations hail Trump's Jerusalem move |work=Arutz Sheva}}</ref>

The [[Reform Jewish movement]] called it "ill-timed" and said it would "exacerbate the conflict", but also declared that "Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people and the State of Israel" and that they "share the President's belief that the US embassy should, at the right time, be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cortellessa |first1=Eric |title=Liberal US Jews blast Trump's expected Jerusalem declaration |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/liberal-us-jews-blast-trumps-expected-jerusalem-declaration/ |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |work=[[Times of Israel]] |date=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction" /> The [[Jewish Democratic Council of America]] similarly expressed support for Jerusalem as an undivided capital of Israel, but criticized Trump for neglecting to "meaningfully support peace between Palestinians and Israelis". Left-wing Mideast policy group [[J Street]] said the timing was "premature and divisive". J Street, [[New Israel Fund]], and [[Reform Zionism|progressive Zionist]] organization [[Ameinu]] expressed concerns that the move would undermine Middle East peace efforts and could lead to violence.<ref name="JP_Jewish_Org_reaction" />

====Other American groups====
In December 2017, more than 130 [[Jewish studies]] scholars from across North America criticized the Trump administration's decision, calling on the U.S. government to take actions to de-escalate the tensions and "clarify Palestinians' legitimate stake in the future of Jerusalem."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.jta.org/2017/12/10/news-opinion/united-states/over-130-jewish-studies-scholars-sign-statement-criticizing-trumps-jerusalem-decision |title=Over 130 US Jewish studies scholars criticize Trump's Jerusalem decision |agency=Jewish Telegraph Agency |date=December 10, 2017 |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> According to ''[[Haaretz]]'', many of these scholars have been critical of the Trump administration and the current Israeli government.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Maltz |first1=Judy |title=Trump's Jerusalem Backlash Continues: Over 100 Jewish Studies Scholars Issue Condemnation |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.827850 |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=December 9, 2017}}</ref>

[[American Muslim]] [[Civil and political rights|civil]] [[advocacy groups]] rejected the policy change, including the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) and the [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]] (MPAC). On December 5, Muslim, [[Interfaith]] and [[human rights group]]s held a protest outside the White House.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ghazali |first1=Abdus Sattar |title=American Muslims reject Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as capital of Israel |url=http://www.milligazette.com/news/16018-american-muslims-reject-trumps-move-to-recognize-jerusalem-as-capital-of-israel |accessdate=December 13, 2017 |work=[[The Milli Gazette]] |date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>

On December 6, shortly after Trump's statement, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said the announcement was a "historic landmark" and praised the decision as "courageous and just". During his remarks Netanyahu said there is "no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel", adding that Jerusalem has "been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years".<ref name=bbc3/> He later said that he has heard condemnation about the announcement but has "not heard any condemnation for the [[Palestinian rocket attacks|rocket]] firing against Israel that has come and the awful incitement against us".<ref name=bbc2>{{Cite news |title=US allies round on Trump over Jerusalem |work=BBC News |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |date=December 10, 2017 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42297437}}</ref>

The announcement was well received by [[Knesset]] members of left, right and centre parties including [[Yesh Atid]], [[Bayit Yehudi]], [[Yisrael Beytenu]], and [[Likud]]. [[Isaac Herzog]] called it an "act of historic justice" but also added that the next step was to "realize the vision of two states". In contrast, [[Bezalel Smotrich]] of the [[religious zionist]] Bayit Yehudi party issued the following statement: "For 30 years we have fallen into the pit of the Palestinian state as a realistic solution. The time has come to rethink things". [[Avi Gabbay]], the leader the [[Zionist Union]], also supported Trump's announcement, saying that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is more important than a peace deal.<ref name=cook>{{Cite web |title=How will US Jerusalem move affect Israel's far right? |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/jerusalem-move-affect-israel-171210122104793.html}}</ref><ref name=knesset>{{Cite web |title=Knesset Speaker: Thank you, POTUS — now, the rest of the world |work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=December 13, 2017 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Knesset-Speaker-Thank-you-POTUS-now-the-rest-of-the-world-517223}}</ref>

Israel's Deputy Education Minister [[Meir Porush]] of [[United Torah Judaism]] party said building in "parts of [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]] and Jerusalem that need housing would be better than a declaration that means nothing". [[Yisrael Eichler]], also of UTJ, expressed similar views saying he would "rather have 1,000 homes for young couples in Jerusalem than one American embassy building." In contrast, left-wing party [[Meretz]] said recognition of Jerusalem should only come with the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, adding that Trump's declaration "de facto betrays the Zionist vision and the values on which the State of Israel was established".<ref name=knesset/>

[[Hanin Zoabi]] and [[Ayman Odeh]], both members of the Arab [[Joint List]] party, said the US could no longer act as a peace mediator. Odeh said that "Trump is a pyromaniac and will set the entire region ablaze with his madness".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Labor's Gabbay welcomes Trump's Jerusalem move, urges 'trust-building' measures |accessdate=December 13, 2017 |work=Times of Israel |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/labors-gabbay-welcomes-trumps-jerusalem-move-urges-trust-building-measures/}}</ref>

===Christian churches based in Jerusalem===
On December 6, 2017, the primate of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem]], Patriarch [[Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem|Theophilos III]], widely regarded as the most senior Christian figure in Jerusalem, and twelve other church leaders in the Holy Land sent a letter to Trump warning that his move “w[ould] yield increased hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division”.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/us-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israel-capital-what-it-means What does US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital mean?] The Guardian, December 6, 2017.</ref> Apart from Theophilos III, the letter was signed by heads of Jerusalem's [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian]], [[Armenian Orthodox Church|Armenian]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopioan]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] patriarchates as well as the Roman Catholic Church's [[Apostolic Administrator]] for [[Jerusalem]] (the [[Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]).

==International response==
Trump's Jerusalem decision was widely condemned by world leaders. European US allies that objected include Britain, Germany, Italy and France. Romania, on the other hand, declined to follow the EU position and also indicated it may relocate its embassy to Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-decision-to-move-embassy-to-jerusalem-sparks-controversy-04-20-2018 |title=Romania President Slates Call to Move Embassy to Jerusalem |work=Balkan Insight |date=April 20, 2018 |access-date=2018-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/romania-begins-process-for-possible-move-of-its-embassy-to-jerusalem/ |title=Romania begins process for possible move of its embassy to Jerusalem |work=The Times of Israel |date=April 20, 2018 |access-date=2018-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-diplomacy-jerusalem/romanian-ruling-party-chief-says-plans-to-move-israel-embassy-to-jerusalem-idUSKBN1HR0UW |title=Romania govt supports moving embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, president concerned |agency=Reuters |date=April 20, 2018 |access-date=2018-05-17}}</ref>

===United Nations ===
====Pre-announcement====
Shortly before Trump's announcement, in November 2017, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted on a resolution in Jerusalem 151–6 with 9 abstentions. The resolution stated that "any actions by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem were illegal and therefore null and void.  It further stressed the need for the parties to refrain from provocative actions, especially in areas of religious and cultural sensitivity, and called for respect for the historic status quo at the holy places of Jerusalem." It was part of six resolutions on Palestine and the Middle East.<ref name="UN resolution statement">{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/ga11982.doc.htm |title='Declaring Israel's Actions in Syrian Golan, East Jerusalem 'Null and Void', General Assembly Adopts Six Resolutions on Palestine, Middle East |date=2018-11-30 |website=United Nations}}</ref>

The U.S. delegation attending the embassy dedication ceremony on 14 May 2018 included the Trump administration's officials [[Steven Mnuchin]], [[Ivanka Trump]], and [[Jared Kushner]] as well as [[Robert Jeffress]] and [[John Hagee]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/world/middleeast/robert-jeffress-embassy-jerusalem-us.html Robert Jeffress, Pastor Who Said Jews Are Going to Hell, Led Prayer at Jerusalem Embassy] The New York Times, 14 May 2018.</ref>

Congressmen from both parties praised the move; [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senate Minority Leader [[Chuck Schumer]] said the move was "long overdue".<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Davis| first = Julie Hirschfeld| title = Jerusalem Embassy Is a Victory for Trump, and a Complication for Middle East Peace| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-05-15| date = 2018-05-15| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/trump-jerusalem-embassy-middle-east-peace.html}}</ref> [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senators [[Lindsey Graham]] and [[Ted Cruz]] traveled to Jerusalem to attend the U.S. Embassy opening.<ref>"[https://www.timesofisrael.com/chuck-schumer-applauds-trump-for-opening-jerusalem-embassy/ Chuck Schumer ‘applauds’ Trump for opening Jerusalem embassy]".

Between 1844 and 2019, the United States also maintained a separate [[Consulate General of the United States, Jerusalem|consulate general]] that was later accredited to Palestinian residents in [[Jerusalem]], the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip]]. In mid-October 2018, the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] announced that the Consulate General would be merged into the new US Embassy in Jerusalem.<ref name="State Department Oct 2018">{{cite web |last1=Pompeo |first1=Mike |title=On the Merging of U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem |url=https://jru.usconsulate.gov/on-the-merging-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/ |publisher=U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem |accessdate=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211211903/https://jru.usconsulate.gov/on-the-merging-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/|archive-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> On March 4, 2019, the Consulate General was formally merged into the Embassy; ending the US practice of assigning separate diplomatic missions to Israel and the Palestinians. The Consulate-General's former Agron Street site will be revamped as the Embassy's Palestinian Affairs Unit, which will assume many of its former responsibilities but will now report to the US Embassy. Hitherto, the former Consulate-General had reported directly to the [[United States Department of State]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Palladino |first1=Robert |title=Merger of U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem |url=https://il.usembassy.gov/merger-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/ |publisher=U.S. Embassy in Israel |accessdate=4 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306042833/https://il.usembassy.gov/merger-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/|archive-date=6 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=US closes Jerusalem consulate, demoting Palestinian mission |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-closes-jerusalem-consulate-demoting-palestinian-mission/ |accessdate=March 4, 2019 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Times of Israel]] |date=March 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hansler |first1=Jennifer |title=US Consulate in Jerusalem will merge with embassy |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/03/politics/us-consulate-embassy-jerusalem/index.html |accessdate=March 4, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Keinon |first1=Herb |last2=Lazaroff |first2=Tovah |title=US Consulate for Palestinians to be merged with Embassy Monday |url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/US-consulate-for-Palestinians-to-be-merged-with-embassy-on-Monday-report-582275 |accessdate=March 4, 2019 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=March 4, 2019}}</ref>
