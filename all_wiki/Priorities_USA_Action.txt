In 2014, the organization began to focus efforts on raising funds to help Hillary Clinton in her 2016 presidential campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/politics/biggest-liberal-super-pac-to-fund-possible-clinton-bid.html?_r=0|title = Huge 'Super PAC' Is Moving Early to Back Clinton|date = January 23, 2014|accessdate = |website = New York Times|publisher = |last = Confessore|first = Nicholas| authorlink = Nicholas Confessore}}</ref> [[Jim Messina (political staffer)|Jim Messina]] and [[Jennifer Granholm]] (former [[Governor of Michigan]]) were drafted to serve as co-chairs of the organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/01/24/jennifer-granholms-role-in-presidential-politics-grows/|title=Jennifer Granholm's Role In Presidential Politics Grows|first=Carol|last=Cain|publisher=}}</ref> Granholm resigned in August 2015 to join [[Correct the Record]], another pro-Clinton super PAC.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth|title=Granholm resigns from pro-Clinton super PAC|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/jennifer-granholm-resigns-from-pro-clinton-super-pac-121366|accessdate=23 September 2016|publisher=Politico|date=August 14, 2015}}</ref>

The group was headed by [[David Brock]] from 2014 until his resignation in February 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth|title=David Brock resigns from Hillary Clinton PAC|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/david-brock-resigns-priorities-usa-action-115028.html|accessdate=February 10, 2015|publisher=Politico|date=February 9, 2015}}</ref>

In 2020, after remaining neutral in the highly contested [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], Priorities USA endorsed [[Joe Biden]] after his apparent delegate lead from the Super Tuesday primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.npr.org/liveblogs/20200310-primaries/share/guy-cecil-71.html|title=Major Democratic SuperPAC Gets Behind Biden|last=|first=|date=|website=apps.npr.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
On August 7, 2012 Priorities USA Action put out an ad titled ''Understands'', which "offers one man's story to suggest the investment practices of [[Mitt Romney|Romney]] and [[Bain Capital]] led to the early death of his wife".<ref name=politifact>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/09/priorities-usa-action/pro-obama-group-blames-romney-womans-death/|title=None|publisher=}}</ref>  The man, Joe Soptic, explains that after the GST Steel plant was shut down, he lost his job and health insurance for him and his family which led to his wife's death from cancer. [[Politifact]] rated the claim made in the ad false, noting that the ad "uses innuendo for a serious allegation, but there's no proof directly linking the death to Bain".<ref name=politifact /> [[Factcheck.org]] found the ad to be "misleading on several accounts", including that Soptic's wife died "five years after the plant closed".<ref name=factcheck>{{cite web|url=http://factcheck.org/2012/08/is-romney-to-blame-for-cancer-death/|title=Is Romney to Blame for Cancer Death?|publisher=}}</ref>  Factcheck.org also points out that, when the plant closed, she had her own employer-sponsored coverage which she lost two years later and, furthermore, that Romney was running the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] when the plant closed.<ref name=factcheck />
