{{Politics of Philippines}}
The '''Senate of the Philippines''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Senado ng Pilipinas'', also ''Mataas na Kapulungan ng Pilipinas'' or "upper chamber") is the [[upper house]] of [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]], the bicameral [[legislature]] of the [[Philippines]]; the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] is the [[lower house]]. The Senate is composed of 24 [[senator]]s who are [[Philippine senatorial elections|elected]] [[at-large]] with the country as one district under [[plurality-at-large voting]].

Senators serve six-year terms with a maximum of two consecutive terms, with half of the senators elected every three years to ensure that the Senate is maintained as a continuous body, though [[staggered elections|staggered]]. When the Senate was restored by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]], the 24 senators who were elected in 1987 served until 1992. In 1992 the 12 candidates for the Senate obtaining the highest number of votes served until 1998, while the next 12 served until 1995. Thereafter, each senator elected serves the full six years.

Aside from having its concurrence on every bill in order to be passed for the [[President of the Philippines|president]]'s signature to become a law, the Senate is the only body that can concur with [[treaty|treaties]], and can try [[Impeachment in the Philippines|impeachment]] cases. The Senate Presidency is currently held by [[Tito Sotto]].

== History ==
[[File:Joint session of Philippine Legislature.jpg|thumbnail|left|Joint session of Philippine Legislature including the newly elected Senate, November 15, 1916]]
[[Image:Sen. Primcias debates Sen. Paredes.jpg|thumb|left|The post–World War II Philippine Senate in 1951: [[Cipriano P. Primicias, Sr.]], far left, debates [[Quintín Paredes]], far right. In the middle are Justiniano Montano, [[Mariano Jesús Cuenco]], Enrique B. Magalona, and Francisco Delgado; in the foreground is Edmundo Cea. Deliberations were once held at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]].]]

The Senate has its roots in the [[Philippine Commission]] of the [[Insular Government]].  Under the [[Philippine Organic Act]], from 1907 to 1916, the [[Philippine Commission]] headed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] served as the upper chamber of the [[Philippine Legislature]], with the [[Philippine Assembly]] as the elected [[lower house]].  At the same time the governor-general also exercised executive powers.

In August 1916 the [[United States Congress]] enacted the [[Philippine Autonomy Act]] or popularly known as the "Jones Law", which created an elected bicameral [[Philippine Legislature]] with the Senate as the [[upper chamber]] and with the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], previously called the Philippine Assembly, as the [[lower chamber]]. The Governor-General continued to be the head of the [[executive branch]] of the Insular Government.  Senators then were elected via [[Senatorial districts of the Philippines|senatorial districts]] via [[plurality-at-large voting]]; each district grouped several provinces and each elected two senators except for "non-Christian" provinces where the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] appointed the senators for the district.

Future president [[Manuel L. Quezon]], who was then [[Philippine Resident Commissioner]], encouraged future president [[Sergio Osmeña]], then [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House, to run for the leadership of the Senate, but Osmeña preferred to continue leading the lower house. Quezon then ran for the Senate and became [[Senate President]] serving for 19 years (1916–1935).

This setup continued until 1935, when the [[Philippine Independence Act]] or the "Tydings–McDuffie Act" was passed by the [[U.S. Congress]] which granted the Filipinos the right to frame their own constitution in preparation for their independence, wherein they established a unicameral [[National Assembly of the Philippines]], effectively abolishing the Senate. Not long after the adoption of the 1935 Constitution several amendments began to be proposed. By 1938, the National Assembly began consideration of these proposals, which included restoring the Senate as the upper chamber of Congress. The amendment of the 1935 Constitution to have a bicameral legislature was approved in 1940 and the [[1941 Philippine Senate election|first biennial elections]] for the restored upper house was held in November 1941. Instead of the old senatorial districts, senators were elected via the entire country serving as an [[at-large]] district, although still under plurality-at-large voting, with voters voting up to eight candidates, and the eight candidates with the highest number of votes being elected. While the Senate from 1916 to 1935 had exclusive confirmation rights over executive appointments, as part of the compromises that restored the Senate in 1941, the power of confirming executive appointments has been exercised by a joint [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]] composed of members of both houses. However, the Senate since its restoration and the independence of the Philippines in 1946 has the power to ratify treaties.

The Senate finally convened in 1945 and served as the upper chamber of Congress from thereon until the declaration of [[martial law]] by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in 1972, which shut down Congress. The Senate was resurrected in 1987 upon the ratification of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]]. However, instead of eight senators being replaced after every election, it was changed to twelve.

In the Senate, the officers are the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]], [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President ''pro tempore'']], [[Majority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Majority Floor Leader]], [[Minority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Minority Floor Leader]] and the Senate Secretary and the Senate Sergeant at Arms who shall be elected by the Senators from among the employees and staff of the Senate. Meanwhile, the Senate President, Senate President pro-tempore, the Majority Floor Leader and the Minority Floor Leader shall be elected by the Senators from among themselves.

==Composition==
{{see also|Philippine senatorial elections}}
[[File:Philippine Senate composition.png|thumb|left|200px|Election results from 1916 to the present. Note that some senators may switch to another party mid-term.]]
Article VI, Section 2 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] provides that the Senate shall be composed of 24 senators who shall be elected at-large by the qualified voters of the [[Philippines]], as may be provided by law.

The composition of the Senate is smaller in number as compared to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]. The members of this chamber are elected at large by the entire electorate. The rationale for this rule intends to make the Senate a training ground for national leaders and possibly a springboard for the [[President of the Philippines|presidency]].

It follows also that the Senator, having a national rather than only a district constituency, will have a broader outlook of the problems of the country, instead of being restricted by narrow viewpoints and interests. With such perspective, the Senate is likely to be more circumspect, or at least less impulsive, than the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].

Senatorial candidates are chosen by the leaders of major political parties or coalitions of parties.  The selection process is not transparent and is done in "backrooms" where much political horse-trading occurs.  Thus, the absence of regional or proportional representation in the Senate exacerbates a top heavy system of governance, with power centralized in Metro Manila.  It has often been suggested that each region of the country should elect its own senator(s) to more properly represent the people.  This will have the effect of flattening the power structure.  Regional problems and concerns within a national view can be addressed more effectively.  A senator's performance, accountability, and electability become meaningful to a more defined and identifiable regional constituency.

The [[Senate Electoral Tribunal]] (SET) composed of three [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] justices and six senators determines election protests on already-seated senators. There had been three instances where the SET has replaced senators due to election protests, the last of which was in 2011 when the tribunal [[Pimentel III vs. Zubiri Senate Electoral Protest|awarded the protest]] of [[Koko Pimentel]] against [[Juan Miguel Zubiri]].<ref name="proclamation">{{cite news|last=Calonzo |first=Andero |title=Pimentel proclaimed 12th winning senator in '07 polls |work=GMA News Online |date=August 11, 2011 |access-date=August 11, 2011 |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/229132/nation/pimentel-proclaimed-12th-winning-senator-in-07-polls}}</ref>

==Qualifications==
The qualifications for membership in the Senate are expressly stated in Section 3, Art. VI of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] as follows:

*No person shall be a Senator unless he is a natural-born citizen of the [[Philippines]], and on the day of the election, is at least 35 years of age, able to read and write, a registered voter, and a resident of the [[Philippines]] for not less than two years immediately preceding the day of the election.
*The age is fixed at 35 and must be possessed on the day of the elections, that is, when the polls are opened and the votes cast, and not on the day of the proclamation of the winners by the board of canvassers.
*With regard to the residence requirements, it was ruled in the case of ''Lim v. Pelaez'' that it must be the place where one habitually resides and to which he, after absence, has the intention of returning.
*The enumeration laid down by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] is exclusive under the Latin principle of ''[[expressio unius est exclusio alterius]]''. This means that [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] cannot anymore add additional qualifications other than those provided by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]].

==Organization==
Under the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], "[[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] shall convene once every year on the fourth Monday of July for its regular session...". During this time, the Senate is organized to elect its officers. Specifically, the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] provides a definite statement, to it:

The Senate shall elect its [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] its [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]] by a vote of all its respective members.

Each House shall choose such other officers as it may deem necessary.

By virtue of these provisions of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]], the Senate adopts its own rules, otherwise known as the "Rules of the Senate." The Rules of the Senate provide the following officers: a [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President]], a [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|President ''pro tempore'']], a Secretary and a Sergeant-at-Arms.

Following this set of officers, the Senate as an institution can then be grouped into the Senate Proper and the Secretariat. The former belongs exclusively to the members of the Senate as well as its committees, while the latter renders support services to the members of the Senate.

==Powers==
The Senate was modeled upon the [[United States Senate]]; the two chambers of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the Senate, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the Senate on [[third reading]], the bill is passed to the House of Representatives, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the lower house is different from the one passed by the Senate, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.

While [[money bill]]s originate in the House of Representatives, the Senate may still propose or concur with amendments. Only the Senate has the power to approve, via a two-thirds supermajority, or denounce treaties, and the power to try and convict, via a two-thirds supermajority, an impeached official.

==Seat==
[[File:Facade of the Senate of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|The GSIS Building in [[Pasay]], the seat of the Senate.]]
 
The Senate currently meets at the [[GSIS Building]] along Sen. J.W. Diokno Boulevard in [[Pasay]]. Built on land reclaimed from [[Manila Bay]], the Senate shares the complex with the [[Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS).

The Senate previously met at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Legislative Building]] in [[Manila]] until May 1997. The Senate occupied the upper floors (the Session Hall now restored to its semi-former glory) while the House of Representatives occupied the lower floors (now occupied by the permanent exhibit of [[Juan Luna]]'s [[Spoliarium]] as the museum's centerpiece), with the [[National Library of the Philippines|National Library]] at the basement. When the Legislative Building was ruined in World War II, the House of Representatives temporarily met at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse at Lepanto<ref>{{cite book|title=Quezon Memorial Book|date=1952|publisher=Quezon Memorial Committee}}</ref> (modern-day S. H. Loyola) Street, while the Senate's temporary headquarters was at the half-ruined [[Manila City Hall]].<ref>Towards the south side, opposite the base of the famous clocktower. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/johntewell/20260722109/] & [https://www.flickr.com/photos/johntewell/12627824664/]</ref> Congress then returned to the Legislative Building in 1950 upon its reconstruction. When President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dissolved Congress in 1972, he built a new legislative complex in [[Quezon City]]. The unicameral parliament known as the [[Batasang Pambansa]] eventually met there in 1978. With the restoration of the bicameral legislature in 1987, the House of Representatives inherited the complex at Quezon City, now called the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], while the Senate returned to the Congress Building, until the GSIS Building was finished in 1997. Thus, the country's two houses of Congress meet at different places in [[Metro Manila]].

The Senate would eventually move to Navy Village in [[Taguig]] by July 2022. As the Senate is renting GSIS for the office space, it asked the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA) to present suitable sites for it to move to, with the Senate eyeing the Navy Village property along [[Lawton Avenue]] as its favored site.<ref>{{cite news|title=Senate to move to Bonifacio Global City in Taguig by 2020 - The Manila Times Online|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/senate-move-bonifacio-global-city-taguig-2020/308688/|access-date=29 January 2017|work=www.manilatimes.net|date=2017-01-25}}</ref> In 2018, a building designed by [[AECOM]] was chosen as winner for the new home for the Senate and is expected to be built by 2022. Civil works to erect the building had been awarded to Hilmarcs Construction Corporation, the same company the Senate investigated for alleged overpriced construction of the [[Makati City|Makati City Hall]] Parking Building II in 2015.<ref> https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1097256/controversial-contractor-to-build-new-senate-home</ref> The design was immediately criticized by Filipino netizens comparing it to a [[waste container|garbage can]]. English political critic [[Paul Joseph Watson]] also said the same thing about the design.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lacson defends construction of new Senate Building in Bonifacio|access-date=August 22, 2019|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/03/22/lacson-defends-construction-of-new-senate-building-in-fort-bonifacio/}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lB5QbMxvac Paul Joseph Watson – ''Latest Atrocities in Modern Architecture''].
