'''Cass Technical High School''' (simply referred to as '''Cass Tech''') is a [[State school|public]] [[Secondary school|high school]] in [[Midtown Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States.<ref name="midloc">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100221012724/http://www.detroitmidtown.com/05/develop.php?msub=5 Midtown location] from the University Cultural Center Association, retrieved June 9, 1001</ref> It was established in 1907 and is part of the [[Detroit Public Schools Community District]]. It is named after [[Lewis Cass]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Whitmer strips name of slave owner Lewis Cass from state office building|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/06/30/lewis-cass-building-lansing-whitmer/3284577001/|access-date=2020-07-10|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en}}</ref>

Until 1977, Cass was Detroit's only [[magnet school]] and the only non-neighborhood enrollment school in Detroit. Today, Cass is one of few magnet schools in Detroit. Entrance to Cass is based on test scores and [[middle school]] grades. Students are required to choose a curriculum path—roughly equivalent to a college "[[Academic major|major]]" —in the ninth grade. Areas of study include, but are not limited to, arts and communication, business management and marketing, engineering and manufacturing, [[human services]], and science and arts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://casstech.schools.detroitk12.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cass-Tech-School-Profile-2014_2015_.REVISED_10-09-2014.pdf |title=Lewis Cass Technical High School }}</ref>

The school was founded on the third floor of the old Cass Union School in 1907. Its historic landmark building on Second Avenue in downtown [[Detroit]] was built in 1917.<ref>{{cite web |author=DAN AUSTIN of HistoricDetroit.org |url=http://historicdetroit.org/building/cass-tech-high-school-old/ |title=– Old Cass Technical High School |publisher=Historicdetroit.org |accessdate=2013-12-26}}</ref> To the south of it an addition was built in 1985.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The new, modern facilities of the school were built in 2004 in an adjacent lot to the north of the original building on Grand River Avenue.

In 2007 there was a large fire in the old structure. Complete demolition of the vacant Cass Tech building began in June 2011 and was finished by November. Pictures of the old historic structures, both from the outside and the abandoned inside floors and classes, can be seen here [http://detroiturbex.com/content/schools/cass/current/index.html]. In addition, a 3D floor-by-floor interactive map of the old building is available here [http://detroiturbex.com/content/schools/cass/architecture/] as well.

Following the fire in the old structure, it was demolished and removed by Homrich Demolition.<ref>Images and information on the demolition of the structure can be found in [http://www.homrichinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cass-Tech-High-School-Detroit-MI1.pdf the Homrich Demolition project file.]</ref> At time of demolition, the school building was approximately {{convert|830000|sqft|m2}} and weighed more than {{convert|100000|ST|MT}}. Over 90% of the material in the building was recycled for other uses or as backfill.

In 2008 some classes that were not very popular with students were removed due to reduction in teacher staffing due to declining enrollment.<ref>Brand-Williams, Orlandar.
