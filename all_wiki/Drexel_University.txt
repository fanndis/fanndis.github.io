{{Main|History of Drexel University}}

Drexel University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry, by Philadelphia financier and philanthropist [[Anthony J. Drexel]]. The original mission of the institution was to provide educational opportunities in the "practical arts and sciences" for women and men of all backgrounds. The institution became known as the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936, and in 1970 the Drexel Institute of Technology gained university status, becoming Drexel University.

Although there were many changes during its first century, the university's identity has been held constant as a privately controlled, non-sectarian, coeducational center of higher learning, distinguished by a commitment to practical education and hands-on experience in an occupational setting. The central aspect of Drexel University's focus on career preparation, in the form of its cooperative education program, was introduced in 1919. The program became integral to the university's unique educational experience. Participating students alternate periods of classroom-based study with periods of full-time, [[Internship|practical work experience]] related to their academic major and career interests.

Between 1995 and 2009, Drexel University underwent a period of significant change to its programs, enrollment, and facilities under the leadership of Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]], the university's president during that time. Papadakis oversaw Drexel's largest expansion in its history, with a 471 percent increase in its endowment and a 102 percent increase in student enrollment. His leadership also guided the university toward improved performance in collegiate rankings, a more selective approach to admissions, and a more rigorous academic program at all levels. It was during this period of expansion that Drexel acquired and assumed management of the former MCP Hahnemann University, creating the [[Drexel University College of Medicine]] in 2002. In 2006, the university established the [[Thomas R. Kline School of Law]], and in 2011 the School of Law achieved full accreditation by the [[American Bar Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/about/ABA_accreditation/ |title=Drexel University Earle Mack School of Law ABA Accreditation |access-date=December 2, 2011}}</ref>

Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]] died of pneumonia in April 2009 while still employed as the university's president. His successor, [[John Anderson Fry]], was formerly the president of [[Franklin & Marshall College]] and served as the Executive Vice President of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name="fry" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/past-presidents/john-fry |title=Past Presidents: John Fry |access-date=December 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112093452/http://www.fandm.edu/past-presidents/john-fry |archive-date=January 12, 2012  }}</ref> Under Fry's leadership, Drexel has continued its expansion, including the July 2011 acquisition of [[The Academy of Natural Sciences]].

===Housing===
[[File:North Hall.JPG|thumb|left|North Hall by architect [[Michael Graves]]]]

Drexel requires all non-commuting first- and second-year students to live in one of its ten residence halls or in "university approved housing".<ref>{{cite web 
| url = http://www.drexel.edu/dbs/universityHousing/assignment-policies/2YrsResReq/
| title = Drexel University Housing Policies
}}</ref> First year students must live in one of the residence halls designated specifically for first-years. These residence halls include Millennium, Bentley, Kelly, Myers, Towers, Van Rensselaer, North, and Race Halls. Kelly, Myers, Towers, and Bentley Halls are traditional residence halls (a bedroom shared with one or more roommate(s) and one bathroom per floor), while Race, North, Caneris, and Van Rensselaer Halls are suite-style residence halls (shared bedrooms, private bathrooms, kitchens, and common area within the suite). Millennium Hall, Drexel's newest residence hall, is a modified suite (a bedroom shared with one roommate, and bathrooms and showers that look like closets with open sinks in the hallway).

Each residence hall is designed to facilitate the Freshman Experience in a slightly different way. Millennium, Kelly, and Towers Halls are all typical residence halls. Myers Hall offers "Living Learning Communities" where a group of students who share common interests such as language or major live together. Most of Bentley Hall is reserved for students of the [[Pennoni Honors College]], although some floors are occupied by other students.

Second-year students have the option of living in a residence hall designated for upperclassmen, or "university approved housing". The residence halls for upperclassmen are North and Caneris Halls. North Hall operates under the For Students By Students Residential Experience Engagement Model, developed by the Residential Living Office. There are many apartments that are university approved that second-year students can choose to live in. Three of the largest apartment buildings that fit this description are Chestnut Square, University Crossings, and The Summit, all owned by [[American Campus Communities]]. Many other students live in smaller apartment buildings or individual townhouse-style apartments in [[Powelton Village, Philadelphia|Powelton Village]]. A second-year student can choose one of the already listed university approved housing options or petition the university to add a new property to the approved list.<ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref> While living in a university approved apartment offers the freedom of living outside a residence hall, due to the Drexel co-op system, many students end up in the residence halls because they operate on a quarter to quarter basis, and don't require students to be locked into leases.

Graduate students can live in Stiles Hall.

All residence halls except Caneris Hall and Stiles Memorial Hall are located north of Arch Street between 34th Street and 32nd Street in the [[Powelton Village, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Powelton Village]] area.

Drexel's school mascot is a [[dragon]] known, as "Mario the Magnificent", named in honor of alumnus and Board of Trustees member Mario V.

Before becoming known as the Dragons, the athletic teams had been known by such names as the Blue & Gold, the Engineers, and the Drexelites.<ref name="dragon" /> The school's sports teams, now known as the [[Drexel Dragons]], participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I as a member of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/drexel-university-3256|title=Drexel University|date=2015|website=www.usnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316182605/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/drexel-university-3256|archive-date=March 16, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> They do not currently field a varsity football team.<ref>Fry, John [https://www.wsj.com/articles/were-glad-we-say-no-to-college-football-1451855999 We're Glad We Say No to College Football] ''Wall Street Journal''.

In addition to its NCAA Division I teams, Drexel University is home to 33 active club teams including men's ice hockey, lacrosse, water polo, squash, triathlon, and cycling. Other club teams include soccer, baseball, rugby, field hockey, and roller hockey. The club teams operate under the direction of the Club Sports Council and the Recreational Sports Office.

==Student lore and traditions==
Tradition suggests that rubbing the toe of the [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] "Waterboy" [[statue]], located in the Main Building atrium, can result in receiving good grades on exams. Although the rest of the bronze statue has developed a dark brown [[patina]] over the years, the toe has remained highly polished and shines like new.<ref name="dragon" />

[[John Langdon (typographer)|John Langdon]], who taught typography in the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design from 1988 to 2015, created the [[ambigram]] featured on the cover of Dan Brown's Angels & Demons; a number of other ambigrams served as the central focus of the book and its corresponding film.
