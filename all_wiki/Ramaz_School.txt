The '''Ramaz School''' is a [[coeducational]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] Day School, which offers a dual curriculum of general studies taught in [[English language|English]] and [[Judaic studies]] taught in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The school is located on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ramaz.org/public/mission_s.cfm|title=Ramaz Mission and Legacy|archivedate=March 17, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317152904/http://ramaz.org/public/mission_s.cfm|url-status=dead}}</ref> It consists of an early childhood center (nursery-kindergarten), a lower school (1st-4th grade), a middle school (5th-8th grade), and an upper school (9th-12th grade).

The Ramaz Upper School is a [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory program]], designed to develop an appreciation for and understanding of the intellectual disciplines that are part of western civilization. The Judaic studies curriculum provides an equally rigorous program through which the religious and cultural tradition of Judaism is both taught and experienced. It is located on East 78th Street, seven city blocks (0.5&nbsp;km) away from the other two school buildings, located on East 85th Street. Approximately fifty percent of the Upper School student body advances from the Middle School, as well as daily commuters from the Bronx, [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] counties in [[New York (state)|New York]]; [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] in [[Connecticut]]; from all over metropolitan [[New Jersey]]; and on a weekly or longer basis from more distant communities.

Ramaz was founded in 1937 and is affiliated with [[Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun]] ("KJ"), a [[synagogue]] located on East 85th Street, which shares a building with the lower school and is across the street from the middle school.  The congregation and its rabbi, [[Joseph Lookstein]], helped to found and finance the school.

Architect [[James Rossant]] designed the modernist Upper School building, completed in 1981.<ref>Goldberger, Paul.

Founded in 1937 by Rabbi [[Joseph Lookstein|Joseph H. Lookstein]] through the generosity of New York lawyer and philanthropist Max J. Etra,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ramaz.org/public/mission2.cfm|title=Mission & Legacy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925170145/http://www.ramaz.org/public/mission2.cfm|archivedate=September 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ramaz takes its name from the initials of Rabbi [[Moses S.

Classes were held in many locations over the years, including the vestry rooms of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun. After the closing of [[Finch College]], Ramaz bought the college's campus and renovated the buildings.<ref>Goldberger, Paul.

In 2007, Joyce Villarin, a former nurse at the school, treated a child for an injury that he claimed his father caused. Villarin contacted the father who admitted to injuring his son. The Ramaz administration told Villarin not to report the incident to the police. Villarin did report this and was fired in 2008 because the school thought that she was "not a team player." Villarin sued the school in Manhattan Supreme Court in 2009, arguing that the state's Social Services Law obligated her to report the potential abuse. Under the law, school faculty are required to report to state authorities a suspicion that a child is being abused or mistreated.<ref>Marcy Oster, [http://www.jta.org/2012/04/15/news-opinion/united-states/ex-ramaz-school-nurse-can-sue-under-whistleblower-law#ixzz3O74cNBUf Ex-Ramaz school nurse can sue under whistleblower law] April 15, 2012.

On November 30, 2007, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' listed Ramaz as one of the top schools for graduates entering the top eight universities in the country, with 10 out of a class of 100 (class of 2007) going to these schools.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-COLLEGE0711-sort.html|title=How the Schools Stack Up|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 28, 2007}}</ref>

In January 2009, the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported that Ramaz lost $6 million in the collapse of the [[Bernard Madoff]] investment scheme.<ref>Mary Pilon, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123301904801417967 Private Schools Feel the Pinch Amid Recession], ''Wall Street Journal'', January 26, 2009.</ref><ref>Stephanie Strom, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/business/16charity.html?_r=1&hp Wall St. Fraud Leaves Charities Reeling], ''The New York Times'', December 15, 2008.</ref>

The Ramaz School had proposed a 28-story project to be built in place of the Lower School during 2008–2010. The building would have replaced the current school with a new building split into ten floors used by the school and topped by 18 floors of condominiums. Air rights of the adjoining synagogue would be transferred for use by the adjoining school/condo structure. The project may have had to be scaled back following a review by the City's Board of Standards & Appeals because the height is more than what is permitted at this site.<ref>Beyer, Gregory.

Since the building was not ready to welcome students that September, the [[Temple Emanu-El of New York]] and [[Park Avenue Synagogue]] volunteered their facilities for students until November 2011. On November 8, 2011, the Lower school reopened its doors.<ref>[http://ramazschool.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/lower-school-building-reopening-after-kj-fire/ "Lower School Building Reopening After KJ Fire"], ''News from Ramaz'', November 4, 2011.
