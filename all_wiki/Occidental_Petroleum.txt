==Controversies==
===Lobbying to do business in Libya===
The company began operations in [[Libya]] in 1965 and operated there until [[economic sanctions]] were imposed in 1986 by the United States.<ref name=libya/> The company was one of the first American companies to resume negotiations in Libya after the sanctions were lifted in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gelsi |first=Steve |date=November 26, 2007 |title=Occidental Petroleum wins major oil deal with Libya |work=[[MarketWatch]] |url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/occidental-petroleum-wins-major-oil-deal-with-libya}}</ref> In 2008, the company, along with 5 other oil companies, was criticized for hiring [[Hogan Lovells]] to lobby to exempt Libya from a law written by U.S. Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-NJ) to assist American terror victims in seizing assets of countries found culpable in terror attacks, such as the Libyan bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie]] in 1988.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Calabresi |first=Massimo |date=June 14, 2011 |title=Gaddafi's Corporate Quislings |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=https://swampland.time.com/2011/06/14/gaddafis-corporate-quislings/}}</ref> and to remove a provision in the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] that requires disclosure of payments to foreign governments.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wang |first=Marian |date=March 24, 2011 |title=Oil Companies That Gave 'Bonuses' to Libya Also Lobbied Against Disclosure Rules |work=[[ProPublica]] |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/oil-companies-that-gave-bonuses-to-libya-als-lobbied-against-disclosure-ru}}</ref> In early 2011, the company ceased exploration activities and production operations in Libya due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and United Kingdom prosecutors requested information from the company, [[ExxonMobil]] and [[ConocoPhillips]] related to the [[Libyan Investment Authority]] (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], to determine if there were any violations of international bribery laws.<ref name="Ruffel">{{Cite web |last=Ruffel |first=Benjamin |date=July 1, 2011 |title=Internal Report Shows Even Before War, Libya's SWF Was in Chaos |url=https://www.ai-cio.com/news/internal-report-shows-even-before-war-libyas-swf-was-in-chaos/ |website=[[Chief Investment Officer Magazine]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Vasan |first=Paula |date=June 29, 2011 |title=UK Prosecutors Team Up With SEC to Investigate Bribery Among SWFs |work=[[Chief Investment Officer Magazine]] |url=https://www.ai-cio.com/news/uk-prosecutors-team-up-with-sec-to-investigate-bribery-among-swfs/}}</ref> The Libyan Investment Authority's investments were frozen by the U.S. government in early 2011 following the Gaddafi regime's attacks on Libyan civilians.<ref name="Ruffel" /> In 2016, the company ceased operations in Libya.

===Environmental record===
In 2017, the company was ranked 55th on the Carbon Majors Report, a list of the Top 100 producers and their cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from 1988-2015.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Riley |first=Tess |date=July 10, 2017 |title=Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change}}</ref>

====Cleanup of the Copper Basin====
In 1982, the company acquired land in the Copper Basin in [[Tennessee]], formerly the site of the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], where copper and sulfur had been mined in the 1800s. In 2016, Occidental agreed to spend $50 million to clean up the Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cobb |first=David |date=May 10, 2016 |title=Once barren Copper Basin reaches major milestone in restoration effort [photos] |work=[[Times Free Press]] |url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2016/may/10/remarkable-reclamation-copbasrestoratieffort/364657/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release |title=Department of Justice and EPA Announce $50 Million Settlement to Clean Up Contamination at Eastern Tennessee Superfund Site |date=April 22, 2016 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-and-epa-announce-50-million-settlement-clean-contamination-eastern}}</ref>

====Love Canal====
{{Further|Love Canal}}
[[File:Abandoned parking lot in Love Canal.jpg|thumb|An abandoned parking lot near [[Love Canal]]]]

Since the 1920s, several companies and the [[United States Armed Forces]] used the [[Love Canal]] as a chemical disposal site. In 1942, [[Hooker Chemical Company]] began disposing chemical waste at the site and, in 1947, it became the sole owner and user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. The company leased the land to the school board in 1953. Later in the 1950s, the local school board requested that the company sell the land, and threatened to use [[eminent domain]]. The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Superfund Site: LOVE CANAL, NIAGARA FALLS, NY |url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0201290 |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]}}</ref>

A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built on land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the region, including high rates of cancer and [[birth defect]]s. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president [[Jimmy Carter]] declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and the company paid $129 million in restitution.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Occidental to pay $129 Million in Love Canal Settlement |date=December 21, 1995 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/Pre_96/December95/638.txt.html}}</ref><ref name=love/>

====Oleum spill====
On Saturday, October 11, 2008, an accidental spill of [[oleum]], a chemical mixture of [[sulfuric acid]] and [[sulfur trioxide]], occurred at a facility in [[Petrolia, Pennsylvania]] belonging to Indspec, an affiliate of Occidental Chemical Corporation. The accident caused contamination of the ventilation system and a cloud of toxic gas in the sky and forced the evacuation of over 2,000 residents of the area for the day.<ref>{{Cite news |last=HOPEY |first=DON |date=October 13, 2008 |title=Chemical cloud brings tense hours |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url=https://www.post-gazette.com/local/neighborhoods/2008/10/13/Chemical-cloud-brings-tense-hours/stories/200810130131}}</ref> The spill was determined to be caused by the use of an auxiliary pump [[power supply]] that lacked safety interlocks to prevent tank overfilling.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=CSB Issues Final Report on Oleum Release from INDSPEC Chemical Corp. that Forced Thousands to Evacuate in October 2008; Report Cites Use of Pump Power Supply that Lacked Safeguards |date=October 5, 2009 |publisher=[[U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]] |url=https://www.csb.gov/csb-issues-final-report-on-oleum-release-from-indspec-chemical-corp-that-forced-thousands-to-evacuate-in-october-2008-report-cites-use-of-pump-power-supply-that-lacked-safeguards/}}</ref><ref name=love/>

====Colombia====
From 1992 to 2001, the company tried to drill for oil in the territory of the [[U'wa people]], in northeast [[Colombia]]. The locals resisted, concerned about [[environmental degradation]] and fears that development would bring strangers and be a target for [[guerrilla warfare]].

====Caño Limón====
{{further|Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline}}
On December 13, 1998, 17 civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the [[Colombian Air Force]] (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after [[AirScan]], Occidental's security contractor, misidentified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as [[FARC]] and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón. In April 2003, Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident, sued Occidental.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Occidental Petroleum Faces Lawsuit for Its Role in Massacre in Colombia Plaintiff Questions CEO at the Company's Annual Meeting |date=April 25, 2003 |publisher=[[Amazon Watch]] |url=http://amazonwatch.org/news/2003/0425-occidental-petroleum-faces-lawsuit-for}}</ref> The courts ruled that Occidental was not liable for the incident.<ref>{{Cite news |last=REYNOLDS |first=MATT |date=November 13, 2014 |title=Occidental Averts Suit for Colombia Massacre |work=[[Courthouse News Service]] |url=https://www.courthousenews.com/occidental-averts-suit-for-colombia-massacre/}}</ref><ref>{{cite court | litigants=Mujica v.

====Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum====
On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 [[Achuar]] [[Peruvians]], a group of [[Indigenous peoples]], filed suit against the company, demanding [[environmental remediation]] and [[Reparation (legal)|reparations]] for [[environmental degradation]] allegedly caused by the company between 1971 and 2000, when it drilled in Block 1-AB in Peru. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated [[technical standard]]s and [[environmental law]] when it dumped a total of {{convert|9|Goilbbl}} of toxic oil [[by-product]]s, such as cadmium, lead, and [[arsenic]], in [[drainage basin]]s used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and [[birth defect]]s. A 2006 study by the [[Ministry of Health (Peru)|Ministry of Health of Peru]], found that all but 2 of the 199 people tested had levels of [[cadmium]] in their blood above safe levels.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Collyns |first=Dan |date=March 5, 2015 |title=Indigenous Peruvians win Amazon pollution payout from US oil giant |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/indigenous-peruvians-amazon-pollution-settlement-us-oil-occidental}}</ref>
