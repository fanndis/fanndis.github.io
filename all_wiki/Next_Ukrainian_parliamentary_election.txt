==Electoral system==
According to Art. 76 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] the term of office of Ukraine's parliament is five years.<ref name="chesno.org/post/3402"/> Hence the powers of the [[9th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada]] will formally expire in September 2024. So, the fifth, final year of the parliaments's powers will begin in September 2023.<ref name="chesno.org/post/3402"/> According to Art. 77 of the Constitution, regular elections to the Verkhovna Rada take place on the last Sunday of October of the fifth year of parliamentary powers.<ref name="chesno.org/post/3402"/> Thus, the next parliamentary elections are due to take place on 29 October 2023.<ref name="chesno.org/post/3402">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.chesno.org/post/3402/ Early to rejoice?

On 1 January 2020, the latest revision of the electoral code of Ukraine took effect.<ref name="633561ElectoralCode"/> It states that all deputies are elected on a party list in one nationwide constituency with a 5% [[election threshold]] with [[Open list|open]] regional lists of candidates for deputies.<ref name="633561ElectoralCode"/> The new election law abolish the single-member constituencies system used in the [[2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2019 parliamentary election]].{{efn|Previous electoral reform passed in July 2019 also made all 450 members only elected by [[open list]] proportional representation; but it would not come into force until 1 December 2023.<ref name=EM20190712erU>[http://euromaidanpress.com/2019/07/12/ukraine-finally-gets-a-new-election-code-its-the-first-step-to-an-effective-political-system/ Ukraine finally gets a new Election Code.

On 4 February 2020, parliament approved (with 236 votes) a Presidential bill to cut down the number of parliamentary deputies from 450 to 300.<ref name="639179IU450to300"/> To do so, the [[Ukrainian Constitution]] needs to be altered, this will require at least 300 parliamentary votes.<ref name="639179IU450to300">{{in lang|uk}} [https://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/political/639179.html The Verkhovna Rada has previously approved the reduction of the number of people's deputies to 300 and the transition to a proportional electoral system], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 February 2020)</ref>
