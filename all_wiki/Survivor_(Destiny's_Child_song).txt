"'''Survivor'''" is a song by American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] group [[Destiny's Child]]. It was written and composed by group member [[Beyoncé]], Anthony Dent, and [[Mathew Knowles]] for the band's third studio album [[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|of the same name]] (2001). 
"Survivor" was inspired by a joke that a radio station had made about the fact that three members had already left the group, comparing the band to the reality game show [[Survivor (franchise)|''Survivor'']].<ref name="DCSurvivor">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/d/destiny01/index2.jhtml|title=Destiny's Child: Survivors|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref> Beyoncé was inspired to take the negative comment and turn it into a positive by writing a song out of it.<ref name="DCSurvivor"/> The song won the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] at the [[2002 Grammy Awards]].

The video won the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards|2001 MTV Video Music Award]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video|Best R&B Video]], and a [[Soul Train]] Lady of Soul Award for Best R&B/Soul Single, Group, Band or Duo. The opening track of singer-songwriter [[Jill Sobule]]'s 2004 album ''[[The Folk Years 2003–2003]]'' is a cover of the song, and a pseudo-cover of the song also opens rapper [[Vanilla Ice]]'s 2005 album ''[[Platinum Underground]]''.

''Billboard'' named the song number 40 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time: Critics' Picks|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7857816/100-greatest-girl-group-songs|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

==Background==
In 1999, [[Destiny's Child]] members [[LaTavia Roberson]] and [[LeToya Luckett]] split from [[Beyoncé]] and [[Kelly Rowland]], and were replaced by [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]]. However, soon afterwards Franklin was also dropped and dismissed from the group.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/jun/10/life1.lifemagazine5 |title=Date with destiny |first=Jancee |last=Dunn |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 10, 2001 |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref> According to Knowles, the group was compared to the reality series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', which inspired her to "write us out of all that negativity."<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Beyoncé|Knowles, Beyoncé]]; Wickham, Nick (director) |date=November 23, 2009 |title=[[I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas]] |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Columbia Records]] |time= |id= |quote= }}</ref>

Additionally, the song was [[Black Entertainment Television]]'s tenth best song of the 2000s (decade).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bet.com/Music/photos/msc_bestsongof2000s_12.15.09.htm?i=9 |title=Best Songs of the 2000s |accessdate=January 5, 2011 |publisher=[[Black Entertainment Television]] }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Composition==
The song is performed in the key of [[G-sharp minor|G{{sharp}} minor]],  with a [[tempo]] of 81 beats per minute in [[Time signature|common time]]. In the [[harmonic minor]] scale, it follows a chord progression of G{{sharp}}m–C{{sharp}}m{{small|7}}–D{{sharp}}, and the group's vocals span an octave and a half, from  G{{sharp}}<sub>3</sub> to C{{sharp}}<sub>5</sub>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0040047_U1|title=Destiny's Child "Survivor" Sheet Music in B Major (transposable) - Download & Print|last=Knowles|first=Mathew|website=Musicnotes.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>

==Music video==
The music video for “Survivor” premiered on "[[Making the Video]]" on March 6, 2001, directed by [[Darren Grant]] and is styled in the sense of three survivors living on an uninhabited island. It also shows a brief prelude to how the girls got shipwrecked. Following their shipwreck, they uncover an island where they change clothes and walk into a waterfall leading to a deserted temple where it transforms into a dance break. It storms on through the dance bridge and the prelude of the shipwreck. After this, a helicopter starts buzzing leading to where Kelly, Beyonce and Michelle are racing out of the island for their escape.

The music video is featured on the DualDisc edition of the album ''[[Number 1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]'', on the international edition of the album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (as an enhanced video), on the 2004 [[Walmart]] exclusive DVD titled ''[[Destiny Fulfilled#Wal-Mart Exclusive DVD|Fan Pack]]'', and on the group's 2013 ''[[Destiny's Child Video Anthology|Video Anthology]]'' DVD.

The remix video featuring [[Da Brat]] is not featured on any video compilation.

==Chart performance==
"Survivor" debuted at number 43 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], making it the group's second highest debuting single to date, behind "[[Lose My Breath]]" at number 30, and quickly raced up the charts reaching its peak position of number 2 within a month. However, it was blocked out of the summit spot due to the massive success of [[Janet Jackson]]'s overarching smash "[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All For You]]", the track remained at the second position for seven consecutive weeks. The song did not have a physical single release until after its airplay had peaked; The song topped the Billboard Hot Dance Music Maxi-Singles Sales chart for eight weeks.
The song only reached number five on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] chart. The single reached number one on the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart for five consecutive weeks and peaked at number three on the [[Hot 100 Singles Sales]] chart.

In the [[United Kingdom]], "Survivor" debuted at number one on the singles chart and went on to sell around 290,000 copies. It also topped the singles chart in [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands]], and [[Japan]]. Moreover, it held the top position in the United World Tracks Chart for five weeks. It was ranked one in [[Canada]], peaked second in [[New Zealand]], placed in the top 5 in [[Australia]] and [[Germany]], and reached number 12 in [[France]].

==Controversy==
Former group members [[LeToya Luckett]] and [[LaTavia Roberson]] filed a lawsuit against Knowles, Rowland, and former manager [[Mathew Knowles]]; they claimed some of the lyrics in "Survivor", such as "You thought I wouldn't sell without you/sold nine million", violated a previous agreement that prevented either party from insulting the other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/76633/ex-destinys-child-members-sue-over-survivor |title=Ex-Destiny's Child Members Sue Over 'Survivor' |date=February 28, 2002 |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>
