Being the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by area|largest province-level division of China]] and the [[List of country subdivisions by area|8th-largest country subdivision]] in the world, Xinjiang spans over 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> (640,000 square&nbsp;miles), and has about 25 million inhabitants.<ref name="area" /><ref>{{cite web |title = National Data |url = http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2019/indexeh.htm |access-date = 16 September 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200415082955/http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2019/indexeh.htm |archive-date = 15 April 2020 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Xinjiang borders the countries of [[Mongolia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]. The rugged [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. The [[Aksai Chin]] region, administered by China mostly as part of Xinjiang's [[Hotan Prefecture]], is claimed by India. Xinjiang also borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and the provinces of [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]]. The most well-known route of the historical [[Silk Road]] ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border.

It is home to a number of ethnic groups, including the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]], [[Kazakhs]] and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], the [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Tajiks]], [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], [[Russians in China|Russians]] and [[Sibe people|Xibe]].<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm|work=BBC News|title=Regions and territories: Xinjiang|date=7 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520054144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm|archive-date=20 May 2011}}</ref> More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang.

With a documented history of at least 2,500 years, a succession of people and empires have vied for control over all or parts of this territory. The territory came under the rule of the [[Qing dynasty]] in the 18th century, later replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government. Since 1949, it has been part of the People's Republic of China following the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In 1954, [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps|Xinjiang Bingtuan]] was set up to strengthen the border defense against the Soviet Union and also promote the local economy. In 1955, Xinjiang was administratively changed from a [[Xinjiang Province|province]] into an [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous region]]. In recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural gas-producing region. In the 1990s and 2000s, the [[East Turkestan independence movement]], [[Xinjiang conflict|separatist conflict]] and the influence of [[Islamic extremism|radical Islam]] have resulted in unrest in the region with [[Terrorism in China#Xinjiang|occasional terrorist attacks]] and clashes between separatist and government forces.<ref name="auto3">{{cite magazine |date = 3 October 2015 |url = http://thediplomat.com/2015/10/chinas-protracted-war-in-xinjiang/ |title = China's 'Protracted War' in Xinjiang |first = Shannonb |last = Tiezzi |magazine = The Diplomat |access-date = 29 October 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161024230910/http://thediplomat.com/2015/10/chinas-protracted-war-in-xinjiang/ |archive-date = 24 October 2016 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite web |url = http://unpo.org/article/19582 |title = East Turkestan: Chinese Authorities Confiscate Passports Amid Security Crackdown |publisher = Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) |date = 21 October 2016 |access-date = 29 October 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161030075250/http://unpo.org/article/19582 |archive-date = 30 October 2016 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

The general region of Xinjiang has been known by many different names in earlier times, in indigenous languages as well as other languages. These names include [[Altishahr]], the historical [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] name for the southern half of the region referring to "the six cities" of the [[Tarim Basin]], as well as Khotan, Khotay, [[Chinese Tartary]], High Tartary, East Chagatay (it was the eastern part of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]), [[Moghulistan]] ("land of the Mongols"), Kashgaria, Little Bokhara, [[Serindia]] (due to Indian cultural influence){{sfnp|Tyler|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEzNwgtiVQ0C&pg=PA3 3]}} and, in Chinese, "[[Western Regions]]".{{sfnp|Hill |2009 |pp=xviii, 60}}

In Chinese, under the [[Han dynasty]], Xinjiang was known as ''Xiyu'' ({{lang|zh|西域}}), meaning "Western Regions". Between the 2nd century BCE and 2nd century CE the Han Empire established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] or Xiyu Protectorate ({{lang|zh-hant|西域都護府}}) in an effort to secure the profitable routes of the [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{cite book |first = Susan |last = Whitfield |author-link = Susan Whitfield |title = The Silk Road: trade, travel, war and faith |url = https://archive.org/details/aurelsteinonsilk0000whit |url-access = registration |year = 2004 |publisher = Serindia Publications |page = [https://archive.org/details/aurelsteinonsilk0000whit/page/27 27] }}</ref> The Western Regions during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] era were known as ''Qixi'' ({{lang|zh-hant|磧西}}). Qi refers to the [[Gobi Desert]] while Xi refers to the west. The Tang Empire had established the ''[[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]]'' or ''Anxi Protectorate'' ({{lang|zh-hant|安西都護府}}) in 640 to control the region. During the [[Qing dynasty]], the northern part of Xinjiang, [[Dzungaria]] was known as Zhunbu ({{lang|zh-hant|準部}}, "[[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] region") and the southern Tarim Basin was known as ''Huijiang'' ({{lang|zh|回疆}}, "Muslim Frontier") before both regions were merged and became the region of "Xiyu Xinjiang", later simplified as "Xinjiang".

The current Mandarin Chinese-derived name Xinjiang (Sinkiang), which literally means "New Frontier", "New Borderland" or "New Territory", was given during the [[Qing dynasty]] by the [[Qianlong Emperor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npm.gov.tw/exh98/frontier/en1.html|title=Introduction|website=The Lost Frontier Treaty Maps that Changed Qing's Northwestern Boundaries|access-date=29 January 2020|quote=The Qianlong emperor (1736-1796) named the region ''Xinjiang'', for New Territory.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129124734/https://www.npm.gov.tw/exh98/frontier/en1.html|archive-date=29 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Chinese statesman [[Zuo Zongtang]]'s report to the Emperor of Qing, Xinjiang means an "old land newly returned" ({{lang|zh-Hant|故土新歸}}) or the "new old land".{{NoteTag|The imperial-era Chinese word gui {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|歸}} is not descriptive, but normative: It is a term which seeks to justify new conquests by presenting them as a naturally appropriate "return."

Thus, the term "Xinjiang" was also used in many other places newly conquered, but never were ruled by Chinese empires before, including in what is now Southern China.{{sfnp|Weinstein|2013|p=4|ps={{full citation needed|date=May 2020}}}}}}

The term was also given to other areas conquered by Chinese empires, for instance, present-day [[Jinchuan County]] was then known as "Jinchuan Xinjiang". In the same manner, present-day Xinjiang was known as ''Xiyu Xinjiang '' ({{zh|t = 西域新疆|l = [[Western Regions]]' New Frontier}}) and ''Gansu Xinjiang'' ({{zh|t = 甘肅新疆|l = [[Gansu|Gansu Province]]'s New Frontier}}, especially for present-day eastern Xinjiang).{{cn|date=November 2020}}

In 1955, Xinjiang Province was renamed "Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region". The name that was originally proposed was simply "Xinjiang Autonomous Region". [[Saifuddin Azizi]], the first chairman of Xinjiang, registered his strong objections to the proposed name with [[Mao Zedong]], arguing that "autonomy is not given to mountains and rivers. It is given to particular nationalities." As a result, the administrative region would be named "Xinjiang ''Uygur'' Autonomous Region".{{sfnp|Bovingdon|2010|p=199}}

[[File:Altai, Tienschan-Orte.png|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Physical map showing the separation of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Altishahr) by the Tien Shan Mountains]]

Xinjiang consists of two main geographically, historically and ethnically distinct regions with different historical names, [[Dzungaria]] north of the Tianshan Mountains and the [[Tarim Basin]] south of the Tianshan Mountains, before [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] unified them into one political entity called Xinjiang Province in 1884. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling, nomadic [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Dzungar people]], while the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, Turkic-speaking Muslim farmers, now known as the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur people]]. They were governed separately until 1884. The native Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is [[Altishahr]].

The Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tian Shan and the Turkic Muslim area south of the Tian Shan and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false 69]}} However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70#v=onepage&q&f=false 70]}} The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing. It was originally not the native inhabitants who viewed it that way, but rather the Chinese who held that point of view.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false 67]}} During the Qing rule, no sense of "regional identity" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false 77]}}

In the late 19th century, it was still being proposed by some people that two separate regions be created out of Xinjiang, the area north of the Tianshan and the area south of the Tianshan, while it was being argued over whether to turn Xinjiang into a province.{{sfnp|Liu|Faure |1996 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false 78]}}

Xinjiang is a large, sparsely populated area, spanning over 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> (comparable in size to [[Iran]]), which takes up about one sixth of the country's territory. Xinjiang borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and [[India]]'s [[Leh District]] to the south and [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] provinces to the southeast, [[Mongolia]] to the east, [[Russia]]'s [[Altai Republic]] to the north and [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]] and India to the west.

The east-west chain of the [[Tian Shan]] separate [[Dzungaria]] in the north from the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. Dzungaria is a dry steppe and the Tarim Basin contains the massive [[Taklamakan Desert]], surrounded by oases. In the east is the [[Turpan Depression]]. In the west, the Tian Shan split, forming the [[Ili River]] valley.

According to [[J. P. Mallory]] and [[Victor Mair|Victor H. Mair]], the Chinese describe the existence of "white people with long hair" or the Bai people in the Shan Hai Jing, who lived beyond their northwestern border.

Various nomadic tribes, such as the Yuezhi, [[Saka]], and [[Wusun]] were probably part of the migration of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speakers who were settled in eastern Central Asia (possibly as far as [[Gansu]]) at that time. The Ordos culture in northern China east of the Yuezhi, is another example. By the time the Han dynasty under Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BC) wrestled the Western Regions of the Tarim Basin away from its previous overlords, the Xiongnu, it was inhabited by various peoples, such as [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Tocharians]] in [[Turfan]] and [[Kucha]] and [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] [[Saka]] peoples centered around [[Shule Kingdom|Kashgar]] and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]].<ref name=Tremblay2007>{{cite book |first=Xavier |last=Tremblay |year=2007 |chapter=The Spread of Buddhism in Serindia: Buddhism Among Iranians, Tocharians and Turks before the 13th Century |editor1=Ann Heirman |name-list-style=amp |editor2=Stephan Peter Bumbacker |title=The Spread of Buddhism |location=Leiden & Boston |publisher=Koninklijke Brill |page=77 |isbn=978-90-04-15830-6 }}</ref>

[[Nomad]]ic cultures such as the [[Yuezhi]] (Rouzhi) are documented in the area of Xinjiang where the first known reference to the Yuezhi was made in 645 BC by the Chinese chancellor [[Guan Zhong]] in his work ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|管子}}, Guanzi Essays: 73: 78: 80: 81). He described the ''Yúshì'' {{lang|zh-hant|禺氏}} (or ''Niúshì'' {{lang|zh|牛氏}}), as a people from the north-west who supplied [[jade]] to the Chinese from the nearby mountains (also known as Yushi) in Gansu.<ref>Iaroslav Lebedynsky, ''Les Saces'', {{ISBN|2-87772-337-2}}, p. 59.</ref> The supply of jade<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dillon |title=China: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7007-0439-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/chinahistoricalc0000unse }}</ref> from the Tarim Basin from ancient times is well documented archaeologically: "It is well known that ancient Chinese rulers had a strong attachment to jade.

In the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty made preparations for [[Han–Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]] when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] people in order to combat the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] and [[Gansu]] [[Hexi Corridor|corridor]] to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hant|西域都護府}}) at Wulei ({{lang|zh-hant|烏壘}}, near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains]], which would remain under the influence and [[suzerainty]] of the Han dynasty with some interruptions. For instance, it fell out of their control during the civil war against [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9–23). It was brought back under Han control in AD 91 due to the efforts of the general [[Ban Chao]].

The Western [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Later Liang]], and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liáng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success. After the final reunification of northern China under the [[Northern Wei]] empire, its protectorate controlled what is now the southeastern region of Xinjiang. Local states such as [[Shule Kingdom|Shule]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Guizi]] and [[Qiemo]] controlled the western region, while the central region around [[Turpan]] was controlled by [[Gaochang]], remnants of a state ([[Northern Liang]]) that once ruled part of what is now [[Gansu]] province in northwestern China.

It occupied the Tang capital of Chang'an in 763 for 16 days, and took control of southern Xinjiang by the end of the century. At the same time, the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] took control of northern Xinjiang, as well as much of Central Asia, and [[Mongolia]].

Meanwhile, after the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia had been smashed by the Kirghiz in 840, branches of the [[Uyghurs]] established themselves in [[Gaochang|Qocha]] (Karakhoja) and [[Beshbalik]], near the modern cities of Turfan and Urumchi. This Uyghur state remained in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, though it was subject to foreign overlords during that time. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam. The Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang initially remained [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] but later converted to [[Buddhism]].

In 1132, remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]] from [[Manchuria]] entered Xinjiang, fleeing the rebellion of their neighbors, the [[Jurchens]]. They established a new empire, the [[Qara Khitai]], which ruled over both the Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].<ref>''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World'', pp. 94</ref>

The historical area of what is contemporary Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Dzungaria]] and was originally populated by Indo-European [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and Iranic [[Saka]] peoples who practiced the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religion. The Turfan and Tarim Basins were populated by speakers of [[Tocharian languages]],{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA15 15]}} with "Europoid" mummies found in the region.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA16 16]}} The area became [[Islamization and Turkification of Xinjiang|Islamified]] starting in the 10th centuries with the conversion of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] who occupied Kashgar. Halfway through the 10th century the Saka Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered [[Hotan|Khotan]] around 1006.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA55 55]}}

=== Mongol period ===
{{see also|Mongol Empire|Yuan dynasty|Chagatai Khanate|Moghulistan|Kara Del|Yarkent Khanate|Dzungar Khanate}}
[[File:Mongolia XVI.png|thumb|left|Mongol states, 14th–17th century: 1.[[Northern Yuan dynasty]] 2. [[Four Oirat]]. 3.[[Moghulistan]] 4.[[Qara Del]]]]

After [[Genghis Khan]] unified [[Mongolia]] and began his advance west, the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi area offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Qara Khitai]] in 1218.

Xinjiang was a stronghold of [[Ogedai]] and later came under the control of his descendant [[Kaidu]]. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule came to an end.

During the era of the Mongol Empire, the [[Yuan dynasty]] vied with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] for rule over the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region. After the Chagatai Khanate fractured into smaller [[khanates]] in the mid-14th century, the politically fractured region was simultaneously ruled by numerous Persianized Mongol Khans, including the ones of [[Moghulistan]] (with the assistance of the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan), and Kashgaria. These leaders engaged in wars with each other and the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxania]] to the west and the [[Oirats]] to the east, the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and in China. In the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.

The Mongolian Dzungar was the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]]. Most of this area was only renamed "Xinjiang" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire. It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.
[[File:Qing Dzungar wars.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Dzungar–Qing Wars]] between the Qing Dynasty and [[Dzungar Khanate]]]]
The Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.

After converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the "infidel Kalmuks" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.<ref name="GibbLewis1998">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers|author4=Charles Pellat|author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677|access-date=10 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101193741/https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Manchu and Oirat armies]]

The Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] of China and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them; afterwards, Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] carried out the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.

The [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty of China gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar–Qing War|long struggle with the Dzungars]] that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years, Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate and many Han Chinese and [[Hui people|Hui]] moved into the pacified areas.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=98}}

By the 1860s, Xinjiang had been under [[Xinjiang under Qing rule|Qing rule]] for a century. The area had been conquered in 1759 from the [[Dzungar Khanate]]<ref>Peter Perdue, China marches west: the Qing conquest of Central Eurasia. Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press, 2005.</ref> whose core population, the [[Oirats]], subsequently became the targets of genocide. However, as Xinjiang consisted mostly of semi-arid or desert lands, these were not attractive to potential [[Chinese Han|Han]] settlers except some traders, so other people such as Uyghurs settled in the area.

Between 1862 and 1877, the area was deeply troubled by the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]], which was mainly an ethnic and religious war fought by members of the Muslim [[Hui people|Hui]] and other [[Muslims|Muslim]] ethnic groups in China's [[Shaanxi]], [[Ningxia]] and Gansu [[Provinces of China|provinces]], as well as in Xinjiang,

The conflict led to a recorded 20.77&nbsp;million deaths due to migration and war-related death. Many war immigrants also died from starvation on their journey to safety.<ref>[http://www.gxmzb.net/content/2019-05/16/content_1223.htm]</ref> Thousands of Muslim refugees from Shaanxi fled to Gansu. Some of them formed significant battalions in eastern Gansu, intending to reconquer their lands in Shaanxi. While the Hui rebels were preparing to attack Gansu and Shaanxi, [[Yaqub Beg]], ethnic Uzbek or [[Tajiks|Tajik]] commander at the [[Kokand Khanate]], fled from the Khanate in 1865 after losing [[Tashkent]] to the [[Russians]], settled in Kashgar and soon managed to take complete control of Xinjiang.

Yakub beg carried out a series of progressive reforms. He encouraged trade, built [[Caravanserai|caravansareis]], new channels and other irrigation systems. Nevertheless, the regime he created was considered severe, and sometimes cruel. Meanwhile the Chinese, finally decided to take decisive action against Yettishar. An army under the Chinese general [[Zuo Zongtang]] approached Kashgaria rapidly and on 16 May 1877, reconquered Kashgaria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yakub Beg |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yakub-Beg |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

After Xinjiang was converted into a province by the Qing, the administrative and reconstruction programs initiated by the Qing resulted in the Chinese government helping Uyghurs migrate from Southern Xinjiang to other areas of the province such as the area between Qitai and the capital, which was formerly nearly completely inhabited by Han Chinese and other areas like Ürümqi, Tacheng (Tabarghatai), Yili, Jinghe, Kur Kara Usu, Ruoqiang, Lop Nor and the Tarim River's lower reaches.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA151 151]}} It was during Qing times that Uyghurs were settled throughout all of Xinjiang, from their original home cities in the Western Tarim Basin.

In 1912, the Qing dynasty was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. [[Yuan Dahua]], the last Qing governor of Xinjiang, fled. One of his subordinates, [[Yang Zengxin]], took control of the province and acceded in name to the Republic of China in March of the same year. Through a balancing of mixed ethnic constituencies, Yang maintained control over Xinjiang until his assassination in 1928 after the [[Northern Expedition]] of the [[Kuomintang]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Victor C. |last1=Falkenheim |first2=Chiao-Min |last2=Hsieh |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Xinjiang |title=Xinjiang: autonomous region, China |date=9 August 2018 |orig-year=Online article added 26 July 1999 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=19 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814102201/https://www.britannica.com/place/Xinjiang |archive-date=14 August 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The [[Kumul Rebellion]] and other rebellions arose against his successor [[Jin Shuren]] in the early 1930s throughout Xinjiang, involving Uyghurs, other Turkic groups, and Hui (Muslim) Chinese.

The Soviet Union maintained a military base in Xinjiang and had several military and economic advisors deployed in the region. Sheng invited a group of [[Chinese Communists]] to Xinjiang, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s brother [[Mao Zemin]], but in 1943, fearing a conspiracy, Sheng executed them all, including Mao Zemin. In 1944, then the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier of China]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], was informed of Shicai's intention of joining the Soviet Union by Soviets, decided to shift him out of Xinjiang to [[Chongqing]] as the Minister of Agriculture and Forest.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dilemmas of Victory |editor=Jeremy Brown |editor2=Paul Pickowicz |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-6740-4702-0 |page=186}}</ref> More than one decade of Sheng's era had stopped.

The autonomous region of the PRC was established on 1 October 1955, replacing the province.<ref name="cfcr"/> In 1955 (the first modern census in China was taken in 1953), Uyghurs were counted as 73% of Xinjiang's total population of 5.11 million.{{sfnp|Bovingdon|2010|p=199}} Although Xinjiang as a whole is designated as an "Uygur Autonomous Region" since 1954 more than 50% of Xinjiang's land area are designated autonomous areas for 13 native non-Uyghur groups.{{sfnp|Bovingdon|2010|pp=43–46}} The modern Uyghur people experienced [[ethnogenesis]] especially from 1955, when the PRC officially recognized that ethnic category – in opposition to the Han – of formerly separately self-identified oasis peoples.{{sfnp|Hopper|Webber|2009|p=176}}

Xinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]], accounting for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases conducive to habitation accounting for 9.7% of Xinjiang's total area by 2015 <ref name="oasis"/> at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]], respectively.

=== Mountain systems and basins ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}
Xinjiang is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug-textonly|تەڭرى تاغ}}, Tengri Tagh, Тәңри Тағ), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].

[[File:Fly over Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]
Other major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] in the south (along the border with [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]) and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the northeast (shared with [[Mongolia]]). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], an [[eight-thousander]] located {{convert|8611|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].
[[File:Taklamakan desert.jpg|thumb|[[Taklamakan Desert]]]]
Much of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. North of it is the [[Turpan Depression]], which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at {{convert|155|m|ft|sp=us}} below sea level.

The Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.

The [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].

=== Geology ===
Xinjiang is geologically young. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges; said tectonics render it a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Center of the continent===
Xinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.

In 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[Ürümqi]], [[Ürümqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the "center point of Asia". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1)|website=www.confluence.org|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archive-date=2 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Rivers and lakes ===
[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]
[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black [[Irtysh]] river in [[Burqin County]] is a famous spot for [[sightseeing]].]]
Having hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh–Karamay–Ürümqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern [[Dzungarian Basin]].

[[File:LakeKanas.jpg|thumb|[[Kanas Lake]]]] 
Elsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the [[Tarim Basin]], the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]]. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into [[Lake Manas]]. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of [[potassium]] fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.

=== Deserts ===
Deserts include:
* [[Gurbantünggüt Desert]], also known as ''Dzoosotoyn Elisen''
* [[Taklamakan Desert]]
* [[Kumtag Desert]], east of Taklamakan

=== Major cities ===
Due to water scarcity, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges in areas conducive to irrigated agriculture. It is in these belts where most of the region's cities are found.

=== Climate ===
A semiarid or desert climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'' or ''BWk'', respectively) prevails in Xinjiang. The entire region has great seasonal differences in temperature with cold winters. The [[Turpan Depression]] recorded the hottest temperatures nationwide in summer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com.cn/cityintro/101130501.shtml? |script-title=zh:吐鲁番 – 气象数据 – 中国天气网|website=www.weather.com.cn|access-date=30 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172034/http://www.weather.com.cn/html/cityintro/101130501.shtml|archive-date=14 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> with air temperatures easily exceeding {{convert|40|°C}}. Winter temperatures regularly fall below {{convert|−20|°C}} in the far north and highest mountain elevations.

Continuous [[permafrost]] is typically found in the Tian Shan starting at the elevation of about 3,500–3,700 m above sea level. Discontinuous alpine permafrost usually occurs down to 2,700–3,300 m, but in certain locations, due to the peculiarity of the [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]] and the microclimate, it can be found at elevations as low as 2,000 m.<ref>{{citation |contribution=Geocryology in Mt.

Xinjiang is famous for its grapes, melons, pears, [[walnut]]s, particularly [[Hami melon]]s and [[Turpan]] [[raisin]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The region is also a leading source for [[tomato paste]], which it supplies for international brands.{{r|Guardian boycott}}

The main livestock of the region have traditionally been sheep. Much of the region's pasture land is in its northern part, where more precipitation is available,{{sfnp|Bellér-Hann|2008|p=37}} but there are mountain pastures throughout the region.

Due to the lack of access to the ocean and limited amount of inland water, Xinjiang's fish resources are somewhat limited. Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of fishing in [[Lake Ulungur]] and [[Lake Bosten]] and in the [[Irtysh River]]. A large number of fish ponds have been constructed since the 1970s, their total surface exceeding 10,000 hectares by the 1990s. In 2000, the total of 58,835 tons of fish was produced in Xinjiang, 85% of which came from [[aquaculture in China|aquaculture]].<ref>Guo Yan, [http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5082e/y5082e0c.htm Fisheries Development in Xinjiang, China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008163542/http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5082e/y5082e0c.htm |date=8 October 2013 }}</ref>

In the past, the [[Lop Nur|Lop Lake]] was known for its fisheries and the area residents, for their fishing culture; now, due to the diversion of the waters of the [[Tarim River]], the lake has dried out.

=== Foreign trade ===
Xinjiang's exports amounted to US$19.3 billion, while imports turned out to be US$2.9 billion in 2008.

The [[Han Chinese]] of Xinjiang arrived at different times from different directions and social backgrounds. There are now descendants of criminals and officials who had been exiled from [[China proper]] during the second half of the 18th and the first half of the 19th centuries; descendants of families of military and civil officers from [[Hunan]], Yunnan, [[Gansu]] and [[Manchuria]]; descendants of merchants from [[Shanxi]], Tianjin, [[Hubei]], and [[Hunan]]; and descendants of peasants who started immigrating into the region in 1776.{{sfnp|Bellér-Hann|2008|pp=51–52}}

Some Uyghur scholars claim descent from both the Turkic Uyghurs and the pre-Turkic [[Tocharians]] (or Tokharians, whose language was [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]); also, Uyghurs often have relatively-fair skin, hair, and eyes and other [[Caucasoid]] physical traits.

In 2002, there were 9,632,600 males (growth rate of 1.0%) and 9,419,300 females (growth rate of 2.2%). The population overall growth rate was 1.09%, with 1.63% of [[birth rate]] and 0.54% [[mortality rate]].

The Qing began a [[migration to Xinjiang|process of settling Han, Hui, and Uyghur settlers into Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria) in the 18th century]]. At the start of the 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=306}} A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% [[Han Chinese|Han]] and 60% [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], and it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census. However, a situation similar to the Qing era's demographics with a large number of Han had been restored by 2000, with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur.<ref name="ddx">{{cite journal |url = http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/EWCWwp001.pdf |title = Demographics and Development in Xinjiang after 1949 |first=Stanley |last=Toops |date=May 2004 |page=1 |issue=1 |periodical=East-West Center Washington Working Papers |publisher=[[East–West Center]] |access-date=14 November 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716193518/http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/EWCWwp001.pdf |archive-date=16 July 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Professor Stanley W.

In general, [[Uyghurs]] are the majority in Southwestern Xinjiang, including the prefectures of [[Kashgar Prefecture|Kashgar]], [[Hotan Prefecture|Khotan]], [[Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture|Kizilsu]] and [[Aksu Prefecture|Aksu]] (about 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs live in those four prefectures) as well as [[Turpan|Turpan Prefecture]], in Eastern Xinjiang. The [[Han Chinese|Han]] are the majority in Eastern and Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria), including the cities of [[Ürümqi]], [[Karamay]], [[Shihezi]] and the prefectures of [[Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Changjyi]], [[Börtala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Bortala]], [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Bayin'gholin]], [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] (especially the cities of [[Kuytun|Kuitun]]) and [[Hami|Kumul]].

A majority of the Uyghur Muslims adhere to [[Sunni Islam]] of the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence or [[madhab]]. A minority of [[Shia Islam|Shias]], almost exclusively of the [[Nizari Isma'ilism|Nizari Ismaili]] (Seveners) rites are located in the higher mountains of Tajik and [[Tian Shan]]. In the western mountains (the Tajiks), almost the entire population of [[Tajiks]] ([[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Sarikolis]] and [[Wakhi people|Wakhis]]), are [[Nizari Isma'ilism|Nizari]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili Shia]].<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> In the north, in the [[Tian Shan]], the [[Kazakhs]] and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] are Sunni.

The construction of the first expressway in the mountainous area of Xinjiang began a new stage in its construction on 24 July 2007. The {{convert|56|km|abbr=on}} highway linking [[Sayram Lake]] and [[Guozi Valley]] in Northern Xinjiang area had cost 2.39 billion yuan. The expressway is designed to improve the speed of national highway 312 in northern Xinjiang. The project started in August 2006 and several stages have been fully operational since March 2007. Over 3,000 construction workers have been involved. The 700 m-long Guozi Valley Cable Bridge over the expressway is now currently being constructed, with the 24 main pile foundations already completed. Highway 312 national highway Xinjiang section, connects Xinjiang with China's east coast, [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]], plus some parts of [[Europe]]. It is a key factor in Xinjiang's [[economic development]]. The population it covers is around 40% of the overall in Xinjiang, who contribute half of the GDP in the area.

The [[Zulfiya Abdiqadir|head of the Transport Department]] was quoted as saying that 24,800,000,000 [[Renminbi|RMB]] had been invested into Xinjiang's road network in 2010 alone and, by this time, the roads covered approximately {{convert|152000|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ts>{{cite web | url=http://news.ts.cn/content/2011-03/03/content_5636418.htm | editor=Su Qingxia ({{lang|zh-hans|苏清霞}}) | script-title=zh:祖丽菲娅·阿不都卡德尔代表：见证新疆交通事业的日益腾飞 | trans-title=Representative Zulfiya Abdiqadir: evidence that Xinjiang's transport projects are developing more with each passing day | language=zh-hans | date=3 March 2011 | access-date=24 February 2017 | website=Tianshan Net  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224215419/http://news.ts.cn/content/2011-03/03/content_5636418.htm# | archive-date=24 February 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Xinjiang's rail hub is Ürümqi. To the east, [[Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway|a conventional]] and [[Lanzhou-Xinjiang High-Speed Railway|a high-speed rail]] line runs through [[Turpan]] and [[Hami City|Hami]] to [[Lanzhou]] in [[Gansu Province]]. A [[Ejin–Hami Railway|third outlet to the east]] connects Hami and Inner Mongolia.

To the west, the [[Northern Xinjiang Railway|Northern Xinjiang]] runs along the northern footslopes of the [[Tian Shan]] range through [[Changji]], [[Shihezi]], [[Kuytun]] and [[Jinghe County|Jinghe]] to the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] border at [[Alashankou]], where it links up with the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]]. Together, the Northern Xinjiang and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang lines form part of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge|Trans-Eurasian Continental Railway]], which extends from [[Rotterdam]], on the [[North Sea]], to [[Lianyungang]], on the [[East China Sea]]. The [[Second Ürümqi-Jinghe Railway]] provides additional rail transport capacity to Jinghe, from which the [[Jinghe-Yining-Horgos Railway]] heads into the [[Ili River]] Valley to [[Yining (city)|Yining]], [[Huocheng]], and [[Khorgos]], a second rail border crossing with Kazakhstan. The [[Kuytun-Beitun Railway]] runs from Kuytun north into the [[Junggar Basin]] to [[Karamay]] and Beitun, near [[Altay City|Altay]].

In the south, the [[Southern Xinjiang Railway|Southern Xinjiang Line]] from Turpan runs southwest along the southern footslopes of the [[Tian Shan]] into the [[Tarim Basin]], with stops at [[Yanqi Town|Yanqi]], [[Korla]], [[Kuqa County|Kuqa]], [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]], [[Maralbexi County|Maralbexi (Bachu)]], [[Artux]], and [[Kashgar]]. From Kashgar, the [[Kashgar-Hotan Railway]], follows the southern rim of the Tarim to [[Hotan]], with stops at [[Shule County|Shule]], [[Akto]], [[Yengisar]], [[Shache|Shache (Yarkant)]], [[Kargilik Town|Yecheng (Karghilik)]], [[Moyu County|Moyu (Karakax)]].

The [[Ürümqi-Dzungaria Railway]] connects Ürümqi with coal fields in the eastern Junggar Basin. The [[Hami–Lop Nur Railway]] connects Hami with [[potash|potassium salt]] mines in and around [[Lop Nur]].

The [[Golmud-Korla Railway]], under construction as of August 2016, would provide an outlet to [[Qinghai]]. Railways [[Khunjerab Railway|to Pakistan]] and Kyrgyzstan have been proposed.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]]; in the large cities of Han China many are [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]], and [[Confucian]], although many follow [[Islam]] as well, such as the [[Hui]] ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country. The Uyghurs are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Turkic, a clear distinction from the Han that are the majority in the eastern regions of China, although many other Turkic ethnicities live in East China such as the [[Salar people]], the [[Chinese Tatars]] and the [[Yugur]]. Ironically, the capital of Xinjiang, Ürümqi, was originally a Han and Hui (Tungan) city with few Uyghur people before recent Uyghur migration to the city.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |pp=77–78, 133–134}} Since 1996, China has engaged in "strike hard" campaigns targeted at separatists.<ref>''[http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215105736/http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ |date=15 December 2013 }}''</ref> On 5 June 2014, China sentenced nine people to death for terrorist attacks.
