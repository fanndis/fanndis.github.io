The '''Winter Fuel Payment''' is a state benefit paid once per year in the United Kingdom to qualifying individuals. It is intended to cover the additional costs of heating over the winter months. It was first introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[First Blair ministry|government]] in 1997, and was first announced by [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] in his Pre-[[Budget of the United Kingdom|Budget]] Statement of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06019/SN06019.pdf|title=Winter Fuel Payments update|year=2016|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=10 June 2016}}</ref>

To be eligible for the benefit in a particular year, a person must be born before a specific qualifying date (e.g. 5 April 1954 for payments for the winter 2019-2020), and have lived in the UK for at least one day during the week of 16 to 22 September 2019 - this is called the ‘qualifying week’. Certain categories of people are excluded groups (prisoners, people receiving long-term free hospital care, those with certain immigration issues, and those living in care homes and receiving income-related benefits such as pension credit). Thus for the winter of 2019-2020 the benefit was available to those aged 65 by 5  April 2019.  The benefit may also be applicable to those living in Switzerland or the EEA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/eligibility|title=Winter Fuel Payment: Eligibility|year=2019|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=1 June 2019}}</ref>

The amount paid is greater for those aged eighty years and older and is set so that a person living alone (or with people ineligible for the payment) is paid twice as much as a person in a household where more than one person receives the payment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment/what-youll-get|title=Winter Fuel Payment: What you'll get|year=2013|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>

If the weather is particularly cold, a [[cold weather payment]] may also be made.
