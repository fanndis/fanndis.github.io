The '''Democratic Unionist Party''' ('''DUP''') is a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] political party in [[Northern Ireland]] favouring [[Great Britain|British]] identity. It was founded in 1971 during [[the Troubles]] by [[Ian Paisley]], who led the party for the next 37 years. Now led by [[Arlene Foster]], it has, by a margin of one, the most seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], and it is the fifth-largest party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

The DUP evolved from the [[Protestant Unionist Party]] and has historically strong links to the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]], the church Paisley founded. During the Troubles, the DUP were opposed to power-sharing with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] or [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] as a means of resolving the conflict, and likewise rejected attempts to involve the [[Republic of Ireland]] in Northern Irish affairs. It campaigned against the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973, the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] of 1985, and the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. In 2006, the DUP co-signed the [[St Andrews Agreement]] and agreed to share power with the republican party [[Sinn Féin]] who agreed to support the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|Police Service]], courts, and rule of law.

The party has been linked to various loyalist paramilitary groups, namely [[Ulster Resistance]] (URM) and [[Third Force (Northern Ireland)|Third Force]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ian Paisley death: Third Force 'were a motley crew of teens and farmers...' |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ian-paisley-death-third-force-were-a-motley-crew-of-teens-and-farmers--30583056.html |accessdate=14 November 2019 |newspaper=Belfast Telegraph |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224221140/https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ian-paisley-death-third-force-were-a-motley-crew-of-teens-and-farmers--30583056.html |archive-date=24 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="third spare activity">{{cite book |title=Unionism and Orangeism in Northern Ireland Since 1945 |publisher=Blackstaff Press |location=Belfast |page=199|quote=The men on the Antrim hillside became the nucleus of a paramilitary formation 'The Third Force' which would play a role in what the DUP called 'The Carson Trail'}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Wood | first = Ian S. | title = Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA | publisher= [[Edinburgh University Press]] | date = 2006 | page = 74 | isbn = 978-0748624270 | quote= Dr Ian Paisley, who had been close to Bradford, called for tax and rent strikes by Loyalists and announced the formation of a new paramilitary body for which he claimed he was helping to recruit.

For most of the DUP's history, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] was the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland, but by 2004 the DUP had overtaken the UUP in terms of seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. Following the [[St Andrews Agreement]] in 2006, the DUP agreed to enter into [[Consociationalism|power-sharing]] [[Devolution|devolved]] government in Northern Ireland with [[Sinn Féin]].

== History ==

=== 1970s ===
[[File:Ian Paisley - (cropped).png|thumb|[[Ian Paisley]], who founded the party and led it for 37 years]]
The Democratic Unionist Party evolved from the [[Protestant Unionist Party]], which itself grew out of the [[Ulster Protestant Action]] movement. The DUP was founded on 30 September 1971 by [[Ian Paisley]], leader of the Protestant Unionist Party, and [[Desmond Boal]], formerly of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Paisley, a well-known [[Christian fundamentalism|Protestant fundamentalist]] minister,  was the founder and leader of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]]. He would lead both the DUP and the Free Presbyterian Church for the next 37 years, and his party and church would be closely linked. When the DUP formed, Northern Ireland was in the midst of an ethnic-nationalist conflict known as [[the Troubles]], which began in 1969 and would last for the next thirty years. The conflict began amid a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|campaign to end discrimination]] against the [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]]/[[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] minority by the Protestant/unionist government and police force.<ref>Richard English. ''The State: Historical and Political Dimensions'', Charles Townshend, 1998, Routledge, p. 96; {{ISBN|0-41515-477-4}}.</ref><ref name="dbryan">Dominic Bryan. ''Orange Parades: The Politics of Ritual, Tradition and Control'', Pluto Press (2000), p. 94; {{ISBN|0-74531-413-9}}.</ref> This protest campaign was opposed, often violently, by unionists who viewed it as an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] front. Paisley had led the unionist opposition to the civil rights movement. The DUP were more hardline or [[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]] than the UUP and its founding arguably stemmed from worries of the [[Ulster Protestant]] working class that the UUP was not paying them enough heed.<ref>"Beyond the Sectarian Divide: the Social Bases and Political Consequences of Nationalist and Unionist Party Competition in Ireland" by Geoffrey Evans and Mary Duffy. In ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 27, No. 1. (Jan. 1997), p.58</ref>

The DUP opposed the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. The Agreement was an attempt to resolve the conflict by setting up a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1973)|assembly]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive (1974)|government for Northern Ireland]] in which unionists and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] would share power. The Agreement also proposed the creation of a Council of Ireland, which would facilitate co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The DUP won eight seats in the [[1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election|1973 election to the Assembly]]. Along with other anti-Agreement unionists, the DUP formed the [[United Ulster Unionist Council]] (UUUC) to oppose the Agreement. In the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 UK election]], the UUUC won 11 out of 12 Northern Ireland seats, while the pro-Agreement unionists failed to win any. On 15 May 1974, anti-Agreement unionists called [[Ulster Workers' Council strike|a general strike aimed at bringing down the Agreement]]. The strike coordinating committee included DUP leader Paisley, the other UUUC leaders, and the leaders of the [[Ulster loyalism#Paramilitary and vigilante groups|loyalist paramilitary groups]]. The strike lasted fourteen days and brought Northern Ireland to a standstill. Loyalist paramilitaries helped enforce the strike by blocking roads and intimidating workers.<ref>[[David George Boyce]] and Alan O'Day.

Following the downfall of the Agreement, in 1975 the British government set up a [[Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention|Constitutional Convention]], an elected body of unionists and nationalists which would seek agreement on a political settlement for Northern Ireland.  In the election to the convention, the UUUC (which included the DUP) won 53% of the vote. The UUUC opposed a power-sharing government and recommended only a return to majority rule (i.e. unionist rule). As this was unacceptable to nationalists, the convention was dissolved.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr Martin Melaugh |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/convention/sum.htm |title=Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention – A Summary of Main Events |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN) |accessdate=9 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916234314/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/convention/sum.htm |archive-date=16 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The DUP opposed UK membership of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In June 1979, in the [[1979 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|first election to the European Parliament]], Paisley won one of the three Northern Ireland seats. He topped the poll, with 29.8% of the first preference votes.<ref name=cain79>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch79.htm A Chronology of the Conflict – 1979] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206183455/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch79.htm |date=6 December 2010 }}.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===

During 1981, the DUP opposed the then-ongoing talks between British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]]. That year, Paisley and other DUP members attempted to create a Protestant loyalist volunteer [[militia]]—called the (Ulster) [[Third Force (Northern Ireland)|Third Force]]—which would work alongside the police and army to fight the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). They organized large rallies where men were photographed in military formation waving [[Firearms license|firearms certificates]]. Paisley declared: "This is a small token of the men who are placed to devastate any attempt by Margaret Thatcher and Charles Haughey to destroy the Union".<ref>Henry Patterson, Eric P. Kaufmann. ''Unionism and Orangeism in Northern Ireland Since 1945''. Manchester University Press, 2007. p.198-199</ref> The DUP helped organize a loyalist 'Day of Action' on 23 November 1981, to pressure the British government to take a harder line against the IRA.<ref name=cain81>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch81.htm A Chronology of the Conflict – 1981] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZqWi6fU?url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch81.htm |date=18 February 2011 }}, Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)</ref> Paisley addressed a Third Force rally in [[Newtownards]], where thousands of masked and uniformed men marched before him. He declared: "My men are ready to be recruited under the crown to destroy the vermin of the IRA. But if they refuse to recruit them, then we will have no other decision to make but to destroy the IRA ourselves!"<ref>Hall, Michael. ''The Death of the Peace Process?: A survey of community perceptions''. Island Publications, 1997. p.10</ref> In December, Paisley claimed that the Third Force had 15,000–20,000 members. [[James Prior, Baron Prior|James Prior]], [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], replied that private armies would not be tolerated.<ref name=cain81 />

The [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] was signed by the British and Irish governments in November 1985, following months of talks between the two. The Agreement confirmed there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without [[principle of consent|the consent of a majority of its citizens]], and proposed the creation of a new power-sharing government. It also gave the Irish government an advisory role on some matters in Northern Ireland. Both the DUP and UUP mounted a major protest campaign against the Agreement, dubbed "[[Ulster Says No]]". Both unionist parties resigned their seats in the British House of Commons, suspended district council meetings, and led a campaign of mass [[civil disobedience]]. There were strikes and mass protest rallies.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement – Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=6 December 2010 }}.

The loyalists  marched up and down the main street, vandalised property, and attacked two Irish police officers ([[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]]) before fleeing back over the border. Robinson was arrested and convicted for [[unlawful assembly]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch86.htm#Aug |title=A Chronology of the Conflict – 1986 |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN) |accessdate=9 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514130616/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch86.htm#Aug |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 10 November 1986, a rally was held in which DUP politicians Paisley, Robinson and [[Ivan Foster]] announced the formation of the [[Ulster Resistance]] Movement (URM). This was a loyalist paramilitary group whose purpose was to "take direct action as and when required" to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism.<ref name=cain-u/> Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined.<ref name=cain-u /> The following year, the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland, which were shared out between the URM, the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA). Most, but not all, of the weaponry was seized by police in 1988. In 1989, URM members attempted to trade [[Short Brothers|Shorts]]' missile blueprints for weapons from the [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]]n regime. Following these revelations, the DUP said that it had cut its links with the URM in 1987.<ref name="belfasttelegraph.co.uk"/>

In the mid-1980s, the Irish republican party [[Sinn Féin]] began to contest and win seats in local council elections. In response, the DUP fought elections under the slogan "Smash Sinn Féin" and vowed to exclude Sinn Féin councillors from all council business. Their 1985 manifesto said "The Sinn Féiners must be ostracised and isolated" at all local government bodies. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, DUP councillors attempted to exclude Sinn Féin councillors by ignoring them, boycotting their speeches, or drowning them out by making as much noise as possible – such as by heckling and banging tables.<ref>McAuley, James. ''The politics of identity: a loyalist community in Belfast''. Avebury, 1994. p.77</ref>

In early January 1994, the Ulster Defence Association released a document calling for the [[repartition of Ireland]] with the goal of making Northern Ireland wholly Protestant.<ref name="Wood 184-185">Wood, Ian S. ''Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA''. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. Pages 184–185.</ref>  The plan was to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. The Irish Catholic/nationalist-majority areas would be handed over to the Republic, and those left in the rump state would be "expelled, [[ethnic cleansing|nullified]], or [[internment|interned]]".<ref name="Wood 184-185" />  [[Sammy Wilson (politician)|Sammy Wilson]], then a DUP press officer and a future [[Northern Ireland Executive|Stormont minister]] and [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]], spoke positively of the document, calling it a "valuable return to reality" and lauded the UDA for "contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity".<ref name="Wood 184-185" />

=== 1998–2004 ===
During the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] of the 1990s, the DUP was initially involved in the negotiations under former United States Senator [[George J. Mitchell]] that led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998, but withdrew in protest when [[Sinn Féin]], an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] party with links to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), was allowed to participate while the IRA kept its weapons. The DUP opposed the Agreement in the [[1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum|Good Friday Agreement referendum]], in which the Agreement was approved with 71.1% of the electorate in favour.

The DUP's opposition was based on a number of reasons, including:
* The early release of paramilitary prisoners
* The mechanism to allow Sinn Féin to hold government office despite ongoing IRA activity (of which it was the political wing)
* The lack of accountability of ministers in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]
* The lack of accountability of the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] and North/South Implementation Bodies

The DUP contested the [[1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election]] that resulted from the Good Friday Agreement, winning 20 seats, the third-highest of any party. It then took up two of the ten seats in the multi-party power-sharing Executive. While serving as ministers, they refused to sit at meetings of the Executive Committee in protest at Sinn Féin's participation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The Executive ultimately collapsed over an alleged IRA espionage ring at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] (see [[Stormontgate]]).

The Good Friday Agreement relied on the support of a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists in order for it to operate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} During the [[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election]], the DUP argued for a "fair deal" that could command the support of both unionists and nationalists. After the results of this election the DUP argued that support was no longer present within unionism for the Good Friday Agreement. They went on to publish their proposals for devolution in Ireland entitled ''Devolution Now''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Martin Melaugh |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/dup/dup050204text.htm |title=CAIN: Issues: Politics: Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) (2004) Devolution Now: The DUP's Concept for Devolution, 5 February 2004 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513030659/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/dup/dup050204text.htm |archive-date=13 May 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> These proposals have been refined and re-stated in further policy documents including ''Moving on''<ref>[http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPMovingOn05.pdf Moving On], Democratic Unionist Party {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184328/http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPMovingOn05.pdf |date=13 March 2012 }}</ref> and ''Facing Reality''.<ref>[http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPFacingReality.pdf Facing Reality], Democratic Unionist Party {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184348/http://www.dup.org.uk/pdf/DUPFacingReality.pdf |date=13 March 2012 }}</ref>

In the 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the DUP won 30 seats, the most of any party. In January 2004, it became the largest Northern Ireland party at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], when MP [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] joined after defecting from the UUP. In December 2004, English MP [[Andrew Hunter (British politician)|Andrew Hunter]] took the DUP whip after earlier withdrawing from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], giving the party seven seats, in comparison to the UUP's five, Sinn Féin's four, and the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]]'s (SDLP) three.

=== 2005–2007 ===
In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 UK general election]], the party reinforced its position as the largest unionist party, winning nine seats, making it the fourth largest party in terms of seats in the British House of Commons behind Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. In terms of votes, the DUP was the fourth largest party on the island of Ireland.

At the [[2005 Northern Ireland local elections|local government election of 2005]], the DUP emerged as the largest party at local government level with 182 councillors across Northern Ireland's 26 district councils.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg05.htm|title= 2005 Local Government Election Results|website= Northern Ireland Elections|publisher= ARK|access-date= 24 August 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070809161624/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg05.htm|archive-date= 9 August 2007|url-status= live}}</ref> The DUP had a majority of the members on [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh Borough Council]], which had long been a DUP stronghold and was home to party leader [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]], also in [[Ballymena (borough)|Ballymena Borough Council]], home to the party's founder Ian Paisley, and finally [[Ards (borough)|Ards Borough Council]]. As well as outright control on these councils, the DUP was also the largest party in eight other councils – [[Antrim (borough)|Antrim Borough Council]], [[Ballymoney (borough)|Ballymoney Borough Council]], [[Banbridge (district)|Banbridge District Council]], [[Belfast City Council]], [[Carrickfergus Borough Council]], [[Coleraine Borough Council]], [[Craigavon Borough Council]] and [[Newtownabbey Borough Council]].

On 11 April 2006, it was announced that three DUP members were to be elevated to the [[House of Lords]]: [[Maurice Morrow]], [[Wallace Browne]], the former [[Lord Mayor of Belfast]], and [[Eileen Paisley]], a vice-president of the DUP and wife of DUP Leader [[Ian Paisley]]. None, however, sit as DUP peers.

On 27 October 2006, the DUP issued a four-page letter in the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' newspaper asking "Are the terms of Saint Andrew's a basis of moving forward to devolution?", with responses to be received to its party headquarters by 8 November. It was part of the party's policy of consultation with its electorate before entering a power-sharing government.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

On 24 November 2006, Ian Paisley refused to nominate himself as [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] designate. There was confusion between all parties whether he actually said that if Sinn Féin supported policing and the rule of law that he would nominate himself on 28 March 2007 after the Assembly elections on 7 March 2007. The Assembly meeting was brought to an abrupt end when the building had to be evacuated because of a security breach. Paisley later released a statement through the press office stating that he did in fact imply that if Sinn Féin supported policing and the rule of law, he would go into a power-sharing government with  them. This was following a statement issued by 12 DUP MLAs stating that what Ian Paisley had said in the chamber could not be interpreted as a nomination.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/6181370.stm| title=Paisley 'will accept nomination'| work=BBC News| access-date=4 January 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104200459/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/6181370.stm| archive-date=4 January 2015| url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 2007, the DUP suggested that it would begin to impose fines up to [[Pound sterling|£]]20,000 on members disobeying the party whip on crucial votes.<ref name="st040207">Sunday Times, page 1.10, 4 February 2007</ref> On 24 March 2007 the DUP party executive overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution put to them by the party officers that did not agree to an establishment of devolution and an executive in Northern Ireland by the Government's deadline of 26 March, but did agree to setting up an executive on 8 May 2007.<ref name="BBC1" />

On 27 March 2007, the party's sole Member of the European Parliament (MEP), [[Jim Allister]], resigned from the party, in opposition to the decision to enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin. He retained his seat as an independent MEP as leader of his new hard-line anti-St Andrews Agreement splinter group that he formed with other disaffected members who had left the DUP over the issue, [[Traditional Unionist Voice]], a seat which he retained until [[Diane Dodds]] won the seat back for the DUP in 2009. MP [[Gregory Campbell (politician)|Gregory Campbell]]  warned on 6 April 2007 that his party would be watching to see if benefits flow from its agreement to share power with Sinn Féin.<ref name="belfasttelegraph060407">{{cite news|title=Agreement must bring benefits, Congressmen are told |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/article2428174.ece |author=Noel McAdam |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=6 April 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Robinson leadership ===

On 31 May 2008, the party's central Executive Committee met at the offices of [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh Borough Council]] where Ian Paisley formally stepped down as party leader and Peter Robinson was ratified as the new leader, with Nigel Dodds as his deputy.

On 11 June 2008, the party supported the government's proposal to detain terrorist  suspects for up to 42 days as part of the [[Counter-Terrorism Act 2008#42 day terrorist detention without charge|Counter-Terrorism Bill]], leading ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper to dub all of the party's nine MPs as part of "Brown's dirty dozen".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/twelve-good-folk-and-true-or-browns-dirty-dozen-847334.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Twelve good folk and true... or Brown's dirty dozen? | date=15 June 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111022852/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/twelve-good-folk-and-true-or-browns-dirty-dozen-847334.html | archive-date=11 November 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' reported that the party had been given "sweeteners for Northern Ireland" and "a peerage for the Rev Ian Paisley", amongst other offers, to secure the bill.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sharrock|first1=David|last2=Coates|first2=Sam|title=42 day detention: bribes and concessions that got DUP on side|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/42-day-detention-bribes-and-concessions-that-got-dup-on-side-r959hlgdhhz|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=The Times|url-access=subscription|date=12 June 2008|language=en|quote=Sweeteners for Northern Ireland and a peerage for the Rev Ian Paisley, dropping sanctions on Cuba and the governorship of Bermuda were among the offers the Government is thought to have used to secure Gordon Brown’s victory in yesterday’s vote.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221211227/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/42-day-detention-bribes-and-concessions-that-got-dup-on-side-r959hlgdhhz|archive-date=21 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Members of the DUP were lambasted by the press and voters, after MPs' expenses reports were leaked to the media. Several newspapers{{who|date=November 2019}} referred to the "Swish Family Robinson" after Peter Robinson, and his wife Iris,  claimed £571,939.41 in expenses with a further £150,000 being paid to family members.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Further embarrassment was caused to the party when its deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, had the highest expenses claims of any Northern Ireland MP, ranking 13th highest out of all UK MPs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/7976508.stm|title=Dodds' expenses bill NI's highest|work=BBC News|access-date=4 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104205636/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/7976508.stm|archive-date=4 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Details of all MPs' expenses claims since 2004 were published in July 2009 under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].

In the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the party suffered a major upset when its leader, Peter Robinson, lost his [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] seat to [[Naomi Long]] of the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|APNI]] on a swing of 22.9%. However, the party maintained its position elsewhere, fighting off a challenge from the [[Ulster Conservatives and Unionists – New Force]] in [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim South]] and [[Strangford (UK Parliament constituency)|Strangford]] and from [[Jim Allister]]'s [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] in [[North Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim North]].

The DUP were strongly criticised after the [[Red Sky scandal]] in which DUP ministers attempted to influence a decision at a meeting of the [[Northern Ireland Housing Executive]]. The decision related to an £8 million contract of east Belfast firm Red Sky. The Housing Executive cancelled Red Sky's contract after a BBC ''Spotlight'' investigation into the company, which was shown to be overcharging taxpayers. The DUP cited "sectarian bias" in relation to the decision.<ref name="role">{{cite news|title=The DUP's full role in Red Sky row revealed|url=http://www.thedetail.tv/articles/the-dup-s-full-role-in-red-sky-row-revealed|work=The Detail|access-date=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004406/http://www.thedetail.tv/articles/the-dup-s-full-role-in-red-sky-row-revealed|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The party suspended DUP councillor [[Jenny Palmer]], who sat on the Executive board, after she confessed that DUP special adviser Stephen Brimstone pressured her into changing her vote at the meeting.

In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], when the result was expected to be a [[hung parliament]], the issue of DUP and the [[UK Independence Party]] forming a [[coalition government]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]] was considered by [[Nigel Farage]] (leader of UKIP).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Justice|first1=Adam|title=General Election 2015: Ukip could form coalition with Tories and DUP|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/general-election-2015-ukip-could-form-coalition-tories-dup-1492489|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=International Business Times|date=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407174306/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/general-election-2015-ukip-could-form-coalition-tories-dup-1492489|archive-date=7 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Michael|title=Conservative Ukip coalition: what have the parties said|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11566274/Conservative-Ukip-coalition-what-have-the-parties-said.html|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410205222/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11566274/Conservative-Ukip-coalition-what-have-the-parties-said.html|archive-date=10 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The then Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], warned against this "Blukip" coalition, with a spoof website highlighting imagined policies from this coalition – such as reinstating the [[death penalty]], scrapping all benefits for under 25s and charging for hospital visits.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cromie|first1=Claire|title=Nick Clegg warns of rightwing 'Blukip' alliance of DUP, Ukip and the Conservatives|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/nick-clegg-warns-of-rightwing-blukip-alliance-of-dup-ukip-and-the-conservatives-31147787.html|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Belfast Telegraph|date=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410140256/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/nick-clegg-warns-of-rightwing-blukip-alliance-of-dup-ukip-and-the-conservatives-31147787.html|archive-date=10 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, issues were raised about the continued existence of the [[BBC]] (as the DUP, UKIP and Conservatives had made a number of statements criticising the institution)<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|title=Tory coalition with DUP and Ukip could spell the end of the BBC as we know it|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/tory-coalition-with-dup-and-ukip-could-spell-the-end-of-the-bbc-as-we-know-it-31177207.html|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=The Belfast Telegraph|date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410161412/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/tory-coalition-with-dup-and-ukip-could-spell-the-end-of-the-bbc-as-we-know-it-31177207.html|archive-date=10 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and support for [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunne|first1=Ciara|title=An alliance with the DUP will be a harder bargain than either Labour or the Tories think|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/alliance-dup-will-be-harder-bargain-either-labour-or-tories-think|accessdate=29 March 2016|work=New Statesman|date=16 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408145302/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/alliance-dup-will-be-harder-bargain-either-labour-or-tories-think|archive-date=8 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=JonesAttitude5May15>{{cite news|last1=Stroude|first1=Will|title=Owen Jones warns of 'homophobic' DUP holding influence over future government|url=http://attitude.co.uk/owen-jones-warns-of-homophobic-dup-holding-influence-over-future-government/|accessdate=12 January 2016|work=Attitude Magazine|date=5 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308163148/http://attitude.co.uk/owen-jones-warns-of-homophobic-dup-holding-influence-over-future-government/|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, in an interview with [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] deputy leader of the DUP [[Nigel Dodds]] told [[BBC Newsline]] that the DUP was "against discrimination based on religion ... or sexual orientation".<ref name=JonesAttitude5May15 />

Two days before the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|UK Brexit referendum]], held on 23 June 2016, the DUP paid £282,000 for a four-page glossy wrap-around to the free newspaper ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'', which is distributed in major towns and cities in the British mainland, but not Northern Ireland, advocating a 'Leave' vote.<ref name="dark money #1">{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/what-connects-brexit-the-dup-dark-money-and-a-saudi-prince-1.3083586| title=What connects Brexit, the DUP, dark money and a Saudi prince?| newspaper=The Irish Times| date=16 May 2017| accessdate=12 June 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612191427/http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/what-connects-brexit-the-dup-dark-money-and-a-saudi-prince-1.3083586| archive-date=12 June 2017| url-status=live}}</ref>

In her capacity as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in 2012, Foster oversaw the establishment of a [[Environmentally friendly|green]] energy scheme, which led to the [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal]].  The scheme gave a [[perverse incentive]] to use more energy and increase their [[carbon footprint]] to those who signed up to it since they could claim £1.60 for every £1 spent on heating with, for example, wood pellets.<ref name="about">{{cite news|title=Q&A: What is the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38307628|work=BBC News|date=13 December 2016|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623035603/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38307628|archive-date=23 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  With no cost controls, it could cost the public purse up to £490 million.

The DUP are strongly supportive of [[Israel]], hewing to the hawkish end of the Israeli political spectrum.<ref>{{cite news|title=A distant conflict resonates in Northern Ireland|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21725795-catholics-and-protestants-have-strong-views-about-israel-and-palestine-distant-conflict|accessdate=4 August 2017|work=The Economist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803222940/https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21725795-catholics-and-protestants-have-strong-views-about-israel-and-palestine-distant-conflict|archive-date=3 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Social policies ===

The DUP is [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] and has strong links to the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]], the small church founded by Reverend Ian Paisley. The vast majority of DUP members are [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians and, on average, 65% of its representatives since the party was founded have been Free Presbyterians.<ref>Bruce, Steve. ''Paisley: Religion and Politics in Northern Ireland''. Oxford University Press, 2007. p.188</ref> The party also has links with the [[Caleb Foundation]], a Protestant fundamentalist pressure group.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/caleb-foundation-the-creationist-bible-group-and-its-web-of-influence-at-stormont-28787760.html |title=Caleb Foundation: The Creationist Bible group and its web of influence at Stormont |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=1 September 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207192315/https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/caleb-foundation-the-creationist-bible-group-and-its-web-of-influence-at-stormont-28787760.html |archive-date=7 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The DUP has opposed [[LGBT rights in Northern Ireland]].

''The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest to Power''. Oxford University Press, 2014. p.155</ref> The DUP campaigned against the legalisation of homosexual acts, which it believed to be a "harmful deviance" linked to paedophilia, in Northern Ireland through the "[[Save Ulster from Sodomy]]" campaign between 1977–82,<ref>{{cite news|title=1982: DUP furious at gay law reforms|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/1982-dup-furious-at-gay-law-reforms-1-4648579|accessdate=10 June 2017|work=The News Letter|date=5 January 2013|location=Belfast, Northern Ireland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904010725/http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/1982-dup-furious-at-gay-law-reforms-1-4648579|archive-date=4 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and the party has vetoed the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage]] in Northern Ireland since 2015, making Northern Ireland the only region of the UK where same-sex marriage is not permitted,<ref name="SSM">{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage: Proposal wins assembly majority but fails over DUP block|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-34692546|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=BBC News|date=2 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612030648/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-34692546|archive-date=12 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> although provision is now being made under the [[Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-49824575|title=Clock is ticking for NI abortion law|last=Page|first=Chris|date=2019-09-25|access-date=2019-10-21|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208114113/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-49824575|archive-date=8 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Former DUP minister [[Jim Wells (politician)|Jim Wells]] called the issue a [[Red line (phrase)|"red line"]] for power-sharing talks, adding that "Peter will not marry Paul in Northern Ireland".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Northern Ireland's DUP would rather block gay marriage than form a government|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/04/22/northern-irelands-dup-would-rather-block-gay-marriage-than-form-a-government/|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=PinkNews|date=22 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527043455/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/04/22/northern-irelands-dup-would-rather-block-gay-marriage-than-form-a-government/|archive-date=27 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The party attempted to introduce a "conscience clause" into law in Northern Ireland, which would let businesses refuse to provide a service if it went against their religious beliefs.
