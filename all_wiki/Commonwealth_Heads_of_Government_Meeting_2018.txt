The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2018''', also known as '''CHOGM 2018''', was the 25th [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|meeting of the heads of government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It was held in the United Kingdom. The meeting had been planned to have been held by [[Vanuatu]] at the end of 2017, but was moved to the United Kingdom after the impact of [[Cyclone Pam]] on the infrastructure of Vanuatu. The meeting was then postponed to April 2018 due to other international commitments.<ref>{{cite news|title=Britain to host next Commonwealth summit in 2018|url=http://www.globalpost.com/article/6695806/2015/11/28/britain-host-next-commonwealth-summit-2018|accessdate=28 November 2015|work=Global Post|agency=Agence Frace Presse|date=28 November 2015}}</ref>

The position of [[Commonwealth Chair-in-Office]], held by the government leader of the CHOGM host country, was transferred at the summit from the [[Prime Minister of Malta]] to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], who will hold the post until the 26th CHOGM (expected in 2020).<ref name="comm">{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-history#88|website=The Commonwealth|publisher=The Commonwealth|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>

==Agenda==

The theme of the summit was "Towards a Common Future". The British hosts set out four main goals for the summit:<ref name=goal>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-to-call-for-revitalised-commonwealth-at-reception-ahead-of-2018-heads-of-government-meeting|title=PM to call for revitalised Commonwealth at reception ahead of 2018 Heads of Government Meeting – GOV.UK|website=gov.uk}}</ref>

*prosperity: boosting intra-Commonwealth trade and investment
*security: increasing cooperation across security challenges including global terrorism, organised crime and cyber attacks
*fairness: promoting democracy, fundamental freedoms and good governance across the Commonwealth
*sustainability: building the resilience of small and vulnerable states to deal with the effects of [[climate change]] and other global crises

Under consideration were: A [[Commonwealth Blue Charter]] on [[ocean governance]], a Commonwealth connectivity agenda for trade and investment, a declaration on [[cybercrime]], and revised Commonwealth guidelines on election observation in member countries.<ref name="Stan">{{cite news|title=CHOGM summit to begin next week|url=http://wap.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/chogm-summit-to-begin-next-week-118041000726_1.html|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=Business Standard|date=10 April 2018}}</ref><ref name="Ang">{{cite news|title=Anglican Communion to play active role in next week’s Commonwealth leaders’ meeting|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2018/04/anglican-communion-to-play-active-role-in-next-weeks-commonwealth-leaders-meeting.aspx|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=Anglican Communion News Service|date=10 April 2018}}</ref>

===Trade===
This was the first CHOGM held following the [[United Kingdom]]'s decision to [[Brexit|withdraw from the European Union]], a decision which has resulted in calls for Britain to strengthen its economic ties with and play a greater role in the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/commonwealth-and-brexit|title=Brexit and the Commonwealth – The Commonwealth|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|website=thecommonwealth.org}}</ref> The Commonwealth, as of 2018, was responsible for one-tenth of British trade compare to the EU with which the UK currently conducts half of its trade. Intra-Commonwealth trade, overall, is expected to increase by at least 17% to around US$700 billion by 2020.<ref name=afp>{{cite news|title=Britain hoping for Brexit boost from Commonwealth summit|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2018/04/16/britain-hoping-for-brexit-boost-from-commonwealth-summit/|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=Free Malaysia Today|agency=Agence France Presse|date=16 April 2018}}</ref>

The British government reportedly hoped to use the CHOGM to open negotiations for expanded trade with Commonwealth nations to replace lost trade with the EU, however, as the summit began ''[[The Economist]]'' dismissed the belief that the Commonwealth could fill the gap created by [[Brexit]] as “an amiable delusion”.

===Head of the Commonwealth and the Royals===

At a speech welcoming Commonwealth leaders to Buckingham Palace on the first day of the summit, the Queen said "It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949."<ref name=bbcopen>{{cite news|title=Commonwealth meeting: Queen hopes Prince Charles will succeed her|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43820328|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=BBC News|date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

LGBT-rights campaigners from the UK and across the Commonwealth picketed [[Marlborough House]], the headquarters of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], on 19 April in order to draw attention to the issue.<ref>{{cite news | last = Quinn | first = Ben | title = UK rows back on plans to promote gay rights at Commonwealth summit | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/uk-rows-back-on-plans-to-promote-gay-rights-at-commonwealth-summit | work = The Guardian | date = 14 April 2018 |accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> UK Prime Minister Theresa May said in a speech to Commonwealth leaders that she "deeply regrets" Britain's role in having same-sex conduct criminalized in colonial laws that remain in force in many Commonwealth countries, saying of these laws that “They were wrong then and they are wrong now” and that the UK government supports the reform of these laws in former colonies.<ref>{{cite news | last = Jain | first = Sagaree |title= Theresa May ‘Deeply Regrets’ Colonial Anti-LGBT Laws|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/18/theresa-may-deeply-regrets-colonial-anti-lgbt-laws|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Human Rights Watch|date=18 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Crerar | first = Pippa |title= Theresa May says she deeply regrets Britain's legacy of anti-gay laws|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/17/theresa-may-deeply-regrets-britain-legacy-anti-gay-laws-commonwealth-nations-urged-overhaul-legislation|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=The Guardian|date=17 April 2018}}</ref>

===Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance===
The UK promised to spend £61m to combat the pollution of the world's oceans by plastics and announced that it would ban plastic straws, [[microbead]]s, and other waste and to help developing countries curb plastics and other environmental pollutants from contaminating the oceans, and urged other Commonwealth countries to do the same. Five countries have joined the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance: the UK, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu and Ghana.<ref name=bbcopen/><ref>{{cite news|title=Government promises £61m to tackle scourge of ocean plastic pollution with Commonwealth nations|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/theresa-may-commonwealth-plastic-climate-change-ocean-pollution-david-attenborough-blue-planet-a8305721.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|date=15 April 2018|work=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Britain urges Australia and the Commonwealth to tackle plastic waste|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-19/chogm-britain-urges-commonwealth-to-tackle-plastic-waste/9677786|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=ABC News|date=20 April 2018}}</ref>
