'''Germany–Poland relations''' refer to the [[GoodRelations|bilateral relations]] between [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]. These relations have been marked by an extensive and complicated history.<ref name="spiegel.de">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-polish-relations-a-history-of-betrayals-a-489527.html German-Polish Relations: A History Of Betrayals]</ref>

From the 10th century onward, the [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Piast Kingdom of Poland]] established under Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] had close and chequered relations with the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  However, these relations were overshadowed by the centuries-long [[Polish–Teutonic War]]s, as a result of which the Teutonic [[Duchy of Prussia]] became a fief of the Kingdom of Poland. Prussia retained a certain level of autonomy under Polish rule. Later, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] rose and eventually became one of the [[partitions of Poland|partitioners of Poland]] in 1772–1795.

In 1918, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] regained its place on the map. After [[World War I]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] deprived [[German Empire|Germany]] of its territories in [[West Prussia]], [[East Upper Silesia]] and [[Danzig]] (Gdansk) and transferred them all to Poland. It was seen as a great injustice in the [[Weimar Republic]], in part leading to the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933. On 1 September 1939, Poland was [[Invasion of Poland|invaded by Germany]], thus initiating [[World War II]]. The [[Third Reich]] established concentration camps in German-occupied Poland, the biggest located in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. Poland suffered circa 6 million casualties and huge material damages during the war as Germany sought to carry out genocide on its Polish, Jewish and Roma populations.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/05/holocaust-secondworldwar] Guardian The fatal fact of the Nazi-Soviet pact
[[Timothy Snyder]] ''When the Germans shot tens of thousands of Poles in 1944, with the intention of making sure that Warsaw would never rise again, that was genocide, too. Far less dramatic measures, such as the kidnapping and Germanisation of Polish children, were also, by the legal definition, genocide.''</ref> After World War II, Germany lost its [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] to Poland and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1945–1950, [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|a series of expulsions and fleeings]] happened, in which up to 16 million ethnic Germans were forced to leave their homes in Poland and resettle in post-war Germany. It was the largest forced movement of any population in history.

The [[Cold War]] saw good relations between the communist states of [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. Polish-[[West Germany|West German]] relations, on the other hand, remained bad, although they improved after [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]] launched the [[Ostpolitik]]. In 1990, [[Reunification of Germany|Germany reunified]] and it confirmed the Polish-German border on the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in a [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|treaty]]. Both states are now [[European Union]] allies and partners, having an open border and being members of the [[European Single Market]]. The once poor relationship between Poland and Germany has now become a strategic partnership.

==Overview==
A [[Princess Wanda|medieval legend about a Polish Princess Wanda]] shows the German-Polish enmity. In the legend, Princess Wanda rejected to marry Knight Rüdiger, a German ruler. The original chronicle by [[Wincenty Kadłubek]] states German troops refused to fight, Rüdiger committed suicide, and Wanda lived a long life. However, later versions say Rüdiger invaded Poland following Wanda's rejection and she drowned herself in the [[Vistula]] in order to spare Poland further fighting.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OdsCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&dq=Samuel+Gottlieb+Linde&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1850&as_brr=0&cd=33#v=onepage&q=Vandal&f=true Vincent Kadlubek legend of Wanda, who lived in the land of the Wandalen, Vandals, page 56,57]</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Poland960.png|thumb|Poland in 996]]

In the 10th century, the West Slavic [[Polans (western)|Polan]] tribes under the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] prince [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] about 960 were able to establish a sovereign state around [[Poznań]] and [[Gniezno]] in an area later called [[Greater Poland]]. Mieszko's territory included [[Masovia]] beyond the [[Vistula]] river, [[Silesia]] and in 962/63 he first met with the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] forces of Margrave [[Gero]], ruler of the ''[[Marca Geronis]]'' between the [[Saale]] and [[Bóbr]] rivers established in 937 by King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I of Germany]]. During the fight with Germanic duchies Mieszko I in 963 recognized Otto I as Emperor<ref>[[Timothy Reuter|Reuter]], 164. Howorth, 226.</ref> In return for tribute to the newly crowned Emperor, Otto I recognized Mieszko I as ''amicus imperatoris'' ("Friend of the Emperor") and stated that he is ''dux Poloniae'' ("Duke of Poland"). As he could not prevail against Gero, Mieszko I resorted to consolidate his realm: he strengthened the relations with the Bohemian duke [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]] by marrying his daughter [[Dobrawa of Bohemia|Dobrawa]] and converted to [[Christianity]] in 966. The next year however, he once again entangled with the troops of the Saxon renegade [[Wichmann the Younger]], fighting over the island of [[Wolin]] on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast. He also had to defend the Polish border on the lower [[Oder]] river against the forces of Margrave [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark|Odo I of Lusatia]] at the 972 [[Battle of Cedynia]].
[[File:Battle of Tannenberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Battle of Grunwald]] was fought against the [[Teutonic Knights|German Order of Teutonic Knights]], and resulted in a decisive victory for the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]], 15 July 1410.]]

Meanwhile, Poland had to face the claims to universal power raised by Otto I when he had conquered the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope John XII]] in 962. According to the idea of the ''[[translatio imperii]]'', the Emperor would continue the tradition of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Carolingian Empire]] as guardian of the [[Catholic Church]] superior to all secular and ecclesiastical rulers. Mieszko sought to improve the relations with Otto I: he appeared as ''amicus imperatoris'' at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Quedlinburg]] in 973 and in 978 secondly married [[Oda of Haldensleben|Oda]], the daughter of [[Dietrich of Haldensleben]], margrave of the [[Northern March]]. In 984 Mieszko's son [[Bolesław I the Brave]] was married to a daughter of Margrave [[Rikdag|Rikdag of Meissen]]. However, in the same year the Polish ruler, instigated by Duke [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslaus II of Bohemia]], interfered in the conflict between minor King [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III of Germany]] and the deposed Bavarian duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Wrangler]]. He timely switched sides, when he realized that Otto's mother [[Theophanu]] would gain the upper hand and in turn sparked a long-term conflict with the Bohemian dukes over Silesia and Lesser Poland. Mieszko backed the German forces several times against the revolting [[Lutici]] ([[Veleti]]) tribes (though to no avail) and until his death in 992 remained a loyal supporter of the Emperor. Nevertheless, Mieszko precautionally had the ''[[Dagome iudex]]'' document drawn up, whereby he put his realm called [[Civitas Schinesghe]] under the auspices of the [[Holy See]].

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], the Germans expanded eastwards from modern western and central Germany into the less-populated regions, east of [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]] rivers. The area of [[Ostsiedlung|German settlement]] roughly stretched from [[Slovenia]] to [[Estonia]], and southwards into [[Transylvania]]. The phenomenon, known as "Ostsiedlung" ("east settlement", "settlement in the east") followed the territorial expansion of the Holy Roman Empire and the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic Order]]. At various times, Germans were encouraged by Polish [[Piast|Piast rulers]] to settle in the east. Ethnic conflicts erupted between the newly arrived settlers and local populations.<ref>The Germans and the East Charles W. Ingrao, Franz A. J. Szabo, Jan Piskorski Medieval Colonization in Europe, page 31, Purdue University Press,2007</ref> In the 13th century, Poland was suffering from the attacks of [[Old Prussians|Pagan tribes]]. In response, [[Konrad I of Masovia]] hired an army of unemployed crusaders - the [[Teutonic Order]]. After the failure of [[Prussian Crusade|converting the Old Prussians to Christianity]], the Order fell into a series of conflicts with the Polish state. As a result, they took the control of the entire southeastern [[Baltic Sea]] coast. They remained powerful until 1410, when a combined Lithuanian-Polish army was able to win [[Battle of Grunwald|a decisive victory]] over the Teutonic Order at Tannenberg.

===Modern Age===

[[File:Alegoria Umarlej Polski.jpg|thumb|[[Włodzimierz Tetmajer]], ''Allegory of Dead Poland'', St. Nicholas Cathedral, [[Kalisz]]]]
In the 16th century, after the [[Counter-Reformation]] was launched and the [[Thirty Years War]] broke out in the German lands, Poland became a [[Roman Catholic]] stronghold. In 1683, the Polish army commanded by [[King of Poland|Polish king]] [[John III Sobieski]] helped to [[Battle of Vienna|relieve the siege of Vienna]] and along with the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, ended the growing expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] into Europe.

In the second half of the 18th century, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned three times]] between [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The partitions took place in [[First Partition of Poland|1772]], [[Second Partition of Poland|1793]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|1795]]. Under Prussian rule in areas where the Polish population lived alongside Germans a virtual apartheid existed, with bans on the Polish language and religious discrimination, besides attempts to colonize the areas with Germans.<ref>A history of modern Germany, 1800-2000 Martin Kitchen Wiley-Blackwel 2006, page 130)</ref>

===Twentieth Century===

====1918–1939====
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}
After Poland regained independence in 1918, it received parts of what had become German territory as a consequence of the [[partitions of Poland|partitions]]. Much of this territory had been part of Poland in earlier centuries. However, particularly in border regions of [[Upper Silesia]] and [[Greater Poland]], Polish and German nationalists fought over the right to the disputed land. Eventually, Poland won back almost all of the province of Greater Poland and (in 1922) [[German-Polish Accord on East Silesia|the industrialized part of Upper Silesia]].

A [[German–Polish customs war]] began in 1925, but in 1934 [[Nazi Germany]] and Poland signed the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]. A trade agreement followed.

In 1939 [[Nazi Germany]] [[German invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] and partitioned the country together with the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1941 [[Hitler]] launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], attacking the Soviet Union.

In 1943 Stalin demanded at the [[Tehran Conference]] that the post-war territory of Germany and [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|Poland]] be redrawn further west as a buffer between Soviet Union and [[Germany]].

[[Nazi Germany]] killed nearly 6 million Polish citizens,<ref>{{harvp|Materski|Szarota|2009}} ''Quote:'' Liczba Żydów i Polaków żydowskiego pochodzenia, obywateli II Rzeczypospolitej, zamordowanych przez Niemców sięga 2,7- 2,9 mln osób. ''Translation:'' The number of Jewish victims is estimated at 2,9 million. This was about 90% of the 3.3 million Jews living in prewar Poland. ''Source:'' IPN.</ref><ref>{{harvp|Materski|Szarota|2009}} ''Quote:'' Łączne straty śmiertelne ludności polskiej pod okupacją niemiecką oblicza się obecnie na ok. 2 770 000. ''Translation:'' Current estimate is roughly 2,770,000 victims of German occupation. This was 11.3% of the 24.4 million ethnic Poles in prewar Poland.</ref> including Polish academics, doctors, lawyers, nobility, priests and others.

Following the defeat of Germany in 1945, this policy lead to the [[Expulsion of Germans from Poland|expulsion of Germans]] from the territories [[Recovered Territories|assigned to Poland]].

====Cold War (1945–1969)====
During the [[Cold War]], communist Poland had good relations with [[East Germany]], but during the early Cold War, relations with [[West Germany]] were strained.

====Ostpolitik (1970–1989)====
{{main|Ostpolitik}}
The relations between West Germany and Poland improved through [[Willy Brandt]]'s Ostpolitik. West Germany recognized the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as Poland's western border in the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]]. The [[Warschauer Kniefall]] gesture by Chancellor and future [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate Willy Brandt, which took place at the [[Monument to the Ghetto Heroes|Monument to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Heroes]] in 1970, was regarded as a major step in the process of reconciliation between the two countries.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1971/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1971 Presentation Speech] (from the [[Nobel Prize]] website)</ref>

====From the fall of Communism to accession (1989–2004)====
After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]], Poland and the reunited Germany have had a mostly positive but occasionally strained relationship due to some political issues. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Germany has been a proponent of Poland's participation in [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]. During this time, some [[German reparations for World War II#Poland|reparations from World War II were continued to be repaid to Poland]] and that money was distributed through the [[Foundation for Polish-German Reconciliation]], a foundation supported by both governments.

The Polish-German border is 467&nbsp;km long.<ref name="Prez">{{in lang|pl}} [http://www.prezydent.pl/x.node?id=44 Informacje o Polsce - informacje ogólne] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625210208/http://www.prezydent.pl/x.node?id=44 |date=25 June 2009 }}.

====Following Accession to the European Union (2004–)====
[[File:Angela Merkel i Mateusz Morawiecki.JPG|thumb|Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and Prime Minister [[Mateusz Morawiecki]]]]
German–Polish relations are sometimes strained when topics like World War II and the postwar forced expulsion of the German citizens from the territories assigned to Poland are brought up.<ref>Jorunn Sem Fure, Department of History, University of Bergen, [http://www.arena.uio.no/publications/wp97_19.htm "The German-Polish Border Region.

On 24 September 2013 [[Lech Wałęsa]] suggested the creation of a political union between the Republic of Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany; his reason was that the borders in Europe don't matter anymore and in the future they will change anyway.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/10330826/Poland-and-Germany-should-unite-says-Lech-Walesa.html Poland and Germany should unite, says Lech Wałęsa], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''</ref>
