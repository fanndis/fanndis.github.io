==Geological setting==
[[Mud volcano|Mud volcano systems]] are fairly common on Earth, and particularly in the Indonesian province of [[East Java]]. Beneath the island of Java is a [[half-graben]] lying in the east–west direction, filled with over-pressured marine [[carbonate]]s and marine muds.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=AAPG Bulletin |date=May 2006 |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=771–786 |url=http://aapgbull.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/90/5/771 |doi=10.1306/11220505045 |title=Structure and emplacement of mud volcano systems in the South Caspian Basin |author1=Simon A.

Some of the overpressured mud escapes to the surface to form mud volcanoes, which have been observed at [[Sangiran|Sangiran Dome]] near [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central Java and near [[Purwodadi Grobogan|Purwodadi]] city, {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Lusi.

The East Java Basin contains a significant amount of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] reserves, therefore the region is known as a major concession area for mineral exploration. The [[Porong]] subdistrict, 14&nbsp;km south of [[Sidoarjo]] city, is known in the [[Industrial minerals|mineral industry]] as the Brantas Production Sharing Contract (PSC), an area of approximately 7,250&nbsp;km² which consists of three oil and gas fields: Wunut, Carat and Tanggulangin. As of 2006, three companies—[[Santos Limited|Santos]] (18%), [[MedcoEnergi]] (32%) and [[PT Lapindo Brantas]] (50%)—had concession rights for this area; PT Lapindo Brantas acted as an operator.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Santos Ltd. |url=http://www.santos.com/Content.aspx?p=290 |work=Our Activities |title=Brantas |accessdate=2007-03-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101115255/http://www.santos.com/Content.aspx?p=290 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-01}}</ref>

==Mud eruption chronology==
On May 28, 2006, PT Lapindo Brantas targeted gas in the Kujung Formation carbonates in the Brantas PSC area by drilling a [[borehole]] named the 'Banjar-Panji&nbsp;1 exploration well'. In the first stage of drilling the [[drill string]] first went through a thick [[clay|clay seam]] (500&ndash;1,300&nbsp;m deep), then through sands, shales, [[volcanic ash|volcanic debris]] and finally into permeable [[carbonate rock]]s.<ref name="noorden2006"/> The Banjar Panji-1 borehole was cased down to 1,091&nbsp;m (3,579&nbsp;ft). At 5:00&nbsp;a.m. local time ([[UTC+7]]) on the 29th of May 2006, after the well had reached a total depth of 2,834&nbsp;m (9,298&nbsp;ft), this time without a protective casing, after which water, steam and a small amount of gas erupted at a location about 200&nbsp;m southwest of the well.<ref name="davies2007">{{cite journal |journal=GSA Today |page=4 |title=Birth of a mud volcano: East Java, May 29, 2006 |author=Richard J.

A day later the well suffered a ‘kick’, an influx of formation fluid into the well bore. The kick was reported by Lapindo Brantas drilling engineers as having been killed within three hours,<ref name="Sawolo2009" /> though alternative interpretations of drilling records, specifically ongoing fluctuations in downhole drillpipe pressure, indicate that the kick continued for at least 24 hours.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Early the next day, on 29 May 2006, steam, water and mud began erupting up to {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}} above the well, a phenomenon that is now known as the Lusi mud volcano.

== Hypotheses on the possible causes ==
The birth of Lusi was a major disaster for the population living nearby, with loss of their houses, properties and their livelihood.<ref name="PBS">https://www.pbs.org/video/grit-9b9uzj/</ref> For the scientific community, however, it was a chance to study the evolving geological process of a mud volcano. In the past, mud vulcanologists could only study existing or ancient mud volcanoes during dormant periods. Thus, Lusi is a rare occasion and a unique opportunity to conduct scientific experiments to further our understanding. It also offers opportunities to study the down hole condition of a mud volcano from the neighboring Banjar-Panji exploration well lithologies.

To explain what triggered the mud volcano, three hypotheses have been suggested, though none has won universal support:

* Drilling-induced fracturing or fault reactivation (reflecting a man-made event)
* Earthquake-triggered fault reactivation (reflecting a natural event)
* Geothermal processes (reflecting geothermal heating)

=== Drilling-induced fracturing, hence a man-made event ===
From a model developed by geologists working in the [[UK]],<ref name="davies2007"/> the drilling pipe penetrated the overpressured [[limestone]], causing [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrainment]] of mud by water. Whilst pulling the drill string out of the well, there were ongoing losses of drilling mud, as demonstrated by the daily drilling reports stating "overpull increasing", "only 50% returns" and "unable to keep hole full".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The loss of drilling mud and associated drop in downhole mud weight eventually resulted in a drilling kick, with over 365 barrels of fluid erupting at the Banjar Panji-1 wellhead.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Blowout preventers were closed to help kill the kick, which resulted in a spike in downhole pressure within the wellbore.<ref name="Sawolo2009" /><ref name=":1" /> The drilling-induced triggering model proposes that the increase in pressure within the wellbore was sufficiently high to induce a large hydraulic fracture in the formation.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> The extra pressure caused the hydraulic fractures to propagate 1–2&nbsp;km to the surface and emerged 200&nbsp;m away from the well. The lack of protective casing in the bottom 1742m of the borehole is considered a key reason why the drilling kick could not be controlled and why pressures during the kick were high enough to initiate hydraulic fracturing.<ref name="davies2007" /><ref name=":2" /> Alternatively, it has also been suggested that the increased fluid pressure in the borehole, due to the kick, may have triggered reactivation of a nearby fault system, rather than hydraulic fracturing (in a similar manner to how fluid injection can induce seismicity).<ref name=":3" /> Though steel casing is used to protect the well bore in oil or gas exploration, this can only be applied in stages after each new section of the hole is drilled; see [[Drilling for Oil|drilling for oil]].

The relatively small distance, around {{convert|600|ft|m|sp=us}}, between the Lusi mud volcano and the well being drilled by Lapindo (the Banjarpanji well) may not be a coincidence, as less than a day before the start of the mud flow the well suffered a [[Blowout (well drilling)#Formation kick|kick]]. Their analysis suggests that the well has a low resistance to a kick.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |journal=Geology |title=Triggering of the Lusi Mud Eruption: Earthquake Versus Drilling Initiation |author=Tingay, M.R.P., Heidbach, O., Davies, R., Swarbrick, R. |year=2008 |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=639–642 |doi=10.1130/G24697A.1|bibcode=2008Geo....36..639T |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9d5eaa41a9e6935a5698cd509b86b3d591045f3 }}</ref> Similarly, a NE-SW crack in the surface in the drill site may be evidence of an underground blowout. The well may have suffered an underground blowout that resulted in a surface breach.

=== Earthquake-induced fault reactivation, hence a natural event ===
The relatively close timing of the Yogyakarta earthquake, the problems of mud loss and kick in the well and the birth of the mud volcano continue to interest geoscientists. Was the mud volcano due to the same seismic event that triggered the earthquake? Geoscientists from Norway, Russia, France and Indonesia have suggested that the shaking caused by the Yogyakarta earthquake may have induced liquefaction of the underlying Kalibeng clay layer, releasing gases and causing a pressure change large enough to reactivate a major fault nearby (the Watukosek fault), creating a mud flow path that caused Lusi.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{cite journal |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |title=Triggering and dynamic evolution of the LUSI mud volcano, Indonesia |author=Mazzini, A., Svensen, H., Akhmanov, G.G., Aloisi, G., Planke, S., Malthe-Sorenssen, A., Istadi, B. |year=2007 |volume=261 |issue=3–4 |pages=375–388 |bibcode = 2007E&PSL.261..375M |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.001}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{cite journal |journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology |title=Strike-slip faulting as a trigger mechanism for overpressure release through piercement structures.

They have identified more than 10 naturally triggered mud volcanoes in the East Java province, with at least five near the Watukosek fault system, confirming that the region is prone to mud volcanism. They also showed that surface cracks surrounding Lusi predominantly run NE-SW, the direction of the Watukosek fault. Increased seep activity in the mud volcanoes along the Watukosek fault coincided with the May 27, 2006 seismic event. A major fault system may have been reactivated, resulting in the formation of a mud volcano.

=== Geothermal process ===
Lusi is near the arc of volcanoes in Indonesia where geothermal activities are abundant. The nearest volcano, the [[Arjuno-Welirang]] complex, is less than 15&nbsp;km away. The hot mud suggests that some form of geothermal heating from the nearby magmatic volcano may have been involved.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=In: Proceedings of the International Geological Workshop on Sidoarjo Mud Volcano, Jakarta, IAGI-BPPT- LIPI, February 20–21, 2007.

===Cause===
[[Image:SidoarjoMudFlowSource.JPG|upright=1.5|Mudflow, photo taken on July 21, 2006|thumb]]
There was controversy as to what triggered the eruption and whether the event was a natural disaster or not. According to PT Lapindo Brantas it was the [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake]] that triggered the mud flow eruption, and not their drilling activities.<ref name="holm">{{cite news |title=Muckraking in Java's gas fields |author=Chris Holm |date=14 July 2006 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HG14Ae01.html |accessdate=2007-03-05 |publisher=Asia Times Online}}</ref>
Two days before the mud eruption, an earthquake of [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] 6.3 hit the south coast of [[Central Java]] and [[Yogyakarta]] provinces killing 6,234&nbsp;people and leaving 1.5&nbsp;million homeless. At a hearing before the [[People's Representative Council|parliamentary]] members, senior executives of PT Lapindo Brantas argued that the earthquake was so powerful that it had reactivated previously in [[active fault]]s and also creating deep underground fractures, allowing the mud to breach the surface, and that their company presence was coincidental, which should exempt them from paying compensation damage to the victims.<ref name="holm"/> If the cause of the incident is determined to be natural, then the [[government of Indonesia]] has the responsibility to cover the damage instead. This argument was also recurrently echoed by [[Aburizal Bakrie]], the Indonesian Minister of Welfare at that time, whose family firm controls the operator company PT Lapindo Brantas.<ref>{{cite news |title=Drilling blamed for Java mud leak |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2007-03-05 |date=24 January 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6293757.stm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=oilRpt&storyID=2007-01-17T125125Z_01_JAK242260_RTRIDST_0_INDONESIA-MUD.XML&pageNumber=0&imageid=&cap=&sz=13&WTModLoc=InvArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |publisher=Reuters |title=Indonesia minister says Java mudflow natural disaster |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=2007-03-05 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

However the UK team of geologists downplayed Lapindo's argument and concluded ''"...that the earthquake that occurred two days earlier is coincidental."''<ref name="davies2007"/> While it could have generated a new fracture system and weakened strata surrounding the Banjar-Panji&nbsp;1 well, it could not have been the cause of the formation of the hydraulic fracture that created the main vent {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} away from the borehole. Additionally there was no other mud volcano reported on Java after the earthquake and the main drilling site is {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} away from the earthquake's [[epicenter]]. The intensity of the earthquake at the drilling site was estimated to have been only magnitude 2 on Richter scale, the same effect as a heavy truck passing over the area.<ref name="noorden2006"/>

In June 2008, a report released by British, American, Indonesian, and Australian scientists,<ref>{{cite web|last=Whitelaw |first=Claire |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2008/06/09_lusi.shtml |title=06.09.2008 - Javan mud volcano triggered by drilling, not quake |publisher=Berkeley.edu |date=2008-06-09 |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref> concluded that the volcano was not a natural disaster, but the result of oil and gas drilling.<ref name="NASA"/>

===Legal case===

On June 5, 2006, MedcoEnergi (one partner company in the Brantas PSC area) sent a letter to PT Lapindo Brantas accusing them of breaching safety procedures during the drilling process.<ref name="holm"/> The letter further attributes "gross negligence" to the operator company for not equipping the well bore with steel safety encasing.

After investigations by independent experts, police had concluded the mud flow was an "underground [[Blowout (well drilling)|blow out]]", triggered by the drilling activity. It is further noted that steel encasing lining had not been used which could have prevented the disaster. Thirteen Lapindo Brantas' executives and engineers face twelve charges of violating Indonesian laws.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1881051.htm |title=Mining firm blamed for mud flooding: report |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-10 |publisher=ABC News Online}}</ref>

As of October 30, 2008, the mud flow was still ongoing at a rate of {{convert|100000|m3|cuyd|sp=us}} per day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.physorg.com/news144596883.html |title=Geologists Blame Gas Drilling for Indonesia Mud Disaster |publisher=Physorg |date=October 30, 2008}}</ref> By mid August 2011, mud was being discharged at a rate of 10,000 m<sup>3</sup> per day, with 15 bubbles around its gushing point.

One study found that the mud volcano was collapsing under its own weight, possibly beginning [[caldera]] formation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jEbdX6_pFakYzsR16PHho3vvu1PQ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531050547/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jEbdX6_pFakYzsR16PHho3vvu1PQ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 31, 2008 |title=Study finds Indonesia 'mud volcano' collapsing |publisher=AFP |date=May 28, 2008 }}</ref> The researchers said the subsidence data could help determine how much of the local area will be affected by Lusi. Their research used GPS and satellite data recorded between June 2006 and September 2007 that showed the area affected by Lusi had subsided by between {{convert|0.5|and|14.5|m|ft|sp=us}} per year. The scientists found that if Lusi continued to erupt for three to 10&nbsp;years at the constant rates measured during 2007 then the central part of the volcano could subside by between {{convert|44|and|146|m|abbr=on}}. They proposed that the subsidence was due to the weight of mud and collapse of rock strata due to the excavation of mud from beneath the surface. Their study also found that while some parts of Sidoarjo were subsiding, others were rising suggesting that the Watukosek fault system had been reactivated because of the eruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/MediaAlerts/2008/2008052826906.html |title=World's fastest-growing mud volcano is collapsing, says new research|date=2019-01-26}}</ref>

A study by a group of Indonesian geo-scientists led by Bambang Istadi predicted the area affected by the mudflow over a ten-year period.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Marine and Petroleum Geology |title=Simulation on growth and potential Geohazard of East Java Mud Volcano, Indonesia |author=Istadi, B., Pramono, G.H., Sumintadireja, P., Alam, S. |year=2009 |volume= 26 |issue=9 |pages=1724–1739 |doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2009.03.006}}</ref> The model simulated the mud flow and its likely outcome in order to find safe locations to relocate people and affected infrastructures.

After new hot gas flows began to appear, workers started relocating families and some were injured in the process. The workers were taken to a local hospital to undergo treatment for severe burns. In Siring Barat, 319 more families were displaced and in Kelurahan Jatirejo, 262 new families were expected to be affected by the new flows of gas. Protesting families took to the streets demanding compensation which in turn added more delays to the already stressed detour road for Jalan Raya Porong and the Porong-Gempol toll road.

The Indonesian government has stated that their heart is with the people.  However the cabinet meeting on how to disburse compensation has been delayed until further notice. A local official Saiful Ilah signed a statement announcing that, ''"The government is going to defend the people of Siring."'' Following this announcement protests came to an end and traffic flow returned to normal an hour later.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tiga Pekerja Terbakar, Warga Tutup Raya Porong |publisher=Jawa Pos |page=16 |date=May 25, 2008}}</ref>

==== Stakeholder exit ====
The Australian oil and gas company [[Santos Limited]] was a minority partner in the venture until 2008. In December 2008, the company sold its 18% stake in the project to Minarak Labuan, the owner of Lapindo Brantas Inc. Labuan also received a payment from Santos of $US22.5 million ($A33.9 million) "to support long-term mud management efforts". The amount was covered by existing provision for costs relating to the incident. Santos had provisioned for $US79 million ($A119.3 million) in costs associated with the disaster. Santos had stated in June 2006 that it maintained "appropriate insurance coverage for these types of occurrences".<ref>[http://www.industrysearch.com.au/Mud-disaster-Santos-no-more-liable-sells-project-stake/n/36045 "Mud disaster- Santos no more liable, sells project stake"] ''Industryseach.com.au ''2008-12-12.

===== 2010 =====
New mudflows spots begun in April 2010, this time on Porong Highway, which is the main road linking [[Surabaya]] with [[Probolinggo]] and islands to the east including [[Bali]], despite roadway thickening and strengthening. A new highway is planned to replace this one however are held up by land acquisition issues. The main railway also runs by the area, which is in danger of explosions due to seepage of methane and ignition could come from something as simple as a tossed cigarette.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/latest-mudflow-bubble-on-sidoarjo-roadway-raises-fears-of-explosion/370173 |title=Latest Mudflow Bubble on Sidoarjo Roadway Raises Fears of Explosion |publisher=The Jakarta Globe |accessdate=2013-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224060806/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/latest-mudflow-bubble-on-sidoarjo-roadway-raises-fears-of-explosion/370173 |archive-date=2012-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As of June 2009, the residents had received less than 20% of the suggested compensation. By mid-2010, reimbursement payments for victims had not been fully settled, and legal action against the company had stalled. It is worth mentioning that the owner of the energy company, [[Aburizal Bakrie]] was the Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare at the time of the disaster, and is currently the chairman of ''[[Golkar]]'', one of the most influential political parties in Indonesia.

===== 2011 =====
In 2011, Lapindo Brantas published an independent Social Impact Report.<ref>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46497355/lapindo/Lapindo-LUSI-Report.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The Sidojaro mud is rich in rock salt ([[halite]]) and has provided a source of income for the local residents who have been harvesting the salt for sale at the local market.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===== 2013 =====
In late 2013, international scientists who had been monitoring the situation were reported as saying that the eruption of mud at Sidoardjo was falling away quite rapidly and that the indications were that the eruption might cease by perhaps 2017, much earlier than previously estimated. The scientists noted that the system was losing pressure quite rapidly and had begun pulsing rather than maintaining a steady flow. The pulsing pattern, it was believed, was a clear sign that the geological forces driving the eruption were subsiding.<ref>Jonathon Amos, '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25188259 Mud volcano to stop "by decade's end"'], ''BBC News Science and Environment'', 13 December 2013.</ref>

=== Revived controversy ===
Out of the three hypotheses on the cause of the Lusi mud volcano, the hydro fracturing hypothesis appeared to be the one most debated. On 23 October 2008 a public relations agency in London, acting for one of the oil well's owners, started to widely publicise what it described as "new facts" on the origin of the mud volcano, which were subsequently presented at an [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]] conference in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] on 28 October 2008 (see next section).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The assertion of the geologists and drillers from Energi Mega Persada was that ''"At a recent Geological Society of London Conference, we provided authoritative new facts that make it absolutely clear that drilling could not have been the trigger of LUSI."'' Other verbal reports of the conference in question indicated that the assertion was by no means accepted uncritically, and that when the novel data is published, it is certain to be [[Scrutiny|scrutinized]] closely.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In 2009, this well data was finally released and published in the Journal of Marine and Petroleum Geology for the scientific community uses by the geologists and drillers from Energi Mega Persada.<ref name="Sawolo2009"/> It is a common practice in the oil and gas industry to closely guard their drilling and geologic information, and the company involved is no exception. After such release, however, future scientific research on Lusi should have access to a set of credible data and not be as constraint as early authors were with their limited and questionable quality of data to back their claims.

After hearing the (revised) arguments from both sides for the cause of the mud volcano at the American Association of Petroleum Geologists International Convention in Cape Town in October 2008, the vast majority of the conference session audience present (consisting of AAPG oil and gas professionals) voted in favor of the view that the Lusi (Sidoarjo) mudflow had been induced by drilling. On the basis of the arguments presented, 42 out of the 74 scientists came to the conclusion that drilling was entirely responsible, while 13 felt that a combination of drilling and earthquake activity was to blame. Only 3 thought that the earthquake was solely responsible, and 16 geoscientists believed that the evidence was inconclusive.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morgan |first=James |title=Mud eruption 'caused by drilling' |work=News Article |publisher=BBC News |date=1 November 2008 |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7699672.stm |accessdate=1 November 2008 }}</ref>

The report of the debate and its outcomes was published in AAPG Explorer Magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aapg.org/explorer/2008/12dec/mud.cfm |title=Mud Volcano Cause Discussed 12:2008 EXPLORER |publisher=Aapg.org |date=2006-05-29 |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref> The article stated that the voting process was a decision by the moderator and only reflected opinions of a group of individuals in the session room at that time and in no way endorsed by the association. It further cautioned readers not to consider the voting result in any way as a scientific validation.

On the possible trigger of Lusi mud volcano, a group of geologists and drilling engineers from the oil company countered the hydro fracturing hypothesis.<ref name="Sawolo2009"/> They suggested that analysis based on the well data showed that the well was safe and pressure in the well bore was below the critical pressure. It is therefore unlikely that the well was fractured as charged. Their paper also published data and well information for the first time to the scientific communities as opinions and technical papers up to that time lacked accurate well data and were forced to rely on a number of assumptions.However, subsequent studies have refuted the claims made in this paper, and have highlighted that a number of claims made in this study are directly contradicted by the oil company's own well-site reports and documents.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":6" />

In February 2010, a group led by experts from [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] [[Durham University]] said the new clues bolstered suspicions the catastrophe was caused by human error. In journal Marine and Petroleum Geology, Professor Richard Davies, of the [[Centre for Research into Earth Energy Systems (CeREES)]], said that drillers, looking for [[natural gas|gas]] nearby, had made a series of mistakes. They had overestimated the pressure the well could tolerate, and had not placed protective casing around a section of open well. Then, after failing to find any gas, they hauled the [[drill]] out while the hole was extremely unstable. By withdrawing the drill, they exposed the wellhole to a "kick" from [[pressure|pressurized]] water and gas from surrounding [[rock formation]]s. The result was a [[volcano]]-like inflow that the drillers tried in vain to stop.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Human error to blame for Indonesia's mud volcano: scientists |newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jtvT9FIv-X9he7cJkscTCwO6g1JQ |accessdate=2010-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Madrigal |first=Alexis |title=Mud Volcano Was Man-Made, New Evidence Confirms |newspaper=Wired Science |date=2010-02-10 |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/02/mudvolcano/ |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>

In the same Marine and Petroleum Geology journal, the group of geologists and drilling engineers refuted the allegation showing that the "kick" maximum pressure were too low to fracture the rock formation.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal |journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology |pages=1658–1675 |title=Was LUSI caused by drilling? – Authors reply to discussion |author=Sawolo, N., Sutriono, E., Istadi, B., Darmoyo, A.B. |year=2010 |volume=27 |issue=7 |doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2010.01.018}}</ref> The well pressure analysis based on credible data showed that the well is stronger than the maximum pressure exerted on the well. This implied that the hydro fracturing hypothesis is likely to be incorrect. They further stated that the model developed by Prof. Davies is much too simplistic by not considering all the available dataset and information in its analysis.

The 2010 technical paper in this series of debate presents the first balanced overview on the anatomy of the Lusi mud volcanic system with particular emphasis on the critical uncertainties and their influence on the disaster.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal |journal=In: ASEG 2010, Sydney, Australia |volume=2009 |pages=NH51A–1051 |title=Anatomy of the 'Lusi' Mud Eruption, East Java |author=Tingay, M.R.P. |year=2010|bibcode=2009AGUFMNH51A1051T }}</ref> It showed the differences in the two hypotheses, the source of water and the current understanding on the subsurface geology below the mud volcano. More geological field studies and analysis based on factual data need to be done before any conclusion can be deduced on what actually caused Lusi mud volcano.

In February 2015, Tingay<ref name=":0" /> compiled a new and detailed chronology of the drilling of the Banjar Panji-1 well and the first days of the Sidoarjo mudflow. This chronology is built from daily drilling reports and well-site reports and is the first to highlight and document the numerous inconsistencies between papers and reports. The new chronology<ref name=":0" /> highlights that a number of key claims made by Lapindo Brantas are contradicted by their own daily drilling and well-site reports (that are included as an appendix in<ref name="Sawolo2009" />). These include the claims that losses occurred seven minutes after the earthquake (when drilling data actually suggests losses preceded the earthquake); that losses at total depth occurred immediately after major aftershocks (whereas total losses occurred over 1.5 hours after any aftershocks); that losses at total depth were cured (whereas there are multiple reports of ongoing losses over an 18-hour period whilst pulling out of hole); that the drilling kick was killed within 3 hours (whereas drill pipe pressures fluctuate repeatedly for 24 hours after kick, indicating ongoing cycles of downhole influx and losses); that there is no evidence for downhole losses (that would indicate fracturing or fault reactivation) during the drilling kick (yet mud engineer reports state that over 300 barrels of drilling mud was lost downhole during the kick) and; that there was no connection between the mud flow and wellbore (yet the daily drilling reports state that mud flow activity noticeably decreased when dense drilling mud was pumped down the well during attempts to stop the mudflow).<ref name="Sawolo2009" /><ref name=":0" />

In July 2013, Lupi et al. proposed that the Lusi mud eruption was the result of a natural event, triggered by a distant earthquake at [[Yogyakarta]] two days before. As a result, seimic waves were geometrically focused at the Lusi site leading to mud and CO<sub>2</sub> generation and a reactivation of the local Watukosek Fault. According to their hypothesis the fault is linked to a deep hydrothermal system that feeds the eruption.<ref name=":7">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lupi M, Saenger EH, Fuchs F, Miller SA |title=Lusi mud eruption triggered by geometric focusing of seismic waves |journal=Nature Geoscience |doi=10.1038/ngeo1884 |date=July 21, 2013 |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=642–646|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..642L }}</ref>  However, this hypothesis has been heavily criticized due to the original models containing a major error. The original study proposed that a “high velocity layer” focussed earthquake waves, amplifying the effect of the earthquake.<ref name=":7" /> However, the “high velocity layer” has since been demonstrated to be a non-existent artefact caused by velocity measurements of the steel casing in the Banjar Panji-1 well, which resulted in the original models assuming that a ‘layer of steel’ existed underground.<ref name=":7" /> Lupi et al. have acknowledged this error, but argue in a corrigendum that it makes no difference to their results, as they have proposed in a new velocity model, arguing for the existence of a different high velocity layer at the same depth.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|title = Corrigendum: Lusi mud eruption triggered by geometric focusing of seismic waves|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2014-09-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 687–688|volume = 7|issue = 9|doi = 10.1038/ngeo2239|first = M.|last = Lupi|first2 = E.
