{{Further|Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program}}

=== Early 20th century (1911–1949) ===

Tsinghua University was established in Beijing, during a tumultuous period of national upheaval and conflicts with foreign powers which culminated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]], an uprising against foreign influence in China. After the suppression of the revolt by [[Eight-Nation Alliance|a foreign alliance]] including the United States, the ruling Qing dynasty was required to pay indemnities to alliance members. US Secretary of State [[John Hay]] suggested that the US$30 million Boxer indemnity allotted to the United States was excessive. After much negotiation with Qing ambassador [[Liang Cheng]], US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] obtained approval from the United States Congress in 1909 to reduce the indemnity payment by US$10.8 million, on the condition that the funds would be used as scholarships for Chinese students to study in the United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Using this fund, the '''Tsinghua College''' ({{zh|labels=no |t=清華學堂 |p=Qīnghuá Xuétáng}}) was established in Beijing, on 29 April 1911 on the site of a [[Tsinghua Park|former royal garden]] to serve as a preparatory school for students the government planned to send to the United States.<ref>{{Cite book |title=University autonomy, the state, and social change in China |last=Su-Yan Pan |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-962-209-936-4 |page=68}}</ref> Faculty members for sciences were recruited by the [[YMCA]] from the United States, and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} The motto of Tsinghua, ''Self-Discipline and Social Commitment'', was derived from a 1914 speech by prominent scholar and faculty member [[Liang Qichao]], in which he quoted the [[I Ching]] to describe a notion of the ideal gentleman.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/9350/2015/20150128170309534478371/20150128170309534478371_.html |title=Tsinghua Motto: Carved on every Tsinghua People |website=Tsinghua University |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109021501/http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/9350/2015/20150128170309534478371/20150128170309534478371_.html |archive-date=9 November 2016 |access-date=8 November 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], many Chinese universities were forced to evacuate their campuses to avoid the Japanese invasion. In 1937, Tsinghua University, along with [[Peking University]] and [[Nankai University]], merged to form the Changsha Temporary University in [[Changsha]], which later became the [[National Southwestern Associated University]] in [[Kunming]], [[Yunnan]] province.

===Admissions===
Admission to Tsinghua for both undergraduate and graduate schools is extremely competitive. Undergraduate admissions for domestic students is decided through the [[National Higher Education Entrance Examination|gaokao]], the Chinese national college entrance exam, which allows students to list Tsinghua University among their preferred college choices. While selectivity varies by province, the sheer number of high school students applying for college each year has resulted in overall acceptance rates far lower than 0.1% of all test takers.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/06/chinas-unfair-college-admissions-system/276995/ |title=China's Unfair College Admissions System |last=Fu |first=Yiqin |date=2013-06-19 |work=The Atlantic |access-date=2018-06-29 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Tsinghua University commands a very high rate of matriculation for accepted undergraduates. According to a report in 2008, 215 out of 300 students who placed within the top 10 in the 30 tested provinces and regions chose Tsinghua as their first choice school, and 21 out of the 30 top scorers in each province and region chose the university.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/admissions.jsp?boardid=34&bid2=34&pageno=1 |title=Programs and Degrees |publisher=Tsinghua.edu.cn |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401093200/http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/admissions.jsp?boardid=34&bid2=34&pageno=1 |archive-date=1 April 2012 |access-date=22 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2020}}

===Research===
Research at Tsinghua University is mainly supported by government funding from national programs and special projects. In the areas of science and technology, funding from these sources totals over 20 billion yuan, which subsidizes more than 1,400 projects every year conducted by the university. With the prospective increase of state investment in science and technology, research at Tsinghua is projected to receive more financial support from the state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/then/5984/index.html |title=Tsinghua University |publisher=Tsinghua.edu.cn |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403151309/http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/then/5984/index.html |archive-date=3 April 2014 |access-date=22 April 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== School of Law ===
The legal studies at Tsinghua University can be dated back to the "Tsinghua College" era (1911-1929), where many students were sent to universities in western countries for legal studies. Graduating from institutions such as [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], those Tsinghua alumni have played an important role in areas of law and diplomacy. Famous legal scholars Tuan-Sheng Ch'ien, Yan Shutang (燕树棠), Wang Huacheng (王化成), [[K. C. Hsiao|Kung Chuan Hsiao]] (萧公权), Pu Xuefeng (浦薛凤), Mei Ju'ao (梅汝璈), Xiang Zhejun (向哲浚) and diplomat Tang Yueliang (唐悦良)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/law/6878/2011/20110323105215091140390/20110323105215091140390_.html |website=Tsinghua.edu.cn |script-title=zh:清华大学法学院 |access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref> are all graduates from Tsinghua College or went to study abroad after passing exams in Tsinghua College.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Tsinghua University School of Law was established in 1929 after Tsinghua College was renamed Tsinghua University. Legal education in Tsinghua University at the time focused on international affairs and Chinese legal studies. Courses on political science and economics could also be found on students' curriculum. Before the Japanese army invaded Beijing in 1937, the School of Law developed greatly. Many Chinese legal scholars graduated during that era, including Wang Tieya (王铁崖), Gong Xiangrui (龚祥瑞) and Lou Bangyan (楼邦彦).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/law/6878/2011/20110317100631037535966/20110317100631037535966_.html |website=Tsinghua.edu.cn |script-title=zh:清华大学法学院 |access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref>

In 1952, in response to the government policy of turning Tsinghua University into an engineering-focused university, the law school was dismissed; the faculty were appointed to other universities, including Peking University and Peking College of Political Science and Law (the predecessor of China University of Political Science and Law).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/law/3240/index.html |website=Tsinghua.edu.cn |script-title=zh:清华大学法学院 |access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref> Until 1995, there was no formal "school of law" at Tsinghua University, yet courses on the law were still taught in Tsinghua University.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

On September 8, 1995, the Tsinghua University Department of Law was formally re-established; on April 25, 1999, the 88th anniversary of Tsinghua University, the university formally changed the Department into the "School of Law". The "new" law school inherited the spirit of the "old" law school and has endeavored to add international factors to its students' curriculum. Due to its outstanding faculty members and students, the Tsinghua University School of Law has risen to become one of the leading law schools in China and since 2012,{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} has been consistently ranked as the best or the second-best law school in mainland China by QS World University Rankings.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2017/law-legal-studies |title=Law |date=2 March 2017 |website=Topuniversities.com |access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref>
