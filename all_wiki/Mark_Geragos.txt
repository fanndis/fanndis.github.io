The case was retried in the fall of 2009 by Pat Harris, an associate at Geragos's firm. The second trial also ended with a [[hung jury]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesocal.com/crime&courts/2009/10/post-18.html |title=BREAKING NEWS: Jurors deadlocked in Cameron Brown case – Crime & Courts |last=Altman |first=Larry |date=2009-10-05 |publisher=Insidesocal.com |accessdate=2012-02-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324045108/http://www.insidesocal.com/crime%26courts/2009/10/post-18.html |archive-date=2012-03-24 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailybulletin.com/2010/07/16/geragos-turns-cameron-brown-case-over-to-new-lawyer/}}</ref>A third trial saw him convicted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cameron Brown sentenced to life in prison for tossing daughter to death off Rancho Palos Verdes cliff

While Geragos typically never leaves a client after a hung jury, him and his firm had to leave the case due to economic hardships. 
* [[Victor Willis]] – In September 2006, Geragos represented the [[Village People]] front man on charges of drug and weapons possession.  Facing jail time, Geragos successfully negotiated a sentence of three years probation and treatment for drug addiction at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coté |first1=John |last2=Writer |first2=Chronicle Staff |title=Ex-Village People singer gets probation on drug charges |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ex-Village-People-singer-gets-probation-on-drug-2470077.php |website=SFGate |date=5 September 2006}}</ref>
* Amphit Dhaliwal and Kulbir Dhaliwal – In December 2007, the two survivors of the [[San Francisco Zoo tiger attacks|tiger attack]] at the [[San Francisco Zoo]], hired Geragos to represent them against potential criminal charges, and also with the anticipation of filing a lawsuit against the zoo. Despite pressure from city officials, the local police inspector made it clear that there were no grounds for filing criminal charges against the Dhaliwal brothers related to the tiger attack. Geragos filed a federal suit against the Zoo and the City of San Francisco for violation of the Dhaliwal brothers' [[civil rights]], including the Dhaliwals' being subject to search and seizure without [[probable cause]], and for [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]]. Geragos settled the civil suit in the early phase of the court process for $900,000.
* [[Kazuyoshi Miura (businessman)|Kazuyoshi Miura]] – In 2008, he joined the defense of Japanese businessman Miura, who [[suicide in Japan|committed suicide]] before his trial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hnSRL8Lx20b2_RNNBngIYdZvn8yg|title=Japanese businessman accused of conspiring to have wife murdered found dead|publisher=The Canadian Press|date=2008-10-11|accessdate=2008-10-11}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref>
* [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] – Geragos represented Brown, who pleaded guilty to the assault of his then-girlfriend, [[Rihanna]]. On February 8, 2009 Geragos brought [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] to surrender to the [[LAPD]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Later, Brown was arrested, and his court date was set to be on March 5, 2009. Geragos and Brown attended the court date, but did not plea and asked for [[arraignment]] until the next court date, April 6, 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to one count of [[felony assault]] and was sentenced to 5 years' probation and 6 months' [[community service]]. However, Brown’s inability to adhere to the rules of his probation – ultimately led to his dismissal from rehab and the singer was thrown in jail from March 2014 to June of that year. Under counsel from Geragos, Brown was once again released under probation. Early in 2015, Brown's probation was revoked after he was present in two nightclubs where shootings took place. His probation officer had a problem with the singer traveling to San Jose, to perform at the nightclub where an incident occurred leaving five people shot and injured. Brown was aware his probation could end with the hearing, and before entering the courthouse, he tweeted: “Hopefully this is my last day in court…. Pray for me.” However, at Brown’s scheduled March 20th court date, with the help of Geragos, Brown’s probation officer reversed course, saying in a positive review that Brown had completed his community service sentence. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James R. Brandlin concurred, ruling the singer would no longer be under the watchful eye of the judicial system. Geragos said this of his client, “He is in a spot right now and a place right now that I couldn’t be prouder of him,” adding that the end of Brown’s probation is “a monumental feat for him.”
* [[Colin Kaepernick]] - Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first filed a grievance against the NFL in October 2017, claiming that the NFL tried to keep him from playing after he chose to kneel during the national anthem. The quarterback opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March of the same year and was not picked up later in free agency. Kaepernick began kneeling during the 2016 season to protest racial inequality and police brutality. Safety Eric Reid and several other NFL players eventually joined him. Reid, a former teammate of Kaepernick's, was also a member of the grievance Kaepernick filed. After several months of ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL, both Kaepernick and Reid withdrew their collusion cases against the National Football League. On Feb. 15, both Geragos and co-counsel Ben Meiselas released a joint statement with the NFL, declaring the resolution of the matter was subject to a confidentiality agreement. 
* [[Jussie Smollett]] –  Geragos represented Smollett in the 2019 alleged false police report. On March 12, 2019, it was reported that Chicago prosecutors had dropped all 16 criminal charges against EMPIRE star Jussie Smollett as part of a deferred prosecution agreement against him. As part of the conditions of the deal, Smollett did 16 hours of community service and forfeited his $10,000 bond to the city. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he wanted Jussie Smollett to cover the cost –amounting to $130,000– for the Chicago police department’s investigation. Smollett’s attorneys responded in a statement via NBC News that “Jussie has paid enough.” Geragos and his firm also filed a motion to seal the case, which was granted by a judge. On April 23, 2019, Geragos was sued, along with Tina Glandian (another member of Smollett's legal team), under claims of defamation and false light by the Osundairo brothers (originally arrested in connection with an alleged attack on the actor.) <ref>{{cite web |url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/4/23/18623361/osundairo-brothers-lawsuit-smollett-directed-every-aspect-of-fake-attack}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ordonez |first1=Jennifer |title=King of the Tabloid Case |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910023326/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3660632/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://apnews.com/1905ff965c0f4cafa9b1ef994f7fe10a}}</ref> However, a defamatory quote the Osundairos attributed to Glandian and Geragos in their lawsuit was in fact, said by their own attorney, Gloria Schmidt. The Osundairo brothers also paraphrased statements they claimed Geragos said on the podcast REASONABLE DOUBT (which Mark co-hosts with comic Adam Carolla), alleging Geragos dragged their reps through the mud by indicating the brothers had attacked Jussie, committed perjury and conspired to make false statements to clear their names. Geragos submitted transcripts of his podcast during the time of the criminal legal proceedings, noting he never said the brothers' names, nor did he say or indicate what they attributed to him. The case was dismissed by the judge. 
* [[Partridge v. Benton]] - In March of 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city of Benton, Arkansas a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle's parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city’s officer,Kyle Ellison, and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. However, on July 3, 2019, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed in 2017 against Benton police by the parents of the suicidal 17-year-old boy (Keagan) who was shot and killed while complying with an officer's order (Kyle Ellison) to move a gun away from his head. Filed by Geragos, (and Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman), the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. Miller said that after Ellison ordered Schweikle to drop the gun and the boy moved it away from his head, the intention behind his actions was ambiguous, leaving the officer little choice but to shoot. Miller noted, "Keagan could have quickly pointed the gun at Ellison and opened fire almost instantaneously. ... Ellison had a right to protect himself." A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said Miller ruled on the matter too early in the process. And Holiman and Geragos argued the case. When Schweikle's parents were told the lawsuit was moving forward again, the parents broke down in tears. Holiman added, "We think it's the right decision."
* [[Scottie Pippen]] - In February of 2014, Scottie Pippen hired Geragos to file a countersuit against a Malibu man who alleged the former NBA All-Star assaulted him at a restaurant last year. Camran Shafighi filed a $4-million lawsuit against Pippen, accusing him of a “brutal and unjustified physical attack" that allegedly occurred outside upscale [[Nobu]] restaurant after Shafighi had sought a picture with the former Chicago Bull. In the cross-complaint filed by Geragos earlier in February, alleged Shafighi cursed at Pippen using racial slurs, spat on him and his children and said, “I’m going to kill you.”  The cross-complaint also alleged that Shafighi was “extremely aggressive and noticeably intoxicated” and calls for unspecified damages “according to proof.”  
* [[Keagan Schweikle]] - In 2019, an 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court finding that a Benton police officer Kyle Ellison had acted reasonably when he fatally shot a suicidal teen, Keagan Schweikle, in October 2016. In March of 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city's motion to dismiss the lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle's parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city, officer Kyle Ellison and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. Filed by Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman and Los Angeles attorney Mark Geragos, the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. A panel of federal judges has restored the lawsuit over the officer-involved shooting death of 17-year-old Keagan Schweikle of Benton. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thv11.com/article/news/crime/lawsuit-restored-over-officer-involved-shooting-death-of-17-year-old/91-7959907d-706f-4226-a1a0-7cd0a1b6ed10}}</ref>
