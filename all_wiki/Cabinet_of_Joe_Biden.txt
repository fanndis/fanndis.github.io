== Announced Cabinet positions ==
All members of the [[Cabinet of the United States]] require the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]] following appointment by the president before taking office. The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires election to office pursuant to the [[United States Constitution]]. Although some are afforded cabinet-level rank, non-cabinet members within the [[Executive Office of the President]], such as [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], and [[White House Press Secretary]], do not hold constitutionally created positions and most do not require Senate confirmation for appointment.

The following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the President-elect of the United States.

== Nominated candidates for Cabinet-level positions ==
{{Further|Political appointments by Joe Biden}}

Cabinet-level officials have positions that are considered to be of Cabinet level, but which are not part of the Cabinet. Which exact positions ''are'' considered part of the presidential cabinet can vary with the president. The [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA]] and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] were cabinet-level agencies under [[Bill Clinton]], but not [[George W. Bush]]. The head of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], also known as the [[List of U.S. executive branch czars|drug czar]], was a cabinet-level position under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, but not under [[Barack Obama]]. It is not to be confused with the head of the [[United States Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]], who has remained in the [[org chart]] underneath the cabinet position held by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Members of the cabinet and cabinet-level officials, meet with the president in [[Cabinet Room (White House)|a room adjacent to the Oval Office]].

=== White House Chief of Staff ===
The [[White House Chief of Staff]] has traditionally been the highest-ranking employee of the [[White House Office|White House]]. The responsibilities of the chief of staff are both managerial and advisory over the president's official business. The chief of staff is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the [[president of the United States|president]]; it does not require [[Advice and consent|Senate confirmation]]. The first Biden cabinet or cabinet level position appointee is White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/klain-biden-white-house/2020/11/11/3c64069a-21d3-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html |title=Biden’s choice of Ron Klain to run White House signals rejection of Trump-era chaos |last1=Schrer |first1=Michael |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 11, 2020 |accessdate=November 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112011339if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/klain-biden-white-house/2020/11/11/3c64069a-21d3-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html |archive-date=November 11, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>
