'''[[Chronic condition|Chronic]] pain''' is [[pain]] that lasts a long time. In medicine, the distinction between [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[Chronic condition|chronic]] pain is sometimes determined by the amount of time since onset.

==Classification==
{{main|Pain#Classification}}
The [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] defines chronic pain as pain with no biological value, that persists past normal tissue healing.  The DSM-5 recognizes one chronic pain disorder, somatic symptom disorders. The criteria include pain lasting longer than six months.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Katz J, Rosenbloom BN, Fashler S | title = Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 160–7 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 26174215 | pmc = 4459242 | doi = 10.1177/070674371506000402 }}</ref>

#Chronic primary pain: defined by 3 months of persistent pain in one or more regions of the body that is unexplainable by another pain condition.
#Chronic cancer pain: defined as cancer or treatment related [[viscera]]l (within the internal organs), [[musculoskeletal]], or bony pain.
#Chronic post-traumatic pain: pain lasting 3 months after an injury or surgery, excluding infectious or pre-existing conditions.
#Chronic neuropathic pain: pain caused by damage to the [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory nervous system]].
#Chronic headache and [[orofacial pain]]: pain that originates in the head or face, and occurs for 50% or more days over a 3 months period.
#Chronic visceral pain: pain originating in an internal organ.
#Chronic musculoskeletal pain: pain originating in the bones, muscles, joints or connective tissue.

Chronic pain may be divided into "[[nociceptive]]" (caused by inflamed or damaged tissue activating specialized pain sensors called [[nociceptors]]), and "[[neuropathic pain|neuropathic]]" (caused by damage to or malfunction of the nervous system).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Keay KA, Clement CI, Bandler R | veditors = Horst GJ |title= The nervous system and the heart|year= 2000|publisher= Humana Press|location= Totowa, New Jersey|isbn= 978-0-89603-693-2|page= 304|chapter= The neuroanatomy of cardiac nociceptive pathways|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IeElgT1clUcC&q=%22definitions+of+pain+and+its+central+representation%22&pg=PA303}}</ref>

Nociceptive pain can be divided into "superficial" and "deep", and deep pain into "deep [[somatic nervous system|somatic]]" and "[[Viscus|visceral]]". ''Superficial'' pain is initiated by [[activation energy|activation]] of nociceptors in the skin or superficial tissues. ''Deep somatic'' pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, [[fasciae]] and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly-localized pain. ''Visceral'' pain originates in the viscera (organs). Visceral pain may be well-localized, but often it is extremely difficult to locate, and several visceral regions produce "referred" pain when damaged or inflamed, where the sensation is located in an area distant from the site of pathology or injury.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Coda BA, Bonica JJ | veditors = Loeser D, Bonica JJ |title= Bonica's management of pain|edition= 3|year= 2001|publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn= 978-0-443-05683-3|location= Philadelphia|chapter= General considerations of acute pain|chapter-url-access= registration|chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/painmanagementin0000main}}</ref>

==Causes==

===Pathophysiology===
Under persistent activation, the transmission of pain signals to the [[Posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] may produce a [[pain wind-up]] phenomenon. This triggers changes that lower the threshold for pain signals to be transmitted. In addition, it may cause nonnociceptive nerve fibers to respond to, generate and transmit pain signals. The type of nerve fibers that are believed to generate the pain signals are the [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fibers]], since they have a slow conductivity and give rise to a painful sensation that persists over a long time.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hansson P |title=Nociceptive and neurogenic pain |publisher=Pharmacia & Upjon AB |pages=52–63 |year=1998}}</ref> In chronic pain, this process is difficult to reverse or stop once established.<ref name="Vadivelu N, Sinatra R.">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vadivelu N, Sinatra R | title = Recent advances in elucidating pain mechanisms | journal = Current Opinion in Anesthesiology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 540–7 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16534290 | doi = 10.1097/01.aco.0000183109.27297.75 | s2cid = 22012269 }}</ref> In some cases, chronic pain can be caused by genetic factors which interfere with neuronal differentiation, leading to a permanently lowered threshold for pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rusanescu G, Mao J | title = Notch3 is necessary for neuronal differentiation and maturation in the adult spinal cord | journal = Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 10 | pages = 2103–16 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25164209 | pmc = 4244024 | doi = 10.1111/jcmm.12362 }}</ref>

These structural changes can be explained by [[Neuroplasticity#Chronic pain|neuroplasticity]]. In the case of chronic pain, the [[Somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic representation]] of the body is inappropriately reorganized following peripheral and central sensitization. This can cause [[allodynia]] or [[hyperalgesia]]. In individuals with chronic pain, [[Electroencephalography|EEGs]] showed altered brain activity, suggesting pain-induced neuroplastic changes. More specifically, the relative [[Electroencephalography#Normal activity|beta activity]] (compared to the rest of the brain) was increased, the relative [[Electroencephalography#Normal activity|alpha activity]] was decreased, and the [[Electroencephalography#Normal activity|theta activity]] was diminished.<ref name="Jensen, M.P. 2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen MP, Sherlin LH, Hakiman S, Fregni F | year = 2009 | title = Neuromodulatory approaches for chronic pain management: research findings and clinical implications | journal = Journal of Neurotherapy | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 196–213 | doi=10.1080/10874200903334371| doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Outcomes==
Sleep disturbance, and [[insomnia]] due to medication and illness symptoms are often experienced by those with chronic pain.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Ferini-Strambi L | title=Sleep Disorders | chapter=Sleep disorders in multiple sclerosis |journal=Handb Clin Neurol. |volume=99 |pages=1139–46 |year=2011 |pmid=21056246 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52007-4.00025-4 | series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology | isbn=978-0-444-52007-4}}</ref> These conditions can be difficult to treat due to the high potential of medication interactions, especially when the conditions are treated by different doctors.

Severe chronic pain is associated with increased risk of death over a ten year period, particularly from heart disease and respiratory disease.<ref name=pmid19726210>{{cite journal | vauthors = Torrance N, Elliott AM, Lee AJ, Smith BH | title = Severe chronic pain is associated with increased 10 year mortality.

However, further research is needed to clarify the relationship between severe chronic pain, stress and cardiovascular health.<ref name=pmid19726210/>

==Psychology==

===Personality===
Two of the most frequent personality profiles found in people with chronic pain by the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI) are the ''conversion V'' and the ''neurotic triad''. The conversion V personality expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings, develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, and often fails to recognize their own emotional state, including [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The neurotic triad personality also expresses exaggerated concern over body feelings and develops bodily symptoms in response to stress, but is demanding and complaining.<ref>{{cite book |title=Clinical manual of pain management in psychiatry |last=[http://www.appi.org/book.cfm?id=62275 Leo]|first=Raphael |year=2007 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-58562-275-7  |page=58}}</ref>

Some investigators have argued that it is this [[neuroticism]] that causes acute pain to turn chronic, but clinical evidence points the other way, to chronic pain causing neuroticism. When long term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and [[anxiety]] fall, often to normal levels.<ref name="pmid17112364">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fishbain DA, Cole B, Cutler RB, Lewis J, Rosomoff HL, Rosomoff RS | title = Chronic pain and the measurement of personality: do states influence traits? | journal = Pain Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 509–29 | date = 1 November 2006 | pmid = 17112364 | doi = 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2006.00239.x | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="pmid9648998">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jess P, Jess T, Beck H, Bech P | title = Neuroticism in relation to recovery and persisting pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 550–3 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9648998 | doi = 10.1080/00365529850172151 }}</ref><ref name="pmid7846260">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jess P, Bech P | title = The validity of Eysenck's neuroticism dimension within the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in patients with duodenal ulcer.

It has been suggested that [[Pain catastrophizing|catastrophizing]] might play a role in the experience of pain. ''Pain catastrophizing'' is the tendency to describe a pain experience in more exaggerated terms than the average person, to think a great deal more about the pain when it occurs, or to feel more helpless about the experience.<ref name="Damme">{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Damme S, Crombez G, Bijttebier P, Goubert L, Van Houdenhove B | title = A confirmatory factor analysis of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale: invariant factor structure across clinical and non-clinical populations | journal = Pain | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–24 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11973004 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(01)00463-8 | s2cid = 19059827 }}</ref> People who score highly on measures of catastrophization are likely to rate a pain experience as more intense than those who score low on such measures. It is often reasoned that the tendency to catastrophize ''causes'' the person to experience the pain as more intense. One suggestion is that catastrophizing influences pain perception through altering attention and anticipation, and heightening emotional responses to pain.<ref name="Grace">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gracely RH, Geisser ME, Giesecke T, Grant MA, Petzke F, Williams DA, Clauw DJ | title = Pain catastrophizing and neural responses to pain among persons with fibromyalgia | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 835–43 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 14960499 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh098 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, at least some aspects of catastrophization may be the ''product'' of an intense pain experience, rather than its cause. That is, the more intense the pain feels to the person, the more likely they are to have thoughts about it that fit the definition of catastrophization.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Severeijns R, van den Hout MA, Vlaeyen JW | title = The causal status of pain catastrophizing: an experimental test with healthy participants | journal = European Journal of Pain | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–65 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15862475 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.07.005 | s2cid = 43047540 }}</ref>

=== Co-Morbidity with trauma ===
Individuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a high comorbidity with chronic pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fishbain DA, Pulikal A, Lewis JE, Gao J | title = Chronic Pain Types Differ in Their Reported Prevalence of Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and There Is Consistent Evidence That Chronic Pain Is Associated with PTSD: An Evidence-Based Structured Systematic Review | journal = Pain Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 711–735 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27188666 | doi = 10.1093/pm/pnw065 | s2cid = 205291405 | url = https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/pm/pnw065 }}</ref> Patients who suffer from both PTSD and chronic pain, report significantly higher severity of pain than those who do not have a comorbidity with PTSD.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morasco BJ, Lovejoy TI, Lu M, Turk DC, Lewis L, Dobscha SK | title = The relationship between PTSD and chronic pain: mediating role of coping strategies and depression | journal = Pain | volume = 154 | issue = 4 | pages = 609–16 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23398939 | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2013.01.001 | pmc = 3609886 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pain.2013.01.001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Siqveland J, Ruud T, Hauff E | title = Post-traumatic stress disorder moderates the relationship between trauma exposure and chronic pain | journal = European Journal of Psychotraumatology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 1375337 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 29038680 | pmc = 5632777 | doi = 10.1080/20008198.2017.1375337 | url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20008198.2017.1375337 }}</ref>

===Perceptions of injustice===
Similar to the damaging effects seen with catastrophizing, perceived injustice is thought to contribute to the severity and duration of chronic pain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sullivan |first1=Michael J. L. |last2=Yakobov |first2=Esther |last3=Scott |first3=Whitney |last4=Tait |first4=Raymond |title=Perceived Injustice and Adverse Recovery Outcomes |journal=Psychological Injury and Law |date=1 November 2014 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=325–334 |doi=10.1007/s12207-014-9209-8|s2cid=143450160 }}</ref> Pain-related injustice perception has been conceptualized as a cognitive appraisal reflecting the severity and irreparability of pain- or injury-related loss (e.g., ‘I just want my life back’), and externalizing blame and unfairness (‘I am suffering because of someone else’s negligence’.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sullivan MJ, Adams H, Horan S, Maher D, Boland D, Gross R | title = The role of perceived injustice in the experience of chronic pain and disability: scale development and validation | journal = Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–61 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18536983 | doi = 10.1007/s10926-008-9140-5 | s2cid = 23897737 }}</ref>  It has been suggested that understanding problems with top down processing/cognitive appraisals can be used to better understand and treat this problem.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bissell DA, Ziadni MS, Sturgeon JA | title = Perceived injustice in chronic pain: an examination through the lens of predictive processing | journal = Pain Management | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–138 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29451429 | pmc = 6123883 | doi = 10.2217/pmt-2017-0051 }}</ref>

===Social support===
[[Social support]] has important consequences for individuals with chronic pain. In particular, pain intensity, pain control, and resiliency to pain have been implicated as outcomes influenced by different levels and types of social support. Much of this research has focused on emotional, instrumental, tangible and informational social support. People with persistent pain conditions tend to rely on their social support as a coping mechanism and therefore have better outcomes when they are a part of larger more supportive social networks. Across a majority of studies investigated, there was a direct significant association between social activities or social support and pain. Higher levels of pain were associated with a decrease in social activities, lower levels of social support, and reduced social functioning.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Molton IR, Terrill AL | title = Overview of persistent pain in older adults | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–207 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24547805 | doi = 10.1037/a0035794 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaza C, Baine N | title = Cancer pain and psychosocial factors: a critical review of the literature | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 526–42 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12547052 | doi = 10.1016/s0885-3924(02)00497-9 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Effect on cognition===
Chronic pain's impact on cognition is an under-researched area, but several tentative conclusions have been published. Most people with chronic pain complain of [[Cognitive Impairment|cognitive impairment]], such as forgetfulness, difficulty with attention, and difficulty completing tasks. Objective testing has found that people in chronic pain tend to experience impairment in attention, memory, mental flexibility, verbal ability, speed of response in a cognitive task, and speed in executing structured tasks.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kreitler S, Niv D | year = 2007 | title = Cognitive impairment in chronic pain | journal = Pain: Clinical Updates | volume = XV | issue = 4 | pages = 1–4 | url = https://www.iasp-pain.org/PublicationsNews/NewsletterIssue.aspx?ItemNumber=2111 | format = pdf | access-date = 2019-01-06 }}</ref> A review of studies in 2018 reports a relationship between people in chronic pain and abnormal results in test of memory, attention, and processing speed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Higgins DM, Martin AM, Baker DG, Vasterling JJ, Risbrough V | title = The Relationship Between Chronic Pain and Neurocognitive Function: A Systematic Review | journal = The Clinical Journal of Pain | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 262–275 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 28719507 | pmc = 5771985 | doi = 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000536 }}</ref>
