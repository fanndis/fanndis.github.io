== Controversy ==
Pop singer [[Miley Cyrus]] became the subject of widespread media attention following a controversial performance with [[Robin Thicke]]. The performance began with Cyrus performing "[[We Can't Stop]]" in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a skin-colored two-piece latex outfit while they performed "[[Blurred Lines]]" in a duet. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's [[crotch]] area with a giant pedicured foam finger and [[twerking|twerked]] against him.

Critics universally panned the performance, while fans and celebrities were shocked. Parents expressed outrage over the performance. An article published in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described the performance as "crass" and "reminiscent of a bad [[acid trip]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/note-miley-cyrus-please-stop-614407|title=Note to Miley Cyrus: Please Stop; Plus Other VMAs Ruminations|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2013|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> The performance was described by ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' critic B. J. Steiner as a "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Most Awkward Hip-Hop Moments At MTV’s 2013 Video Music Awards|author=Steiner, B.
