This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May 2003 when [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W.

The U.S.-led coalition sent 177,194 troops into Iraq during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 1 May 2003. About 130,000 arrived from the U.S. alone, with about 45,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers, and 194 Polish soldiers. [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|36 other countries]] were involved in its aftermath.

In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war.<ref name="CBSnews-20030124">[https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml "Poll: Talk First, Fight Later"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330062908/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/23/opinion/polls/main537739.shtml |date=30 March 2007 }}.

The invasion was preceded by an [[airstrike]] on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into [[Basra Province]] from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While [[special forces]] launched an amphibious assault from the [[Persian Gulf]] to secure [[Basra]] and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi [[command and control|command-and-control]] threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] was [[Operation Northern Delay|airdropped]] near the northern city of [[Kirkuk]], where they joined forces with [[Kurds|Kurdish]] rebels and fought several actions against the [[Iraqi Army]], to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and the coalition occupied Baghdad on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi Army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack on and capture of [[Tikrit]] on 15 April. [[President of Iraq|Iraqi president]] Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May President George W. Bush declared an end to major combat operations: this ended the invasion period and began the period of [[military occupation]].

Despite the Bush administration's stated interest in invading Iraq, little formal movement towards an invasion occurred until the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].

On 20 September 2001, Bush addressed a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] (simulcast live to the world), and announced his new "[[War on Terror]]". This announcement was accompanied by the doctrine of "pre-emptive" military action, later termed the [[Bush Doctrine]]. Allegations of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were made by some [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] officials who asserted that a highly secretive relationship existed between Saddam and the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant organization [[al-Qaeda]] from 1992 to 2003, specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] (IIS). Some Bush advisers favored an immediate invasion of Iraq, while others advocated building an international coalition and obtaining United Nations authorization.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gause|first=F.

Key U.S. allies in [[NATO]], such as the United Kingdom, agreed with the U.S. actions, while France and Germany were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]], which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised "serious consequences" for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2364203.stm "France threatens rival UN Iraq draft"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308081555/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2364203.stm |date=8 March 2008 }}.

Resolution 1441 gave Iraq "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations" and set up inspections by the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman [[Hans Blix]] and IAEA Director-General [[Mohamed ElBaradei]]. As of February 2003, the IAEA "found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statements of the Director General|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebsp2003n006.shtml|publisher=IAEA|date=6 March 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903185204/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2003/ebsp2003n006.shtml|archive-date=3 September 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> UNMOVIC "did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programs of weapons of mass destruction" or significant quantities of proscribed items.

In October 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the "[[Iraq Resolution]]". The resolution authorized the President to "use any means necessary" against Iraq. Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush's plan. The U.S. government engaged in an elaborate [[Public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|domestic public relations campaign]] to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. Of those who thought Iraq had weapons sequestered somewhere, about half responded that said weapons would not be found in combat. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Saddam from power.<ref name = "CBSnews-20030124"/>

SAD teams also conducted missions behind enemy lines to identify leadership targets. These missions led to the initial [[air strike]]s against Saddam and his generals. Although the strike against Saddam was unsuccessful in killing him, it effectively ended his ability to [[command and control]] his forces. Strikes against Iraq's generals were more successful and significantly degraded the Iraqi command's ability to react to, and maneuver against, the U.S.-led invasion force.<ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004"/><ref name="unseen-war">"Behind lines, an unseen war," Faye Bowers, ''The Christian Science Monitor'', April 2003.</ref> SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started.<ref name="Tucker 2008" />

Powell also presented evidence alleging [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|Iraq had ties to al-Qaeda]]. As a follow-up to Powell's presentation, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but NATO members like Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy.

In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began [[preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|preparing for the invasion of Iraq]], with a host of [[public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|public relations]] and military moves. In his 17 March 2003 address to the nation, Bush demanded that Saddam and his two sons, [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030317-7.html|title=President Says Saddam Hussein Must Leave Iraq Within 48 Hours|date=17 March 2003|publisher=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary]]|access-date=28 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506075201/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030317-7.html|archive-date=6 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> But the U.S. began the bombing of Iraq on the day before the deadline expired. On 18 March 2003, the bombing of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, Italy and Denmark began. Unlike the first Gulf War, this war had no explicit UN authorisation.

The UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] held a debate on going to war on 18 March 2003 where the government motion was approved 412 to 149.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030318/debtext/30318-47.htm |journal=Hansard |date=18 March 2003 |volume=401 |issue=365 |title=Division No. 117 (Iraq) |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |access-date=29 October 2011  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123101047/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030318/debtext/30318-47.htm |archive-date=23 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The vote was a key moment in the history of the [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Blair administration]], as the number of government MPs who rebelled against the vote was the greatest since the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. Three government ministers resigned in protest at the war, [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], [[Lord Hunt of Kings Heath]], and the then Leader of the House of Commons [[Robin Cook]]. In a passionate speech to the House of Commons after his resignation, he said, "What has come to trouble me is the suspicion that if the 'hanging chads' of Florida had gone the other way and Al Gore had been elected, we would not now be about to commit British troops to action in Iraq." During the debate, it was stated that the [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Attorney General]] had advised that the war was legal under previous UN Resolutions.

{{main|Failed Iraqi peace initiatives}}
In December 2002, a representative of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General [[Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti]], contacted former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] Counterterrorism Department head [[Vincent Cannistraro]] stating that Saddam "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)." Cannistraro further added that "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it." Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all "killed" by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Saddam to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep US$1 billion.<ref name="WaPo">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/26/us-iraq-bush-spain-idUSL2683831120070926 |title=Bush thought Saddam was prepared to flee: report |author=Jason Webb |agency=Reuters |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=26 September 2007 |access-date=27 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610042137/http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/26/us-iraq-bush-spain-idUSL2683831120070926 |archive-date=10 June 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s national security advisor, [[Osama El-Baz]], sent a message to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that the country had weapons of mass destruction and ties with Al-Qaeda. Iraq also attempted to reach the U.S. through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services.

In January 2003, [[Lebanese-American]] [[Imad Hage]] met with [[Michael Maloof]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]'s [[Office of Special Plans]]. Hage, a resident of [[Beirut]], had been recruited by the department to assist in the [[war on terror]]. He reported that [[Mohammed Nassif]], a close aide to Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]], had expressed frustrations about the difficulties of Syria contacting the United States, and had attempted to use him as an intermediary.

In January 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligence's foreign operations, [[Hassan al-Obeidi]]. Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad did not understand why they were targeted and that they had no WMDs. He then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to confirm this. He additionally offered petroleum concessions but stopped short of having Saddam give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted.<ref name="transcripts.cnn.com" />

Later that month, Hage met with General Habbush and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]]. He was offered top priority to U.S. firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, U.S. inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent [[Abdul Rahman Yasin]] (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give "full support for any U.S. plan" in the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. They also wished to meet with high-ranking U.S. officials. On 19 February, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to [[Jaymie Duran]]. [[The Pentagon]] denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran's bosses, were aware of the plan.<ref name="transcripts.cnn.com" />

On 21 February, Maloof informed Duran in an email that [[Richard Perle]] wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it. Duran responded "Mike, working this. Keep this close hold." On 7 March, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting). A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perle's response was "that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go"). Perle told ''[[The Times]]'', "The message was 'Tell them that we will see them in Baghdad.′"<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/06/world/struggle-for-iraq-diplomacy-iraq-said-have-tried-reach-last-minute-deal-avert.html |title=THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: DIPLOMACY; Iraq Said to Have Tried to Reach Last-Minute Deal to Avert War |author=James Risen |work=The New York Times |date=6 November 2003 |access-date=22 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915040815/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/06/world/struggle-for-iraq-diplomacy-iraq-said-have-tried-reach-last-minute-deal-avert.html |archive-date=15 September 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

==Casus belli and rationale==
{{Main|Rationale for the Iraq War}}
George Bush, speaking in October 2002, said that "The stated policy of the United States is regime change. ... However, if Saddam were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_23-10-2002_pg4_1 |author=Bob Kemper |title=Saddam can keep rule if he complies: Bush |work=Daily Times |date=23 October 2002 |access-date=9 December 2015  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825024139/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_23-10-2002_pg4_1 |archive-date=25 August 2004 }}</ref> Citing reports from certain intelligence sources, Bush stated on 6 March 2003 that he believed that Saddam was not complying with [[UN Resolution 1441]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030306-8.html|title=News Release|publisher=White House|access-date=1 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708202824/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030306-8.html|archive-date=8 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2002, [[Tony Blair]] stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that "Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction..."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020924/debtext/20924-05.htm|title=Tony Blair: Answer to Parliamentary Question|work=Hansard|access-date=1 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085841/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020924/debtext/20924-05.htm|archive-date=29 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In November of that year, Blair further stated that, "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not régime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, but on the other hand I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is the disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change."<ref>{{cite web|title=PM gives interview to Radio Monte Carlo |url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page1299.asp |access-date=9 December 2015  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020622220253/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page1299.asp |archive-date=22 June 2002 }}</ref>

At a press conference on 31 January 2003, Bush again reiterated that the single trigger for the invasion would be Iraq's failure to disarm, "Saddam Hussein must understand that if he does not disarm, for the sake of peace, we, along with others, will go disarm Saddam Hussein."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/01/31/sprj.irq.bush.blair.topics/|title=Bush, Blair: Time running out for Saddam|publisher=CNN|date=31 January 2003|access-date=29 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114081424/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/01/31/sprj.irq.bush.blair.topics/|archive-date=14 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As late as 25 February 2003, it was still the official line that the only cause of invasion would be a failure to disarm.

While it never made an explicit connection between Iraq and the 11 September attacks, the George W. Bush administration repeatedly insinuated a link, thereby creating a false impression for the U.S. public. Grand jury testimony from the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] trials cited numerous direct linkages from the bombers to Baghdad and Department 13 of the Iraqi Intelligence Service in that initial attack marking the second anniversary to vindicate the surrender of Iraqi armed forces in [[Operation Desert Storm]]. For example, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has noted that,

{{quote|While not explicitly declaring Iraqi culpability in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, administration officials did, at various times, imply a link. In late 2001, Cheney said it was "pretty well confirmed" that attack mastermind Mohamed Atta had met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official.

Steven Kull, director of the [[Program on International Policy Attitudes]] (PIPA) at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], observed in March 2003 that "The administration has succeeded in creating a sense that there is some connection [between 11 Sept. and Saddam Hussein]". This was following a ''[[The New York Times]]''/[[CBS]] poll that showed 45% of Americans believing Saddam Hussein was "personally involved" in the 11 September atrocities. As ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' observed at the time, while "Sources knowledgeable about U.S. intelligence say there is no evidence that Saddam played a role in the 11 Sept. attacks, nor that he has been or is currently aiding Al Qaeda. ... the White House appears to be encouraging this false impression, as it seeks to maintain American support for a possible war against Iraq and demonstrate seriousness of purpose to Saddam's regime." The CSM went on to report that, while polling data collected "right after 11 Sept. 2001" showed that only 3 percent mentioned Iraq or Saddam Hussein, by January 2003 attitudes "had been transformed" with a Knight Ridder poll showing that 44% of Americans believed "most" or "some" of the 11 September hijackers were Iraqi citizens.<ref>{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Feldmann |title=The impact of Bush linking 9/11 and Iraq |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=14 March 2003 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html |access-date=22 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930032450/http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html|archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

According to [[General Tommy Franks]], the objectives of the invasion were, "First, end the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to search for, to capture and to drive out terrorists from that country. Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. Seventh, to secure Iraq's oil fields and resources, which belong to the Iraqi people. And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government."<ref>{{cite web |last=Sale |first=Michelle |url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/missions-accomplished |title=Missions Accomplished? |work=The New York Times |date=11 April 2003 |access-date=10 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630004014/http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/missions-accomplished/ |archive-date=30 June 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The [[BBC]] has also noted that, while President Bush "never directly accused the former Iraqi leader of having a hand in the attacks on New York and Washington", he "repeatedly associated the two in keynote addresses delivered since 11 September", adding that "Senior members of his administration have similarly conflated the two." For instance, the BBC report quotes Colin Powell in February 2003, stating that "We've learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases.

Throughout 2002, the Bush administration insisted that removing Saddam from power to restore international peace and security was a major goal. The principal stated justifications for this policy of "regime change" were that Iraq's [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|continuing production of weapons of mass destruction]] and [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|known ties to terrorist organizations]], as well as Iraq's continued violations of UN Security Council resolutions, amounted to a threat to the U.S. and the world community.

{{Wikisource|Colin Powell's February 5, 2003 address to The United Nations Security Council}}
The Bush administration's overall rationale for the invasion of Iraq was presented in detail by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 5 February 2003. In summary, he stated,
{{quote|We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction; he's determined to make more. Given Saddam Hussein's history of aggression ... given what we know of his terrorist associations and given his determination to exact revenge on those who oppose him, should we take the risk that he will not some day use these weapons at a time and the place and in the manner of his choosing at a time when the world is in a much weaker position to respond? The United States will not and cannot run that risk to the American people. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post–September 11 world.<ref name="CNNtranscript">[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.transcript/index.html "Transcript of Powell's U.N.

===Iraqi drones===
In October 2002, a few days before the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] vote on the [[Legality of the Iraq War#United States|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution]], about 75 senators were told in [[closed session]] that the Iraqi government had the means of delivering [[biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]] of mass destruction by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) drones that could be launched from ships off the US' Atlantic coast to attack [[East Coast of the United States|US eastern seaboard cities]]. [[Colin Powell]] suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the United States.

===Human rights===
As evidence supporting U.S. and British charges about Iraqi Weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism weakened, some supporters of the invasion have increasingly shifted their justification to the [[Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq|human rights violations of the Saddam government]].<ref>[http://www.turks.us/article.php?story=20030730114304428 Senators Slam Shifting Iraq War Justification.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919032805/http://www.turks.us/article.php?story=20030730114304428 |date=19 September 2011 }} Islamonline. 30 July 2003.</ref> Leading human rights groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]] have argued, however, that they believe human rights concerns were never a central justification for the invasion, nor do they believe that military intervention was justifiable on humanitarian grounds, most significantly because "the killing in Iraq at the time was not of the exceptional nature that would justify such intervention."<ref>Roth, Ken.

Citing the [[Iraq Liberation Act of 1998]], the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.

The resolution "supported" and "encouraged" diplomatic efforts by President George W. Bush to "strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq" and "obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq." The resolution authorized President Bush to use the [[Armed Forces of the United States]] "as he determines to be necessary and appropriate" to "defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant [[United Nations Security Council]] Resolutions regarding Iraq."

=== International law ===
The legality of the invasion of Iraq under international law has been challenged since its inception on a number of fronts, and several prominent supporters of the invasion in all the invading nations have publicly and privately cast doubt on its legality. It has been argued by US and British governments that the invasion was fully legal because authorization was implied by the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/iraq/decade/sect2.html |title=Saddam Hussein's Defiance of UNSCRs |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |access-date=10 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711150828/https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/iraq/decade/sect2.html |archive-date=11 July 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> International legal experts, including the [[International Commission of Jurists]], a group of 31 leading Canadian law professors, and the U.S.-based Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, have denounced this rationale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robincmiller.com/ir-legal.htm |title=Links to Opinions of Legality of War Against Iraq |publisher=Robincmiller.com |access-date=13 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331191202/http://www.robincmiller.com/ir-legal.htm |archive-date=31 March 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0321-10.htm |title=Law Groups Say U.S. Invasion Illegal |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=21 March 2003 |access-date=9 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040215193958/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0321-10.htm |archive-date=15 February 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj.org/news.php3?id_article=2770&lang=en |title=International Commission of Jurists |publisher=Icj.org |date=18 March 2003 |access-date=9 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407232423/http://www.icj.org/news.php3?id_article=2770&lang=en |archive-date=7 April 2003 }}</ref>

The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|678]], passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes "member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means" to (1) implement Security Council Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 660|660]] and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) "restore international peace and security in the area." Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|678]] has not been rescinded or nullified by succeeding resolutions and Iraq was not alleged after 1991 to invade Kuwait or to threaten to do so.

Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|1441]] was most prominent during the run-up to the war and formed the main backdrop for Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]]'s address to the Security Council one month before the invasion.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.transcript/index.html Transcript of Powell's U.N.

At the same time, Bush Administration officials advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force in response to Iraq's 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]]. Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of [[U.N.

In a March 2007 interview with the [[Sunday Telegraph]], Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes.<ref>Chamberlin, Gethin.

United States Ohio Congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]] held a press conference on the evening of 24 April 2007, revealing [[US House Resolution 333]] and the three articles of impeachment against Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. He charged Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq's weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq's connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the [[United Nations Charter]].

CIA [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) Paramilitary teams entered Iraq in July 2002 before the 2003 invasion. Once on the ground they prepared for the subsequent arrival of US military forces. SAD teams then combined with [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] to organize the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]]. This joint team combined to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], an ally of Al Qaida, in a battle in the northeast corner of Iraq. The U.S. side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army's [[10th Special Forces Group (United States)|10th Special Forces Group]].<ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /><ref name="Tucker 2008" /><ref name="charles-faddis-interview" />

SAD teams also conducted high-risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial strikes against Saddam were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force coming from the south.<ref name="Attack, Bob Woodward 2004" /><ref name="charles-faddis-interview" />

SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.<ref name="Tucker 2008" /> NATO member [[Turkey]] refused to allow its territory to be used for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG and U.S. Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga constituted the entire northern force against government forces during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of the Iraqi army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than moving to contest the coalition force.

According to [[Tommy Franks|General Tommy Franks]], [[April Fool (spy)|April Fool]], an American officer working [[undercover]] as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi [[intelligence agent]]. April Fool then sold the Iraqi false "top secret" invasion plans provided by Franks' team. This deception misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in northern and western Iraq in anticipation of attacks by way of [[Turkey]] or [[Jordan]], which never took place. This greatly reduced the defensive capacity in the rest of Iraq and facilitated the actual attacks via [[Kuwait]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] in the southeast.

In addition, the Kurdish Islamist militant group [[Ansar al-Islam]] controlled a small section of northern Iraq in an area outside of Saddam Hussein's control. Ansar al-Islam had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At the time of the invasion they fielded about 600 to 800 fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1016/p12s01-woiq.html |title=The rise and fall of Ansar al-Islam |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=16 October 2003 |first=Scott |last=Peterson |access-date=29 October 2011  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920145616/http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1016/p12s01-woiq.html |archive-date=20 September 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Ansar al-Islam was led by the Jordanian-born militant [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], who would later become an important leader in the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]].

However, information obtained by the UK [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq in the second half of 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14&nbsp;tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6&nbsp;tons in September – before the U.S. Congress' 11 October [[Iraq Resolution|authorization of the invasion]].

The 5 September attacks included a 100+ aircraft attack on the main air defense site in western Iraq. According to an editorial in ''[[New Statesman]]'' this was "Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias, it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected."<ref name="newstatebomb">{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300013 |title=The war before the war |first=Michael |last=Smith |work=New Statesman |location=UK|date=30 May 2005 |access-date=6 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210040821/http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300013 |archive-date=10 December 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Tommy Franks]], who commanded the invasion of Iraq, has since admitted that the bombing was designed to "degrade" Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf War. These "spikes of activity" were, in the words of then British Defence Secretary, [[Geoff Hoon]], designed to 'put pressure on the Iraqi regime' or, as ''[[The Times]]'' reported, to "provoke Saddam Hussein into giving the allies an excuse for war". In this respect, as provocations designed to start a war, leaked British Foreign Office legal advice concluded that such attacks were illegal under international law.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527701.ece |title=RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war |work=The Times |location=London |access-date=1 September 2008 |first=Michael |last=Smith |date=29 May 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727015416/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527701.ece|archive-date=27 July 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article535045.ece |title=British bombing raids were illegal, says Foreign Office – Times Online |work=The Times |location=London |access-date=1 September 2008 |first=Michael |last=Smith |date=19 June 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326183855/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article535045.ece |archive-date=26 March 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Another attempt at provoking the war was mentioned in a leaked memo from a meeting between George W.

If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article342859.ece |title=Bush 'plotted to lure Saddam into war with fake UN plane' |work=The Independent |location=London |access-date=13 September 2009 |first=Andy |last=Mcsmith |date=3 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017153359/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article342859.ece |archive-date=17 October 2007}}</ref> On 17 March 2003, U.S. President [[George W.

===Preceding special forces mission in al-Qa'im===
On the night of 17 March 2003, the majority of B and D squadron [[Special Air Service|British 22nd SAS Regiment]], designated as Task Force 14, crossed the border from Jordan to conduct a ground assault on a suspected chemical munitions site at a water-treatment plant in the city of [[Al-Qa'im (town)|al-Qa'im]]. It had been reported that the site might have been a [[SCUD missile]] launch site or a depot; an SAS officer was quoted by author Mark Nicol as saying "it was a location where missiles had been fired at Israel in the past, and a site of strategic importance for WMD material." The 60 members of D squadron, along with their 'Pinkie' [[Desert Patrol Vehicle|DPVs]] (the last time the vehicles were used before their retirement), was flown 120&nbsp;km into Iraq in 6 [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook#MH-47D|MH-47Ds]] in 3 waves. Following their insertion, D squadron established a patrol laager at a remote location outside al-Qa'im and awaited the arrival of B squadron, who had driven overland from Jordan. Their approach to the plant was compromised, and a firefight developed which ended in one 'pinkie' having to be abandoned and destroyed, repeated attempts to assault the plant were halted, leading the SAS to call in an air strike which silenced the opposition.<ref>Neville, Leigh, ''The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite)'', Osprey Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1472814037}} {{ISBN|978-1472814036}}, p.34, p.36</ref>

===Opening salvo: the Dora Farms strike===
In the early morning of 19 March 2003, U.S. forces abandoned the plan for initial, non-nuclear [[decapitation strike]]s against 55 top Iraqi officials, in light of reports that Saddam Hussein was visiting his sons, [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], at Dora Farms, within the [[Dora (Baghdad)|al-Dora]] farming community on the outskirts of [[Baghdad]].<ref name="PBS-20040226">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/cron/ |title=A chronology of the six-week invasion of Iraq |date=26 February 2004 |publisher=[[PBS]] |access-date=19 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331235432/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/cron/|archive-date=31 March 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> At approximately 05:30 [[UTC]], two [[F-117 Nighthawk]] [[stealth fighter]]s from the [[8th Fighter Squadron|8th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0703/air.html |title=The First Shot |work=Airman Magazine |access-date=18 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517050321/http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0703/air.html |archive-date=17 May 2008 |date=July 2003}}</ref> dropped four enhanced, satellite-guided 2,000-pound [[GBU-27]] '[[Bunker Buster]]s' on the compound.

===Opening attack===
On 19 March 2003 at 21:00, the first strike of the operation was carried out by members of the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th SOAR]]: a flight of [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk#Variants|MH-60L DAPs]] (Direct Action Penetrators) and four 'Black Swarm' flights – each consisting of a pair of [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|AH-6M Little Birds]] and a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] equipped MH-6M to identify targets for the AH-6s (each Black swarm flight was assigned a pair of [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II#Variants|A-10As]]) engaged Iraqi visual observation posts along the southern and western borders of Iraq. Within seven hours, more than 70 sites were destroyed, effectively depriving the Iraqi military of any early warning of the coming invasion. As the sites were eliminated, the first heliborne [[Special forces|SOF]] teams launched from [[Prince Hassan Air Base|H-5 air base]] in Jordan, including vehicle-mounted patrols from the British and Australian components transported by the [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook#MH-47D|MH-47Ds]] of the 160th SOAR. Ground elements of Task Force Dagger, Task Force 20, Task force 14, and Task Force 64 breached the sand berms along the Iraqi border with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in the early morning hours and drove into Iraq. Unofficially, the British, Australians, and Task Force 20 had been in Iraq weeks prior.<ref>Neville, Leigh, ''The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite)'', Osprey Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1472814037}} {{ISBN|978-1472814036}}, p.34,</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p. 97</ref>

On 20 March 2003 at approximately 02:30 [[UTC]] or about 90&nbsp;minutes after the lapse of the 48-hour deadline, at 05:33 local time, explosions were heard in Baghdad.

Before the invasion, many observers had expected a longer campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to incapacitate the Iraqi forces quickly which resulted in the [[Shock and awe]] military campaign attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.

Following [[Turkey]]'s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.<ref>''Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq'', Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press.</ref> Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in [[Kuwait]] and other [[Persian Gulf]] nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.

The invasion was swift, leading to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the first Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set many oil wells on fire]] and had dumped oil into the Gulf waters; this was to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around [[Basra]] and the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] with explosives.<ref>http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/21/sprj.irq.oil.wells/index.html|title=CNN.com - UK: Iraq torches seven oil wells - Mar. 21, 2003|publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx|title=Kuwait Oil Company|date=19 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519003256/http://kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx|archive-date=19 May 2015}}</ref>
Coalition troops launched an air and [[amphibious assault]] on the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Polish Navy]], and [[Royal Australian Navy]].

In the meantime, Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked the radar defence systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on 22 March along with the pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams), shot down by an American Patriot missile as they returned to their air base in Kuwait.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|title=Coroner condemns 'glaring failures' that led to US missile killing RAF crew|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305033041/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/31/military.iraq|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 1 April, an F-14 from USS Kitty Hawk crashed in southern Iraq reportedly due to engine failure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|title=f-14|access-date=12 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626124822/http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/f-14.htm|archive-date=26 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a S-3B Viking plunged off the deck of the USS Constellation after a malfunction and an AV-8B Harrier jump jet went into the Gulf while it was trying to land on the USS Nassau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|title=The following was received from a PJ in Operation Iraqi Freedom|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073741/http://www.pjsinnam.com/war_on_terror/IF/April_2_F-14_SAR.htm|archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

British [[3 Commando Brigade]], with the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] and the [[Poland|Polish]] Special Forces unit [[GROM]] attached, attacked the port of [[Umm Qasr]]. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30–40 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The [[British Army]]'s [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like [[Rumaila Field|Rumaila]] while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War.

In keeping with the rapid advance plan, the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]] moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]] moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] moved northward through the eastern marshland.

During the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a [[Scud]] missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in [[Camp Doha]], Kuwait. The missile was intercepted and shot down by a [[Patriot missile]] seconds before hitting the complex. Subsequently, two [[A-10 Warthog]]s attacked the missile launcher.

====Battle of Nasiriyah====
{{Main|Battle of Nasiriyah}}
Initially, the [[1st Marine Division (United States)]] fought through the [[Rumaila oil field]]s, and moved north to [[Nasiriyah]]—a moderate-sized, Shi'ite-dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and its proximity to nearby [[Ali Air Base|Tallil Airfield]]. It was also situated near a number of strategically important bridges over the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]]. The city was defended by a mix of regular Iraqi army units, Ba'ath loyalists, and Fedayeen from both Iraq and abroad. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west.

On 23 March, a convoy from the 3rd Infantry Division, including the female American soldiers [[Jessica Lynch]], [[Shoshana Johnson]], and [[Lori Piestewa]], was ambushed after taking a wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.Army.mil/features/507thMaintCmpy |title=Attack on the 507th Maintenance Company |publisher=[[The United States Army]] |date=17 July 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810130257/http://www.army.mil/features/507thMaintCmpy/ |archive-date=10 August 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=19 July 2009  }}</ref> Piestewa died of wounds shortly after capture, while the remaining five prisoners of war were later rescued.

An [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|Air Force A-10]] was involved in a case of [[friendly fire]] that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/086ykhgk.asp |title=Stopping Blue-on-Blue |work=[[The Weekly Standard|The Daily Standard]] |first=Christian |last=Lowe |date=8 September 2003 |access-date=7 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023022108/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/086ykhgk.asp |archive-date=23 October 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref> A Marine from [[Marine Air Control Group 28]] was killed by enemy fire, and two Marine engineers drowned in the Saddam Canal.

On the evening of 24 March, the [[2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion]], which was attached to [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|Regimental Combat Team One (RCT-1)]], pushed through Nasiriyah and established a perimeter 15&nbsp;kilometers (9.3&nbsp;miles) north of the city. Iraqi reinforcements from [[Kut]] launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200–300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights that killed many Fedayeen. Because of Nasiriyah's strategic position as a road junction, significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city's surrounding highways.

With the Nasiriyah and Tallil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some {{convert|10|mi|km}} outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The [[101st Airborne Division]] continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.

By 28 March, a severe sandstorm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive halfway between Najaf and Karbala. Air operations by helicopters, poised to bring reinforcements from the 101st Airborne, were blocked for three days. There was particularly heavy fighting in and around the bridge near the town of Kufl.

====Battle of Najaf====
{{Main|Battle of Najaf (2003)}}
[[File:DestroyedT-72outsidenajaf.jpg|thumb|Destroyed Iraqi [[T-72]] tank on Highway 9 outside [[Najaf]]]]

Another fierce battle was at [[Najaf]], where U.S. airborne and armored units with British air support fought an intense battle with Iraqi Regulars, Republican Guard units, and paramilitary forces. It started with U.S. [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopter gunships setting out on a mission to attack Republican Guard armored units; while flying low the Apaches came under heavy anti-aircraft, small arms, and RPG fire which heavily damaged many helicopters and shot one down, frustrating the attack.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2003/03/25/2003-03-25_iraqis_bash_choppers__one_u_.html |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=IRAQIS BASH CHOPPERS One U.S. copter downed, crew captured by Saddam's guards |date=25 March 2003 |url-status=dead |access-date=9 December 2015  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605020114/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2003/03/25/2003-03-25_iraqis_bash_choppers__one_u_.html |archive-date=5 June 2011 }}</ref> They attacked again successfully on 26 March, this time after a pre-mission artillery barrage and with support from [[F/A-18 Hornet]] jets, with no gunships lost.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/030325-apache01.htm |title=Loss of Apache in Iraq Is Evidence of Vulnerability of Copters to |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=24 March 2003 |access-date=7 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604050440/http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2003/030325-apache01.htm |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The 1st Brigade Combat Team's air defense battery moved in and after heavy fighting with entrenched Iraqi Fedayeen seized a strategic bridge in Najaf, known as "Objective Jenkins". They then came under fierce counterattacks by Iraqi forces and Fedayeen, who failed to dislodge U.S. forces from their positions. After 36 hours of combat at the bridge at Najaf, the Iraqis were defeated, and the key bridge was secured, isolating Najaf from the north.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/onpoint/ch-3.htm#najaf |title=On Point – The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |access-date=7 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520184440/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2004/onpoint/ch-3.htm#najaf |archive-date=20 May 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The Iraqi port city of [[Umm Qasr]] was the first British obstacle. A joint Polish-British-American force ran into unexpectedly stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the [[British 7 Armoured Brigade]] ("The Desert Rats"), fought their way into Iraq's second-largest city, [[Basra]], on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] cleared the 'old quarter' of the city that was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, including a tank battle when the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March. A few members of D Squadron, British SAS, were deployed to southern Iraq to support the coalition advance on Basra, the team conducted forward route reconnaissance and infiltrated the city and brought in strikes on the Ba'athist loyalist leadership.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urban|first=Mark|title=Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq|location=St. Martin's|publisher=Griffin|year=2012|isbn=978-1250006967|page=9}}</ref><ref name="Neville, Leigh 2016">Neville, Leigh, ''The SAS 1983-2014 (Elite)'', Osprey Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1472814037}} {{ISBN|978-1472814036}}, p.36,</ref>

Elements of [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] began to advance north towards U.S. positions around [[Amarah|Al Amarah]] on 9 April. Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While Coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of [[Umm Qasr]].

After a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near [[Karbala]]. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division's lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad.

Eleven British soldiers were killed, while 395–515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed.

===Battle of Karbala===
{{Main|Battle of Karbala (2003)}}
[[File:DerelictAsadBabil.JPEG|thumb|An ''Asad Babil'' abandoned after facing the final US thrust into Baghdad]]
The Karbala Gap was a 20–25-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and [[Lake Razazah]] to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to [[Baghdad]], and was defended by some of the best units of the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]]. The Iraqi high command had originally positioned two [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] divisions blocking the Karbala Gap.<ref name="stripes.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=13572&archive=true |title=Battle through, around Karbala Gap likely to be 'hell of a fight' |work=Stars and Stripes |date=1 April 2003 |access-date=29 October 2011  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030418111708/http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=13572&archive=true |archive-date=18 April 2003 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Here these forces suffered heavy Coalition air attacks. However, the Coalition had since the beginning of March been conducting a strategic deception operation to convince the Iraqis that the U.S. [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] would be mounting a major assault into northern Iraq from Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michael/kelly1.asp#3.%20Across |title=Across the Euphrates |author=Michael Kelly |work=Jewish World Review |date=3 April 2003 |access-date=15 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223093046/http://jewishworldreview.com/michael/kelly1.asp#3.%20Across |archive-date=23 December 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

This deception plan worked, and on 2 April Saddam's son [[Qusay Hussein]] declared that the American invasion from the south was a feint and ordered troops to be re-deployed from the Karbala front to the north of Baghdad. Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, commander of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayyib. At Musayyib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.

The 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayyib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed [[Multiple Launch Rocket System|artillery rockets]], destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massive firepower and the U.S. forces poured through the gap and onward to Baghdad.

====Initial infiltration====
B Squadron, [[Delta Force]] (known as "Wolverines,") accompanied by several Air Force Special Tactics teams, a Delta intelligence and Target Acquisition, several military working dog teams and two Iraqi—American interpreters, was the first US SOF unit to enter western Iraq, crossing the border from [[Arar, Saudi Arabia|Ar'ar]] in 15 customised [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauer]] 6x6 Special Operations Vehicles and several armed Toyota Hilux pick up trucks. As part of Task Force 20, their formal role was to conduct selected high-priority [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] on suspected chemical weapon facilities before heading for the Haditha Dam complex. Along the way, Delta supported the seizure of H-3 Air Base and also conducted numerous deception operations to confuse the Iraqis as to the disposition of Coalition forces in the west.<ref name="Neville, Leigh p.93">Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.127-128</ref>

====Operation Row and Falconer====
On 18 March 2003, B and D Squadrons of the British 22nd SAS Regiment had now infiltrated Iraq in full strength (D Squadron by air and B Squadron by ground) along with 1 Squadron [[Special Air Service Regiment|Australian SASR]] and headed for [[H-2 Air Base|H-2]] and [[H-3 Air Base]]. They set up observation posts and called in airstrikes that defeated the Iraqi defenders, the combined British and Australian Squadrons took H-2 virtually unopposed, H-3 was secured on 25 March with the assistance of members of Delta Force and by Green Beret ODAs from Bravo company, 1st Battalion 5th SFG; a company of Rangers and Royal Marines from [[45 Commando]] flew from Jordan to the bases and the base was handed over to them. The SAS teams moved to the next objective – the intersection of the two main highways linking Baghdad with Syria and Jordan,<ref>Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00696-7}}, p.10</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.118-119</ref> where both squadrons were involved in conducting interdictions of fleeing Iraqi leadership targets heading for Syria.<ref name="Neville, Leigh 2016"/>

Previously, 16 (Air) Troop of D squadron conducted mounted reconnaissance of an Iraqi army facility near the Syrian border, followed by a harassing attack on the site, two other troops had conducted mobile ambushes on Iraqi units in the area, although they themselves were being hunted by a large Fedayeen Saddam unit mounted in 'technicals.'<ref name="Neville, Leigh 2016"/>

In northern Iraq in early March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron of the [[Special Boat Service|British Special Boat Service]] mounted on Honda ATVs inserted into Iraq from Jordan, its first mission was to conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. F-15E that flew air cover for the team and the bravery of an RAF Chinook that extracted the team under the Fedayeen's 'noses'. A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 air base, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days whilst unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a [[T-72]], the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them – though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft couldn't identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes – although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by an RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.121-123</ref>

====Operation Viking Hammer====
[[File:Operation Viking Hammer 16.jpg|thumb|left|Aftermath of Battle]]
In the early hours of 21 March 2003, as part of [[Operation Viking Hammer]], 64 [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]] struck the [[Ansar al-Islam]] camp and the surrounding sites, the terrorist group – numbering around 700 – had inhabited a valley near [[Halabja]] Iraqi Kurdistan, along with a small [[Kurdistan Islamic Group|Kurdish splinter faction]]; they had prepared a number of defensive positions including anti-aircraft machine guns and maintained a facility, that US intelligence suspected, at which chemical and biological agents may have been developed and stored for future terrorist attacks. Viking Hammer was set to begin on 21 March, however, the ground component of the operation was set back several days owing to the issues around infiltrating most of the 3rd Battalion 10th SFG into Iraq.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.98, p.100</ref> The Islamic Group of Kurdistan surrendered after having suffered 100 men killed in the 21 March strikes.<ref name="Masters of Chaos, Chapter 13">{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit.tau.ac.il/government/robinson1_Ch13.pdf |title=Masters of Chaos, Chapter 13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214133920/http://www.spirit.tau.ac.il/government/robinson1_Ch13.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2012 }}</ref>

On 28 March 2003, the ground element of Operation Viking Hammer was finally launched with a six-pronged advance, each prong was composed of several ODAs from 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and upwards of 1,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. The main advance set off towards Sargat – the location of the suspected chemical and biological weapons site; the force was soon pinned down by DShK heavy machine-gun fire from the surrounding hills. A pair of [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] responded to an urgent [[Close air support|CAS]] request from the force and dropped two [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|500lb JDAMs]] on the Ansar al-Islam machine gun nests and strafed the positions with 20mm cannon before departing due to being low on fuel. The advance began again only to be halted once more by fire from prepared DShK and PKM machine gun nests, Green Berets from ODA 081 deployed a [[Mk 19 grenade launcher]] from the back of a [[Toyota Tacoma]] and suppressed the gun positions allowing the Peshmerga to assault and wipe out the terrorists. After capturing the town of Gulp, the force continued onto the village of Sargat; the village was heavily defended by fortified fighting positions mounting DShKs and mortars along with several [[BM-21 Grad]]. Unable to call in airstrikes due to the close proximity of the Peshmerga, a Green Beret sergeant used a dismounted [[M2 Browning|M2 HMG]] to suppress the entrenched terrorists, his actions allowed the Peshmerga to bring forward their own 82mm Mortars and Grads which forced the Ansar al-Islam fighters to retreat. Task Force Viking advanced to secure the Daramar Gorge – which was surrounded by caves in the rock walls – the Peshmerga were again engaged by small arms fire and RPGs which it and the ODAs returned fire with heavy weapons, however, it became obvious that they couldn't advance any further without air support. To dislodge the terrorists, the [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Controllers]] attached to the ODAs vectored in US Navy F/A-18s which dropped six 500&nbsp;lb JDAMs that shut down any further resistance. During the night, four [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunships]] maintained the pressure on the retreating Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border; the next day, Task Force Viking seized the high ground and pushed down through the valley – surrounding and killing small pockets of remnants from Ansar al-Islam. With their objectives completed, the 3rd Battalion and their Peshmerga returned to the green line to assist the push on Kirkuk and Mosul. A specialist [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] team was brought in to document the find at Sargat, the team recovered traces of several chemicals including [[Ricin]] along with stocks of [[CBRN defense|NBC protective suits]], atropine injectors and Arabic manuals on chemical weapons and [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] construction. Estimates of Ansar al-Islam dead number over 300, many of them foreign fighters, whilst only 22 Peshmerga fighters were killed.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.100-101</ref>

The initial lift had deployed 19 Green Beret ODAs and four ODBs into Northern Iraq.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p. 97-98</ref> Hours after the first of such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space and the rest of the 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group [[Ansar al-Islam]], believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion.<ref name="Peltier2005"/> Eventually Task Force Viking would number 51 ODAs and ODBs alongside some 60,000 Kurdish Peshmerga militia of the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] (PUK).<ref>Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.98</ref>

On 26 March 2003, the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] augmented the invasion's northern front by parachuting into northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield, controlled at the time by elements of 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga. The fall of Kirkuk on 10 April 2003 to the 10th SFG, CIA Paramilitary Teams and Kurdish peshmerga precipitated the 173rd's planned assault, preventing the unit's involvement in combat against Iraqi forces during the invasion.<ref name="10thSFGand173rdAbnBde">{{cite book|author1=Gregory Fontenot|author2=E.

Following the Battle of Haditha Dam, Delta Force handed the dam over to the Rangers and headed north to conduct ambushes along the highway above Tikrit, tying up Iraqi forces in the region and attempting to capture fleeing high-value targets trying to escape to Syria.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.128-130</ref>

On 2 April, Delta was engaged by half a dozen armed technicals from the same anti-special forces Fedayeen that had previously fought the SBS, two Delta operators were wounded (one serious), the squadron requested an urgent aeromedical evacuation and immediate close-air support as a company of truck-borne Iraqi reinforcements arrived. Two MH-60K Blackhawks carrying a para jumper medical team and two MH-60L DAPs of the 160th SOAR responded and engaged the Iraqis, which allowed the Delta operators to move their casualties to an emergency HLZ and they were medevaced to H-1 escorted by a pair of A-10As, however [[Master Sergeant]] George Fernandez died. The DAPs stayed on station and continued to engage the Iraqis, destroying a truck carrying a mortar and several infantry squads, whilst Delta snipers killed Iraqi infantryman firing on the DAPs, another pair of A-10As arrived and dropped airburst 500&nbsp;lb bombs within 20m of Delta positions and killed a large number of Iraqi infantry gathering in a wadi. The DAPs spotted several Iraqi units and engaged them until they were dangerously low on fuel.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.130</ref>

Task Force Viking launched an operation to seize the town of [[Ain Sifni]], the town was strategically important because it straddles the main highway into [[Mosul]], once the town fell, it would be clear for the coalition to advance on Mosul. ODAs from the 3rd and 10th SFG called in airstrikes on the Iraqi garrisons in and around the town, causing many of the Iraqi conscripts to flee, by 5 April 2003, there appeared to be only two Iraqi platoons left in the town. On 6 April, ODAs 051, 055, and 056 assaulted the town – ODAs 055 and 056 provided fire support along with Peshmerga heavy weapons teams, whilst ODA 51 made the actual assault on the town. As ODA 51 cautiously advanced on the village, it came under intense fire – the two platoons of Iraqis turned out to be closer to battalion strength and equipped with heavy weapons like 82mm mortars, anti-aircraft guns, and an artillery piece. After 4 hours of F/A-18 airstrikes and constant heavy weapons fire from ODA 055 and 056, the assault force entered Ain Sifni; soon afterward, Iraqi infantry counterattacked, supported by several mortars, attempting to retake the town, but it was beaten back by ODA 51 and the Kurds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102</ref>

On 6 April 2003, ODA 391 and ODA 392 from the 3rd SFG and ODA 044 from 10th SFG with about 150 Kurdish fighters were the main force involved in the [[Battle of Debecka Pass]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102-105</ref>

On 9 April, nine ODAs from FOB 103 encircled [[Kirkuk]] after fierce fighting to capture the ridges overlooking the approaches to the city, the earlier capture of the nearby city of [[Tuz Khormato|Tuz]] had largely broken the will of the Iraqi Army and only the Fedayeen remained in Kirkuk, the first ODA units entered the city the next day, a week later the 173rd Airborne took over responsibility for the city, after some minor skirmishes the Fedayeen fled.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.105</ref> Staging out of MSS Grizzly, Delta mounted operations to interdict Ba'ath Party HVTs on Highway 1 (Highway 2 and 4 in western Iraq had been secured by British SAS and Australian SAS teams), on 9 April, the combined team seized an airfield near Tikrit.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.130-131</ref>

The successful occupation of Kirkuk came after approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi [[1st Corps (Iraq)|1st Corps]]. The 173rd Brigade would eventually take responsibility for Kirkuk days later, becoming involved in the counterinsurgency fight and remain there until redeploying a year later.<ref name="10thSFGand173rdAbnBde" />

On 11 April an advanced element from FOB 102 numbering no more than 30 Green Berets advanced into Mosul, the advanced had followed several days of heavy airstrikes on three Iraqi divisions defending Mosul; on 13 April, 3rd Battalion 3rd SFG and a battalion from the [[10th Mountain Division]] were ordered to Mosul to relieve the 10th SFG and their Peshmerga allies.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.102, p.105</ref> Further reinforcing operations in Northern Iraq, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] (Special Operations Capable), serving as Landing Force Sixth Fleet, deployed in April to Erbil and subsequently Mosul via Marine [[KC-130]] flights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.26thmeu.marines.mil/About/History.aspx |title=26th MEU History |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, United States Marine Corps |access-date=18 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320232030/http://www.26thmeu.marines.mil/About/History.aspx |archive-date=20 March 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The 26 MEU (SOC) maintained security of the Mosul airfield and surrounding area until relief by the 101st Airborne Division.<ref>{{cite book|title=After Saddam: Prewar Planning and the Occupation of Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWgP_DiGKRUC&pg=PA85|year=2008|publisher=Rand Corporation|isbn=978-0-8330-4458-7|page=85|access-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918234547/https://books.google.com/books?id=nWgP_DiGKRUC&pg=PA85|archive-date=18 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ODAs next mission was to work with a CIA-recruited Sheikh and assist British forces in identifying targets around Basra. The ODA soon established an informant network, they eventually assisted the British in rounding up some 170 Fedayeen in the city; they were eventually replaced by members of G Squadron 22nd SAS Regiment.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.116</ref>

====Battle of Haditha Dam====
The [[Battle of Haditha Dam]] occurred on 24 March 2003, Rangers from [[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Battalion]], [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]], conducted a combat parachute drop onto [[H-1 Air Base]], securing the site as a staging area for operations in the west. Delta Force recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the [[Haditha Dam]] on customised ATVs, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction of a large number of Iraqi armoured vehicles and anti aircraft systems. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion [[70th Armor Regiment|70th Armor]]. C-17 flew the company from Tallil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly – a desert strip established by Delta Force located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.<ref name="Neville, Leigh p.93"/>

On 1 April, C squadron, Delta Force and 3/75th Ranger Regiment conducted a night-time ground assault in their [[Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauers]] and GMVs against the Haditha Dam complex. Three platoons of Rangers seized the dams' administrative buildings with little initial opposition, while a pair of AH-6M Six Guns orbited overhead, soon after daybreak, a Ranger sniper shot and killed 3 Iraqis carrying RPGs on the western side of the dam and Rangers on the eastern side engaged a truck carrying infantry, which led to an hour-long contract. South of the dam, another Ranger platoon was securing the dam's power station and electricity transformer against sabotage, another platoon was occupied establishing blocking positions on the main road into the dam complex. The blocking positions came under the sporadic mortar fire, resulting in the AH-6Ms flying multiple gun runs to silence the mortar positions, another mortar team, firing from a small island was engaged and silenced by a Ranger Javelin team. For five days, Iraqi forces continued to harass the Rangers at the dam, principally with episodic artillery and mortar fire along with several infantry counterattacks against the blocking positions; the [[HIMARS]] rocket system saw its first combat deployment at the dam – firing counter-battery missions, 3 Rangers were killed on 3 April by a [[Car bomb|VBIED]] at the blocking positions, the car was driven by a pregnant Iraqi woman acting distressed and asking for water. Rangers captured an Iraqi forward observer dressed as a civilian after sinking his kayak with .50cal fire, the observer had maps of the Rangers positions.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.93, p.128-130</ref>

====Objective Beaver====
Intelligence indicated that chemical and biological weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the [[Lake Qadisiyah|al Qadisiyah reservoir]] among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a [[DEVGRU]] assault element supported by B Company, [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd Battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky – pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached – engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.133-134</ref>

====Operations in western Iraq====
Bravo and Charlie companies of 1st Battalion [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]] crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges to clear a path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of [[Nukhayb|Nukyab]], Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA's 534 and 532 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab searching for mobile Scud-B TEL launch sites.  ODA 532 also inserted a mobile weather station that provided planners with vital real time weather updates of the battle space. Bravo company set out for the central town of [[Ar-Rutbah|Ar Rutba]] and [[H-3 Air Base]] with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. While waiting, the reconnaissance team and Target Acquisition Marines fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (who were clearing suspects east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove into the middle of the firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.108-111</ref>

The strategic intent of the US Army Special Forces ODAs had been to shut down the main supply routes and deny access around Ar Rutbah and the strategically important H-3 air base, which was defended by a battalion of Iraqi troops and significant numbers of mobile and static anti aircraft guns. On 24 March 2003, the surrounding ODAs supported by Task Force 7 (British [[Special Air Service]]) and Task Force 64 (Australian Special Air Service Regiment) called in constant 24 hours of precision airstrikes on H-3 using SOFLAM target designators, the aerial bombardment forced the Iraqi military vehicles to leave the base and headed towards Baghdad. ODA 521 over watching the highway they were travelling on ambushed the convoy destroying a truck mounted [[ZU-23-2|ZU-23]], the convoy was thrown into disarray, a sandstorm prevented the ODA calling in airstrikes and the convoy scattered into the desert. Bravo company 5th SFG and the coalition SOF secured the airfield, finding a [[Roland (missile)|Roland surface-to-air missile system]], around 80 assorted anti aircraft cannon guns including [[ZSU-23-4|ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7 grail handheld SAMs]] and an enormous amount of ammunition. H-3 was established as an Advanced Operating Base for Bravo company, with supplies delivered by C-130s and MH-47Es; ODA 581 vehicle checkpoint managed to capture the Iraqi general in command of H-3 as he was trying to escape in civilian attire, he was secured and flown by an unmarked CIA SAD Air Branch Little Bird on 28 March for further interrogation. Additionally, ODA 523 discovered what may have been chemical weapons samples in a laboratory on the grounds of H-3.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.111-112</ref>

Bravo company turned its attention to Ar Rutbah, signals intercepts by SOT-A (Support Operations Team – Alpha) and an informer network among the Bedouins as well as inhabitants of the town indicated that around 800 Fedayeen remained in the town; Fedayeen patrols from the town were engaged by surrounding Green Berets and captured. ODAs guided precision airstrikes on Fedayeen anti aircraft guns on the outskirts of the town and on top of the airstrikes, they also struck large groups of Fedayeen militia with Javelin missiles. On 9 April, nine ODAs secured the main roads into the town and commenced a day of near continuous final airstrikes from fix-wing aircraft and Apache helicopters. Civilians from the town approached the Green Berets asking them to stop the bombing, the Green Berets struck a deal with the civilians and they entered the town the next day. A B-52 and 2 F-16Cs flew show of force flights over the town as the Green Berets entered, the Fedayeen blended in with the population. Within days, the Green Berets helped the town to elect a mayor and set up markets, get sixty percent of the electricity grid working and repair water supplies. ODA 521 and 525 continued to operate in the region, stopping several trucks carrying foreign fighters, they disarmed them, took their details and warned them not to come back before sending them to Syria; in late May, the teams were replaced by the [[3rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.113-114</ref>

====Jessica Lynch rescue====

[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|thumb|A combat camera video shows the 1 April 2003 footage of Lynch on a stretcher during her rescue from Iraq.]]
[[Private first class|Private First Class]] [[Jessica Lynch]] of the [[507th Maintenance Company]] was seriously injured and captured after her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi forces during the Battle of Nasiriyah. Initial intelligence that led to her rescue was provided by an informant who approached ODA 553 when it was working in Nasiriyah, the intelligence was passed on and Task Force 20 planned a rescue mission. Launching from the recently captured airfield at Tallil, the rescue force consisted of 290 Rangers from [[1st Ranger Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)|2nd battalion]], 75th Ranger Regiment, around 60 SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] along with [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Pararescue Jumpers]] and Combat Controllers from the [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]] conventional Marines from Task Force Tarawa then currently fighting through the city and aviators from the Army, Marines and Air Force. The plan called for Task Force Tarawa to conduct a deception mission by seizing the bridges across the Euphrates to draw attention away from the hospital Lynch was held at, an airstrike by US Marine AV-8 Harriers would be conducted against one of the bridges to confuse the opposition further and US Marine AH-1W Cobras were tasked to fly over the area to conceal the sound of incoming SOF helicopters. Air cover as provided by an AC-130 Spectre and a Marine EA-6 Prowler to jam any enemy SAM systems that might be present. With the deception mission underway, the SEAL and select Ranger elements would be inserted by MH-60K Blackhawks and four MH-6 Little Birds, supported by four AH-6 attack helicopters and two MH-60L DAPs, the other Rangers would be flown in by Marine CH-46s and CH-53 transport helicopters to establish a cordon around the hospital grounds. The main assault force of SEALs would arrive by a ground convoy of [[Pandur I|AGMS Pandur]] forearmed vehicles and GMV trucks whilst the hostage rescue element landed directly on the objective in MH-6 Little Birds.<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.131</ref>

At 0100 on 1 April 2003, the Marines commenced their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city's power as the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around and on the hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door, the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched down near the hospital entrance with a team of PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Tallil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds. Task Force 20 carried out the first successful US [[POW]] rescue mission since [[World War II]].<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.132</ref>

===Fall of Baghdad (April 2003)===
{{Main|Battle of Baghdad (2003)}}
[[File:DerelictAsadBabil.JPEG|thumb|left|A T72 ''Asad Babil'' abandoned after facing the final U.S. thrust into Baghdad]]

Three weeks into the invasion, the Army's [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]], with the [[1st Marine Division]] also present, moved into [[Baghdad]].<ref name="forces">{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A33016-2003Apr5&notFound=true |title = U.S. Forces Enter the Heart of Baghdad |work = The Washington Post |access-date = November 19, 2006 |first = Alan |last = Sipress |date = April 5, 2003 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180821114627/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/?pagename=article&contentId=A33016-2003Apr5&notFound=true |archive-date = August 21, 2018 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Units of the Iraqi [[Special Republican Guard (Iraq)|Special Republican Guard]] led the defence of the city. The rest of the defenders were a mixture of [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] units, regular army units, [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.

This plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard's assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force [[64th Armor Regiment|1–64 Armor]] of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the "Thunder Run", to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the [[Baghdad airport]]. They met significant resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport, and eventually secured it after heavy fighting.

[[File:IrakKriegM1A1USA.jpg|thumb|An American M1 Abrams tank destroyed in Baghdad]]

The next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.

On 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.

Many Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his [[cult of personality]]. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time. As the British ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported, {{quote|For an oppressed people this final act in the fading daylight, the wrenching down of this ghastly symbol of the regime, is their [[Berlin Wall]] moment. Big Moustache has had his day."<ref>Anton Antonowicz, "Toppling Saddam's Statue Is The Final Triumph For These Oppressed People", ''The Mirror'', 10 April 2003.</ref>}}

As Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich reported in ''On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom'',

{{quote|The Marine Corps colonel in the area saw the Saddam statue as a target of opportunity and decided that the statue must come down. Since we were right there, we chimed in with some loudspeaker support to let the Iraqis know what it was we were attempting to do...

Somehow along the way, somebody had gotten the idea to put a bunch of Iraqi kids onto the wrecker that was to pull the statue down. While the wrecker was pulling the statue down, there were Iraqi children crawling all over it. Finally they brought the statue down.<ref>Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich, team leader, Tactical Psychological Operations Team 1153, 305th Psychological Operations Company, interview by Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Cahill, 31 May 2003 in {{cite book|title=Col.

The fall of Baghdad saw the outbreak of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of [[Al-Kut]] and [[Nasiriyah]] launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.
[[File:Grateful Iraqis welcome American Marines during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.ogg|alt=video of US Marines entering the city|US Marines being welcomed while entering Baghdad in April 2003|right|thumb]]
U.S. General [[Tommy Franks]] assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a "safqua") wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba'ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.

U.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein's government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. Later during the [[military occupation]] period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from [[Task Force 20]], Saddam Hussein's sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]], and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of [[Task Force 121]] during [[Operation Red Dawn]].

===Other areas===

U.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to [[Syria]] and air bases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.

On 15 April, U.S. forces took control of [[Tikrit]], the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines' [[Task Force Tripoli]]. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army's 4th Infantry Division.

===Bush declares "End of major combat operations" (May 2003)===
[[File:USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) Mission Accomplished.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'' returning to port carrying its ''[[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|Mission Accomplished]]'' banner]]
On 1 May 2003, Bush landed on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}}, in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave [[Mission Accomplished speech|a speech]] announcing the end of major combat operations in the Iraq war. Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as an unnecessarily theatrical and expensive stunt. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating "Mission Accomplished." The banner, made by [[White House]] staff and supplied by request of the United States Navy,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/ |title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |last=Bash |first=Dana |publisher=CNN |date=29 October 2003 |access-date =21 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715123158/http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/|archive-date=15 July 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> was criticized as premature.

===Aftermath of the Invasion===
{{Main|Iraq War}}
After the invasion, several factors contributed to the destabilization of Iraq. On May 23, [[L. Paul Bremer]] issued [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2]], dissolving the Iraqi Army and other entities of the former Ba'athist state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20030823_CPAORD_2_Dissolution_of_Entities_with_Annex_A.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040701202042/http://iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20030823_CPAORD_2_Dissolution_of_Entities_with_Annex_A.pdf |archive-date=2004-07-01 }}</ref> The new democratic system elected a majority of Shias, such as The Shia [[United Iraqi Alliance]], who proceeded to ostracize Sunnis.

British troops, in what was codenamed '''Operation''' (or Op) '''TELIC''' participated in the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The 1st Armoured Division was deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] and commanded British forces in the area, securing areas in southern Iraq, including the city of [[Basra]] during the invasion. A total of 46,000 troops of all the British services were committed to the operation at its start, including some 5,000 [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] sailors and 4,000 [[Royal Marines]], 26,000 [[British Army]] soldiers, and 8,100 [[Royal Air Force]] airmen. The British special forces deployment was codenamed '''Operation Row''' and were known as Task Force 7 under Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-West (Task Force Dagger).<ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-4728-0790-8}}, p.90</ref>

==Summary of the invasion==
[[File:AirForce over Iraq.jpg|thumb|upright|Aircraft of the USAF 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and UK and Australian counterparts stationed together at [[Al Udeid Air Base]], Qatar, in southwest Asia, fly over the desert on 14 April 2003.

The U.S.-led Coalition forces toppled the government and captured the key cities of a large nation in only 26 days. The invasion did require a large army build-up like the 1991 Gulf War, but many did not see combat and many were withdrawn after the invasion ended. This proved to be short-sighted, however, due to the requirement for a much larger force to combat the irregular Iraqi forces in the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency]]. General [[Eric Shinseki]], U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recommended "several hundred thousand"<ref>Dave Moniz, ''USA Today'', 2 June 2003</ref> troops be used to maintain post-war order, but then Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]]—and especially his deputy, civilian [[Paul Wolfowitz]]—strongly disagreed. [[General Abizaid]] later said General Shinseki had been right.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/15/world/americas/15iht-cong.3553734.html |title=Top U.S. general resists calls for pullout from Iraq |work=International Herald Tribune |date=15 November 2006 |first=Brian |last=Knowlton |access-date=29 October 2011  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919012551/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/15/world/americas/15iht-cong.3553734.html |archive-date=19 September 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The Iraqi army, armed mainly with older Soviet and Eastern European built equipment,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas C. Bruneau|author2=Florina Cristiana Matei|title=The Routledge Handbook of Civil-Military Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=opJKzPZiADkC&pg=PA139|date=12 November 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-25320-1|pages=139–140|access-date=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915004029/https://books.google.com/books?id=opJKzPZiADkC&pg=PA139|archive-date=15 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> was overall ill-equipped in comparison to the American and British forces. Attacks on U.S. [[Main Supply Route|supply routes]] by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis' artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi [[T-72]] tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the Coalition [[air supremacy]]. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British [[Royal Air Force]] operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The [[main battle tank]]s of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] and British [[Challenger 2]], functioned well in the rapid advance across the country. Despite the many [[rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost, and no tank crew-members were killed by hostile fire, although nearly 40 M1 Abrams were damaged in the attacks.<ref>"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, as many as 40 Abrams tanks were damaged by RPGs. Most were repaired." ''Battle Tanks: Power in the Field'', Page 33, Enslow Publishers, 2006</ref> The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the [[Queen's Royal Lancers]] that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members.

The Iraqi army suffered from poor [[morale]], even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent – reports state that [[Qusay Hussein]], charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.

According to the declassified [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report, "The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq's military forces was the continued interference by Saddam." The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam's inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe an invasion was imminent without further Iraqi provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as "chronically out of touch with reality&nbsp;– preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |title=Russia denies Iraq secrets claim |work=BBC News |date=25 March 2006 |access-date=7 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223055637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4843394.stm |archive-date=23 December 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

==Casualties==

===Death toll===
Estimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely. Estimates on civilian casualties are more variable than those for military personnel. According to [[Iraq Body Count project|Iraq Body Count]], a group that relies on press reports, NGO-based reports and official figures to measure civilian casualties, approximately 7,500 civilians were killed during the invasion phase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iraqbodycount.org/press/pr12.php |title=Iraq Body Count: A Dossier of Civilian Casualties in Iraq, 2003–2005. |access-date=2 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109215135/http://www.iraqbodycount.org/ |archive-date=9 November 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Project on Defense Alternatives study estimated that 3,200–4,300 civilians died during the invasion.<ref name="pda" />

After the ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]] during the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] on 23 March, the bodies of several U.S. soldiers who had been killed in the ambush were shown on Iraqi television. Some of these soldiers had visible gunshot wounds to head, leading to speculation that they had been executed. Except for Sgt. [[Donald Walters]], no evidence has since surfaced to support this scenario and it is generally accepted that the soldiers were killed in action. Five live prisoners of war were also interviewed on the air, a violation of the [[Third Geneva Convention]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/24/1048354495010.html |title=Iraqi TV shows US dead and POWs |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=24 March 2003 |access-date=13 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112090142/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/24/1048354495010.html |archive-date=12 November 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2003/03/pow_tv.single.html|title=How POW TV violates the Geneva Conventions|work=Slate|access-date=9 September 2015|date=March 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017063114/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2003/03/pow_tv.single.html|archive-date=17 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Sergeant Walters was initially reported to have been killed in the ambush after killing several Fedayeen before running out of ammunition.

==Security, looting and war damage==
Massive [[looting]] took place in the days following the 2003 invasion.<ref>Johnson, I.M. "The impact on libraries and archives in Iraq of war and looting in 2003 – a preliminary assessment of the damage and subsequent reconstruction efforts". ''International Information and Library Review'', 37 (3), 2005, 209–271.</ref> According to U.S. officials, the "reality of the situation on the ground" was that hospitals, water plants, and ministries with vital intelligence needed security more than other sites. There were only enough U.S. troops on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some "hard choices" were made.

It was reported that [[National Museum of Iraq|The Iraq Museum]] was among the looted sites. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was soon called into Iraq to track down the stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of stolen pieces at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an "inside job" before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos. Over 5,000 looted items have since been recovered.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/040415/oi.shtml |title=Archaeologists review loss of valuable artifacts one year after looting |first=William |last=Harms |publisher=The University of Chicago Chronicle |date=15 April 2004 |access-date=7 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430095329/http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/040415/oi.shtml |archive-date=30 April 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> An assertion that U.S. forces did not guard the museum because they were guarding the Ministry of Oil and Ministry of Interior is disputed by investigator Colonel [[Matthew Bogdanos]] in his 2005 book ''Thieves of Baghdad''. Bogdanos notes that the Ministry of Oil building was bombed, but the museum complex, which took some fire, was not bombed. He also writes that Saddam Hussein's troops set up sniper's nests inside and on top of the museum, and nevertheless U.S. Marines and soldiers stayed close enough to prevent wholesale looting.

"Two great libraries, with priceless ancient collections"—the Awqaf Library (Library of the Ministry of Religious Endowments) and the [[Iraq National Library and Archive|National Library of Iraq and National Centre for Archives]] (the House of Wisdom)—"have been burned," ''The Boston Globe'' reported in 2003, adding that the libraries at the University of Mosul and University of Basra had been looted. András Riedlmayer, a specialist in Islamic architecture at Harvard University,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.harvard.edu/staff/andras-riedlmayer|title=András Riedlmayer|website=Harvard Library|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> said the U.S. State Department had asked him for advice before the invasion, and that "everybody warned them that the greatest danger was not from Tomahawk missiles but from looting." Noting that [[Modern history of Iraq|Iraq had been unified only in 1922]] and that relatively little attention had been paid to this local history, [[Keith David Watenpaugh|Keith D. Waterpaugh]], a specialist in Ottoman history, said, "Imagine if we could not go back and read ''The New York Times'' from 1922 on. If we are going to help the Iraqi people build a new nation, we don't do it by letting their past be destroyed."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mehegan|first=David|url=http://archive.boston.com/dailyglobe2/111/living/Reconstruction_time_again+.shtml|title=Reconstruction time again|date=21 April 2003|work=Boston Globe|page=B7}}</ref>

More serious for the post-war state of Iraq was the looting of cached weaponry and ordnance which fueled the subsequent insurgency.

===Independent media coverage===
[[Independent media]] also played a prominent role in covering the invasion. The [[Indymedia]] network, among many other independent networks including many journalists from the invading countries, provided reports on the Iraq war. In the United States [[Democracy Now]], hosted by [[Amy Goodman]] has been critical of the reasons for the 2003 invasion and the alleged crimes committed by the U.S. authorities in Iraq.

The [[Israeli Military Censor]] have released gag orders to Fresh and Rotter news platforms preventing them releasing any information about events and action related to the invasion.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/news/2003/03/is031903.html Censorship instructions – American Attack on Iraq] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017063114/http://www.fas.org/sgp/news/2003/03/is031903.html |date=17 October 2015 }}, fas.org</ref>

On the other side, among media not opposing to the invasion, ''[[The Economist]]'' stated in an article on the matter that "the normal diplomatic tools—sanctions, persuasion, pressure, UN resolutions—have all been tried, during 12 deadly but failed years" then giving a mild conditional support to the war stating that "if Mr Hussein refuses to disarm, it would be right to go to war".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1592539 |title=Dealing with Saddam Hussein&nbsp;– Why war would be justified |work=The Economist |date=20 February 2003 |access-date=29 October 2011  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014225926/http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1592539 |archive-date=14 October 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Australian [[war artist]] [[George Gittoes]] collected independent interviews with soldiers while producing his documentary ''[[Soundtrack To War]]''. The war in Iraq provided the first time in history that military on the front lines were able to provide direct, uncensored reportage themselves, thanks to blogging software and the reach of the internet. Dozens of such reporting sites, known as [[Warblog|soldier blogs]] or milblogs, were started during the war. These blogs were more often than not largely pro-war and stated various reasons why the soldiers and Marines felt they were doing the right thing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1543658,00.html |title=The Secret Letter From Iraq |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=6 October 2006 |access-date=1 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907022521/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1543658%2C00.html |archive-date= 7 September 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===International media coverage===
International coverage of the war differed from coverage in the U.S. in a number of ways.
The Arab-language news channel [[Al Jazeera]] and the German satellite channel [[Deutsche Welle]] featured almost twice as much information on the political background of the war.<ref>[http://www.agendasetting.com/newsletter/ICA.pdf International comparison of TV news coverage of Iraq]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229191158/http://www.agendasetting.com/newsletter/ICA.pdf |date=29 February 2012 }}</ref> Al Jazeera also showed scenes of civilian casualties rarely seen in the U.S. media.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of the Iraq War}}
Opponents of the military intervention in Iraq have attacked the decision to invade Iraq along a number of lines, including the human cost of war,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yamada|first1=Seiji|last2=Fawzi|first2=Mary C.

In 2010, an independent commission of inquiry set up by the government of the Netherlands, maintained that UN resolution 1441 "cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council's resolutions." Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the invasion violated international law.<ref name="auto"/>

===Rationale based on faulty evidence===
The central U.S. justification for launching the war was that Saddam Hussein's alleged development of nuclear and biological weapons and purported ties to al-Qaeda made his regime a "grave and growing"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020912-1.html|title=President's Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly, 12 September 2002|access-date=29 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026165139/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/20020912-1.html|archive-date=26 October 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> threat to the United States and the world community.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.transcript/index.html |title=Transcript of Powell's U.N. presentation |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=6 February 2003 |access-date=6 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208074448/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.transcript/index.html |archive-date=8 February 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> During the lead-up to the war and the aftermath of the invasion, critics cast doubt on the evidence supporting this rationale. Concerning Iraq's weapons programs, prominent critics included [[Scott Ritter]], a former U.N. weapons inspector who argued in 2002 that inspections had eliminated the nuclear and chemical weapons programs, and that evidence of their reconstitution would "have been eminently detectable by intelligence services ..." Although it is popularly believed{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} that Saddam Hussein had forced the IAEA weapons inspectors to leave Iraq, they were withdrawn at the request of the US before [[Operation Desert Fox]], the 1998 American bombing campaign. After the build-up of U.S. troops in neighboring states, Saddam welcomed them back and promised complete cooperation with their demands.

Similarly, alleged links between Iraq and al-Qaeda were called into question during the lead-up to the war, and were discredited by a 21 October 2004 report from U.S. Senator [[Carl Levin]], which was later corroborated by an April 2006 report from the Defense Department's inspector general.<ref>Jehl, Douglas.

===Lack of a U.N. mandate===
One of the main questions in the lead-up to the war was whether the [[United Nations Security Council]] would authorize military intervention in Iraq. It became increasingly clear that U.N. authorization would require significant further weapons inspections. Many criticized their effort as unwise, immoral, and illegal. [[Robin Cook]], then the leader of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom House of Commons]] and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blair's cabinet in protest over the UK's decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution. Cook said at the time that: "In principle I believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support. In practice I believe it is against Britain's interests to create a precedent for unilateral military action."<ref>Tempest, Matthew. [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,9061,916123,00.html "Cook resigns from cabinet over Iraq"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423184728/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,9061,916123,00.html |date=23 April 2007 }}.

===Military intervention vs diplomatic solution===
{{Wikisource|French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council}}
Criticisms about the evidence used to justify the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], who responded to U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]]'s 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: "Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspections."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.world.reax/ "Nations take sides after Powell's speech"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308161802/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.world.reax/ |date=8 March 2008 }}.

===Distraction from the war on terrorism and other priorities===
Both supporters and opponents of the Iraq War widely viewed it within the context of a post–[[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September]] world, where the U.S. has sought to make terrorism the defining international security paradigm. Bush often described the Iraq War as a "central front in the [[war on terror]]".<ref>Office of the Press Secretary. [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050628-7.html "President Addresses Nation, Discusses Iraq, War on Terror"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711145020/https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050628-7.html |date=11 July 2017 }}. White House Press Release, 28 June 2005. Retrieved 17 April 2007.</ref> Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda. As Marine Lieutenant General [[Greg Newbold]], the Pentagon's former top operations officer, wrote in a 2006 ''Time'' article, "I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat—al-Qaeda."<ref>Newbold, Greg. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1181629,00.html "Why Iraq Was a Mistake".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827215013/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1181629%2C00.html |date=27 August 2013 }} ''Time'', 9 April 2006.

Critics within this vein have further argued that containment would have been an effective strategy for the Saddam government, and that the top U.S. priorities in the Middle East should be encouraging a solution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], working for the moderation of [[Iran]], and solidifying gains made in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and Central Asia. In an October 2002 speech, Retired Marine Gen. [[Anthony Zinni]], former head of [[United States Central Command|Central Command]] for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department's envoy to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, called Iraq "maybe six or seven," in terms of U.S. Middle East priorities, adding that "the affordability line may be drawn around five."<ref>Boehlert, Eric. [http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/10/17/zinni/index.html?pn=1 "I'm not sure which planet they live on"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203194940/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/10/17/zinni/index.html|date=3 February 2009 }}. ''Salon'', 17 October 2002. Retrieved 17 April 2007.</ref> However, while commander of CENTCOM, Zinni held a very different opinion concerning the threat posed by Iraq. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2000, Zinni said: "Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR), persistent threats to enforcement of the No Fly Zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2000/000229az.pdf |title=Statement of General Anthony C.

===Potential to destabilize the region===
Besides arguing that Iraq was not the top strategic priority in the war on terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was [[Brent Scowcroft]], who served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] to [[George H. W. Bush]]. In a 15 August 2002 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial entitled "Don't attack [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]]", Scowcroft wrote that, "Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region ... there would be an explosion of outrage against us ... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes", and, "could even swell the ranks of the terrorists."<ref>Scowcroft, Brent.

This campaign featured a variety of new terminology, much of it initially coined by the U.S. government or military. The military official name for the invasion was Operation Iraqi Freedom. Also notable was the usage "[[death squad]]s" to refer to Fedayeen paramilitary forces. Members of the Saddam Hussein government were called by disparaging nicknames – e.g., "Chemical Ali" ([[Ali Hassan al-Majid]]), "Baghdad Bob" or "Comical Ali" ([[Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf]]), and "Mrs. Anthrax" or "Chemical Sally" ([[Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash]]).

Terminology introduced or popularized during the war include:
* "[[Axis of evil]]", originally used by Bush during a [[State of the Union]] address on 29 January 2002 to refer to the countries of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html |title=The President's State of the Union Address |date=29 January 2002 |access-date=21 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502151928/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020129-11.html |archive-date=2 May 2009  }}</ref>
* "[[Coalition of the willing]]", a term that originated in the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] era (e.g., interview, Clinton, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], 8 June 1994), and used by the Bush Administration for the countries contributing troops in the invasion, of which the U.S. and UK were the primary members.
* "[[Decapitation strike|Decapitating]] the regime", a euphemism for killing Saddam Hussein.
* "[[Embedded journalist|Embedding]]", United States practice of assigning civilian journalists to U.S. military units.
* "[[Freedom fries]]", a euphemism for [[French fries]] invented to protest the non-participation of [[France]]
* "[[Mother of all bombs]]", a bomb developed and produced to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. Its name echoed Saddam's phrase "[[Mother of all battles]]" to describe the first [[Gulf War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2080106/ |title=Meet the Air Force's 'palace buster.' |access-date=21 September 2009 |last=Kaplan |first=Fred |date=13 March 2003 |publisher=MSN |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050826002400/http://slate.msn.com/id/2080106/ |archive-date=26 August 2005 }}</ref>
* "[[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]]", Rumsfeld's term for European governments not supporting the war: "You're thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I don't. I think that's old Europe."
* "[[Regime change]]", a euphemism for overthrowing a government.
* "[[Shock and Awe]]", the strategy of reducing an enemy's will to fight through displays of overwhelming force.

Many slogans and terms coined came to be used by Bush's political opponents, or those opposed to the war. For example, in April 2003 [[John Kerry]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate in the [[2004 United States Presidential Election|presidential election]], said at a campaign rally: "What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23490-2003Apr3 |archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100302084152/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23490-2003Apr3 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 March 2010 |last=Balz |first=Dan |title=Kerry Angers GOP in Calling For 'Regime Change' in U.S. |work=The Washington Post |page=A10|date=3 April 2003 |access-date=21 July 2006}}</ref> Other war critics use the name "Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL)" to subtly convey their belief with respect to the cause of the war, such as the song "Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL)" by [[David Rovics]], a popular folk protest singer.
