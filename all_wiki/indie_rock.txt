'''Indie rock''' is a genre of [[rock music]] that originated in the United States and United Kingdom in the 1970s. Originally used to describe [[independent record label]]s, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with [[alternative rock]] or "[[Pop rock|guitar pop rock]]".<ref>{{cite book|first=Katja|last=Plemenitas|chapter=The Complexity of Lyrics in Indie Music: The Example of Mumford & Sons|editor-last1=Kennedy|editor-first1=Victor|editor-last2=Gadpaille|editor-first2=Michelle|title=Words and Music|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9UxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA79|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-6438-1|page=79}}</ref> In the 1980s, the use of the term "[[independent music|indie]]" (or "[[indie pop]]") started to shift from its reference to recording companies to describe the style of music produced on [[punk rock|punk]] and [[post-punk]] labels.<ref name=BrownandVolgsten2006p.194>S.

In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped-down, back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream. The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: [[The Strokes]], [[The White Stripes]], [[The Hives]] and [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

==Characteristics==
The term indie rock, which comes from "independent", describes the small and relatively low-budget [[independent record label|label]]s on which it is released and the [[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself]] attitude of the bands and artists involved. Although distribution deals are often struck with major corporate companies, these labels and the bands they host have attempted to retain their autonomy, leaving them free to explore sounds, emotions and subjects of limited appeal to large, mainstream audiences.<ref name=AllMusicIndie>{{Citation|title=Indie rock |journal=Allmusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2687 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wTaUVdId?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2687 |archive-date=February 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}.</ref> The influences and styles of the artists have been extremely diverse, including [[punk rock|punk]], [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], [[post-punk]] and [[country music|country]].<ref name=BrownandVolgsten2006p.194/> The terms "[[alternative rock]]" and "indie rock" were used interchangeably in the 1980s, but after many alternative bands followed [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] into the mainstream in the early 1990s, "indie rock" began to be used to describe those bands, working in a variety of styles, that did not pursue or achieve commercial success.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> Aesthetically speaking, indie rock is characterized as having a careful balance of pop accessibility with noise, experimentation with pop music formulae, sensitive lyrics masked by ironic posturing, a concern with "authenticity", and the depiction of a simple guy or girl.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Stephen|last2=Novara|first2=Vincent J|title=Sound Recording Review: A Guide to Essential American Indie Rock (1980–2005)|journal=Notes: Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association|date=2009|volume=65|issue=4|pages=816–33}}</ref>

''Allmusic'' identifies indie rock as including a number of "varying musical approaches [not] compatible with mainstream tastes".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/indie-rock-ma0000004453|title=Indie Rock – Significant Albums, Artists and Songs – AllMusic|work=AllMusic}}</ref> Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], to punk-folk singers such as [[Ani DiFranco]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative>S.

Connell and C. Gibson, ''Sound Tracks: Popular Music, Identity, and Place'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2003), {{ISBN|0-415-17028-1}}, pp. 101–3.</ref>

Indie rock is noted for having a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of the feminist-informed [[Riot Grrrl]] music of acts like [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Team Dresch]] and [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]].<ref>M.

Although Buzzcocks are often classified as a punk band, it has been argued by the BBC and others <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.23indie.com|title=A definition of indie music|website=www.23indie.com|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> that the publication of Spiral Scratch independently of a major label led to the coining of the name "indie" ("indie" being the shortened form of "independent").

In the United Kingdom the ''[[C86]]'' cassette, a 1986 ''[[NME]]'' compilation featuring [[Primal Scream]], [[The Pastels]], [[The Wedding Present]] and other bands, was a document of the UK indie scene at the start of 1986.

=== Noise rock and shoegazing ===
{{Main|Noise rock|Shoegazing}}

The most abrasive and discordant outgrowth of punk was [[noise rock]], which emphasised loud distorted electric guitars and powerful drums, and was pioneered by bands including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Big Black]] and [[Butthole Surfers]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Noise Rock |journal=Allmusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/noise-rock-d2925 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yLE0mhdZ?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/noise-rock-d2925 |archive-date=April 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}.</ref>

SWANS, an influential band from New York can easily, but mistakenly, be categorised as noise rock, but are more correctly identified as part of the [[No Wave]] scene which included Lydia Lunch, and James Chance & The Contortions.  These bands were documented by [[Brian Eno]] on the seminal compilation album [[No New York]].  A number of prominent [[Independent record label|indie rock record labels]] were founded during the 1980s. These include Washington, D.C.'s [[Dischord Records]] in 1980, [[Seattle]]'s [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]] in 1986<ref>{{Citation|last=R.

[[Chicago]]'s [[Touch and Go Records]] was founded as a [[fanzine]] in 1979 and began to release records during the 1980s.<ref>A. Earles, ''Husker Du: The Story of the Noise-Pop Pioneers Who Launched Modern Rock'' (Voyageur Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7603-3504-4}}, p. 72.</ref>

The Jesus and Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr, indie pop and the [[dream pop]] of [[Cocteau Twins]], were the formative influences for the [[shoegazing]] movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare at their feet and guitar [[effects pedal]]s onstage rather than interact with the audience, acts like [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and later [[Slowdive]] and [[Ride (band)|Ride]] created a loud "wash of sound" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback.<ref name=AMShoegaze>{{Citation|title=Shoegaze |journal=Allmusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/shoegaze-d2680 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wjkalKMT?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/shoegaze-d2680 |archive-date=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}.</ref> The other major movement at the end of the 1980s was the drug-fuelled [[Madchester]] scene. Based around [[The Haçienda]], a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and [[Factory Records]], Madchester bands such as [[Happy Mondays]] and [[The Stone Roses]] mixed [[acid house]] dance rhythms, [[Northern soul]] and [[funk]] with melodic guitar pop.<ref>{{Citation|title=Madchester |journal=Allmusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d4391 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJmvXX5F?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d4391 |archive-date=April 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}.</ref>

===Development: 1990s===

====Alternative enters the mainstream====
{{Main|Alternative rock}}
[[File:Stevemalkmus(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|left|thumb|[[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] singer/guitarist [[Stephen Malkmus]]]]
The 1990s brought major changes to the alternative rock scene. [[Grunge]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Alice in Chains]] broke into the mainstream, achieving commercial chart success and widespread exposure.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> [[Punk revival]] bands like [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]] also became popular and were grouped under the "alternative" umbrella.<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/> Similarly, in the United Kingdom [[Britpop]] saw bands like [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] emerge into the mainstream, abandoning the regional, small-scale and political elements of the 1980s [[Indie pop|indie]] scene.<ref>A. Bennett and J. Stratton, ''Britpop and the English Music Tradition'' (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-6805-3}}, p. 93.</ref> Bands like Hüsker Dü and Violent Femmes were just as prominent during this time period, yet they have remained iconoclastic, and are not the bands that are frequently cited as inspirations to the current generation of indie rockers.<ref>Novara, Vincent J., and Henry Stephen. "A Guide to Essential American Indie Rock (1980–2005)." ''Notes'' 65.4 (2009): 816-33. Web.</ref>

As a result of alternative rock bands moving into the mainstream, the term "alternative" lost its original counter-cultural meaning and began to refer to the new, commercially lighter form of music that was now achieving mainstream success. It has been argued that even the term "sellout"  lost its meaning as grunge made it possible for a niche movement, no matter how radical, to be co-opted by the mainstream, cementing the formation of an individualist, fragmented culture.<ref name="Swanson">C. Swanson [https://nymag.com/arts/art/features/1993-new-museum-exhibit/ "Are We Still Living in 1993?"], retrieved February 26, 2013.</ref> This theory hypothesizes staying independent became a career choice for bands privy to industry functions rather than an ideal, as the principle of resistance to the market evaporated in favor of a more synergistic culture.<ref name="Swanson"/>

The term "indie rock" became associated with the bands and genres that remained dedicated to their independent status.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> Even grunge bands, following their break with success, began to create more independent sounding music, further blurring the lines.<ref name="Swanson"/> Ryan Moore has argued that in the wake of the appropriation of alternative rock by the corporate music industry that what became known as indie rock increasingly turned to the past to produce forms of "retro" rock that drew on [[garage rock]], [[surf rock]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], [[country music|country]] and [[swing music|swing]].<ref>R. Moore, ''Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis'' (New York: New York University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-8147-5748-0}}, p. 11.</ref>

===Proliferation: 2000s===

====Signs of commercial interest====
In the 2000s, the changing music industry, the decline in record sales, the growth of new digital technology and increased use of the Internet as a tool for music promotion, allowed a new wave of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success.<ref name="N. Abebe"/> Existing indie bands that were now able to enter the mainstream included more musically and emotionally complex bands<ref name=Spitz2010>M.

====Post-punk revival====
[[File:Alex Turner and Nick O'Malley Roskilde 2014.jpg|thumb|Arctic Monkeys vocalist [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] and bassist [[Nick O'Malley]].]]
In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped-down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream, which some termed a [[post-punk]] revival, but because the bands came from across the globe, cited diverse influences (from traditional blues, through new wave to grunge), and adopted differing styles of dress, their unity as a genre has been disputed.<ref>E. J. Abbey, ''Garage Rock and its Roots: Musical Rebels and the Drive for Individuality'' (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2006), {{ISBN|0-7864-2564-4}}, pp. 108–12.</ref>

====Emo====
{{Main|Emo}}
During the 1990s a number of indie rock groups, such as [[Sunny Day Real Estate]] and [[Weezer]], diversified the emo genre from its [[hardcore punk]] roots. A number of [[Midwestern emo]] groups started to form during the mid-late 1990s including [[The Promise Ring]], [[The Get Up Kids]], and [[American Football (band)|American Football]]. Emo also broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s, with the platinum-selling success of [[Jimmy Eat World]]'s ''[[Bleed American]]'' (2001) and [[Dashboard Confessional]]'s ''[[The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most]]'' (2001).<ref name="DeRogatis2003"/> The new emo had a more refined sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations.<ref name=DeRogatis2003/> At the same time, use of the term "emo" expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion.<ref>{{Citation|last=H.

===="Landfill Indie"====
By the end of the 2000s, the proliferation of indie bands that appeared after the success of [[The Strokes]] and [[The Libertines]],<ref>https://www.vice.com/en/article/bv8a8w/the-top-50-greatest-landfill-indie-songs-of-all-time</ref><ref>https://www.nme.com/features/landfill-indie-snobbery-2741199</ref> was being referred to "Landfill Indie",<ref>{{Cite web|last=Power|first=Ed|date=28 July 2019|title=How landfill indie swallowed guitar music in the mid-Noughties|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/landfill-indie-kaiser-chiefs-album-razorlight-kooks-ricky-wilson-a9022051.html|access-date=2020-08-29|website=www.independent.co.uk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Beaumont|first=Mark|date=2020-05-04|title=From Britpop to 'landfill indie', lockdown forces us to face our musical pasts|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/britpop-landfill-indie-razorlight-nostalgia-2658671|access-date=2020-08-29|website=NME|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name="T.

As the 1980s idea of indie (referring to a group of self-financed record companies set up by a bunch of 'mavericks' and the bands they liked<ref>https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/best-indie-record-labels/</ref>) was devalued throughout the Britpop-era so that indie ended up describing a form of contemporary guitar-based pop music,<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/22/indie-record-labels-changed-world</ref> which would be at home on the airwaves of [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] as it was on BBC 6 Music,<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0008xc6</ref><ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0108t11</ref> a number of new acts started to be associated with the old 'post-punk' term, even though by then these revivalists were 'post-post-Britpop'.<ref>https://www.slugmag.com/music/reviews-music/top-five/editors-picks-10-post-punk-albums-from-the-2010s-that-youll-love-into-2020/</ref><ref>https://post-punk.com/editors-premiere-hallelujah-so-low/</ref> Acts falling into this [[Post-punk revival|category]]<ref>https://www.albumoftheyear.org/genre/23-post-punk/2005/</ref> include [[Editors (band)|Editors]] and [[Maxïmo Park]]<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/maximo-park-gig-review-post-britpop-meets-post-punk-hedonism-9208666.html</ref><ref>https://www.vice.com/en/article/9bkn9z/how-maximo-parks-a-certain-trigger-is-still-the-ultimate-seth-cohen-album-for-the-oc-era</ref><ref>https://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/reviews/albums/maximo-park-our-earthly-pleasures</ref> 

The dominance of pop and other forms of music over guitar-based indie was leading to predictions of the end of indie rock. However, there continued to be commercial successes like [[Kasabian]]'s ''[[West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum]]'' (2009), which reached number one in the UK.<ref>{{Citation|last=G.
