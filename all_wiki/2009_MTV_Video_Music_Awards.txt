The '''2009 [[MTV Video Music Awards]]''', honoring the best [[music video]]s from the previous year between June 2008 to June 2009, were presented on September 13, 2009, at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]], and televised by [[MTV]]. The ceremony was hosted for a second year in a row by [[Russell Brand]].

[[Beyoncé]], [[Green Day]], and [[Lady Gaga]] were tied for the most-awarded acts of the night, winning three awards each. Beyoncé's "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" would win the award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], while Beyoncé and Lady Gaga were both tied for the largest number of nominations with nine, followed by [[Britney Spears]] with seven. In the aftermath of his [[Death of Michael Jackson|June 2009 death]], the show featured various tributes to [[Michael Jackson]], including an opening act featuring a medley of Jackson's biggest hits and a special appearance by [[Janet Jackson]] to perform her duet "[[Scream (Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song)|Scream]]", and the premiere of a trailer for the posthumous documentary film ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''. 

The ceremony was marred by controversy when [[Kanye West]] [[#Kanye West controversy and debated_incidents|interrupted]] [[Taylor Swift]]'s acceptance of the award for Best Female Video, in order to proclaim that despite her victory, Beyoncé still had "one of the best videos of all time" (in reference to the aforementioned "Single Ladies"). When Beyoncé was eventually awarded Video of the Year, she acknowledged the moment when she had won her [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|first VMA]] as part of [[Destiny's Child]], and invited Swift back to the stage to finish her acceptance speech. The incident was widely-discussed after the ceremony, while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' would deem it to be the "wildest" moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards.

The broadcast  was seen by a total of 9&nbsp;million viewers, a 17% increase over [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards|2008]], making it the most-watched VMAs since [[2004 MTV Video Music Awards|2004]].<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/09/15/mtvs-2009-vmas-pull-nine-million-viewers-best-ratings-since-04/ MTV's 2009 VMAS Pull Nine Million Viewers, Best ratings since '04] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919020301/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/09/15/mtvs-2009-vmas-pull-nine-million-viewers-best-ratings-since-04/ |date=September 19, 2009 }}, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. 2009.</ref><ref>[https://archive.today/20120703021348/http://www.hollyscoop.com/tv/kanye-west/2009-vmas-ratings-up-17_1904.aspx 2009 VMAs Ratings Up 17%], Hollyscoop.com. 2009.</ref>

While [[Taylor Swift]] was giving her acceptance speech for Best Female Video for "[[You Belong with Me]]", [[Kanye West]] walked onto the stage and interrupted her; he took her microphone, saying: "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but [[Beyoncé]] had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!" (West was referring to the music video for "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]"). The cameras then cut to Beyoncé, who looked shocked, saying, "Oh, Kanye.

Emil Wilbekin, managing editor of [[Essence (magazine) |Essence.com]], said West may have gone too far with his antics this time: "I think that it was not Kanye's place to speak for Beyoncé or to ruin Taylor Swift's moment...  It's OK for Kanye to rattle off about himself, but I think he crossed the line when he decided to speak for other people."<ref name=Cnn.com /> Ann Powers of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that "from one vantage point, it was a case of chivalry gone horribly wrong" as West meant to "stand up for" Beyoncé.<ref name= "latimes.com">{{cite news |first= Ann |last= Powers |title=Beyonce and Taylor Swift: Sisterhood is powerful, especially when male-directed|date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate= September 15, 2009| work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/09/beyonce-and-taylor-swift-sisterhood-is-powerful-especially-when-maledirected.html}}</ref>  She added that when Swift accepted Beyoncé's invitation to return to the stage, "The two women [engaged in] a quick sisterly embrace, adding another layer of meaning to an already complicated moment.

On September 15, 2009, two days after the outburst, Swift talked about the matter on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series) |The View]]''. Asked what she was thinking the moment it happened, she stated:
<blockquote>Well, I think my overall thought process was something like, 'Wow, I can't believe I won, this is awesome, don't trip and fall, I'm gonna get to thank the fans, this is so cool.

West's outburst resulted in an [[Internet meme]] which consisted of images of West being superimposed onto other images alongside text in the style of his VMA outburst ("X is one of the greatest Y of all time", or variants thereon, in some cases preceded by "I'm really happy for you" and/or "I'mma let you finish").<ref name="newsroom.mtv.com">{{cite web|accessdate=October 3, 2009|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/09/16/kanye-wests-vma-interruption-photos/|title= Kanye West's VMA Interruption Gives Birth To Internet Photo Meme |publisher=MTV|date=September 16, 2009|author=Anderson, Kyle}}</ref>

After the VMA incident, Kanye West and Lady Gaga's co-headlining, ''Fame Kills'' tour, was cancelled. No official explanation was given for the cancellation of the tour, with people speculating that there was tension among Kanye's and Lady Gaga's camps regarding the creative direction of the tour. However, the negative publicity of Kanye's actions during the VMA's may have been the boiling point that pushed Live Nation to subsequently cancel the thirty-four stop, North American tour.<ref>{{cite web|last =Aswad|first =Jem|title= Kanye West/Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1622849/kanye-west-lady-gagas-fame-kills-tour-canceled/|website= MTV |accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>

The incident was parodied at the 2009 [[Country Music Association Awards]], in which after Swift won the award for Music Video of the Year, [[Carrie Underwood]], who was hosting the awards with [[Brad Paisley]], told Paisley that she thought his video for "[[Welcome to the Future]]" was a great video as well.  Paisley thanked her and then thanked his producers for the video, at which time singer [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] stepped on the stage and pushed Brad Paisley away from the microphone, saying, "Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, I'll let you finish later. Now, Brad Paisley, I know you had a nice video and all that, but Taylor Swift had the best video of all time.  You go girl!" Swift laughed in her seat. Paisley then remarked, "What kind of security do we have if a 4'9" 88-year-old man gets by it?" Earlier in the awards show, Underwood and Paisley's monologue was a duet paying tribute to the song "[[Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys]]", in which the first line was "Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be Kanye". Additionally, when Taylor Swift hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', one part of her monologue (which was done in the form of a song ostensibly about all the things that she was not going to talk about) included [[Bill Hader]] and [[Jason Sudeikis]] as security men charged with preventing Kanye West from coming on stage. She closed her monologue by saying "Kanye West is ''not'' here."<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/clips/taylor-swift-monologue/1173589/ ''Saturday Night Live'': Taylor Swift monologue] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110225626/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/clips/taylor-swift-monologue/1173589 |date= November 10, 2009}}.

The incident is also referenced in [[Eminem]]'s single "[[No Love]]", which he says "Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage/where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?/Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'mma let you finish in a minute, yeah/the rap was tight/But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elyricsworld.com/no_love_lyrics_eminem.html |title= Eminem – No Love Lyrics |publisher=Elyrics world |accessdate= 2016-01-30}}</ref>

In September 2010, West wrote a series of apologetic tweets addressed to Swift including "Beyonce didn't need that. MTV didn't need that and Taylor and her family friends and fans definitely didn't want or need that" and concluding with "I'm sorry Taylor."  West also revealed he had written a song for Swift and if she did not accept the song, he would perform it himself.<ref>{{cite news|title= Kanye West Writes Song In Honor of Taylor Swift |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20015747-10391698.html| first =Devon | last = Thomas| work =[[CBS News]]|date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100909032405/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20015747-10391698.html| archivedate= September 9, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>  Swift said that she received a call from the rapper and accepted.<ref name= "Serpe">{{cite web |url=http://comcast.eonline.com/uberblog/b144247_rattled_taylor_talks_kanyegate.html|title= "Rattled" Taylor Talks Kanyegate, Accepts View-Guilted Apology |first=Gina|last=Serpe|accessdate=December 15, 2010 |work= [[E!]] Online |publisher=Comcast}}</ref> She would respond in the form of a song, "[[Innocent (Taylor Swift song)|Innocent]]", from her 2010 album, ''[[Speak Now]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/09/watch_taylor_swift_sing_about.html|title= Watch Taylor Swift Sing About Kanyegate |work= [[New York (magazine) |New York]] |accessdate= December 15, 2010 |first= Josh|last= Duboff|publisher= New York Media}}</ref> After the incident, West went into seclusion for months, before releasing new music in 2010.

However, when asked if he had any desire to "take back" his actions or apology, West assumed neutrality, explaining, "You know what? I can answer that, but I’m – I’m just – not afraid, but I know that would be such a distraction. It’s such a strong thing, and people have such a strong feeling about it."<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/arts/music/kanye-west-talks-about-his-career-and-album-yeezus.html?_r=0|title = Behind Kanye's Mask |last = Caramanica|first = John|date = June 11, 2013|work = The New York Times|access-date = March 5, 2015}}</ref>

West himself somewhat parodied the event at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2015. When Beyoncé's [[Beyoncé (album)|self-titled 5th studio album]] lost to [[Beck]]'s 2014 album ''[[Morning Phase]]'' for the Album of the Year award, West once again appeared onstage, only to change his mind and return to his seat before speaking. Although the incident initially seemed like a lighthearted joke, West later revealed in an after-show interview with [[E!]] that he was actually genuinely disappointed that Beyoncé did not win the award. He also expressed his disdain for the Grammy's in general, and felt that Beck should "respect artistry" and give his award to Beyoncé. He later apologized to Beck. Following the interview, he was once again met with backlash from many celebrities and commentators.{{citation needed|date= December 2015}} During the ''[[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special]]'', [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Mike Myers]] presented a skit named [[Wayne's World]]. As they were listing the top ten best aspects of SNL, they made a joke twice about West stepping onstage, but this time, West seemed to enjoy it.{{citation needed |date=December 2015}}

At the [[2015 MTV Video Music Awards]], Swift presented the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]] to West. She said that she first met West at the 2009 VMAS when the incident happened. She also said that she is one of West's biggest fans. She told the audience that the first album she and her brother Austin bought was ''[[The College Dropout]]'' by West. At the end of her presentation, she repeated West's speech by saying: "All the other winners, I'm really happy for you, I'm going to let you finish, but Kanye West has had one of the greatest careers of all time."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/kanye-west-wins-award-bizarre-speech-vmas-article-1.2342612 |title=Kanye West wins award for most bizarre speech at VMAs | work =NY Daily News |date= 2015-08-31 |accessdate= 2016-01-30}}</ref>

During West' eleven-minute Video Vanguard Award speech, he was frustrated that [[MTV]] kept referring to his 2009 interruption by continuously running the footage and announcing Swift's presentation of the award to him "'cause it got them more ratings." West pointed out the contradictions in fighting for artists at the expense of other artists and not knowing the right thing to say like a politician would, and saying he felt like he died "for the artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful". He said that he did not understand "how they get five people who worked their entire life..to come stand on the carpet and for the first time in their life be judged on the chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser." Around the incident's 10th anniversary, Swift revealed in the October 2019 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that she took West's criticism of the network personally and accused him of being "two-faced", despite being nice to her backstage and acting remorseful onstage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-rolling-stone-interview-880794/ |title= The Rolling Stone Interview Taylor Swift  |publisher=Rolling Stone|date=2019-09-18 |accessdate= 2019-09-20}}</ref> Swift further commented in a 2020 interview for the documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' that "it was about him creating some revisionist history where he was right all along, and it was correct, right and decent for him to get up and do that to a teenage girl."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-says-kanye-west-moment-burrowed-into-psyche/ |title= Taylor Swift Says Kanye West Moment 'Burrowed Into My Psyche' but She Doesn't 'Think Too Hard' About It Now |publisher=People |date= 2020-01-20}}</ref> At the end of his speech, West announced he was running for the [[Kanye West 2020 presidential campaign|2020 U.S. Presidential Election]].
