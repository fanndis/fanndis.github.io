'''''Juliana, et al. v. United States of America, et al.''''' is a climate-related [[lawsuit]] filed in 2015 by 21 youth plaintiffs against the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] and several [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] officials. The plaintiffs, represented by the non-profit organization [[Our Children's Trust]], include [[Xiuhtezcatl Martinez]], the members of Martinez's organization Earth Guardians, and climatologist [[James Hansen]] as a "guardian for future generations". Some fossil fuel and industry groups intervened as defendants, but were later dropped at their request following the 2016 presidential election.

They assert that the government has knowingly violated their due process rights of life, liberty, and property as well as the government’s sovereign duty to protect public grounds i.e. the Public Trust Doctrine by encouraging and permitting the combustion of fossil fuels. The plaintiffs call for the government to offer “both declaratory and injunctive relief for their claim—specifically, a declaration of the federal government's fiduciary role in preserving the atmosphere and an injunction of its actions which contravene that role.” The case is an example of an area of [[environmental law]] referred to as "atmospheric trust litigation", a concept based on the [[public trust doctrine]] and [[Environmental law#Transboundary responsibility|international responsibility]] related to natural resources. While similar past lawsuits have been dismissed by U.S. courts, ''Juliana v. United States'' gained attention in 2016 when [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon|U.S. District Court of Oregon]] Judge [[Ann Aiken]] declined to dismiss it; Judge Aiken ruled that access to a clean environment was a [[Fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental right]]. In January 2020, a Ninth Circuit panel reversed Judge Aiken and dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. Attorneys for the youth plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.

==Case history==
===Background===
Legal actions to affect [[Global warming|climate change]] by federal and state-level governments have been attempted since the 1990s; one of the first known cases was led by [[Antonio Oposa]], a Philippine lawyer that represented a class-action suit of 43 students against the Philippine government to protect a forest surrounding their village. Oposa had won the suit, which led to numerous other lawsuits around the world.<ref name="atlantic may2012">{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/05/an-inconvenient-lawsuit-teenagers-take-global-warming-to-the-courts/256903/ | title = An Inconvenient Lawsuit: Teenagers Take Global Warming to the Courts | first=  Katherine | last = Ellison | date = May 9, 2012 | accessdate = October 23, 2018  | work = [[The Atlantic]] }}</ref> As of July 2018, there were over 1,000 such lawsuits filed across 24 countries, with 888 of those within the United States.<ref name="cnn july2018">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/health/youth-climate-march/index.html | title = Can 'climate kids' take on governments and win? | first = Katy | last= Scott | date = July 24, 2018 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = [[CNN]] }}</ref> Such cases typically involve youth and children and other future generations, as they help to broaden the appeal of the action, and represent the class that would be most affected by government action or inaction.<ref name="atlantic may2012" />

The Oregon non-profit organization, Our Children's Trust, was created by attorney Julia Olson to help formulate legal cases that could be taken against states and the federal government that would charge them with mitigating climate change under the [[public trust doctrine]].<ref name="psmag">{{cite web |url=https://psmag.com/environment/meet-the-kids-trying-to-put-the-government-on-trial-for-its-climate-policies |first=Andrea |last=Powell |title=Meet The Kids Trying To Put The Government On Trial For Its Climate Policies |website=[[Pacific Standard]] |date=October 29, 2018 |accessdate=November 18, 2018}}</ref> Olson established the non-profit with advice and assistance from [[Mary Christina Wood]], director of the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Program at the [[University of Oregon]], who had been studying the concept of the public trust doctrine and established the idea of "Atmospheric Trust Litigation" to take legal action to make governments responsible for actions related to climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.uoregon.edu/images/uploads/entries/atmo.pdf |first=Mary Christina |last=Wood |title=Atmospheric Trust Litigation, in "Climate Change: A Reader" (2011) |publisher=Carolina Academic Press |date=2008}}</ref><ref name="psmag" /> Part of Our Children's Trust's inspiration was from Oposa's work in the Philippines. Since 2011, Our Children's Trust has been filing various state and federal lawsuits on behalf of youth, though most of these have been dismissed by courts, as courts generally have not ruled that access to a clean environment is a right that can be litigated against.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/climate/kids-climate-lawsuit-lawyer.html |title=Young People Are Suing the Trump Administration Over Climate Change.

A few related cases on climate change have made it to the Supreme Court.  The first, which opened the way for the others, was ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]'', {{ussc|549|497|2007|el=no}}. In that suit, twelve states sued the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for failing to regulate emissions of [[greenhouse gases]] and sought relief. The Court agreed with the states by a 5–4 vote on each of three issues: that the states had standing to sue the EPA for not issuing regulations, that greenhouse gases were air pollutants, and that the EPA was authorized to regulate them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/washington/03scotus.html |first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Justices Say E.P.A. Has Power to Act on Harmful Gases |date=April 21, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref> The majority opinion stated that, while any regulation made by the EPA would be unlikely to stop global warming, the agency should be required to regulate such emissions to reduce the extent of global warming.<ref name="atlantic oct2018" /> Further, Massachusetts v. EPA modified standing precedent by ruling that only one plaintiff had to demonstrate a particularized harm. Subsequent cases were less successful. For example, an attempt to sue public utilities for greenhouse gas emissions under a "[[public nuisance]]" theory invoking the federal common law of nuisance was unanimously rejected by the Court in 2011 in ''[[American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut]]'', {{ussc|564|410|2011|el=no}}, reversing a lower court decision in a case that also found an evenly divided court with regard to standing (as Justice Sotomayor did not participate).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/supreme-court-review/2011/9/aepadler_0.pdf |first=Jonathan H. |last=Adler |title=The Supreme Court Disposes of a Nuisance Suit: ''American Electric Power v. Connecticut'' |work=Cato Supreme Court Review |date=September 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2018}}</ref> Also, a challenge to the EPA's subsequent regulations on greenhouse gases was upheld in part and denied in part in ''[[Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA]]'', {{ussc|573|___|2014|el=no}}, a ruling which rejected the EPA's expansive reading of its powers by a 5–4 vote but permitted EPA to implement greenhouse gas regulation on existing monitored power plants by a 7–2 vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2014/11/utility-air-regulatory-group-v-epa/ |author=Note |title=Utility Air Regulatory Group v.

===Initial hearings===
[[File:James_Hansen_profile_(cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Climatologist [[James Hansen]], who is representing the youth as a "guardian for future generations"]]
The present case was filed in August 2015 with the [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon]], and was assigned to judge [[Ann Aiken]], who was then the chief judge of the court.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://dockets.justia.com/docket/oregon/ordce/6:2015cv01517/123110 | title=Juliana, et al v United States of America, et al}}</ref> The 21 youths, ranging from 8 to 19 at the time of filing, received pro bono representation from Our Children's Trust, and had support of climatologist [[James Hansen]], acting as a "guardian for future generations" in the case filings.<ref name="cnn mar2016" /><ref name="mashable apr2016">{{cite web |url = https://mashable.com/2016/04/11/youth-climate-lawsuit/ | title = 21 American kids are suing the government for not doing enough about global warming | first=  Andrew | last = Freedman | date = April 11, 2016 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = [[Mashable]] }}</ref> (Hansen's granddaughter Sophie Kivlehan was one of the named plaintiffs.)<ref name="Vox">{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/10/23/18010582/childrens-climate-lawsuit-supreme-court |first=Umair |last=Irfan |title=The Supreme Court stepped in to stall a climate lawsuit.

The case was filed against President [[Barack Obama]] and several agencies within the executive branch, and sought confirmation that their constitutional and public trust rights had been violated by the government's actions, and sought an order to enjoin the defendants from continued violation of their rights and to develop a plan to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Among their arguments, the youths' attorneys asserted that the lack of governmental action on climate change discriminated against the youths' generation, since they would be most impacted by climate change but have no voting rights to influence that.<ref name="cnn mar2016">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/09/opinions/sutter-oregon-kids-lawsuit-climate/index.html | title = Climate kids take on the feds | first = John | last= Sutter | date = March 9, 2016 | accessdate= October 23, 2018 | work = [[CNN]] }}</ref>

Three [[fossil fuel]] industry groups, the [[American Petroleum Institute]], [[American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers]], and the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], initially intervened in the case as defendants, joining the U.S. government in trying to have the case dismissed.<ref name="wapost may2017">{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/05/26/three-fossil-fuel-groups-joined-a-historic-climate-lawsuit-now-they-want-to-get-out-of-it |  title = These fossil-fuel groups joined a historic climate lawsuit.

===Government objections===
In early June 2017, the Department of Justice filed a motion requesting that Judge Aiken rule on its prior motion for an [[interlocutory appeal]] to the Ninth Circuit of Judge Aiken's November 2016 decision on the justiciability of the plaintiffs' claims, by June 9 or the department would directly seek a [[writ of mandamus]] regarding the issue in the Ninth Circuit.<ref name="think june2017">{{cite web | url = https://thinkprogress.org/youth-climate-lawsuit-trump-appeal-denied-db0f6a811c08/ | title = Federal judge denies Trump administration appeal in youth climate lawsuit | first=  Natasha | last =Geiling | date = June 9, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = [[Think Progress]] }}</ref> Judge Aiken denied the motion requesting the interlocutory appeal on June 8,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2017/20170608_docket-615-cv-1517_order.pdf|title=Order (June 8, 2018)|accessdate=October 28, 2020}}</ref> leading the government to petition the Ninth Circuit for a writ of mandamus on June 11. The government's petition argued that the Ninth Circuit needed to act to correct "multiple and clear errors of law in refusing to dismiss an action that seeks wholesale changes in federal government policy based on utterly unprecedented legal theories".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://mashable.com/2017/06/11/trump-climate-lawsuit-drastic-step | title = Trump administration takes a 'drastic' step to stop youth climate lawsuit | first = Maria | last = Gallucci |date = June 11, 2017 |  accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = [[Mashable]] }}</ref> The government also argued that the pre-trial discovery phase would cause the government harm due to the volume of data and evidence they would need to provide.<ref name="mashable nov2017">{{cite web | url = https://mashable.com/2017/11/17/youth-climate-lawsuit-ninth-circuit-oral-arguments/ | title = The feds are afraid of 21 teens suing on climate, and an appeals court wants to know why | first = Andrew | last = Freedman | date = November 17, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = [[Mashable]] }}</ref>

After receiving responses from the plaintiffs, the Ninth Circuit opted in November 2017 to hear oral arguments before making their decision.<ref name="mashable nov2017" /> These arguments were held on December 11, 2017 in front of Judges [[Sidney Thomas]], [[Alex Kozinski]], and [[Marsha Berzon]]. A few days later, Judge Kozinski stepped down from the Ninth Circuit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-judge-alex-kozinski-20171218-story.html|title=9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski steps down after accusations of sexual misconduct | last=Dolan |first=Maura |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 18, 2017 |accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref> On December 21, 2017, Judge [[Michelle Friedland]] was appointed to replace Kozinski.

The government then petitioned the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] requesting a stay to delay the trial. On July 30, 2018, the Supreme Court issued a brief order, denying the government's request for a stay as premature but expressing skepticism about the lawsuit, as well as noting that the breadth of the plaintiffs' claims was "striking" and requesting that the District Court issue a prompt ruling on the government's motions challenging the overall justiciability of those claims.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/18a65.html|title=Docket for 18A65|website=www.supremecourt.gov|accessdate=October 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/supreme_court_refuses_stay_in_youths_climate_change_suit_while_offering_adv|first=Debra Cassens|last=Weiss|title=Supreme Court refuses stay in youths' climate change suit, while offering advice to trial court |website=ABA Journal|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref> 

Following the Supreme Court's order, the government again presented two motions to dismiss the case to Judge Aiken in July 2018. One motion stated that the case, in addressing multiple government agencies, violated the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], while the other motion challenged the youths' standing in the case.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.climateliabilitynews.org/2018/07/19/federal-judge-to-rule-on-latest-government-challenge-to-youth-climate-suit/ | title= Federal Judge to Rule on Latest Government Challenge to Youth Climate Suit | first = Dana | last = Drugmand | date = July 19, 2018 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work  = Climate Liability News }}</ref> While Judge Aiken said she would rule promptly on the motions, she had not issued her decision by October 5, causing the government again to request an emergency stay from the Ninth Circuit via a second writ of mandamus, asking them to delay the case until Aiken ruled on the two motions.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.climateliabilitynews.org/2018/10/06/trump-administration-kids-climate-case/ | title = As Trial Looms, Trump Administration Still Trying to Stop Kids Climate Case | first = Karen | last =Savage |date = October 6, 2018 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = Climate Liability News }}</ref> On October 15, Judge Aiken ruled on the two motions, denying both. Aiken also removed President Trump as a defendant in the case without prejudice, meaning that he could be re-added to the case at a later stage, and reaffirmed the trial start date of October 29.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.climateliabilitynews.org/2018/10/15/youth-climate-case-ann-aiken/ | title = Judge Denies Government Motions to Dismiss Youth Climate Case | first=  Karen | last = Savage | date = October 15, 2018 | accessdate = October 23, 2018 | work = Climate Liability News }}</ref>

U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken issued an order certifying the case for interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and staying the case pending this decision. Judge Aiken declared that she did not “make this decision lightly,” emphasizing that, while she stood by her prior rulings recommending that the case should go to trial, she believed the case was better suited for appeal after trial, not before. Experts in the fields of constitutional law, climate change, and public health, and several leading women’s, children’s, environmental, and human rights organizations filing ten amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in support of the plaintiffs, urging the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to grant the en banc petition.

On permission granted, the government filed a petition with the Ninth Circuit on November 30, 2018, for interlocutory review of the order on motions to dismiss and the order on motions for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment. An answer was filed with the Court by the plaintiffs on December 10, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571d109b04426270152febe0/t/5c0f0f5faa4a99f7e98ae5b2/1544490848118/DktEntry+2-1+Opp+to+Fifth+Ninth+Circuit+Petition.pdf|title=Plaintiff's answer in opposition to interlocutory appeal (Dec. 10, 2018).|accessdate=October 28, 2020}}</ref>

Some legal experts believed that the interlocutory appeal "could (and, indeed, likely will) bring this litigation to an end" due to the Supreme Court's already-expressed skepticism.<ref name="Adler" /> Other experts, such as the director of Columbia University's climate change center, noted that any decision in favor of the plaintiffs likely would be reversed by the Supreme Court, which has been reluctant to declare new rights and which unanimously held in ''[[American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut]]'' that it was not for the courts to decide appropriate levels of pollution.<ref name="Atlantic" />

On January 17, 2020, on a 2–1 vote, the Ninth Circuit panel dismissed the case for lack of Article III standing. Writing for the majority, [[Andrew D. Hurwitz|Judge Hurwitz]] wrote that "it is beyond the power of an Article III court to order, design, supervise, or implement the plaintiffs' requested remedial plan.
