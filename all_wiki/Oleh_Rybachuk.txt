Due to the information of [[The Washington Times]] anonymous source within the [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]], published in November 2018, Rybachuk was an agent of the Soviet and later Russian Main intelligence directorate ([[GRU (G.U.)|GRU]]).<ref>[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/nov/19/russian-hybrid-warfare-ukraine/]</ref> Rybachuk himself doesn't deny contacts with [[KGB]] during the Soviet times. He told about them in the end of 2017 in an interview, explaining that in the Soviet Union there was no possibility to work abroad with no special services connection all the while.<ref>[https://www.rudenko.kiev.ua/interview/oleh-rybachuk-ya-pratsyuvav-radyanskymy]</ref> He disowns his accusation for the Russian special services performance and says that the respective information diffusion in Ukrainian news media is a special-order campaign designed by the Executive Office of the President against him.<ref>[https://detector.media/infospace/article/142880/2018-11-27-agentom-yakoi-spetssluzhbi-e-oleg-ribachuk/]</ref>
