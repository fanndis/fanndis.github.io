Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms, and [[prostitution law|its legal status]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]] (sometimes from region to region within a given country), ranging from being an enforced or unenforced crime, to unregulated, to a regulated profession. It is one branch of the [[sex industry]], along with [[pornography]], [[Stripper|stripping]], and [[Erotic dance|erotic dancing]]. [[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In [[Escort agency|escort prostitution]], the act may take place at the client's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call). Another form is [[street prostitution]].

There are about 42 million prostitutes in the world, living all over the world (though most of Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa lacks data, studied countries in that large region rank as top [[sex tourism]] destinations).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1|title=There Are 42 Million Prostitutes In The World, And Here's Where They Live|author=Gus Lubin|date=17 January 2012|website=Business Insider|access-date=14 December 2015}}</ref> Estimates place the annual revenue generated by prostitution worldwide to be over $100 billion.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/prostitution/| title= Prostitution Market Value| access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>
The majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients.

The position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions. Some view prostitution as a form of exploitation of or [[violence against women]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/decriminalizing-prostitution-may-not-be-the-answer|title=Prostitution by Any Other Name Is Still Exploitation|author=Meghan Murphy|date=12 December 2013|website=VICE|access-date=4 February 2016}}</ref> and [[Prostitution of children|children]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/29/opinions/saar-child-trafficking-united-states/|title=The myth of child prostitution|author=Malika Saada Saar|date=29 July 2015|website=CNN|access-date=4 February 2016}}</ref> that helps to create a supply of victims for [[Sex trafficking|human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/international/human-rights/legalized-prostitution-human-trafficking-inflows|title=Does legalized prostitution increase human trafficking?|author=Carol Tan|date=2 January 2014|website=Journalist's Resource|access-date=4 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="Cho1" /> Some critics of prostitution as an [[institution]] are supporters of the "[[Nordic model approach to prostitution|Nordic model]]", which decriminalizes the act of selling sex, but makes the purchase of sex illegal.

== Etymology and terminology ==
===General===
[[File:EN BESKYTTERINDE AF INDUSTRIEN.gif|thumb|Prostitute c.1890]]

''Prostitute'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''prostituta''. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of "''pro''" meaning "up front" or "forward" and "''stituere''", defined as "to offer up for sale".{{sfn|Perkins|Lovejoy|2007|pp=2–3}} Another explanation is that ''prostituta'' is a composition of ''pro'' and ''statuere'' (to cause to stand, to station, place erect). A literal translation therefore is: "to put up front for sale" or "to place forward". The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' states, "The notion of 'sex for hire' is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one 'exposed to lust' or sex 'indiscriminately offered.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=prostitute&searchmode=none |title=''prostitute'' |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=26 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ |title=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=26 June 2012}}</ref>

The word ''prostitute'' was then carried down through various languages to the present-day Western society. Most [[sex worker activists]] groups reject the word ''prostitute'' and since the late 1970s have used the term ''sex worker'' instead. However, ''sex worker'' can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sexual nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sex%20worker |title=''sex worker'' |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=13 August 2010 |access-date=26 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-120025|title = Sociology of Sex Work| journal=Annual Review of Sociology| volume=35| pages=213–234|year = 2009|last1 = Weitzer|first1 = Ronald}}</ref>

[[File:Dirck van Baburen - The Procuress - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]] (1622)]]

A variety of terms are used for those who engage in prostitution, some of which distinguish between different types of prostitution or imply a value judgment about them. Common alternatives for ''prostitute'' include ''[[Escort agency|escort]]'' and ''whore''; however, not all professional escorts are prostitutes.

The English word ''whore'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''hōra'', from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*hōrōn'' (prostitute), which derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] ''*keh₂-'' meaning "desire", a root which has also given us Latin ''cārus'' (dear), whence the French ''cher'' (dear, expensive) and the Latin ''cāritās'' (love, charity). Use of the word ''whore'' is widely considered [[pejorative]], especially in its modern slang form of ''ho''. In Germany, however, most prostitutes' organizations deliberately use the word ''Hure'' (whore) since they feel that ''prostitute'' is a bureaucratic term.  Those seeking to remove the social stigma associated with prostitution often promote terminology such as ''[[sex worker]]'', ''commercial sex worker'' (CSW) or ''sex trade worker''.  Another commonly used word for a prostitute is ''hooker''. Although a popular etymology connects "hooker" with [[Joseph Hooker]], a Union general in the [[American Civil War]], the word more likely comes from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the [[Corlear's Hook]] area of [[Manhattan]] in the 1820s, who came to be referred to as "hookers".<ref>{{cite web|title=AmericanHeritage.com / History Now |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |date=21 May 2006 |access-date=22 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521101352/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |archive-date=21 May 2006 }}</ref> A ''streetwalker'' solicits customers on the streets or in public places, while a ''[[call girl]]'' makes appointments by phone, or in recent years, through email or the internet.

Correctly or not, use of the word ''prostitute'' without specifying a sex may commonly be assumed to be female; compound terms such as ''[[male prostitution]]'' or ''male escort'' are therefore often used to identify males.  Those offering services to female customers are commonly known as ''gigolos''; those offering services to male customers are ''hustlers'' or ''rent boys''.

===Procuring===
{{main|Procuring (prostitution)}}
Organizers of prostitution may be known as ''[[pimp]]s'' (if male) and ''[[madam]]s'' or ''[[Mama-san]]'' (if female). More formally, one who is said to practice procuring is a ''procurer'', or ''procuress''.

===Clients===
{{Main|Client (prostitution)}}

Clients of prostitutes, most often men by [[prevalence]], are sometimes known as ''johns'' or ''tricks'' in North America and ''punters'' in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. These slang terms are used among both prostitutes and law enforcement for persons who solicit prostitutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |title=Adult Industry Terms and Acronyms |publisher=Forum.myredbook.com |access-date=23 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209113009/http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |archive-date=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The term ''john'' may have originated from the frequent customer practice of giving one's name as "John", a common name in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, in an effort to maintain anonymity. In some places, men who drive around [[red-light district]]s for the purpose of soliciting prostitutes are also known as ''[[kerb crawler]]s''.

Female clients of prostitutes are sometimes referred to as ''janes'' or ''sugar mamas''.<ref name="janes1">{{cite web |last1=Ling |first1=Justin |title=Opposition parties shy away from sex-work debate |url=https://www.dailyxtra.com/opposition-parties-shy-away-from-sex-work-debate-58724 |website=Xtra |access-date=26 August 2018 |date=4 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="janes2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1950-7-things-you-learn-as-cop-doing-prostitution-stings.html|title=7 Things You Learn As A Cop Pretending To Be A Hooker|website=Cracked.com|date=11 October 2015}}</ref><ref name="sm1">[[Alcinda Honwana|Honwana, Alcinda]].

=== Other meanings ===
The word "prostitution" can also be used metaphorically to mean debasing oneself or working towards an unworthy cause or "selling out".<ref name="education.yahoo.com">{{cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |title=prostitution – Dictionary definition and pronunciation – Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |access-date=23 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323211921/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |archive-date=23 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In this sense, "prostituting oneself" or "whoring oneself" the services or acts performed are typically not sexual.  For instance, in the book ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', [[Holden Caulfield]] says of his brother ("D.B."): "Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even mention them to me." D.B. is not literally a prostitute; Holden feels that his job writing [[B-movie]] screenplays is morally debasing.

The prostitution metaphor, "traditionally used to signify political inconstancy, unreliability, fickleness, a lack of firm values and integrity, and venality, has long been a staple of Russian political rhetoric."<ref name="jspsps-2015">Riabova, Tatiana and Riabova, Oleg (2015) "Gayromaidan" in Fedor, Julie; Portnov, Andriy; and Umland, Andraes (eds.)

For the sake of the longed alliance with imperialist democracies [Stalin] has brought the Comintern to the last stages of political prostitution."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/09/newwar.htm |publisher=Marxists.org |title = New War Flows from Versailles Banditry |author=Trotsky, Leon| author-link = Leon Trotsky |date = September 1938 |access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref>

Besides targeting political figures, the term is used in relation to organizations and even small countries, which "have no choice but to sell themselves", because their voice in world affairs is insignificant. In 2007, a Russian caricature depicted the Baltic states as three "ladies of the night", "vying for the attentions of Uncle Sam, since the Russian client has run out of money".<ref name="jspsps-2015"/>

Usage of the "political prostitute" moniker is by no means unique to Russian political lexicon, such as when a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' contributor expressed the opinion that [[Donald Trump]] was "prostituting himself to feed his ego and gain power" when he ran for President of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-gerdy/winner-or-just-another-po_b_9347740.html |work=The Huffington Post |title = Winner or Just Another Political Prostitute? |author=Gerdy, Tom |date = 29 February 2016 |access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref>

Sex work researcher and writer Gail Pheterson writes that these metaphorical usages exist because "the term "prostitute" gradually took on a Christian moralist tradition, as being synonymous with debasement of oneself or of others for the purpose of ill-gotten gains".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/466259|jstor=466259|title=The Whore Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness|journal=Social Text|issue=37|pages=39–64|year=1993|last1=Pheterson|first1=Gail}}</ref>

[[Prostitution in ancient Rome]] was legal, public, and widespread. A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category '''''prostibulae'''''. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose, sometimes by large-scale "prostitute farmers" who took [[child abandonment|abandoned children]]. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=New Advent |access-date=26 August 2018|quote= But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution.}}</ref> Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women.

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]], and [[Osaka]], Japan. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesan]]s in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The oiran were considered a type of {{nihongo|''yūjo''|遊女}} "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the {{nihongo|''tayū''|太夫}} was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and an educated wit was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761. Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a "private agreement" reached between a woman and a man in a [[brothel]]. [[Yoshiwara]] has a large number of [[soapland]]s that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men's bodies. They were originally known as toruko-buro, meaning [[Turkish bath]].

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of the [[Indian subcontinent]], particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans danced, sang, recited poetry and entertained their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film, and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm |title=Mapping cultures |publisher=The Hindu |date=11 August 2004 |access-date=23 May 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
{{Main|Courtesan}}
Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] the definition of a prostitute has been ambiguous, with various secular and canonical organizations defining prostitution in constantly evolving terms. Even though medieval secular authorities created legislation to deal with the phenomenon of prostitution, they rarely attempted to define what a prostitute was because it was deemed unnecessary "to specify exactly who fell into that [specific] category" of a prostitute.<ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110">{{cite journal|last=Rollo-Koster|first=Joelle|title=From Prostitutes to Brides of Christ: The Avignonese Repentises in the Late Middle Ages|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|year=2002|volume=31|issue=1|page=110|doi=10.1215/10829636-32-1-109|s2cid=170873311}}</ref> The first known definition of prostitution was found in Marseille's thirteenth-century statutes, which included a chapter entitled De meretricibus ("regarding prostitutes").<ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110" /> The Marseillais designated prostitutes as "public girls" who, day and night, received two or more men in their house, and as a woman who "did business trading [their bodies], within the confine[s] of a [[brothel]]."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} A fourteenth-century English tract, Fasciculus Morum, states that the term ''prostitute'' (termed '[[meretrix]]' in this document), "must be applied only to those women who give themselves to anyone and will refuse none, and that for monetary gain".{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} In general prostitution was not typically a life-time career choice for women. Women usually alternated their career of prostitution with "petty retailing, and victualing," or only occasionally turning to prostitution in times of great financial need.{{sfn|Roberts|1992|p=65}} Women who became prostitutes often did not have the familial ties or means to protect themselves from the lure of prostitution, and it has been recorded on several occasions that mothers would be charged with prostituting their own daughters in exchange for extra money.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Medieval civilians accepted without question the fact of prostitution, it was necessary part of medieval life.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=16}} Prostitutes subverted the sexual tendencies of male youth, just by existing. With the establishment of prostitution men were less likely to collectively rape honest women of marriageable and re-marriageable age.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=32}} This is most clearly demonstrated in [[St. Augustine]]'s claim that "the removal of the institution would bring lust into all aspects of the world."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=34}} Meaning that without prostitutes to subvert male tendencies, men would go after innocent women instead, thus the prostitutes were actually doing society a favor.

In urban societies there was an erroneous view that prostitution was flourishing more in rural regions rather than in cities, however it has been proven that prostitution was more rampant in cities and large towns.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Although there were wandering prostitutes in rural areas who worked according to the calendar of fairs, similar to riding a circuit, in which prostitutes stopped by various towns based on what event was going on at the time, most prostitutes remained in cities. Cities tended to draw more prostitutes due to the sheer size of the population and the institutionalization of prostitution in urban areas which made it more rampant in metropolitan regions.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Furthermore, in both urban and rural areas of society, women who did not live under the rule of male authority were more likely to be suspected of prostitution than their oppressed counterparts because of the fear of women who did not fit into a stereotypical category outside of marriage or religious life.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Secular law, like most other aspects of prostitution in the Middle Ages, is difficult to generalize due to the regional variations in attitudes towards prostitution.{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–31}} The global trend of the thirteenth century was toward the development of positive policy on prostitution as laws exiling prostitutes changed towards [[sumptuary laws]] and the confinement of prostitutes to [[red light districts]].{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}}

Sumptuary laws became the regulatory norm for prostitutes and included making [[courtesans]] "wear a shoulder-knot of a particular color as a badge of their calling" to be able to easily distinguish the prostitute from a respectable woman in society.{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}} The color that designated them as prostitutes could vary from different earth tones to yellow, as was usually designated as a color of shame in the Hebrew communities.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | pp=95-117}} These laws, however, proved no impediment to wealthier prostitutes because their glamorous appearances were almost indistinguishable from noble women.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | p=101}} In the [[14th century]], [[London]] prostitutes were only tolerated when they wore yellow hoods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mortimer |first1=Ian |title=The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England: A Handbook for Visitors to the Fourteenth Century |date=2012 |publisher=Random House |isbn=9781448103782 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRzMnElSh3EC |language=en}}</ref>

Although brothels were still present in most cities and urban centers, and could range from private bordelages run by a procuress from her home to public baths and centers established by municipal legislation, the only centers for prostitution legally allowed were the institutionalized and publicly funded brothels.{{sfnm|Karras|1998|1p=32|Rossiaud|1996|2p=6}} However this did not prevent illegal brothels from thriving. Furthermore, brothels theoretically banned the [[patronage]] of married men and clergy also, but it was sporadically enforced and there is evidence of clergymen present in brawls that were documented in brothels.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=41}} Thus the clergy were at least present in brothels at some point or another. Brothels also settled the "obsessive fear of the sharing of women" and solved the issue of "collective security."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=42}} The lives of prostitutes in brothels were not cloistered like that of nuns and "only some lived permanently in the streets assigned to them."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=43}} Prostitutes were only allowed to practice their trade in the brothel in which they worked.{{sfn|Geremek|2006|p=216}} Brothels were also used to protect prostitutes and their clients through various regulations. For example, the law that "forbid brothel keepers [from] beat[ing] them."{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}} However, brothel regulations also hindered prostitutes' lives by forbidding them from having "lovers other than their customers" or from having a favored customer.{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}}

Courts showed the conflicting views on the role of prostitutes in secular law as prostitutes could not inherit property, defend themselves in court, or make accusations in court.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=37}} However, prostitutes were sometimes called upon as witnesses during trial.{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–107}}

=== 16th–17th centuries ===
By the end of the 15th century attitudes seemed to have begun to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of [[syphilis]] in [[Naples]] 1494 which later swept across Europe, and which may have originated from the [[Columbian Exchange]],<ref>"[http://www.livescience.com/history/080114-syphilis-columbus.html Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe]". [[LiveScience]]. 15 January 2008.</ref> and the prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] from the earlier 13th century, may have been causes of this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague, and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothel-keeping and prostitution was also used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the sixteenth-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}}
[[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."<ref>{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470–1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}</ref> The prostitute was considered a "whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold: “acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]]."{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the fourteenth century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were to be excluded from the Church as long as they practiced.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=36}} Around the twelfth century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4|pmid=11622758}}</ref> Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. 'Magdalene Homes' were particularly popular and peaked especially in the early fourteenth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1994|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73–4}} Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes, with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|pp=41–42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/History/teaching/protref/women/WR0911.htm|title=L. Roper: Luther on sex, marriage and motherhood. The University of Warwick}}</ref> In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves by particular signs, sometimes wearing very short hair or no hair at all, or wearing [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated in this case the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession. In some cultures, prostitutes were the sole women allowed to sing in public or act in theatrical performances.

=== 18th century ===
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ,'' the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfn|Gazali|2001|p=106}}<ref name=Nedim>{{cite book|title=Nedim and the poetics of the Ottoman court|author=Kemal Sılay|isbn=978-1-878318-09-1|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|year=1994}}</ref> in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]], who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also worked as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242 "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are {{linktext|bardash}}es [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]], and the details of their sexual practices.

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they frequently visited local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.<ref name=Fisher-2007>{{cite journal|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-19th-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 [304–5]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007}}</ref> As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, legalized prostitution became a public controversy as France and then the United Kingdom passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation mandating pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. This legislation applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. France, instead of trying to outlaw prostitution began to view prostitution as an evil necessary for society to function. France chose to regulate prostitution, introducing a Morals Brigade onto the streets of Paris.{{sfn|Harsin|1985|pp=3, 25}}  A similar situation did in fact exist in the [[Russian Empire]]; prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels were given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. A major work, ''[[Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social, and Sanitary Aspects]]'', was published by [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]] in 1857, which estimated that
the County of London had 80,000 prostitutes and that 1 house in 60 was serving as a brothel.{{Sfn|Gale|2002|p=245}} [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During this period, prostitution was also very prominent in the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco]] as the population was mainly men, due to the influx from the [[Gold Rush]].{{sfn|Sears|2014| }} One of the more successful madams was [[Belle Cora (Arabella Ryan)|Belle Cora]], who inadvertently got involved in a scandal involving her husband, Charles Cora, shooting US Marshal William H. Richardson.{{sfn|Jensen|2011| }} This led to the rise of new statutes against prostitution, gambling and other activities seen as "immoral".{{sfn|Sears|2014| }}

In contemporary Communist countries, it remains illegal but is nonetheless common.{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FSNB0G7f4CsC&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=prostitution+in+former+soviet+countries&source=bl&ots=vtvOji8f76&sig=t6tNuWtoT4OzR2W5shTCYe1SfWM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwia4520td3aAhUGJ8AKHbOqCKY4ChDoAQhSMAc#v=onepage&q=prostitution%20in%20former%20soviet%20countries&f=false 169]}} The economic decline brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to increased prostitution in many current or former Communist countries.<ref name="Slate Explainer">{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title="Socialist Whores": What did Karl Marx think of prostitutes?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/socialist_whores_what_did_karl_marx_think_of_prostitution_.html|access-date=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]|date=5 November 2011}}</ref>

Originally, prostitution was widely legal in the United States. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. On the other hand, prostitution generated much national revenue in South Korea, hence the military government encouraged [[prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military|prostitution for the U.S. military]].<ref name=IBT20130429>{{cite news | first=Palash | last=Ghosh | title=South Korea: A Thriving Sex Industry In A Powerful, Wealthy Super-State | date=29 April 2013 | publisher=[[International Business Times]] | url =http://www.ibtimes.com/south-korea-thriving-sex-industry-powerful-wealthy-super-state-1222647 | access-date = 21 May 2013 }}</ref><ref name=joongang20081030>{{cite news|first=Soo-mee |last=Park |title=Former sex workers in fight for compensation |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=[[Joongang Daily]] |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |access-date=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430220310/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |archive-date=30 April 2013 }}</ref>

In 1956, the United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of [[prostitution in the United Kingdom]] itself, it prohibited such activities as running a brothel. Soliciting was made illegal by the [[Street Offences Act 1959]]. These laws were partly repealed, and altered, by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] and the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]].

Beginning in the late 1980s, many states in the US increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly HIV-positive. Penalties for felony prostitution vary, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison.

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]].

=== Attitudes ===
{{Further|Feminist views on prostitution}}

Roughly speaking, the possible attitudes are:
* "Prostitution should be tolerated by society":
**[[decriminalization]]: "prostitution is labor like any other. Sex industry premises should not be subject to any special regulation or laws", the current situation in New Zealand; the laws against operating a brothel, pimping and street prostitution are struck down, but prostitution is hardly regulated at all. Proponents of this view often cite instances of government regulation under legalization that they consider intrusive, demeaning, or violent, but feel that criminalization adversely affects sex workers.<ref>[http://www.sexworkeurope.org/sites/default/files/userfiles/files/join/manbrussels2005.pdf Sex Workers in Europe Manifesto].

** regulation: prostitution may be considered a legitimate business; prostitution and the employment of prostitutes are legal, but regulated; the current situation in the Netherlands, Germany,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-women-prostitution-idUSKBN1OA28N|title=Legalizing prostitution lowers violence and disease, report says|date=2018-12-11|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-03-19|language=en}}</ref> most of [[Prostitution in Australia|Australia]] and parts of [[Nevada]] (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]). The degree of regulation varies very much; for example, in the Netherlands, prostitutes are not required to undergo mandatory health checks (see [[Prostitution in the Netherlands]]), while in [[Nevada]], the regulations are very strict (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]).
* "Prostitution should not be tolerated":
**[[Abolition of prostitution|abolitionism]] (prostitution itself is not prohibited, but most associated activities are illegal, in an attempt to make it more difficult to engage in prostitution, prostitution is heavily discouraged and seen as a social problem): prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal, but the surrounding activities such as public [[solicitation]], operating a [[brothel]] and other forms of [[pimp]]ing are prohibited. This is to some extent the current situation in Great Britain, where prostitution is considered "both a public nuisance and sexual offence", and Italy among others.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Carline|first1=Anna|title=Almost abolitionism : the peculiarities of prostitution policy in England and Wales|date=2017-03-03|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/61328/|work=Feminism, Prostitution and the State Abingdon|pages=103–120|editor-last=Ward|editor-first=Eilis|publisher=Routledge|language=en|isbn=978-1-138-94540-1|access-date=2020-03-19|last2=Scoular|first2=Jane|editor2-last=Wylie|editor2-first=Gillian}}</ref>

** [[prohibitionism]] (both prostitutes and clients are criminalized and are seen as immoral, they are considered criminals): the prevailing attitude nearly everywhere in the United States, with a few exceptions in some rural [[Nevada]] counties (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]])

In some countries, there is controversy regarding the laws applicable to [[sex work]]. For instance, the legal stance of punishing pimping while keeping sex work legal but "underground" and risky is often denounced as hypocritical; opponents suggest either going the full abolition route and criminalize clients or making sex work a regulated business.

[[File:Prostitution Info Centre.jpg|thumb|left|Prostitution Information Centre in [[Amsterdam]]]]
Many countries have sex worker advocacy groups which lobby against criminalization and discrimination of prostitutes.
These groups generally oppose Nevada-style regulation and oversight, stating that prostitution should be treated like other professions. In the United States of America, one such group is [[COYOTE]] (an abbreviation for "Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics") and another is the North American Task Force on Prostitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bayswan.org/NTFP.html |title=Prostitution: North American Task Force On Prostitution |publisher=Bayswan.org |access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref> In Australia the lead sex worker rights organisation is [[Scarlet Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/ |title=Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex Workers Association is the national peak sex worker organisation in Australia |publisher=Scarletalliance.org.au |access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref> International [[Sex workers' rights|prostitutes' rights]] organizations include the [[International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights]] and the Network of Sex Work Projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswp.org/ |title=Global Network of Sex Work Projects &#124; Promoting Health and Human Rights |publisher=Nswp.org |access-date=2015-08-25}}</ref>

Other groups, often with religious backgrounds, focus on offering women a way out of the world of prostitution while not taking a position on the legal question.

Prostitution is a significant issue in feminist thought and activism. Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution can be a valid choice for the women who choose to engage in it; in this view, prostitution must be differentiated from [[forced prostitution]], and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.

In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the 'Swedish Model' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221IPR36644/html/Punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute|title=Punish the client, not the prostitute|website=European Parliament|date=2014-02-26}}</ref>

{{Main|Prostitution law|Prostitution by country}}

The position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions on victimhood and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]], [[gender role]]s, [[gender equality]], ethics and [[morality]], [[free will|freedom of choice]], historical [[social norm]]s, and [[sociology|social costs and benefits]].

Legal themes tend to address four types of issue: victimhood (including potential victimhood), ethics and morality, freedom of choice, and general benefit or harm to society (including harm arising indirectly from matters connected to prostitution).

Prostitution may be considered a form of exploitation (e.g., Sweden, Norway, Iceland, where it is illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them — the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute), a legitimate occupation (e.g., Netherlands, Germany, where prostitution is regulated as a profession) or a crime (e.g., many [[Muslim]] countries, where the prostitutes face severe penalties).

The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being legal and considered a [[profession]] to being [[punishable by death]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |title=Iran – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |access-date=23 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |archive-date=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some jurisdictions outlaw the act of prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money); other countries do not prohibit prostitution itself, but ban the activities typically associated with it (soliciting in a public place, operating a brothel, pimping etc.), making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law; and in a few countries prostitution is legal and [[regulated prostitution|regulated]].

In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted a [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|convention]] stating that "prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others |publisher=.ohchr.org |access-date=26 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508080409/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |archive-date=8 May 2012 }}</ref> requiring all signing parties to punish pimps and brothel owners and operators and to abolish all special treatment or registration of prostitutes. As of January 2009, the convention was ratified by 95 member nations including France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and not ratified by another 97 member nations including Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.

[[File:Prostitutoin Adverts.jpg|thumb|Stickers affixed to a [[payphone]] in [[São Paulo]], 2006]]

=== Advertising ===
In countries where prostitution is legal, advertising it may be legal (as in the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]) or illegal (as in [[Prostitution in India|India]]).
Covert advertising for prostitution can take a number of forms:
* by cards in newsagents' windows
* by cards placed in public telephone enclosures: so-called [[tart card]]s
* by euphemistic advertisements in regular magazines and newspapers (for instance, talking of "massages" or "relaxation")
* in specialist [[contact magazine]]s
* via the [[World Wide Web|Internet]]

In the United States, [[massage parlor]]s serving as a cover for prostitution may advertise "full service", a euphemism for coitus.{{sfn|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|2002| }}

In [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], prostitution is often promoted overtly on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] by third party workers distributing risque flyers with the pictures and phone numbers of escorts (despite the fact that prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]).

The way in which prostitutes advertise their presence varies widely. Some remain in apartments which have hints or clues outside such as posters with "model" written on them to lure potential customers inside. Others advertise by putting numbers or location in [[phonebox]]es or in online or newspaper ads. In more sexually permissive societies, prostitutes can advertise in public view, such as through display windows. In sexually restrictive societies it may occur through word-of-mouth and other means.{{sfn|Scambler|Scambler|1997|p=1920}}

== Socio-economic issues ==
=== Illegal immigration ===
{{Main|Illegal immigration}}
A difficulty facing migrant prostitutes in many developed countries is the illegal residence status of some of these women. They face potential deportation, and so do not have recourse to the law. Hence there are brothels that may not adhere to the usual legal standards intended to safeguard public health and the safety of the workers.

The immigration status of the persons who sell sexual services is – particularly in Western Europe – a controversial and highly debated political issue. Currently, in most of these countries most prostitutes are immigrants, mainly from Eastern and Central Europe; in Spain and Italy 90% of prostitutes are estimated to be migrants, in Austria 78%, in Switzerland 75%, in Greece 73%, in Norway 70% (according to a 2009 [[TAMPEP]] report, ''Sex Work in Europe-A mapping of the prostitution scene in 25 European countries'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |title=Sex work in Europe |publisher=Tampep.eu |access-date=2015-08-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714160224/http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2015 }}</ref>

=== Survival sex ===
{{Main|Survival sex}}
Survival sex is when the prostitute is driven to prostitution by a need for basic necessities such as food or shelter. This type of prostitution is common among the [[homeless]] and in [[refugee camp]]s. The term is used in the sex trade and by [[aid workers]], although some practitioners do not regard the act as exploitative.

=== Use of children ===
{{Main|Prostitution of children}}
Regarding the [[prostitution of children]] the laws on prostitution as well as those on sex with a child apply. If prostitution in general is legal there is usually a minimum age requirement for legal prostitution that is higher than the general [[age of consent]] (see above for some examples). Although some countries do not single out patronage of child prostitution as a separate crime, the same act is punishable as sex with an underage person.

In India, the federal police say that around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution.<ref name="cnn.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/11/india.prostitution.children/index.html | work=CNN | title=Official: More than 1M child prostitutes in India – CNN.com | access-date=22 May 2010 | date=11 May 2009}}</ref> A [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] statement said that studies and surveys sponsored by the ministry of women and child development estimated that about 40% of all India's prostitutes are children.<ref name="cnn.com" />

In Bangladesh, child prostitutes are known to take the drug Oradexon, also known as [[dexamethasone]]. This over-the-counter [[steroid]], usually used by farmers to fatten cattle, makes child prostitutes look larger and older. Charities say that 90% of prostitutes in the country's legalized brothels use the drug. According to social activists, the steroid can cause [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]] and is highly addictive.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-bangladesh-prostitution-idUSBRE82I02A20120319 |title=Bangladesh's teenage brothels hold dark steroid secret|publisher=reuters.com|access-date=20 March 2012|date=19 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/05/sex-workers-bangladesh-steroid|title=A new danger for sex workers in Bangladesh|publisher=guardian.com|access-date=20 March 2012|date=5 April 2010|location=London|first=Joanna|last=Moorhead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10173115|title=Bangladesh's dark brothel steroid secret|publisher=bbcnews.com|access-date=20 March 2012|date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

===Among the elderly===
Prostitution among the elderly is a phenomenon reported in [[South Korea]] where [[elderly]] women, called [[Bacchus Ladies]], turn to prostitution out of necessity. They are called that because many also sell the popular [[Bacchus-F|Bacchus]] energy drink to make ends meet. [[State pension]]s of about {{Currency|amount=200000|code=KRW}} ({{currency|168}}) provide a basic income but are often not enough to cover the rising medical bills of old age. It first arose after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] when it became more difficult for children and grandchildren to support their elders. Clients tend to be more senior. The use of erection inducing injections with reused needles has contributed to the spread of sexually transmitted disease.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Korean grandmothers who sell sex |author=Lucy Williamson |work=BBC News |date=10 June 2014 |access-date=28 May 2019 |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27189951 }}</ref><ref>Ng, Desmond (January 29, 2017) [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/granny-prostitutes-reflect-south-korea-s-problem-of-elderly/3475610.html "Granny prostitutes reflect South Korea's problem of elderly poverty"] ''Channel NewsAsia''</ref>

===Illicit uses===
{{see also|Extortion|Blackmail}}
Prostitution, often when it is illegal, is used in [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]], which always involves extortion, where the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met. The subject of the extortion may be manipulated into or voluntarily solicit the use of prostitution which is then later used to extort money or for profit otherwise. The film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' famously depicts the role of Senator Geary who is implicated in the use of prostitution in order to gain his compliance on political issues.

=== Street ===
{{Main|Street prostitution}}
In street prostitution, the prostitute solicits customers while waiting at street corners, sometimes called "the track" by [[pimp]]s and prostitutes alike.  They usually dress in skimpy, provocative clothing, regardless of the weather. In American usage, street prostitutes are often called "streetwalkers" while their customers are referred to as "tricks" or "johns." Servicing the customers is described as "turning tricks." The sex is usually performed in the customer's car, in a nearby alley, or in a rented room.  Motels and hotels that accommodate prostitutes commonly rent rooms by the half or full hour.

In Russia and other countries of the [[Soviet Union|former USSR]], prostitution takes the form of an open-air market. One prostitute stands by a roadside, and directs cars to a so-called "tochka" (usually located in alleyways or carparks), where lines of women are paraded for customers in front of their car headlights. The client selects a prostitute, whom he takes away in his car. Prevalent in the late 1990s, this type of service has been steadily declining in recent years.

A "lot lizard" is a commonly encountered special case of street prostitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://traffickingresourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/Sex%20Trafficking%20at%20Truck%20Stops%20AAG.pdf |title=Sex Trafficking At Truck Stops |publisher=[[Polaris Project]] |website=[[National Human Trafficking Resource Center]] |access-date=12 August 2018 |year=2012}}</ref> Lot lizards mainly serve those in the [[Semi-trailer truck|trucking industry]] at [[truck stop]]s and stopping centers. Prostitutes will often proposition [[trucker]]s using a [[CB radio]] from a vehicle parked in the non-commercial section of a truck stop parking lot, communicating through codes based on commercial driving slang, then join the driver in his truck.

[[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution, often confined to special [[red-light district]]s in big cities. Other names for brothels include ''bordello'', ''whorehouse'', ''cathouse'', ''knocking shop'', and ''general houses''. Prostitution also occurs in some [[massage]] [[Massage parlor|parlours]], and in Asian countries in some [[barber]] shops where sexual services may be offered as a secondary function of the premises.

=== Escorts ===

{{Main|Call girl|Escort agency}}

Escort services may be distinguished from prostitution or other forms of prostitution in that sexual activities are often not explicitly advertised as necessarily included in these services; rather, payment is often noted as being for an escort's time and companionship only, although there is often an implicit assumption that sexual activities are expected.

In escort prostitution, the act takes place at the customer's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or in a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (called in-call). The prostitute may be independent or working under the auspices of an [[escort agency]]. Services may be advertised over the Internet, in regional publications, or in local telephone listings.

Use of the Internet by prostitutes and customers is common.{{sfn|Siegel|2007| }} A prostitute may use adult boards or create a website of their own with contact details, such as email addresses. Adult contact sites, chats and on-line communities are also used. This, in turn, has brought increased scrutiny from law enforcement, public officials, and activist groups toward online prostitution. In 2009, [[Craigslist]] came under fire for its role in facilitating online prostitution, and was sued by some 40 US state attorneys general, local prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.

Reviews of the services of individual prostitutes can often be found at various escort review boards worldwide. These [[online forum]]s are used to trade information between potential clients, and also by prostitutes to advertise the various services available. Sex workers, in turn, often use online forums of their own to exchange information on clients, particularly to warn others about dangerous clients.

=== Sex tourism ===
{{Main|Sex tourism|Child sex tourism}}
[[Sex tourism]] is travel for [[sexual intercourse]] with prostitutes or to engage in other sexual activity. The [[World Tourism Organization]], a specialized agency of the United Nations defines sex tourism as "trips organized from within the tourism sector, or from outside this sector but using its structures and networks, with the primary purpose of effecting a commercial sexual relationship by the tourist with residents at the destination".<ref name="WTO">{{cite web|url=http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010061925/http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|title=WTO Statement on the Prevention of Organised Sex Tourism|archive-date=10 October 2006|date=22 October 1995|publisher=World Tourism Organization|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref>

As opposed to regular sex tourism, which is often legal, a tourist who has sex with a [[Prostitution of children|child prostitute]] will usually be committing a crime in the host country, under the laws of his own country (notwithstanding him being outside of it) and against international law. Child sex tourism (CST) is defined as a travel to a foreign country for the purpose of engaging in commercially facilitated [[child sexual abuse]].<ref name=deptstate>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/tip/rls/fs/08/112090.htm|title=The Facts About Child Sex Tourism|website=Fact Sheet|publisher= US Dept of State, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons|date=29 February 2008}}</ref> Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil, and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |title=RIGHTS-MEXICO: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation – IPS |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=13 August 2007 |access-date=23 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111520/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |archive-date=26 March 2012 }}</ref>

=== Virtual sex ===
[[Virtual sex]], that is, sexual acts conveyed by messages rather than physically, is also the subject of commercial transactions. Commercial [[phone sex]] services have been available for decades. The advent of the Internet has made other forms of virtual sex available for money, including computer-mediated [[cybersex]], in which sexual services are provided in text form by way of [[chat room]]s or [[instant messaging]], or audiovisually through a [[webcam]] (see [[camgirl]]).

According to the paper "Estimating the prevalence and career longevity of prostitute women",{{sfn|Potterat|Woodhouse|Muth|Muth|1990| }} the number of full-time equivalent prostitutes in a typical area in the United States (Colorado Springs, CO, during 1970–1988) is estimated at 23 per 100,000 population (0.023%), of which some 4% were under 18. The length of these prostitutes' working careers was estimated at a mean of 5 years. According to a 2012 report by ''Fondation Scelles'' there are between 40 and 42 million prostitutes in the world.<ref>{{cite news|title=There Are 42 Million Prostitutes In The World, And Here's Where They Live|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1?IR=T|author=Gus Lubin|date=17 January 2012|newspaper=Business Insider|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref>

In 2003, it was estimated that in [[Amsterdam]], one woman in 35 was working as a prostitute, compared to one in 300 in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/Window_ban_for_Zurich_s_prostitutes.html?siteSect=107&sid=1853267&cKey=1052980380000&ty=st |title=Window ban for Zurich's prostitutes |publisher=swissinfo |date=15 May 2003 |access-date=26 June 2012}}</ref>

The number of men who have used a prostitute at least once varies widely from country to country, from an estimated low of between 7%<ref>{{cite web|last=Månsson|first=Sven-Axel|title=Men's practices in prostitution and their implications for social work|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/mens-practices-in-prostitution-and-their-implications-for-social-work.pdf|access-date=26 January 2013}}</ref> and 8.8%<ref name="Who pays for sex?">{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=H|author2=C H Mercer|author3=K Wellings|author4=K Fenton|author5=B Erens|author6=A Copas|author7=A M Johnson|title=Who pays for sex?

In Australia, a survey conducted in the early 2000s showed that 15.6% of men aged 16–59 reported paying for sex at least once in their life, and 1.9% had done so in the past year.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-842X.2003.tb00807.x|title=Sex in Australia: Experiences of commercial sex in a representative sample of adults|first5=Anthony M.A.|last5=Smith|first4=Richard O.|last4=Visser|first3=Andrew E.|last3=Grulich|first2=Juliet|year=2003|last2=Richters|last1=Rissel|first1=Chris E.|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume=27|pmid=14696710|issue=2|pages=191–7|s2cid=25225114}}</ref>

Reports disagree on whether prostitution levels are growing or declining in [[developed countries]]. Some studies indicate that the percentage of men engaging in commercial sex in the United States has declined significantly in recent decades: in 1964, an estimated 69–80% of men had paid for sex at least once.<ref name=ProCon /> Some have suggested that prostitution levels have fallen in sexually liberal countries, most likely because of the increased availability of non-commercial, non-marital sex<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Edlund |first1=Lena |last2=Korn |first2=Evelyn |title=A Theory of Prostitution |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 2002 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=181–214 |doi=10.1086/324390 |s2cid=15862773 |url=http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526010007/http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2006}}</ref> or, for example in Sweden, because of stricter legal penalties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Skarhead|first=Anna|title=Evaluating the Swedish Ban on the Purchase of Sexual Services: The Anna Skarhed Report|url=http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|publisher=Nordic Prostitution Policy Reform|access-date=26 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709082031/http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|archive-date=9 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other reports suggest a growth in prostitution levels, for example in the US,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|title=The John Next Door|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/07/17/the-growing-demand-for-prostitution.html|website=2011|publisher=The Daily Beast|access-date=26 January 2013}}</ref> where again, sexual liberalisation is suggested as the cause. As Norma Ramos, Executive Director of the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] says "The more the commercial [[sex industry]] normalizes this behavior, the more of this behavior you get".<ref>{{cite web|title=CATW submission to the OCHR Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/CoalitionagainstTraffickinginWomen.pdf|publisher=[[CATW]]|access-date=26 January 2013}}</ref>

Prostitutes have long plied their trades to the military in many cultures.  For example, the British naval port of [[Portsmouth]] had a flourishing local sex industry in the 19th century, and until the early 1990s there were large [[red-light district]]s near American military bases in the Philippines. The notorious [[Patpong]] entertainment district in [[Bangkok]], Thailand, started as an [[R&R (military)|R&R]] location for US troops serving in the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1970s. Washington D.C. itself had [[Murder Bay]] which attracted the military of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The village of [[Vadia (Banaskantha)|Vadia]], India is known locally as the ''village of prostitutes'', where unmarried women are involved in prostitution. Mass weddings for children of prostitutes in the village are held to protect them from being pushed into prostitution.<ref>{{cite news|title=In pictures: Mass wedding in India 'prostitute village'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17336512|work=BBC|date=March 12, 2012}}</ref>

== Medical situation ==
In some places, prostitution may be associated with the spread of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). Lack of condom use among prostitutes and their clients has been cited as a factor in the spread of HIV in Asia: "One of the main reasons for the rapid spread of HIV in Asian countries is the massive transmission among sex workers and clients".<ref name=Rojanap />  As a result, prevention campaigns aimed at increasing condom use by sex workers have been attributed to play a major role in restricting the spread of HIV.<ref name=AVERTHIVSexWorkers>{{cite web|url = http://www.avert.org/sex-workers.htm | title = HIV Prevention and Sex Workers | access-date= 15 September 2009| date = 2015-07-20 }}</ref>

One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Côté AM, Sobela F, Dzokoto A |title=Transactional sex is the driving force in the dynamics of HIV in Accra, Ghana |journal=AIDS |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=917–25 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15060439 |doi= 10.1097/00002030-200404090-00009|s2cid=22638286 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shabbir I, Larson CP |title=Urban to rural routes of HIV infection spread in Ethiopia |journal=J Trop Med Hyg |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=338–42 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7563263 }}</ref>
Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Costa LJ, Plummer FA, Bowmer I |title=Prostitutes are a major reservoir of sexually transmitted diseases in Nairobi, Kenya |journal=Sex Transm Dis |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=64–7 |year=1985 |pmid=4002094 |doi= 10.1097/00007435-198504000-00002|s2cid=22361492 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Typical responses to the problem are:
* banning prostitution completely
* introducing a system of [[Licensure|registration]] for prostitutes that mandates health checks and other public health measures
* educating prostitutes and their clients to encourage the use of [[barrier contraception]] and greater interaction with health care

Some think that the first two measures are counter-productive. Banning prostitution tends to drive it underground, making safe sex promotion, treatment and monitoring more difficult. Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes. Both of the last two measures can be viewed as [[harm reduction]] policies.

In countries and areas where safer sex precautions are either unavailable or not practiced for cultural reasons, prostitution is an active disease vector for all STDs, including [[HIV]]/AIDS, but the encouragement of [[safer sex]] practices, combined with regular testing for sexually transmitted diseases, has been very successful when applied consistently. As an example, Thailand's condom program has been largely responsible for the country's progress against the HIV epidemic.<ref name=Rojanap>{{cite journal |author=Rojanapithayakorn W |title=The 100% condom use programme in Asia |journal=Reprod Health Matters |volume=14 |issue=28 |pages=41–52 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17101421 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28270-3 |doi-access=free }}</ref> It has been estimated that successful implementation of safe sex practices in India "would drive the [HIV] epidemic to extinction" while similar measures could achieve a 50% reduction in Botswana.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagelkerke NJ, Jha P, de Vlas SJ |title=Modelling HIV/AIDS epidemics in Botswana and India: impact of interventions to prevent transmission |journal=Bull.
