'''Tracey Ullman''' (born '''Trace Ullman'''; 30 December 1959) is a [[British-American]] actress, comedian, singer, writer, producer, and director. Her earliest appearances were on British television sketch comedy shows, ''[[A Kick Up the Eighties]]'' (with [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Miriam Margolyes]]) and ''[[Three of a Kind (1981 TV series)|Three of a Kind]]'' (with [[Lenny Henry]] and [[David Copperfield (comedian)|David Copperfield]]). After a brief singing career, she appeared as Candice Valentine in ''[[Girls on Top (British TV series)|Girls on Top]]'' with [[Dawn French]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]].

She emigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States where she starred in her own network television comedy series, ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', from 1987 until 1990, which also featured the first appearances of the long-running animated [[media franchise]], ''[[The Simpsons]]''. She later produced programmes for [[HBO]], including ''[[Tracey Takes On...]]'' (1996–99), for which she garnered numerous awards. Her sketch comedy series, ''[[Tracey Ullman's State of the Union]]'', ran from 2008 to 2010 on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. She has also appeared in several feature films. Ullman was the first British woman to be offered her own television sketch show in both the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman returns to BBC with first television series in 30 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/08/tracey-ullman-returns-to-bbc-with-first-television-series-in-30-years|work=The Guardian|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, she returned to British television with the [[BBC]] sketch comedy show ''[[Tracey Ullman's Show]]'', her first project for the broadcaster in over thirty years;<ref name=tusjan>{{cite web|title=BBC - Tracey Ullman's Show - Media Centre|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/02/tracey-ullmans-show|work=BBC|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=22 December 2015}}</ref> this led to the creation of the topical comedy series ''[[Tracey Breaks the News]]'' in 2017.

Ullman is currently the richest British actress and female comedian and the third richest British comedian overall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman: I had to wear fatsuit to play Judi Dench and being Dame Maggie Smith was hard|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/tracey-ullman-wear-fatsuit-play-7112472|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=Mirror Online|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The UK's richest comedian unloads Upper East Side pad|url=https://nypost.com/2017/07/26/the-uks-richest-comedian-unloads-upper-east-side-pad/|work=The New York Post|publisher=Nypost.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>

==Early life==
Tracey Ullman was born Trace Ullman in [[Slough]], [[Berkshire]],<ref name=queenofparody>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman Is Sitting Pretty as the Queen of Parody and Pops |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089118,00.html|first=Barbara|last=Graustark|date=12 November 1984|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref>, the younger of two daughters<ref name=prodigal>{{cite web|title=Return of the Prodigal Daughter|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4709481/Return-of-the-prodigal-daughter.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 July 1997|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>, to Doreen ([[née]] Cleaver) and Antoni John Ullman. Her mother was British, with [[Romani people|Roma]] ancestry,<ref>{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=98}}</ref> and her father was a [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Roman Catholic]] [[Poles|Pole]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The International Who's Who 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwXjAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=1712|isbn = 9781857430813}}</ref> On the subject of the spelling of her name: "My real name is Trace Ullman, but I added the 'y.' My mother said it was spelled the American way, but I don't think she can spell! I always wanted a middle name. My mum used to tell me it was Mary but I never believed her. I looked on my birth certificate and I didn't have one, just Trace Ullman."<ref>''Look in TV Annual'' (Independent Television Books Ltd, 1984), p. 67.</ref>

Antoni Ullman served in the [[Polish Army]] and was [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]] in 1940. He subsequently worked as a [[solicitor]], a furniture salesman, and a travel agent. He also brokered marriages and translated among the émigré Polish community. Doreen and Anthony recognized their younger daughter's talents early on and encouraged her to perform.<ref name=skitcom/>

In an interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'' host [[Terry Gross]], Ullman revealed that when she was six, her father, who had been recovering from a heart operation, died of a heart attack in front of her while the two were alone and as he was reading to her.<ref name=npr-state>{{cite web|title=Tracy Ullman Takes on the 'State of the Union'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89037585|work=[[NPR]]|publisher=NPR|date=25 March 2008|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=vanityfair-88>{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=James |date=March 1991 |title=Amazing Trace |journal=Vanity Fair |publisher=Condé Nast Publications Inc.|volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=pg.88}}</ref> "When that happens to you as a child, you can face anything. You're always waiting for the other shoe to drop. If something great happens, you're like, 'Wow, that's great that happened, because it could have been crap'. The most disappointing thing happened when you were younger [...] You're just braver and if good things happen you're really grateful."<ref name=npr-state/>

Ullman, who had been living an upper-middle class life, was uprooted to [[Hackbridge]], southwest [[London]], along with her older sister Patti and her mother, who could now barely make ends meet without their father's income.<ref name=shemadeit>{{cite web |url=http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=83 |title=The Paley Center for Media &#124; She Made It &#124; Tracey Ullman |publisher=She Made It |date=30 December 1959 |accessdate=17 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317140929/http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=83 |archivedate=17 March 2014}}</ref> "After [Dad] died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn't speak Polish and had to give up the business. When I meet other girls who lost their fathers when they were young, I really relate to them. You become independent quickly; I could cope with anything because of that terrible loss."<ref name=prodigal/> Doreen would go on to take a variety of odd jobs. "My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil and paid 10 pounds a week. But she was very funny, and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour."<ref name=shemadeit/> On a separate occasion, on the subject of her mother's jobs, Ullman recalled: "[Mum] worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pagesix.com/2008/05/09/mums-the-word-of-the-stars/ |title=Mum's the Word of the Stars |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date= 9 May 2008 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref> One of her mother's jobs enabled Ullman to indulge in her penchant for observing people. "My mum used to work in a mental institution in London when I was a kid, and I used to go there on Sundays, and I used to love studying the people there."<ref>{{cite news|last=Avasthi |first=Sarubhui |date=17 January 1997 |title=Tracey Ullman Defies Characterization |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/296428181 |work=[[The News Journal]]|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref> Her mother maintained that their family was still middle-class in the absence of their father. "My mother always insisted on middle-class because we had money at one time. We're really lower-middle."<ref name=classsystem>{{cite web|title=Television – How to get away from the class system, or not: Tracey Ullman is big in America and back in Britain. Robert Butler met her|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television--how-to-get-away-from-the-class-system-or-not-tracey-ullman-is-big-in-america-and-back-in-britain-robert-butler-met-her-1476279.html|first=Robert|last=Butler|date=3 January 1993|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

Ullman credits her sense of humour to a feeling of both classlessness as well as her mother's working-class roots. "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to [[gymkhana]] and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we suddenly didn't have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother's family is all from South London, and we have a lot of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London ''oiks''. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who ''really'' affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod. An he's got the sharpest mind I've ever known; he's so hysterically funny. And I wanted to be like him."<ref>{{cite news |author=Amanda Root|title=Uncle Butch Castle & The Song & Dance Kid|newspaper=New Musical Express|date=24 December 1983|page=61}}</ref>

In the aftermath of their father's death, their mother slipped into a deep depression and spent a lot of time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. "It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I'm a spin-off of my sister's show, as she likes to point out". In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Édith Piaf]].<ref name=liveandexposed>{{cite video |people=Ullman, Tracey |date=2005 |title=Tracey Ullman: Live and Exposed |medium=DVD |publisher=HBO Video}}</ref> "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone."<ref>{{cite episode |title=S 6: Ep 224 |series=[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]] |network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |airdate=5 August 2003}}</ref> She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them."<ref name=liveandexposed/> She was particularly interested in [[Ken Loach]] films; films such as ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'', which she as a child believed was a real documentary and would reenact. Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!"<ref name=npr-state/> The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household.<ref name=liveandexposed/> The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up."<ref name=queenofparody/>

Ullman wrote and performed in school plays<ref>{{cite journal |date=16 February 1984 |title=The Tracey Ullman Show |url=http://41.media.tumblr.com/10173329d75001ab79fdb6810b83168b/tumblr_nky5r4PyEW1upi75eo1_1280.jpg |journal=Smash Hits |pages=pg.38}}</ref> and it was there that she caught the eye of a headmaster who recommended that she attend a "special school." "I thought he meant a school for juvenile delinquents."<ref name=liveandexposed/> Eventually her mother agreed and at age twelve she won a full scholarship to the [[Italia Conti Academy]]. Despite the encouragement she received from family, friends, and teachers, her big boost of confidence came from a very unlikely source: a clairvoyant who predicted that she would become famous, especially in America.<ref>[[#Ullman|Ullman]], p. 141.</ref> Some of her earliest work included an appearance on ''The [[Tommy Steele]] Show'' when she was thirteen, and acting as a model for British teenage magazines ''My Guy'' and ''Photo Love''.<ref>Handbook of Intermediality: Literature – Image – Sound – Music edited by Gabriele Rippl, publ. 20 July 2015, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|3110308363}}, chapter 1 (retrieved 22 December 2018): https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1BDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT399</ref><ref>The Best of My Guy: A Collection of the Very Best of Everyone's Favourite 80s Weekly Magazine Hardcover – 28 Sep 2006 by Frank Hopkinson, publ. 28 September 2006, Robson Books Ltd, {{ISBN|1861059795}} – 'photostories featuring many stars before they were famous including Hugh Grant, Tracey Ullman, Lesley Ash, Alex Kingston and Tony Hadley etc.': https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Guy-Collection-Everyones-Favourite/dp/1861059795</ref> Ullman also did radio work when she was thirteen. One of her jobs was recording English lessons for Swedish children. "I used to have to say these ridiculous sentences really slowly in my poshest voice. I remember once having to say 'Peter wants a wonk.'  I told the producer it was really suggestive but he insisted that wonk meant fairy.

She would end up loathing Italia Conti saying, "I hated the pressure that many of the children were under. Many of the kids were forced to grow up too fast, their careers were being decided for them before they were 13. If I went to an audition then they'd always choose the sweetest, prettiest kid. I wasn't obviously beautiful so I used to miss out." Ullman has also alleged that the owners taught their own children and that a certain level of favouritism seemed to exist. She also felt that the education she was receiving was of very little value. "These stupid teachers would come in and go, 'Good morning, darlings, lets all be dustbins!' I'd go, 'Oh, shut up! I wanna be a banana!'"<ref>{{cite journal |date=September 1988 |title=20 Questions Tracey Ullman |journal=Playboy |publisher=Playboy Enterprises |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=pg.166}}</ref>

The treatment she received at school led to her spending more time in pubs than in class.<ref name=liveandexposed/> Despite her tardiness, she passed her [[GCE Ordinary Level|O levels]].<ref name=pressrelease>{{cite web|title=1982 Stiff Records press release.|url=http://tracey-archives.tumblr.com/post/113162928508/1982-stiff-records-press-release|work=The Tracey Ullman Archives|publisher=Tumblr.com|accessdate=7 December 2015}}</ref> Before long, her interest in performing began to wane and her family could no longer afford tuition.

With fame came intense scrutiny of her personal life. The press became increasingly aggressive, printing untrue or exaggerated stories, and soliciting information from people who supposedly knew her.

Ullman, who had already made a name for herself as a comedian with her BBC comedy series ''[[Three of a Kind (1981 TV series)|Three of a Kind]]'', had a chance encounter with the wife of the head of the [[Punk rock|punk]] music label [[Stiff Records]], Dave Robinson. The meeting led to her recording her first album. "One day, I was at my hairdresser, and Dave Robinson's wife Rosemary leant over and said, 'Do you want to make a record?' I was having some of those [[Boy George]] kind of dreadlock things put in and I went, 'Yeah I want to make a record.'

Her future husband Allan McKeown had reservations about her launching a music career and tried talking her out of it. "When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London and I told her that she had a big career in comedy, and she said to me, 'Well actually, I'm doing a record next week,' and I said, 'Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn't get involved with singing.

Ullman's songs were over-the-top evocations of 1960s and 1970s pop music with a 1980s edge, "somewhere between [[Minnie Mouse]] and [[the Supremes]]" as the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' put it, or "retro before retro was cool," as a reviewer wrote in 2002.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Her career received another boost when the video for "They Don't Know" featured a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] from [[Paul McCartney]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman takes on two new musicals with 'The Band Wagon' and 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tracey-ullman-stars-band-wagon-woods-article-1.1990248|work=New York Daily News|publisher=NYdailynews.com|accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref> at the time Ullman was filming a minor role in McCartney's film ''[[Give My Regards to Broad Street (film)|Give My Regards to Broad Street]].''<ref name=bio>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040413013625/http://www.traceytakeson.com/tracey/ Tracey]. traceytakeson.com</ref> She released her second (and final) album, ''[[You Caught Me Out]],'' in 1984.<ref name=charts/>

==Television career==

===Early years===
Ullman got her first television acting job when she was seventeen, in a Heinz soup advert where she had to wear a cow's head.<ref name=skitcom/>

She tried her hand at serious drama, playing [[Lynda Bellingham]]'s daughter in the 1980 BBC TV series ''Mackenzie'', but said that she found that she wasn't cut out to be a straight actress. "I really thought I was great when I did a quite serious soap opera for the BBC. I played a nice girl from St. John's Wood. 'Mummy, I think I'm pregnant. I don't know who's done it.' Then I would fall down a hill or something. 'EEEEE! Oh, no, lost another baby.' It seemed all I ever did was have miscarriages—or make yogurt."<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman Is Sitting Pretty as the Queen of Parody and Pops|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20089118,00.html|work=Barbara Graustark|publisher=([[People Magazine]])|accessdate=9 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090524/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20089118,00.html|archivedate=10 January 2014}}</ref>

In 1981, the success of her performance in the Royal Court Theatre's production of ''Four in a Million'' led to many offers; one being the chance to move into television comedy. The BBC was quick to cast her in the BBC Scotland sketch comedy programme ''[[A Kick Up the Eighties]]''. The network was so impressed with her that it offered her her own series. She initially turned down the offer. "My first reaction was you must be joking, as women are treated so shoddily in comedy. Big busty barmaids and all those sort of cliches just bore me rigid."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tracey's Papers |url=http://tracey-archives.tumblr.com/post/113163172393/tracey-ullman-the-face-no37 |journal=The Face |pages=pg.69}}</ref> She also had reservations due to a lack of female contemporaries. "At that time English women weren't really allowed to be funny on television. I didn't have any examples. I mean, I didn't have a [[Gilda Radner]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Lily Tomlin]]. I mean, my only point of reference, quite honestly, was the ''[[The Benny Hill Show|Benny Hill]]'' girls."<ref name=liveandexposed/> Ullman got into her performing arts school by doing an impersonation of Lily Tomlin.<ref name=bookpage>{{cite web|title=Enter the antic world of Tracey Ullman|url=http://tracey-archives.tumblr.com/post/148769362063/enter-the-antic-world-of-tracey-ullman|work=Bookpage.com|publisher=Bookpage.com|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> Eventually a deal was made with the proviso that she would get to choose the show's writers, have script approval, and choose the costumes.<ref name=pressrelease/> ''[[Three of a Kind (1981 TV series)|Three of a Kind]]'', co-starring comedians [[Lenny Henry]] and [[David Copperfield (comedian)|David Copperfield]], debuted in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=BFI Screenonline: Three of a Kind (1981-83)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/535119/|work=BFI Screenonline|publisher=Screenonline.org.uk|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref>

In an interview with [[Amanda Root]] for ''The Musical Express'' magazine, Ullman was asked about critics labeling the show "non-sexist humour." Did it exist? "Not unless it's cleverly done. When we did ''Three of a Kind'' we kept getting sketches sent in about me as a traffic warden, or me being a busty barmaid. Writers that have no idea about women - their typical way of starting a sketch is to say, Tracey is sitting there, filing her nails and chewing gum, as if all girls are stupid. Sketches beginning like that used to really get on my nerves. But as soon as we found the right team of writers, they weren't into that sort of thing, so it worked out OK."<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman biography and filmography|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/tracey-ullman/5009/|work=Tribute.ca|publisher=Tribute.ca|accessdate=9 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092420/http://www.tribute.ca/people/tracey-ullman/5009/|archive-date=10 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She went on to win her first BAFTA Award in the category of Best Light Entertainment Performance for ''Three of a Kind'' in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=BAFTA Awards|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1984/television/light-entertainment-performance|work=BAFTA|publisher=bafta.org|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>

In 1982, she met her future husband, Allan McKeown, a television producer with his own production company, Witzend Productions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Allan McKeown obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/31/allan-mckeown|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> McKeown discovered her when he happened to catch her in an episode of ''Three of a Kind''. The two eventually worked together on a television pilot for [[ITV Central|Central Television]], ''A Cut Above'', about a 1960s hairdresser (McKeown's former profession) who meets a posh girl (Ullman). "Pilot didn't work, but I got a husband out of it," said Ullman in 1990.<ref name=watchout>{{cite web|title=Watch Out For Ullman She's a Master of Accents, A Wiz at Changing Personalities.

In 1983, she signed on to star in a comedy about four women sharing a flat together, ''[[Girls on Top (British TV series)|Girls on Top]]'' (provisionally titled ''Four-Play'', ''Bitches on Heat'', and ''Four Fs to Share''). She was cast as the promiscuous golddigger Candice Valentine. The show didn't go into production until early 1985 due to an electricians' strike at the studio where the series was set to film.<ref name=girlsontop>{{cite web|title=The Troubled Production History of Girls on Top|url=http://smarterthantheaverage.tumblr.com/post/57146111/the-troubled-production-history-of-girls-on-top|work=Smarter Than Average|publisher=Tumblr.com|accessdate=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141438/http://smarterthantheaverage.tumblr.com/post/57146111/the-troubled-production-history-of-girls-on-top|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The show, co-starring comedians [[Dawn French]], [[Ruby Wax]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]] (who also wrote the scripts), continued after Ullman bowed out after the first series. In her book, ''Bonkers: My Life in Laughs'', Saunders writes, "If Ruby taught us how to write funny, then Tracey was a lesson in how to act funny. She was by far the most famous of us, having starred with Lenny Henry in 'Three of a Kind.'”<ref>{{cite book |last=Saunders |first=Jennifer |date=2013 |title=Bonkers: My Life in Laughs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LRBuAAAAQBAJ |publisher=Penguin UK |page=202 |isbn=978-0241967270}}</ref>

In April 1984, ''Five Faces of Tracey'', described as an 'all film series of five half hours' starring Ullman as one character per episode in one 'self-contained story,' was announced as scheduled to begin filming in July of that year written by Ruby Wax and herself. The series never came to fruition.<ref name=girlsontop/>

===''The Tracey Ullman Show''===
In 1985, Ullman was persuaded by her husband to join him in Los Angeles, where he was already partially based.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mills |first=Nancy |date=19 November 2000 |title=A Demented Pixie Grows Up |journal=You Magazine |pages=pg.29–32}}</ref> She was no stranger to the United States, as she had promoted her music career there, appearing and performing on an array of American talk shows.<ref>{{cite web|title=1984 MCA Press Release|url=http://tracey-archives.tumblr.com/post/135227006958/1984-mca-press-release|work=The Tracey Ullman Archives|publisher=Tumblr.com|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> She had also just completed a press junket for her film, the period drama, ''[[Plenty (film)|Plenty]]'' there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Late Night with David Letterman - 9/18/85|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc_EvNu6PjA|website=youtube.com|publisher=Bud Sneebra|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> The US knew her as a singer and a now budding serious film actress; not the television comedian of her homeland.<ref name=plenty>{{cite web|title=British Actress/singer Has 'Plenty' To Cheer About|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-10-03/features/8503070330_1_tracey-ullman-paul-mccartney-oscar-winner-meryl-streep|work=The Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicagotribune.com|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref> When she agreed to make the move to the America, she had set her sights on a film and stage career, believing that there was little in the way of television for her.<ref name=realcharacter>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/movies/television-tracey-ullman-she-s-a-real-character.html |title=Television – Tracey Ullman: She's a Real Character |last=O'Connor |first=Thomas |date=25 September 1988 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=6 June 2015}}</ref> "I didn't believe there was anything above ''[[Webster (TV series)|Webster]]'' standard.

Her British agent put together a videotape containing a compilation of her work and began circulating it around Hollywood. The tape landed in the lap of Craig Kellem, vice president for comedy at Universal Television. "I could not believe my eyes. It was just about the most extraordinary piece of material I'd seen in a long time." He wanted production on a series to begin immediately for her.<ref name=skitcom/>

A deal was struck right away with CBS television, who went from ordering a pilot to ordering a full series two weeks later. A script for ''I Love New York'', a show about a "slightly wacky" British woman working in New York, was written by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' writer [[Anne Beatts]]. Ullman hated it and the deal deteriorated.<ref name=skitcom/>

Recalling the project, Ullman said, "We'd just hit on an idea, then some white-haired executive - very, very important - would come in from the race track and say, 'I don't like that idea. I think Tracey should be a caring person. I think there should be a kid in this. Now, I'm just pitching here. I don't know if this is funny. But I think Tracey should love this kid and maybe there's a moment where she tells the kid something about life.' And I'd say, "Look - I don't want to work with little kids being cute who I eventually adopt'."<ref name=goldfinger/>

She was also turned off by the industry's materialistic attitude. "Literally, you start your first meeting and already they're thinking about three years' syndication. 'You're going to be worth $13 million. You're going to be a very rich young lady.' I'd say, 'I don't want to talk about the millions of dollars now. Can we put that on hold? I just want to talk about something good'."<ref name=goldfinger/>

{{Rquote|right|I don't think there's anybody like her, and that's a big deal. If you insist, there are parallels to [[Peter Sellers]], an actor who did brilliant sketch comedy.|[[James L. Brooks]] on Tracey Ullman<ref name=realcharacter/>}}

Ullman's agent then decided to send producer [[James L. Brooks]] some tapes of her work.<ref name=goldfinger/> Brooks, who had had a very successful career producing television sitcoms, had stepped away from the medium, opting instead for a career in film. Ullman's material was so good that it lured him back to television. "I started showing [her work] to people like you'd show home movies," revealed Brooks.<ref name=realcharacter/> "I was just startled by the size of the talent. I got chills."<ref name=foxylady>{{cite journal |title=Foxy Lady |last=Zehme |first=Bill |date=27 August 1987 |journal=Rolling Stone |issn=0035-791X}}</ref>

Brooks felt that a sketch show would best suit her assets (acting, singing, and dancing). "Why would you do something with Tracey playing a single character on TV when her talent requires variety? You can't categorize Tracey, so it's silly to come up with a show that attempted to."<ref name=realcharacter/>

To ensure that she was well-versed in American comedy, Brooks sent her tapes of American sitcoms and variety shows to watch while at home, now pregnant. Ullman refers to it as "homework."<ref name=bravo>{{cite web|title=Bravo - Influences: Tracey Ullman|url=https://vimeo.com/52657083|website=Vimeo.com|publisher=Vimeo|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> She also visited the [[Paley Center for Media|Museum of Television and Radio]], which she would later be inducted into. She had in fact grown up watching American television in the 1970s in England. Two things stood out to her: the vast number of female comedians, as well as their not having to be conventionally attractive to be funny. "It was very true of my childhood that women needed to be sexy in order to be funny."<ref name=bravo/><ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Ullman Makes A Face|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/15/magazine/tracy-ullman-makes-a-face.html?pagewanted=1|work=The New York Times|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>

Brooks assembled a team of writers, and a deal with Fox Television was made.<ref name=goldfinger/> The network was looking to create its own original programming. Ullman's show, along with ''[[Married... with Children]]'', would be the first two scripted shows produced and launched.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox Network at 25: Blazing Trails and Burning Bridges|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/arts/television/the-fox-network-celebrates-its-25th-anniversary.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref>

Scouting for a supporting cast to play opposite her began. [[Dan Castellaneta]], a relative unknown, was asked to read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's [[The Second City|Second City]]. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind man who wants to be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh.<ref>Lawsom, Tim; Persons, Alisa (2004).

Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an [[Emmy Award]]. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-15/entertainment/ca-2655_1_character-actress-tracey-ullman-show-sara-lee |title=Julie Kavner: a Private Person in Many Roles |last=Haithman |first=Diane |date=15 June 1989 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref> Actor [[Sam McMurray]] read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father.

Because the Fox network was new to the world of television production, a bureaucracy had not yet been established. This enabled the show to take risks and the freedom to try things that the major networks would never permit. The series landed an initial twenty-six episode commitment deal, unheard of for a television comedy. ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' debuted on 5 April 1987. Describing the show proved difficult. Creator [[Ken Estin]] dubbed it a "skitcom". A variety of diverse original characters were created for her to perform. Extensive makeup, wigs, teeth, and body padding were utilised, sometimes rendering her unrecognisable. One original character created by Ullman back in Britain was uprooted for the series: long-suffering British spinster [[Kay Clark (character)|Kay Clark]].<ref name=foxylady/>

A typical episode of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' consisted of three sketches, one including a song and/or a heavily choreographed dance routine. Brooks was keen on showing off all of Ullman's abilities. "It's 'Can you juggle this and keep throwing on more plates?' I'm constantly amazed." Ullman opened and closed the show as herself, adding her trademark, "Go home!," which she would shout to the studio audience for the closing. The show was shot on film, a departure from previous variety shows which were routinely shot on tape.<ref name=foxylady/>

In 1991, she had given birth to her second child, Johnny, and her husband was bidding on a television franchise in the South of England. Along with the bid he included a potential television programming lineup. Listed was a Tracey Ullman special. Ullman thought nothing would come of it, but to her horror, she learnt that the bid was successful.<ref name=takeson1>{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=xi}}</ref>

The frantic pace of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' was one of the key factors in her decision to give up television. That show was shot in front of a live studio audience and featured her playing on average three characters a week. She frequently wore layers of costuming to disguise herself. The prosthetic makeup was at times excessive. In her book ''[[Tracey Takes On (book)|Tracey Takes On]]'', she recalls an incident where she fainted on the makeup room floor, having to be revived before rushing out to give a performance.<ref name=takeson1/>

Unlike the Fox show though, this special would be shot entirely on location, allowing ample time to apply makeup, wigs, and other accoutrements for the characters; so Ullman felt less panicked. She decided to do a send up of the [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|British class system]]. All new characters were created and she was joined by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Michael Palin]] for each of the show's sketches. ''[[Tracey Ullman: A Class Act]]'' premiered on 9 January 1993 on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC - Comedy - Guide - Tracey Ullman: A Class Act |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml |work=BBC |publisher=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=14 September 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404051645/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml |archivedate=4 April 2005 }}</ref>

The American cable network [[Home Box Office|HBO]] became interested in Ullman doing a special for their network with the caveat that she take on a more American subject. She chose New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=xiii}}</ref>

The special, ''[[Tracey Ullman Takes on New York]]'' debuted on 9 October 1993 and both it and Ullman went on to win two Emmy Awards, a [[CableACE Awards|CableAce Award]], an [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy Award]], and a [[Writers Guild of America Award]]. The success of the special led the network to broach the subject of a "Takes On" series. Ullman and her husband liked the idea and set up production on ''[[Tracey Takes On...]]'' in Los Angeles in 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=xv}}</ref>

As with the special ''Takes On New York'', each episode of ''Tracey Takes On...'' centered on a single subject. Characters created for ''A Class Act'' and ''Takes On New York'' were adapted for the HBO series, along with several new characters, as well as the character Kay Clark. Unlike ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', ''Tracey Takes On...'' had a rotating roster of upwards of twenty characters repeated throughout the run of the show.<ref>{{harvnb|Ullman|1998|p=xix-xxvi}}</ref> Also, unlike ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', ''Tracey Takes On...'' was a [[Single-camera setup|single-camera comedy]], shot heavily on location, without a studio audience.

Ullman and the show went on to receive a slew of awards including six Emmy Awards, two CableAce Awards, three American Comedy Awards, two [[GLAAD Media Award]]s, as well as a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] in 1999 for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tracey Takes On... |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml |work=BBC |publisher=BBC.co.uk |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404051645/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/t/traceyullmanacla_66603500.shtml |archivedate=4 April 2005 }}</ref>

===Purple Skirt and Oxygen===
In 2001, Ullman took a break from her character-based work and created a fashion-based talk show for [[Oxygen Network]], ''[[Tracey Ullman's Visible Panty Lines]]''. The series was spun off from her [[e-commerce]] clothing store [[Purple Skirt]], which had been launched a few years prior. Interviewees included [[Arianna Huffington]] and [[Charlize Theron]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch Tracey Ullman's Visible Panty Lines Episodes |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/tracey-ullmans-visible-panty-lines/episodes/430461/|work=TV Guide|publisher=Tvguide.com|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> The show lasted for two seasons and ended in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purpleskirt.com/vpl/vplonair/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011116031325/http://www.purpleskirt.com/vpl/vplonair/|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 November 2001|title=Tracey Ullman's "Visible Panty Lines"|date=16 November 2001|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>

{{cquote|It's been fascinating to watch Ullman evolve from, say, [[Imogene Coca]] and Carol Burnett to something leaner and meaner, like a young [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. Or [[Lenny Bruce]], with his surreal jive and need to shock. Or Lily Tomlin, signalling in coded transmissions through a worm hole to some parallel universe. Or [[Anna Deavere Smith]], chameleon and exorcist, seeing around corners and speaking in tongues. Or, of course, [[Robin Williams]], before all the bad films and worse career choices, a brilliant mind unmade of equal parts politics and paranoia, music video and [[psychotherapy]], a scrambled shaman egghead and Jack–in–a–Pandora's box. Think of America as performance art.<ref>[https://nymag.com/arts/tv/reviews/45294/ America (The Cable Show)]. New York Magazine. John Leonard. 24 March 2008.</ref>}}

Ullman commented that the United States is "now able to laugh at itself more," embracing more [[satire|satiric]] humour rather than deeming it "unpatriotic." Now that she is a citizen, she joked that she "won't end up in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]]"<ref>[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hrvjp8YgMitKSLUWtvdNj3o4IxOQ Tracey Ullman plays characters real and imagined on 'State of the Union'].

It included the reaction of not only the UK, but Europeans and Russians. "I'm excited the BBC has asked me to make a show at this time. We've decided to shake it up with a more topical format because things move so fast these days it's like every 10 minutes I'm voting for something.

==Film career==
Along with her television work, Ullman has featured in many films throughout her career. Her first theatrical film was a small role in [[Paul McCartney]]'s 1984 film ''[[Give My Regards to Broad Street (film)|Give My Regards to Broad Street]]''.<ref name=bio/> This was followed by a supporting role in the 1985 [[Meryl Streep]] drama ''[[Plenty (film)|Plenty]]''.<ref name=plenty/> She re-teamed with Streep for 1992's ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'', playing Toni, a bartender who runs away with Ernest ([[Bruce Willis]]) and lives happily ever after. Director [[Robert Zemeckis]] decided to re-shoot the ending, opting for a darker, "more risky ending." This meant that Ullman's scenes would have to be cut. "We were all heartbroken over losing the character. (She) was so great." Despite the cut, some of her scenes were released in an early trailer for the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies. : THE VANISHING : 'Death Becomes Her' and the Lost Ullman Ending|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-09/entertainment/ca-6132_1_ullman-ending|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=LATimes.com|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> ''Death Becomes Her'' is one of two instances in which her scenes in a film have ended up on the [[cutting room floor]].
