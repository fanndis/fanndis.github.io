Botswana is topographically flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast.

A mid-sized country of just over 2.3 million people, it is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated]] countries in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, [[Gaborone]]. Formerly one of the world's poorest countries—with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s—Botswana has since transformed itself into an upper middle income country, with one of the world's fastest-growing economies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Consolidating Democratic Governance in Southern Africa : Botswana|url=https://www.africaportal.org/publications/consolidating-democratic-governance-in-southern-africa-botswana/|last1=Maundeni|first1=Zibani|last2=Mpabanga|first2=Dorothy|date=2007-01-01|website=Africa Portal|access-date=2020-05-28|last3=Mfundisi|first3=Adam}}</ref> 

[[Homo sapiens]] had first inhabited the country over 200,000 years ago. The [[Tswana people|Tswana ethnic group]] were descended mainly from Bantu-speaking tribes who migrated southward of Africa to modern Botswana around 600 AD, living in tribal enclaves as farmers and herders. In 1885, The [[British Empire|British]] colonized the area and declared a [[protectorate]] under the name of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]].

Botswana is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Southern African Development Community]], the Commonwealth of Nations, and the [[United Nations]].

It is unclear when [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples first moved into the country from the north, although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. In that era, the ancestors of the modern-day [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]] moved into what is now the north-eastern areas of the country. These proto-Kalanga were closely connected to states in [[Zimbabwe]] as well as to the [[Mapungubwe]] state and the notable of these was [[Domboshaba]] ruins which is a cultural and heritage site in Botswana originally occupied towards the end of the Great Zimbabwe period (1250–1450 AD) with stone walls that have an average height of 1.8 metres.. The site is a respected place for the people living in the region and it is believed that the chief lived on the top of the hill together with his helpers or assistants. These states, located outside of current Botswana's borders, appear to have kept massive cattle herds in what is now the Central District—apparently at numbers approaching modern cattle density.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=181334 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700029170|title=A New Look at the Later Prehistory of the Kalahari|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–28|last1=Denbow|first1=James|year=1986}}</ref> This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so, and seems to have regressed following the collapse of Mapungubwe.

All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and [[rhinoceros horn]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Denbow|first1=James|last2=Klehm|first2=Carla|last3=Dussubieux|first3=Laure|date=April 2015|title=The glass beads of Kaitshàa and early Indian Ocean trade into the far interior of southern Africa|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/glass-beads-of-kaitshaa-and-early-indian-ocean-trade-into-the-far-interior-of-southern-africa/9BB659F4DA38A560EF64C4E8E3F49AFA|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=89|issue=344|pages=361–377|doi=10.15184/aqy.2014.50|issn=0003-598X}}</ref>

[[Toutswemogala Hill]] Iron Age Settlement's radio-carbon dates for this settlement range from 7th to late 19th century AD indicating occupation of more than one thousand years. The hill was part of the formation of early states in Southern Africa with cattle keeping as major source of economy. Toutswe settlement include house-floors, large heaps of vitrified cow-dog and burials while the outstanding structure is the stone wall. There are large tracts of centaurs ciliaris, a type of grass which has come to be associated with cattle-keeping settlements in South, Central Africa.Around 700 A.D., the [[Toutswe]] people moved westward into Botswana and began an agricultural and pastoral land tenure system based on [[sorghum]] and [[millet]], and domesticated stock, respectively.<ref name=Hall>Hall, Martin (1990), ''Farmers, Kings, and Traders: The People of Southern Africa, 200-1860'', University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-31326-3}}.</ref> The site was situated in the center of a broader cultural area in Eastern Botswana and shares many commonalities with other archaeological sites of this region, in both ceramic production styles and also timeframes inhabited.<ref name=Hall /> Large structures were observed that contained vitrified remains of animal dung, leading to the theory that these were animal enclosures and that Toutswemogala Hill was thus a major center of animal husbandry in the region.<ref name=Hall /> However, agriculture also played a vital role in the longevity of Toutswemogala Hill's extended occupation, as many grain storage structures have also been found on the site.  Many different stratified layers of housing floors further signal continuous occupation over hundreds of years.

The arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region has yet to be dated precisely. Members of the [[Bakwena]], a chieftaincy under a legendary leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the southern Kalahari by AD 1500, at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining territories. The [[Bangwaketse]] occupied areas to the west, while the [[Bangwato]] moved northeast into formerly Kalanga areas.<ref>[[David Magang|Magang, D.]] (2008) ''The Magic of Perseverance: The Autobiography of David Magang''.

===Effects of the Mfecane and Batswana-Boer Wars===
{{main|Mfecane}}
[[File:Kapstaaten 1905.png|thumb|left|German map of 1905 still showing the undivided Bechuanaland area]]
The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in [[1824]]. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=Fred|title=The Rise of a Raiding State: Makaba II's Ngwaketse, 1780–1824|url=https://www.academia.edu/11134264}}</ref> Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morton, B. |title=Pre-1904 Population Estimates of the Tswana|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=25 |year=1993|pages=89–99|jstor=40979984 }}</ref> This equilibrium came to end during the [[Mfecane]] period, 1823–1843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading [[Makololo tribe|Bakololo]] in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and [[Amandebele]]{{dn|date=October 2020}} raided repeatedly and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana—most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton |first=Barry|date=2009-01-14|title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838–1880|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=36|pages=220–239|language=en|doi=10.1080/02582479708671276}}</ref>

During the 1840s and 1850s trade with [[Cape Colony]]-based merchants opened up and enabled the [[Batswana]] chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by [[1880]], and thus the Bushmen, the Kalanga, the Bakgalagadi, and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02582479708671276|title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838–1880|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=36|pages=220–239|year=1997|last1=Morton|first1=Barry}}</ref>

Following the [[Great Trek]], [[Afrikaners]] from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. In 1852 a coalition of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] chiefdoms led by [[Sechele I]] resisted Afrikaner incursions during [[Battle of Dimawe]], and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together comparatively peacefully.<ref>[[David Magang|Magang, D.]] (2008) ''The Magic of Perseverance: The Autobiography of David Magang''.

In 1884 Batawana, a northern based Tswana clan's Cavalry under the command of Kgosi Moremi fought and defeated the Ndebele's invasion of northern Botswana at the Battle of Khutiyabasadi. This blow to the larger invading Ndebele force signaled the start of the collapse of the Ndebele Kingdom in Zimbabwe and helped galvanize Tswana speaking authority of the area now making part of northern Botswana. .<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=72905&dir=2017/november/06|title=Mmegi Blogs :: The Guns of Khutiyabasadi (II)|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|work=Mmegi Blogs|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>

Due to newly peaceful conditions, trade thrived between 1860 and 1880. Taking advantage of this were Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]]. The [[Lutherans]] and the [[London Missionary Society]] both became established in the country by 1856. By 1880 every major village had a resident missionary, and their influence slowly became felt. [[Khama III]] (reigned 1875–1923) was the first of the Tswana chiefs to make Christianity a state religion and changed a great deal of Tswana customary law as a result. Christianity became the de facto official religion in all the chiefdoms by World War I.<ref>Landau, P.

===Colonialism and the Bechuanaland Protectorate===
{{Main|Bechuanaland Protectorate}}[[File:3 Dikgosi.jpg|thumb|3 Dikgosi [[Khama III]], [[Sebele I]] & [[Bathoen I]] who negotiated a Protectorate]]
During the [[Scramble for Africa]] the territory of Botswana was coveted by both [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. During the [[Berlin Conference]], Britain decided to annex Botswana in order to safeguard the Road to the North and thus connect the Cape Colony to its territories further north. It unilaterally annexed Tswana territories in January 1885 and then sent the [[Warren Expedition]] north to consolidate control over the area and convince the chiefs to accept British overrule. Despite their misgivings, they eventually acquiesced to this fait accompli.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/15645705 |title=The Invention and Perpetuation of Botswana's National Mythology, 1885–1966 |last1=Morton |first1=Barry |last2=Ramsay |first2=Jeff |pages=4–7 |access-date=13 July 2018 |via=academia.edu}}</ref>

In 1890 areas north of 22 degrees were added to the new [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]]. During the 1890s the new territory was divided into eight different reserves, with fairly small amounts of land being left as freehold for white [[settlers]]. During the early 1890s, the British government decided to hand over the Bechuanaland Protectorate to the [[British South Africa Company]]. This plan, which was well on its way to fruition despite the entreaties of Tswana leaders who toured England in protest, was eventually foiled by the failure of the [[Jameson Raid]] in January 1896.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/15645705 |title=The Invention and Perpetuation of Botswana's National Mythology, 1885–1966 |last1=Morton |first1=Barry |last2=Ramsay |first2=Jeff |access-date=13 July 2018 |via=academia.edu|pages=7–11}}</ref><ref>Parsons, N.

When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 from the main British colonies in the region, the High Commission Territories – the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]), and [[Swaziland]] (now [[Eswatini]]) — were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, the UK began to consult with their inhabitants as to their wishes. Although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred to their jurisdiction, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of the UK or these territories agreeing to incorporation into South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Frank|date=1980|title=South Africa's Departure from the Commonwealth, 1960-1961|journal=The International History Review|volume=2|issue=3|pages=453–484|doi=10.1080/07075332.1980.9640222|jstor=40105085|issn=0707-5332}}</ref>

===Independence===
{{see also|Independence Day (Botswana)}}
In June 1964, the United Kingdom accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from [[Mahikeng]] in South Africa, to the newly established [[Gaborone]], which is located near Botswana's border with South Africa. Based on the 1965 constitution, the country held its first general elections under universal suffrage and gained independence on 30 September 1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/fireworksatmidnight.htm |title=Fireworks at Midnight |website=Britishempire.co.uk |access-date=27 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103054412/http://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/fireworksatmidnight.htm |archive-date=3 November 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first President, and subsequently re-elected twice.

The presidency passed to the sitting vice-president, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. He was succeeded by [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first President), who had been serving as Mogae's vice-president since resigning his position in 1998 as Commander of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] to take up this civilian role.

A long-running dispute over the northern border with [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]] was the subject of a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 1999. It ruled that [[Kasikili Island]] belongs to Botswana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southern-eagle.com/namibia/namgeninfo.html |title=Namibia General Information |publisher=Southern-eagle.com |date=21 March 1990 |accessdate=21 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112332/http://www.southern-eagle.com/namibia/namgeninfo.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Botswana|Climate of Botswana}}
[[File:Botswana map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Botswana map of [[Köppen climate classification]].]]
At {{convert|581730|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} Botswana is the world's 48th-largest country. It is similar in size to [[Madagascar]] or [[France]]. It lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[27th parallel south|27°S]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[30th meridian east|30°E]].

The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling [[plateau|tableland]]. Botswana is dominated by the [[Kalahari Desert]], which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The [[Okavango Delta]], one of the world's largest inland [[River deltas|delta]]s, is in the northwest. The [[Makgadikgadi Pan]], a large [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]], lies in the north.

The [[Limpopo River]] Basin, the major landform of all of southern Africa, lies partly in Botswana, with the basins of its tributaries, the [[Notwane River|Notwane]], [[Bonwapitse River|Bonwapitse]], [[Mahalapye]], [[Lotsane River|Lotsane]], [[Motloutse River|Motloutse]] and the [[Shashe River|Shashe]], located in the eastern part of the country. The Notwane provides water to the capital through the [[Gaborone Dam]]. The [[Cuando River|Chobe River]] lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and Namibia's [[Zambezi Region]]. The Chobe River meets with the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] at a place called [[Kazungula]] (meaning a small [[sausage tree]], a point where [[Sebitwane]] and his [[Makololo|Makololo tribe]] crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

===Ecology===
[[File:Cebras de Burchell (Equus quagga burchellii), vista aérea del delta del Okavango, Botsuana, 2018-08-01, DD 28.jpg|thumb|Zebras roaming the Okavango Basin]]
Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where [[blue wildebeest]], [[antelope]]s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered [[African wild dog]]. [[Chobe National Park]], found in the [[Chobe District]], has the world's largest concentration of [[African bush elephant|African elephant]]s. The park covers about {{convert|11000|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and supports about 350 species of birds.

The Chobe National Park and [[Moremi Game Reserve]] (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] located in the Kalahari desert in [[Ghanzi District]]; [[Makgadikgadi Pans National Park]] and [[Nxai Pan National Park]] are in [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the [[Shashe River]] and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is [[Mokolodi Nature Reserve]] near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like [[Khama Rhino Sanctuary]] (for [[rhinoceros]]) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for [[flamingo]]s). They are both located in Central District.

Botswana faces two major [[Natural environment|environment]]al problems, drought and [[desertification]], which are heavily linked. Three-quarters of the country's human and animal populations depend on groundwater due to drought. [[Groundwater]] use through deep borehole drilling has somewhat eased the effects of drought. Surface water is scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall. In the remaining 95% of the country, raising livestock is the primary source of rural income. Approximately 71% of the country's land is used for communal [[grazing]], which has been a major cause of the desertification and the accelerating soil erosion of the country.<ref name="rala.is">{{cite web | publisher = Rala | location = IS | url = http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | title = Darkoh | access-date = 30 March 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010191509/http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | archive-date = 10 October 2010 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

Since raising livestock has been profitable for the people of Botswana, they continue to exploit the land with dramatically increasing numbers of animals. From 1966 to 1991, the livestock population grew from 1.7 million to 5.5 million.<ref name = "rala.is" />{{rp |64}} Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, a 161% increase in 24 years. "Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is currently the largest single source of rural income." "Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing, or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use. Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change."<ref name = "rala.is" />

Environmentalists report that the [[Okavango Delta]] is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.<ref name="afrol.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |title= Botswana, US sign 'Debt-for-Nature' agreement |publisher= Afrol |accessdate= 4 July 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091201140712/http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |archive-date= 1 December 2009 |url-status= live}}</ref> The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana and one of the largest inland deltas in the world; it is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The [[United States Government]] has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them US$7 million to reduce Botswana's debt by US$8.3 million. The stipulation of the US reducing Botswana's debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the land.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] claims that poverty is a major problem behind the [[overexploitation]] of resources, including land, in Botswana. To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana. The purpose of the project is to draw from "indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems". The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, to draw them in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty. The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development.<ref name="afrol1">{{cite web |url = http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 |title = Botswana villages fighting desertification |publisher = Afrol |accessdate = 4 July 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091102221242/http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 |archive-date = 2 November 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref>

The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana 1996 (rev. 2002)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Botswana_2002?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414180706/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Botswana_2002?lang=en|archive-date=14 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

It consists of a typical court system of local Magistrates Courts, a [[High Court of Botswana|High Court]] and a Court of Appeal. The High Court is a superior court of record with unlimited original jurisdiction to hear and determine any criminal, civil or constitutional cases under any law. Appeals can be heard by the Court of Appeal. The Head of the High Court is the Chief Justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.bw/about%20us/background-judiciary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929023917/http://www.justice.gov.bw/about%20us/background-judiciary|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2015|title=Administration of Justice|publisher=Republic of Botswana Administarion of Justice|accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The Court of Appeal is the highest and final court in the country and deals with appeals from the High Court and the Industrial Court. The Head of the Court of Appeal is the Judge President.

Judges are appointed by the President of Botswana on the recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission.

At the time of independence, Botswana had no armed forces.

Following political changes in South Africa and the region, the BDF's missions have increasingly focused on prevention of [[poaching]], [[Emergency management|preparing for disasters]], and foreign [[peacekeeping]]. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps have received U.S. training.

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Botswana}}
Many of the indigenous [[San people]] have been forcibly relocated from their land to reservations. To make them relocate, they were denied access to water on their land and faced arrest if they hunted, which was their primary source of food.<ref name=bbc1>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24821867|title=Botswana bushmen: Modern life is destroying us|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=24 July 2016|date=7 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325015238/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24821867|archive-date=25 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Their lands lie in the middle of the world's richest [[diamond]] field. Officially, the government denies that there is any link to mining and claims the relocation is to preserve the wildlife and ecosystem, even though the San people have lived sustainably on the land for millennia.<ref name=bbc1/> On the reservations, they struggle to find employment and [[alcoholism]] is rampant.<ref name=bbc1/>
On 24 August 2018 the UN Special Rapporteur on Minorities, Fernand de Varennes, issued a statement calling on Botswana "to step up efforts to recognize and protect the rights of minorities in relation to public services, land and resource use and the use of minority languages in education and other critical areas."

Until June 2019, [[LGBT rights in Botswana|homosexuality]] was illegal in Botswana. A Botswana High Court decision of 11 June of that year, however, struck down provisions in the Criminal Code that punished "carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature" and "acts of gross indecency", making Botswana one of twenty-two African countries that have either [[Decriminalization|decriminalised]] or [[Legalization|legalised]] homosexuality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/africa/botswana-lgbtq-ruling-intl/index.html|title=Botswana scraps gay sex laws in big victory for LGBTQ rights in Africa|last=Fox|first=Kara|website=CNN|access-date=11 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611111110/https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/africa/botswana-lgbtq-ruling-intl/index.html|archive-date=11 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20130823203723/http://www.mti.gov.bw/ Ministry of Trade and Industry of Botswana] is responsible for promoting [[business development]] throughout the country. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], economic growth averaged over 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Botswana has a [[List of countries by economic freedom|high level of economic freedom]] compared to other African countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&aid=99&dir=2007/September/Thursday6/|title=Botswana ranked Africa's leader in economic freedom|publisher=mmegi.bw|date=19 May 2017|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822145230/http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&aid=99&dir=2007%2FSeptember%2FThursday6%2F|archive-date=22 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The government has maintained a sound [[fiscal policy]], despite consecutive [[Government budget deficit|budget deficits]] in 2002 and 2003, and a negligible level of [[External debt|foreign debt]]. It earned the highest sovereign [[credit rating]] in Africa and has stockpiled foreign exchange reserves (over $7 billion in 2005/2006) amounting to almost two and a half years of current imports.

The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2014 International Property Rights Index.<ref>{{cite web|title=The International Property Rights Index 2014: Africa by Score|url=http://internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/countries?r=A&f=ipri&o=desc|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208141240/http://internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/countries?r=A&f=ipri&o=desc|archive-date=8 December 2015|accessdate=23 August 2015|publisher=The International Property Rights Index}}</ref>

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves some sectors for citizens. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise's fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.

Botswana imports refined petroleum products and electricity from South Africa. There is some domestic production of electricity from coal.

{{Main|Languages of Botswana|Setswana}}
The official language of Botswana is English although [[Tswana language|Setswana]] is widely spoken across the country. In Setswana, [[prefix]]es are more important than they are in many other languages, since Setswana is a [[Bantu language]] and has noun classes denoted by these prefixes. They include ''Bo'', which refers to the country, ''Ba'', which refers to the people, ''Mo'', which is one person, and ''Se'' which is the language. For example, the main ethnic group of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.

Other languages spoken in Botswana include [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] (sekalanga), [[Tshwa language|Sarwa]] (sesarwa), [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], Kgalagadi, Tswapong, [[Taa language|!Xóõ]], Yeyi, and, in some parts, [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]].

An estimated 77% of the country's citizens identify as [[Christians]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and the [[United Congregational Church of Southern Africa]] make up the majority of Christians. There are also congregations of [[Lutheran]]s, [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in the country. According to the 2001 census, the country has around 5,000 [[Islam|Muslims]], mainly from [[South Asia]], 3,000 [[Hindus]] and 700 of the [[Baháʼí Faith]]. Approximately 20% of citizens identify with [[Irreligion|no religion]].

==Culture==

Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana—whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana. In Botswana, most of the tribes have different ways to greet one another, but for easy communication and connection, batswana use a three-way hand shake or just greet one another by saying "Dumelang" as a way of saying "hello" without physical contact. In community celebrations like Dikgafela or during marriage ceremonies, batswana women show excitement and happiness by the use of [[ululation]]s as part of their culture.

===Literature and cinema===

Botswana literature belongs somewhere in the strong African literary writing circles. African literature is known for its consciousness and didactic writing styles. Writing as an art form has existed in Botswana for a long while from the rock painting era especially in the Tsodilo Hills known to be 20,000 years old, to the present day with the movie production of [[the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency]] story.

In recent times and to date Botswana has seen a remarkable appearance of distinguished writers whose genres range from historical, political and witty story writing. Prominent amongst these are the South African born Bessie Head who settled in Serowe village, Andrew Sesinyi, Barolong Seboni (His works include Images of the Sun, Screams and Pleas, Lovesongs, Windsongs of the Kgalagadi and Lighting the Fire, and several other publications that include a play; Sechele I, and Setswana Riddles Translated into English), Unity Dow, Galesiti Baruti, Caitlin Davies, Lauri Kubuetsile, Albert Malikongwa, Toro Mositi and Moteane Melamu.<ref>https://medium.com/@africadialogue/the-history-and-future-of-literature-in-botswana-dc0120b34561</ref>

Most of Bessie Head's important works are set in Serowe. The three novels When Rain Clouds Gather (1968), Maru (1971), and A Question of Power (1973) all have this setting. The three are also autobiographical; When Rain Clouds Gather is based on her experience living on a development farm, Maru incorporates her experience of being considered racially inferior, and A Question of Power draws on her understanding of what it was like to experience acute psychological distress. Head also published a number of short stories, including the collection The Collector of Treasures (1977). She published a book on the history of Serowe, the village she settled in, called Serowe: Village of the Rainwind. Her last novel, A Bewitched Crossroad (1984), is historical, set in 19th-century Botswana. She had also written a story of two prophets, one wealthy and one who lived poorly called "Jacob: The Faith-Healing Priest".<ref>Mary Ellen Snodgrass, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&pg=PT141 "Head, Bessie (Bessie Amelia Emery Head)"], ''Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire'', Infobase Publishing, 2010, pp. 131-132.</ref><ref name=SAHO>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/bessie-amelia-head-sa-novelist-dies "Bessie Amelia Head, SA novelist dies"], South African History Online, 17 April 1986.</ref>

The 1981 comedy, "[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]" was set in Botswana and became a major international hit, 2000's [[Disney]] production "[[Whispers: An Elephant's Tale]]" was filmed in Botswana, starring Hollywood legend [[Angela Bassett]]. Later on, during 2009, parts of [[M. Saravanan (film producer)|M. Saravanan]]'s Tamil language Indian action film, "[[Ayan (film)|Ayan]]" were recorded in Botswana.

The critically acclaimed "[[A United Kingdom]]", about the real-life love story of Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, was filmed partly between Botswana and [[London, England]] and was released internationally in 2016.<ref name="oxfordbibliographies">{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199846733/obo-9780199846733-0110.xml|title=Botswana (Bechuanaland) - African Studies|website=Oxford Bibliographies|accessdate=2019-12-22}}</ref>

===Media===
{{main|Media of Botswana}}

There are five [[television station]]s in Botswana, one of which is state-owned ([[Botswana TV]]), along with Now TV, Khuduga HD, Maru TV and EBotswana. There are five local [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]] (RB1, RB2, Duma FM, Gabz FM, and Yarona FM) and thirteen [[newspaper]]s ([[Mmegi]], Sunday Standard, The Telegraph, Business Weekly, [[The Botswana Gazette]], The Voice, The Guardian, Echo, Botswana People's Daily, DailyNews, Tswana Times, Weekend Post, and The Monitor) that publish regularly.

Botswana's music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Botswana folk music has instruments such as setinkane (a sort of miniature piano), segankure/segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument [[erhu]]), moropa (meropa -plural) (many varieties of drums), phala (a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. The hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against {{transl|tn|phathisi}} (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area, only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the segaba instrument does not have. The national anthem is "[[Fatshe leno la rona]]". Written and composed by [[Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete]], it was adopted upon independence in 1966.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Makgala|first=Christian John|date=2014-07-03|title=Neil Parsons, National Coat of Arms, and Introduction of the Pula Currency in Botswana, 1975–1976|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=66|issue=3|pages=504–520|doi=10.1080/02582473.2014.898081|s2cid=159475736|issn=0258-2473}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Welcome to Daily News .:.

=== Visual arts ===
{{Main|Culture of Botswana}}

In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of Etsha and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through colour use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for international markets.{{sfn|Cunningham|Milton|1987}}

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/Bushmen) over twenty thousand years ago within the [[Kalahari]] desert.

===Food===
{{Main|Cuisine of Botswana}}

The cuisine of Botswana is unique and mostly includes meat as Botswana is a cattle country, the national dish is [[seswaa]], pounded meat made from goat meat or beef, [[Biltong|Segwapa]] dried, cured meat ranging from beef to game meats & the cut may also vary, either fillets of meat cut into strips following the grain of the muscle, or flat pieces sliced across the grain. Madila is a popular fermented milk product of Botswana in a yogurt form. Botswana's cuisine shares some characteristics with other cuisine of Southern Africa. 

Examples of Botswana food are: [[Bogobe]], [[Pap (food)|pap]] (maize porridge), [[boerewors]], [[samp]], Magwinya (fried dough bread) and [[Imbrasia belina|mopane worms]]. Porridge (bogobe) is made by putting sorghum, maize or millet flour into boiling water, stirring into a soft paste, and cooking it slowly. A dish called Ting is made when the sorghum or maize is fermented and milk and sugar added. Without the milk and sugar, ting is sometimes eaten with meat or vegetables as lunch or dinner. Another way of making bogobe is to add sour milk and a cooking melon (lerotse). This dish is called tophi by the Kalanga tribe. Many different kinds of beans are grown, including cowpeas, ditloo, and letlhodi. There are some vegetables that grow in the wild that are available seasonally including thepe and Delele (okra). Many fruits are locally available, including marula. Watermelons, believed to have come originally from Botswana, are plentiful in season. Another kind of melon, called lerotse or lekatane, is also grown. There are some kinds of wild melon found in sandy desert areas which are an important food and water source for the people who live in those areas. [[Kgalagadi Breweries Limited]] produces the national beer St. Louis Larger Botswana's first and only proud local beer brand that has also been a part of Batswana's rich history since 1989 & non-alcoholic beverage Keone Mooka Mageu a traditional fermented porridge.

Botswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.<ref name="ref">{{cite web |url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |publisher=Stats.uis.unesco.org |accessdate=21 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725065836/http://stats.uis.unesco.org/ |archive-date=25 July 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.

After leaving school, students can attend one of the seven technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in [[teaching]] or [[nursing]]. Students enter the [[University of Botswana]], [[Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources]], [[Botswana International University of Science and Technology]] and the [[Botswana Accountancy College]] in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. Notable amongst these is [https://web.archive.org/web/20130904150159/http://www.bothocollege.ac.bw/ Botho University], the country's first private university which offers undergraduate programmes in Accounting, Business and Computing.

A vast majority of these students are government sponsored. The nation's second international university, the Botswana International University of Science and Technology, was completed in [[Palapye]] in 2011.

In terms of power infrastructure in Botswana, the country produces coal for electricity and oil is imported into the country. Recently, the country has taken a large interest in renewable energy sources and has completed a comprehensive strategy that will attract investors in the wind, solar and biomass renewable energy industries. Botswana's power stations include [[Morupule Power Station|Morupule B Power Station]] (600&nbsp;MW), [[Morupule Power Station|Morupule A Power Station]] (132&nbsp;MW), [[Orapa Power Station]] (90&nbsp;MW), [[Phakalane power station|Phakalane Power Station]] (1.3&nbsp;MW) and [[Mmamabula|Mmamabula Power Station]] (300&nbsp;MW) which is expected to be online in the near future.
A 200&nbsp;MW solar power plant is at planning and designing stage by Ministry of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/unusual-tourism-ministry-solar-power-plant-tender-raises-eyebrows|title=Unusual Tourism ministry solar power plant tender raises eyebrows {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref><ref name="mmegi.bw">http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=1253&dir=2012/June/Friday22/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190121232514/http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=1253&dir=2012%2FJune%2FFriday22%2F |date=21 January 2019 }}.</ref>

The Ministry of Health<ref>[http://www.moh.gov.bw/ Ministry of Health]</ref> in Botswana is responsible for overseeing the quality and distribution of [[healthcare]] throughout the country. [[Life expectancy]] at birth was 55 in 2009 according to the World Bank, having previously fallen from a peak of 64.1 in 1990 to a low of 49 in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Bank Botswana Data |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/botswana |accessdate=20 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709120507/http://data.worldbank.org//country//botswana |archive-date=9 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> After Botswana's 2011 census, current life expectancy is estimated at 54.06 years.<ref name="cia" />

Like elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, the [[economic impact of AIDS]] is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002–3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|Botswana has been hit]] very hard by the [[AIDS pandemic]]; in 2006 it was estimated that life expectancy at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.<ref name= Kallings>{{Cite journal |journal= J Intern Med |year= 2008 |volume=263 |issue=3 |pages= 218–43 |title=The first postmodern pandemic: 25 years of HIV/AIDS |last=Kallings |first= LO |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x |pmid=18205765 |s2cid= 205339589 }}</ref> However, after Botswana's 2011 census current life expectancy is estimated at 54.06 years.<ref name="cia" />

The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana was estimated at 25.4% for adults aged 15–49 in 2009 and 21.9% in 2013,<ref name= Gap />{{rp|A8}} exceeded by Lesotho and Swaziland in sub-Saharan African nations. This places Botswana at the third highest prevalence in the world, in 2013, while "leading the way in prevention and treatment programmes".<ref name=Avert>{{cite web |url= http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htm |title= HIV and Aids in Botswana |publisher= Avert International Aids Charity |accessdate= 21 June 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228211140/http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htm |archive-date= 28 February 2009 |url-status= live}}</ref> In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral]] drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus; in 2013, over 40% of adults in Botswana had access to antiretroviral therapy.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |28}} In the age group of 15–19 years old, prevalence was estimated at about 6% for females and 3.5% for males in 2013,<ref name= Gap />{{rp|33}} and for the 20–24 age group, 15% for females and 5% for males.<ref name=Gap />{{rp |33}} Botswana is one of 21 priority countries identified by the UN AIDS group in 2011 in the Global Plan to eliminate new HIV infections among children and to keep their mothers alive.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |37}} From 2009 to 2013, the country saw a decrease over 50% in new HIV infections in children.<ref name=Gap />{{rp |38}} A further measure of the success, or reason for hope, in dealing with HIV in Botswana, is that less than 10% of pregnant HIV-infected women were not receiving antiretroviral medications in 2013, with a corresponding large decrease (over 50%) in the number of new HIV infections in children under 5.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |39, 40}} Among the UN Global Plan countries, people living with HIV in Botswana have the highest percentage receiving antiretroviral treatment: about 75% for adults (age 15+) and about 98% for children.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |237}}

With a nationwide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program, Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%. Under the leadership of [[Festus Mogae]], the Government of Botswana solicited outside help in fighting HIV/AIDS and received early support from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Merck Foundation, and together formed the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership (ACHAP). Other early partners include the [[Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute]], of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and the [[Botswana-UPenn Partnership]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, universal access to treatment – defined as 80% coverage or greater – has been achieved in Botswana.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf |title= World AIDS Day Report |year= 2011 |publisher= UNAIDS |access-date= 21 February 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130601011732/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf |archive-date= 1 June 2013 |url-status= live}}</ref>

Potential reasons for Botswana's high HIV prevalence include concurrent sexual partnerships, transactional sex, cross-generational sex, and a significant number of people who travel outside of their local communities in pursuit of work. The [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] nature of many sexual relationships further impacts the health situation, to the extent that it has given rise to a love vocabulary<ref>{{cite web |title= Exposing Botswana's Love Vocabulary |publisher= Dr. Shem |url= http://drshem.com/2011/06/16/exposing-botswana-love-vocabulary/ |date= 16 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111013150737/http://drshem.com/2011/06/16/exposing-botswana-love-vocabulary |archive-date= 13 October 2011 |url-status= live}}</ref> that is unique to the region.
