== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2019}}
B-Reel was founded in 1999 by Anders Wahlquist, Fredrik Heinig, Johannes Åhlund, Pelle Nilsson and Petter Westlund,<ref>Diaz, Ann Christine,  http://creativity-online.com/news/creativity-50-2011-pelle-nilsson-anders-wahlquist-petter-westlund/227972 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011102330/http://creativity-online.com/news/creativity-50-2011-pelle-nilsson-anders-wahlquist-petter-westlund/227972 |date=2011-10-11 }} "Creativity 50 2011: Pelle Nilsson, Anders Wahlquist, Petter Westlund" ''Creativity'', June 05 2011</ref> all of whom in different ways are still involved in the company. At the time Åhlund and Heinig were running the television commercial production company Spader Knekt (later renamed St Paul). The two companies, Spader Knekt and B-Reel, worked side by side for several years until the two merged to create B-Reel Films, focusing on drama, television and advertising production.

B-Reel continued to exist under the moniker B-Reel, but as a creative agency offering strategic, creative and digital services for brands.

In 2011, B-Reel was involved in creating ''[[The Wilderness Downtown]]'', an interactive music experience for [[Arcade Fire]]'s song [[We Used to Wait|We Used To Wait]], which was included in [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine's]] list of the 30 best music videos.<ref>Sanburn, Josh, http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085359_2085377,00.html "The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos" ''Time Magazine'', July 28, 2011</ref>
