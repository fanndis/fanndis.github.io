'''Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon''' (born March 22, 1976) is an American actress, producer, and entrepreneur. The recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Reese Witherspoon|various accolades]], including an [[Academy Award]], two [[Golden Globe Awards]], and a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], she is one of the [[List of highest paid American television stars|highest-paid actresses]] in the world as of 2019. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named her one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2006 and 2015, and ''[[Forbes]]'' listed her among the [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|World's 100 Most Powerful Women]] in 2019.

Born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], and raised in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Witherspoon began her career as a teenager, making her screen debut in ''[[The Man in the Moon]]'' (1991). Following a leading role opposite [[Mark Wahlberg]] in ''[[Fear (1996 film)|Fear]]'' (1996), her breakthrough came in 1999 with a supporting role in ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'', and for her portrayal of [[Tracy Flick]] in the black comedy ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]''. She gained wider recognition for her role as [[Elle Woods]] in the comedy ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' (2001) and its [[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde|2003 sequel]], and for her starring role in the romantic comedy ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]'' (2002). In 2005, she garnered critical acclaim for her portrayal of [[June Carter Cash]] in the biographical musical film ''[[Walk the Line]]'', which won her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Witherspoon then starred in several critically and commercially unsuccessful comedies, during which her sole box-office success was the romantic drama ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011). She made a comeback by producing and starring as [[Cheryl Strayed]] in the drama ''[[Wild (2014 film)|Wild]]'' (2014), which earned her a second nomination for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Witherspoon has since begun work in television, by producing and starring in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Big Little Lies (TV series)|Big Little Lies]]'' (2017–2019), the [[Apple TV+]] drama series ''[[The Morning Show (American TV series)|The Morning Show]]'' (2019–present), and the [[Hulu]] miniseries ''[[Little Fires Everywhere (miniseries)|Little Fires Everywhere]]'' (2020). For the first of these, she won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series]].

Witherspoon also owns a clothing company [[Draper James]], and she is actively involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She serves on the board of the [[Children's Defense Fund]] (CDF) and was named Global Ambassador of [[Avon Products]] in 2007, serving as honorary chair of the charitable Avon Foundation dedicated to women's causes. In 2000, she co-founded production company [[Type A Films]], which has since merged with [[Hello Sunshine (company)|Hello Sunshine]], a media firm which Witherspoon also co-founded in 2016.

Witherspoon admits to spending several years "kind of floundering career-wise".

You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs." She claims that she "wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know.
