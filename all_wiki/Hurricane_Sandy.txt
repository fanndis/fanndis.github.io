Sandy developed from a [[tropical wave]] in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, quickly strengthened, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sandy six hours later. Sandy moved slowly northward toward the [[Greater Antilles]] and gradually intensified. On October 24, Sandy became a hurricane, made landfall near [[Kingston, Jamaica]], re-emerged a few hours later into the Caribbean Sea and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. On October 25, Sandy hit Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane, then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane.

In [[Jamaica]], winds left 70% of residents without electricity, blew roofs off buildings, killed one person, and caused about $100&nbsp;million (2012&nbsp;USD) in damage. Sandy's outer bands brought flooding to [[Haiti]], killing at least 54, causing food shortages, and leaving about 200,000 homeless; the hurricane also caused two deaths in the [[Dominican Republic]]. In [[Puerto Rico]], one man was swept away by a swollen river. In Cuba, there was extensive [[coastal flooding]] and wind damage inland, destroying some 15,000 homes, killing 11, and causing $2&nbsp;billion (2012&nbsp;USD) in damage.

===Forecasts===
[[File:AL182012 5W 025 0.png|thumb|The National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s forecast for the storm as of October 28, 2012]]
On October 23, 2012, the path of Hurricane Sandy was correctly predicted by the [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts]] (ECMWF) headquartered in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading, England]] nearly eight days in advance of its striking the [[East Coast of the United States|American East Coast]]. The computer model noted that the storm would turn west towards land and strike the New York/New Jersey region on October 29, rather than turn east and head out to the open Atlantic as most hurricanes in this position do. By October 27, four days after the ECMWF made its prediction, the [[National Weather Service]] and [[National Hurricane Center]] confirmed the path of the hurricane predicted by the European model. The National Weather Service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its European counterpart did. A hardware and software upgrade completed at the end of 2013 enabled the weather service to make predictions more accurate and farther in advance than the technology in 2012 had allowed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vergano|first=Dan|title=U.S. forecast's late arrival stirs weather tempest|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2012/10/30/sandy-hurricane-models/1668867/w|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=October 5, 2013|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

===Relation to global warming===
{{see also|Tropical cyclones and climate change}}
According to [[NCAR]] senior climatologist [[Kevin E. Trenberth]], "The answer to the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by [[global warming|climate change]] is that it is the wrong question. All weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trenberth|first=Kevin|title=Framing the way to relate climate extremes to climate change|journal=Climatic Change|date=March 2012|doi=10.1007/s10584-012-0441-5|volume=115|issue=2|pages=283–290|bibcode=2012ClCh..115..283T|doi-access=free}}</ref> Although [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] meteorologist Martin Hoerling attributes Sandy to "little more than the coincidental alignment of a tropical storm with an extratropical storm",<ref name="Revkin">{{cite news|last=Andrew C.|first=Revkin|title=The #Frankenstorm in Climate Context|url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/the-frankenstorm-in-climate-context/|newspaper=The New York Times; Dot Earth|date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> Trenberth does agree that the storm was caused by "natural variability" but adds that it was "enhanced by global warming".<ref name="SurfTemps">{{cite news|last=Trenberth|first=Kevin|title=Hurricane Sandy mixes super-storm conditions with climate change|url=http://theconversation.edu.au/hurricane-sandy-mixes-super-storm-conditions-with-climate-change-10388|work=The Conversation|access-date=October 29, 2012|quote=The sea surface temperatures along the Atlantic coast have been running at over 3[[°C]] above normal for a region extending 800 km off shore all the way from Florida to Canada. Global warming contributes 0.6°C to this. With every degree C, the water holding of the atmosphere goes up 7%, and the moisture provides fuel for the tropical storm, increases its intensity, and magnifies the rainfall by double that amount compared with normal conditions. Global climate change has contributed to the higher sea surface and ocean temperatures, and a warmer and moister atmosphere, and its effects are in the range of 5 to 10%. Natural variability and weather has provided the perhaps optimal conditions of a hurricane running into extra-tropical conditions to make for a huge intense storm, enhanced by global warming influences.}}</ref> One factor contributing to the storm's strength was abnormally warm [[sea surface temperatures]] offshore the [[East Coast of the United States]]—more than {{convert|3|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}} above normal, to which global warming had contributed {{convert|0.6|C-change|F-change|sigfig=1}}.<ref name="SurfTemps" /> As the temperature of the atmosphere increases, the capacity to hold water increases, leading to stronger storms and higher rainfall amounts.<ref name="SurfTemps" />

=== Environmental Impacts ===
The intense flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy proved to be too much for water treatment infrastructure on the East Coast of the United States. When the storm ended, more than two-hundred wastewater treatment plants and over eighty drinking water facilities had been severely damaged. The resulting damage caused more than ten-billion gallons of raw sewage to be released into different water sources. This contamination resulted in the shutting down of several drinking water facilities across many different states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.epa.gov/2013/10/29/a-look-back-at-epas-work-in-the-wake-of-hurricane-sandy/|title=A Look Back at EPA’s work in the Wake of Hurricane Sandy {{!}} The EPA Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

The contamination caused by this incident resulted in the EPA issuing a warning that all individuals should avoid coming into contact with the water in Newark Bay and New York Harbor, due to the increased presence of bacteria that is associated with human waste. Similar warnings were issued for water sources in both the Westchester and Yonkers areas due to similarly high levels of bacteria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/region02/sandy/web/html/response_11-23-12.html|title=Response 11/23/2012 {{!}} Hurricane Sandy {{!}} US EPA|website=archive.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

In January 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that those affected by the hurricane were still struggling to recover.<ref>{{cite news|title=Recovery Remains Spotty 3 Months After Hurricane|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/nyregion/recovery-remains-spotty-3-months-after-hurricane-sandy.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=March 24, 2014|date=January 21, 2013}}</ref>

In June 2013, NY Governor Andrew Cuomo set out to centralize recovery and rebuilding efforts in impacted areas of New York State by establishing the Governor's Office of Storm Recovery (GOSR). He aimed to address communities' most urgent needs, and to identify innovative and enduring solutions to strengthen the State's infrastructure and critical systems. Operating under the umbrella of New York Rising, GOSR utilized approximately $3.8&nbsp;billion in flexible funding made available by the [[U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development]]'s (HUD) [[Community Development Block Grant]] Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program to concentrate aid in four main areas: housing, small business, infrastructure, and the community reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governor's Office of Storm Recovery: Overview|url=http://stormrecovery.ny.gov/overview|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405075405/http://stormrecovery.ny.gov/overview|archive-date=April 5, 2014}}</ref>

On December 6, 2013, an analysis of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] data showed that fewer than half of those affected who requested disaster recovery assistance had received any, and a total of 30,000 residents of New York and New Jersey remained displaced.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGeehan|first=Patrick|title=Displaced by Hurricane Sandy, and Living in Limbo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/nyregion/displaced-by-hurricane-sandy-and-living-in-limbo-instead-of-at-home.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=March 24, 2014|date=December 6, 2013}}</ref>

In March 2014, ''[[Newsday]]'' reported, that 17 months after the hurricane people displaced from rental units on Long Island faced unique difficulties due to lack of affordable rental housing and delays in housing program implementations by New York State. Close to 9,000 rental units on Long Island were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, and [[Hurricane Irene]] and [[Tropical Storm Lee]] in 2011 per the NY State Governor's Office of Storm Recovery (GOSR).<ref>{{cite web|title=Long Island storm damage|url=http://data.newsday.com/long-island/data/real-estate/storm-damage|work=Newsday|publisher=New York State Governor's Office of Storm Recovery|access-date=March 25, 2014}}</ref> New York State officials said that additional assistance would soon be available from the HUD's Community Development Block Grant funds via the New York Rising program.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramos|first=Victor|title=Displaced by Sandy, LI renters long for home|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/displaced-by-sandy-li-renters-long-for-home-1.7433299|work=Newsday|publisher=Newsday|access-date=March 25, 2014}}</ref> On March 15, 2014, a group of those who remained displaced by the hurricane organized a protest at the Nassau Legislative building in Mineola, New York, to raise awareness of their frustration with the timeline for receiving financial assistance from the New York Rising program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Protesters demand Sandy recovery help in Mineola| work=News 12|  url=http://longisland.news12.com/features/sandy/protesters-demand-sandy-recovery-help-in-mineola-1.7400730|publisher=News 12|access-date=March 25, 2014}}</ref>

{{As of| March 2014}}, the GOSR released a press statement, that the New York Rising Community Reconstruction Program had distributed more than $280&nbsp;million in payments to 6,388 homeowners for damage from Hurricane Sandy, [[Hurricane Irene]] or [[Tropical Storm Lee]]. Every eligible homeowner who had applied by January 20, 2014, had been issued a check for home reconstruction, including over 4,650 Nassau residents for over $201&nbsp;million and over 1,350 Suffolk residents for over $65&nbsp;million. The state also had made offers over $293&nbsp;million to buy out homes of 709 homeowners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release, Governor's Office of Storm Recovery|date=March 11, 2014|url=http://www.stormrecovery.ny.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/03-11-14_gosr_ny_rising_housing_program_application_deadline_release_final.pdf}}</ref>

Hurricane Sandy sparked much political commentary. Many scientists said warming oceans and greater atmospheric moisture were intensifying storms while rising sea levels were worsening coastal effects. November 2012 Representative [[Henry Waxman]] of [[California]], the top Democrat of the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]], requested a hearing in the [[lame duck session]] on links between [[climate change]] and Hurricane Sandy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.

The storm hit the United States one week before its general [[United States elections]], and affected the presidential campaign, local and state campaigns in storm-damaged areas. New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]], one of [[Mitt Romney]]'s leading supporters, praised President [[Barack Obama]] and his reaction to the hurricane, and toured storm-damaged areas of his state with the president.<ref>{{cite news|last=Horsey|first=David|title=Chris Christie and Hurricane Sandy give Obama a timely boost|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-chris-christie-boost-20121031,0,1044954.story| newspaper=LA Times| access-date=November 2, 2012|date=October 31, 2012}}</ref> It was reported at the time that Sandy might affect elections in several states, especially by curtailing [[early voting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2012/10/31/hurricane-sandy-effect-on-election-could-hurt-democrats/|title=Hurricane Sandy effect on election could hurt Democrats| publisher=Foundation for Independent Voter Education| date=October 31, 2012|author=W.E.

In his news conference on November 14, 2012, President Obama said, "we can't attribute any particular weather event to climate change. What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting faster than was predicted even five years ago. We do know that there have been extraordinarily — there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe. And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it."<ref>{{cite news |title=Transcript of President Obama's News Conference |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/us/politics/running-transcript-of-president-obamas-press-conference.html |access-date=November 14, 2012 |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 14, 2012}}</ref>

On January 30, 2015, days after the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] released a post-Sandy report examining flood risks for 31,200 miles (50,210&nbsp;km) of the North Atlantic coast, President Obama issued an executive order directing federal agencies, state and local governments drawing federal funds to adopt stricter building and siting standards to reflect scientific projections that future flooding will be more frequent and intense due to climate change.<ref>Eilperin, Juliet [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/01/30/in-major-shift-obama-administration-will-plan-for-rising-seas-in-all-federal-projects/ In major shift, Obama administration will plan for rising seas in all federal projects] ''The Washington Post''. January 30, 2015</ref>

===Financial markets impact===
Power outages and flooding in the area closed the New York Stock Exchange and other financial markets on both October 29 and 30, a weather-related closure that last happened in 1888.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Craig|first1=Susanne|last2=Protess|first2=Ben|title=After Hurricane Sandy, Stock Exchanges Prepare to Open|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/after-hurricane-sandy-stock-exchanges-prepare-to-open/|access-date=November 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref> When markets reopened on October 31, investors were relieved that it closed relatively flat that day. A week later, the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]] Capital Markets Bureau noted a slight uptick in the market (0.8%) and suggested that the negative economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was offset by the expected positive impacts of rebuilding.<ref>{{cite news|title=Market Volatility: The Impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Financial Markets|url=http://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/121108.htm|work=Capital Markets Bureau Report|agency=National Association of Insurance Commissioners|date=November 8, 2012}}</ref>

===Infrastructure impact===

The destruction of physical infrastructure as a result of Sandy cost impacted states, including New York and New Jersey, tens of billions of dollars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events.pdf|title=Billion-Dollar U.S. Weather/Climate Disasters 1980-2012|date=11 July 2013|website=NOAA|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> EQECAT, a risk-modeling company that focuses on catastrophes, approximated that impacted regions lost between $30&nbsp;billion to $50&nbsp;billion in economic activity. The economic loss was attributed to the massive power outages, liquid fuel shortages, and a near shutdown of the region's transportation system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eqecat.com/catwatch/post-landfall-loss-estimates-superstorm-sandy-released-2012-11-01/|title=Post-Landfall Loss Estimates - Hurricane Sandy|date=1 November 2012|website=EQECAT|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

* Energy: Roughly 8.5&nbsp;million customers were impacted due to power outages, including many businesses that were hard pressed to deliver products and services in a timely manner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/Northeast%20Storm%20Comparison_FINAL_041513c.pdf.|title=Comparing the Impacts of Northeast Hurricanes on Energy Infrastructure|date=1 April 2013|website=Department of Energy|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> Breaks in gas lines also caused fires in many locations, prompting explosions and destruction of a large amount of residences. Locating gas and diesel fuel proved difficult immediately after Sandy hit, which harmed transportation access for many people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL182012_Sandy.pdf|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Sandy|date=12 February 2013|website=National Hurricane Center|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> The impairment of the ability to obtain fuel was due to flooding damage in crucial terminals and harbors in areas of New Jersey bordering the Arthur Kill. The shortage of fuel held up first responders as well as other response and recovery officials. Therefore, portable generators remained unutilized, resulting in long lines at fueling stations while individuals were unable to differentiate between the stations that did not hold power from the gas stations that were operational.
* Communications: Telecommunications infrastructure was heavily disrupted, impacting millions of people and thousands of businesses, destabilizing the economy of one of the biggest cities in the world. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) found that roughly 25% of cell towers across 10 states were out of service at the peak of the storm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/public-safety-and-homeland-security-bureau-chief-speeches|title=NENA 2013 Conference & Expo Charlotte|last=Turetsky|first=David|date=18 June 2013|website=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>
* Green Infrastructure: Hurricane Sandy's storm surge caused erosion of the beaches and dunes, island breaches, and overwash along the coast of New England down all the way to Florida. Flooding along the coast generated substantial erosion of previous natural infrastructure, flooding of wetland habitats, coastal dune destruction or erosion, decimation of coastal lakes, and novel inlet creation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/HSREBUILDINGSTRATEGY.PDF|title=Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy|date=1 August 2013|website=HUD|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>
* Transportation: Throughout the history of the country, the nation had not witnessed a worse disaster for public transit systems, including buses, subway, and commuter rail, than when Sandy struck. The morning after the storm hit, on October 30, 2012, more than half of the country's daily public transportation riders were unable to commute due to inoperable service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/newsroom/12908_14967.html|title=Testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development|last=Rogoff|first=Peter M.|date=20 December 2012|website=Federal Transit Association (FTA)|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> The New York City subway system was shut down two days prior to the storm due to necessary precautions and remained closed through November 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/RebuildingRockawaysAfterHurricanSandy.htm|title=Rebuilding the Rockaways After Hurricane Sandy: The Recovery|date=30 May 2013|website=MTA|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> During that short amount of time, one of the world's largest financial centers experienced immense traffic jams.

* Stormwater Management and Wastewater Treatment Systems: There was a massive failure in wastewater treatment facilities all around the mid-Atlantic coast due to floodwaters, large storm runoff, wind damage, and electricity loss.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/pdfs/Sewage.pdf|title=Sewage Overflows From Hurricane Sandy|date=1 April 2013|website=Climate Central|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> The region's waterways were hit with billions of gallons of raw and partially treated sewage, adversely affecting the health of the public, as well as ocean habitats and other important resources.<ref name=":0" /> There was also a public health concern about the threat of contaminated water filling the pipes and wells that supplied potable water to large parts of the region. Large water utility companies experienced power outages, disrupting their ability to provide safe drinking water. Advisories had to be sent out to many parts of New York and New Jersey for customers to warn them of the potential of their water being contaminated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2012/approved/20121031a.shtml|title=Christie Administration Advises Residents to Be Alert for Local Boil Water Advisories|date=31 October 2012|website=State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> The “boil water” advisories were later lifted, however, when it was proven that none of the water was contaminated or held the potential for any ill effects.
* Public Medical Facilities and Schools: A variety of New York City hospitals and other medical facilities, including the Bellevue Medical Center and Coney Island hospital, were shut down as a result of flooding from the storm. In many parts of the hospitals, there was considerable damage to research, medical, and electrical equipment which was located on lower floors for ease of access.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sirr/report/report.page|title=PlaNYC: A Stronger, More Resilient New York|date=11 June 2013|website=New York City Special Initiative for Resilient Rebuilding|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> In New Jersey, medical facilities were also severely affected. In sum, the hospitals in the state reported an estimated $68&nbsp;million in damage.

Thousands of homeowners were denied their flood insurance claims based upon fraudulent engineers' reports, according to the whistleblowing efforts of Andrew Braum, an engineer who claimed that at least 175 of his more than 180 inspections were doctored.<ref>{{cite episode | title= The Storm after the Storm |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-sandy-60-minutes-fraud-investigation/ | series= 60 Minutes | network= CBS | airdate= March 1, 2015 | access-date= April 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last= Cushman | first= Ted | title= FEMA Official Admits Fraud in Sandy Flood Cases | url= http://www.jlconline.com/insurance/fema-official-admits-fraud-in-sandy-flood-cases_o.aspx | journal= The Journal of Light Construction| date= March 9, 2015 | access-date= April 6, 2015}}</ref> As a result, a class-action racketeering lawsuit has been filed against several insurance companies and their contract engineering firms.<ref>{{cite journal | last= Cushman | first= Ted | title= Texas Trial Lawyer Mostyn Changing the Game in Sandy Insurance Battle | url= http://www.jlconline.com/insurance/texas-trial-lawyer-mostyn-changing-the-game-in-sandy-insurance-battle_o.aspx | journal= The Journal of Light Construction| date= February 23, 2015 | access-date= April 6, 2015}}</ref> {{As of |2015}}, the Federal Emergency Management Agency planned to review all flood insurance claims.<ref>{{citation | last= Dunn | first= Catherine | title= FEMA Opens Review To Every Single Hurricane Sandy Flood Insurance Claim After Fraud Allegations | url= http://www.ibtimes.com/fema-opens-review-every-single-hurricane-sandy-flood-insurance-claim-after-fraud-1844358 | newspaper = The International Business Times | date= March 11, 2015 | access-date= April 6, 2015}}</ref>

===Baby boom===
New Jersey hospitals saw a spike in births nine months after Sandy, causing some to believe that there was a post-Sandy baby boom. The [[Monmouth Medical Center]] saw a 35% jump, and two other hospitals saw 20% increases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/us/sandy-baby-boom/index.html?hpt=us_t4|title=Is the post-Sandy baby boom real?|author=Josh Levs|publisher=CNN|date=July 24, 2013|access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref> An expert stated that post-storm births that year were higher than in past disasters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130722/NJNEWS/307220079/Oh-baby-Sandy-baby-boom-due-Shore-month?nclick_check=1|title=Oh, baby!

===Retirement of the name===
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}

Because of the exceptional damage and deaths caused by the storm in many countries, the name "Sandy" was later retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]], and will never be used again for a [[North Atlantic hurricane]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Naming History and Retired Names|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|access-date=December 4, 2018|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml}}</ref> The name was replaced with "Sara" as a naming candidate for the [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season]] ("Sara" ended up unused in 2018 and will next be a candidate in 2024).<ref>{{cite web|title='Sandy' Out, 'Sara' in For 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Names, Watch out for 'Joyce'|year=2018|publisher=640 The Hurricane Sports Radio|access-date=December 4, 2018|url=https://www.640thehurricane.com/sandy-out-sara-in-for-2018-atlantic-hurricane-names-watch-out-for-joyce/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205003210/https://www.640thehurricane.com/sandy-out-sara-in-for-2018-atlantic-hurricane-names-watch-out-for-joyce/|archive-date=December 5, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Media coverage==
As Hurricane Sandy approached the United States, forecasters and journalists gave it several different unofficial names, at first related to its projected snow content, then to its proximity to Halloween, and eventually to the overall size of the storm. Early nicknames included "Snowicane Sandy"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=It Is Time To Start Freaking Out About Snowicane Sandy|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/10/hurricane-sandy-new-york-storm-snowicane.html?mid=twitter_nymag|magazine=New York Magazine|author=Amira, Dan|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> and [[Nor'easter|"Snor'eastercane]] Sandy".<ref>{{cite news|title=How to Feel About a Snor'eastercane|publisher=Atlantic Wire|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2012/10/how-feel-about-snoreastercane/58352/|author=Doll, Jen|date=October 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Weather Journal: When Hurricane Meets Snowstorm|author=Holthaus, Eric|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/10/24/weather-journal-when-hurricane-meets-snowstorm/?mod=e2tw|date=October 24, 2012}}</ref> The most popular Halloween-related nickname was "Frankenstorm",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Frankenstorm: Why Hurricane Sandy Will Be Historic|url=http://science.time.com/2012/10/29/frankenstorm-why-hurricane-sandy-will-be-historic/|author=Walsh, Bryan|magazine=Time|date=October 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Biggest Moments of 2012: The Frankenstorm|author=Sharwood, Anthony|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/biggest-moments-of-2012-7-the-frankenstorm/story-e6freuy9-1226536248620|date=December 13, 2012}}</ref> coined by Jim Cisco, a forecaster at the [[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]].<ref>{{cite news|title=What's in a name?

The severe and widespread damage the storm caused in the United States, as well as its unusual merger with a frontal system, resulted in the nicknaming of the hurricane "Superstorm Sandy" by the media, public officials, and several organizations, including U.S. government agencies.<ref name=SandyDebris>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Superstorm-Sandy-debris-may-hurt-tourism-4286772.php|title=Superstorm Sandy debris may hurt tourism|work=www.sfgate.com/|access-date=March 3, 2013|date=February 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=SandyUnusual>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/29/opinion/nolan-hurricane-sandy|title=Why is Sandy unusual?|work=www.cnn.com|access-date=March 3, 2013|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref><ref name=BlameGame>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20181266|title=Superstorm Sandy triggers climate blame game|work=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=March 3, 2013|date=November 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Supersturms>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/meteorologische-bilanz-wie-hurrikan-sandy-zum-rekord-sturm-wurde-a-864551.html|title=Hurrikan "Sandy": Die tödliche Kraft des Supersturms|work=www.spiegel.de|language=de|access-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref> This persisted as the most common nickname well into 2013.
