On December 30, 2012, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released a report, "Flashing Red: A Special Report on the Terrorist Attack at Benghazi", wherein it was determined:

<blockquote>In the months [between February 2011 and September 11, 2012] leading up to the attack on the Temporary Mission Facility in Benghazi, there was a large amount of evidence gathered by the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and from open sources that Benghazi was increasingly dangerous and unstable, and that a significant attack against American personnel there was becoming much more likely. While this intelligence was effectively shared within the Intelligence Community (IC) and with key officials at the Department of State, it did not lead to a commensurate increase in security at Benghazi nor to a decision to close the American mission there, either of which would have been more than justified by the intelligence presented. ...

However, through September 14, CIA analysts made a contradictory assessment, stating "We believe based on currently available information that the attacks in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. Consulate and subsequently its annex. The crowd almost certainly was a mix of individuals from across many sectors of Libyan society. That being said, we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/benghazi-memo-drafts/315398/|title=The Benghazi Memo Drafts, as They Evolved|first=Philip|last=Bump|access-date=April 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401212705/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/benghazi-memo-drafts/315398/|archive-date=April 1, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|date=May 10, 2013}}</ref>

By 4:30&nbsp;p.m. ET, Pentagon officials had informed Defense Secretary [[Leon Panetta]] about the attack. The Pentagon ordered an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] that was in the air conducting surveillance on militant camps to fly over Benghazi. The drone arrived at 11:10&nbsp;p.m. local time (5:10&nbsp;p.m. ET) and began providing a video feed to Washington. At 5:41&nbsp;p.m. ET, Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] telephoned CIA Director [[David Petraeus]] to coordinate. The CIA, which made up most of the U.S. government's presence in Benghazi, had a ten-member security team at its annex and the State Department believed that this team would assist the consulate in the event of an attack.<ref>{{cite news|last=Entous|first=Adam|title=CIA Takes Heat for Role in Libya|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204712904578092853621061838|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 1, 2012|author2=Gorman, Siobhan|author3=Coker, Margaret|access-date=May 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307070500/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204712904578092853621061838|archive-date=March 7, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

I want people around the world to hear me: To all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remarks by the President in Golden, CO|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/13/remarks-president-golden-co|publisher=The White House|date=Sep 13, 2012|access-date=October 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216143649/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/13/remarks-president-golden-co|archive-date=February 16, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

In his press briefing on September 14, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that "we don't have and did not have concrete evidence to suggest that this [the Benghazi attack] was not in reaction to the film."<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jay Carney, 9/14/2012|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/14/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-9142012|publisher=The White House|date=September 14, 2012|access-date=October 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202165518/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/14/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-9142012|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He went on to say:

<blockquote>There was no intelligence that in any way could have been acted on to prevent these attacks. It is—I mean, I think the DNI spokesman was very declarative about this that the report is false. The report suggested that there was intelligence that was available prior to this that led us to believe that this facility would be attacked, and that is false&nbsp;... We have no information to suggest that it was a preplanned attack. The unrest we've seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims, many Muslims find offensive. And while the violence is reprehensible and unjustified, it is not a reaction to the 9/11 anniversary that we know of, or to U.S. policy.</blockquote>

On September 16, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. [[Susan Rice]] appeared on [[Full Ginsburg|five major interview shows]] to discuss the attacks. Prior to her appearance, Rice was provided with "talking points" from a CIA memo,<ref name="nyt22">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/us/politics/explanation-for-benghazi-attack-under-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=Explanation for Benghazi Attack Under Scrutiny |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Eric |last=Schmitt |date=October 21, 2012 |url-access=subscription |access-date=October 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026013341/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/us/politics/explanation-for-benghazi-attack-under-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |archive-date=October 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> which stated:

<blockquote>The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.

This assessment may change as additional information is collected and analyzed and as currently available information continues to be evaluated.

The investigation is ongoing, and the U.S. government is working with Libyan authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/world/text-describing-an-attack.htmlText: The Benghazi Talking Points] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 28 November 2012</ref>
</blockquote>

Using these talking points as a guide, Rice stated:

<blockquote>Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy—sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that— in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent. We do not—we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned. I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al Qaeda affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al Qaeda itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine.<ref name="Face the Nation">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57513819/face-the-nation-transcripts-september-16-2012-libyan-pres-magariaf-amb-rice-and-sen-mccain/|title="Face the Nation" transcripts, September 16, 2012: Libyan Pres.

Since Rice's five television appearances, there have been persistent accusations that she had intentionally and repeatedly lied. However, none of the ten Benghazi investigations determined she had.

In a White House press briefing on September 18, press secretary Jay Carney explained the attack to reporters: "I'm saying that based on information that we—our initial information, and that includes all information—we saw no evidence to back up claims by others that this was a preplanned or premeditated attack; that we saw evidence that it was sparked by the reaction to this video.

On September 20, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney answered a question about an open hearing with the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] Director, [[Matthew G. Olsen]], which referenced which extremist groups might have been involved. Carney said, "It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.

In the Presidential debate of October 16, 2012, between President Obama and [[Mitt Romney]], Romney claimed that "it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror." President Obama responded, "The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened," Obama said.

On January 23, 2013, during testimony at a Senate hearing on Benghazi, Clinton engaged in a heated exchange with Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]]. When Johnson pressed her to explain why, in the immediate aftermath, no one from the State Department had asked American evacuees if there had been a protest before the attack, Clinton replied:

<blockquote>With all due respect, the fact is, we had four dead Americans! Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they'd go kill some Americans?! What difference, at this point, does it make?! It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The [Intelligence Community] has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out.

===U.S. media response===

Multiple conservative media outlets, most notably Fox News, promulgated an elaborate narrative of a scandal and cover-up by officials of the Obama administration, including, among other things, accusations that officials issued a "stand-down order" to preclude a military rescue operation; that officials knowingly lied by repeatedly asserting the attack was spontaneously triggered by the [[Innocence of Muslims]] video rather than a pre-planned terrorist attack; that a secret CIA gun-running operation to Syrian rebels was being conducted out of Libya; that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were absent and negligent on the night of the attack; that Hillary Clinton had personally declined multiple requests for more security at the compound; that a live video feed of the attack was viewed at the White House or State Department; that Ambassador Stevens had been captured by terrorists and dragged through the streets; and that witnesses had been prevented from testifying. These accusations were widely shared across various blogs and social media platforms. Ultimately, none of the accusations of scandal and cover-up were confirmed by any of the [[Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|ten Benghazi investigations]], including six investigations conducted by Republican-controlled congressional committees.

The [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]] at George Mason University described the conclusions of an unpublished study on November 2, 2012. Based on a textual analysis that tallied the occurrence of certain words and phrases in news reports during the days immediately following the attack, the study concluded that leading newspapers in the U.S. framed the attack in terms of a spontaneous protest over the anti-Islamic film ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' as framed by the Obama administration's version, four times as often as a planned terrorist attack, which was the Republican version.<ref>{{cite news |title=Study: Media accepted Obama version of Benghazi attack |author=Dinan, Stephen |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/nov/2/study-media-accepted-obama-version-benghazi-attack/ |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=November 2, 2012 |access-date=June 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319153038/http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/nov/2/study-media-accepted-obama-version-benghazi-attack/ |archive-date=March 19, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> However, the 2014 final report by the Republican-controlled [[House Intelligence Committee]] found that during the days immediately following the attack there was confusion among intelligence analysts as to the origin of the attack, leading to an initial assessment that it was the spontaneous outcome from a protest. Obama administration officials, most notably [[Susan Rice]], were provided this early assessment and repeated it to media outlets, only to be later contradicted as further intelligence assessments were made.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/benghazi-memo-drafts/315398/|title=The Benghazi Memo Drafts, as They Evolved|first=Philip|last=Bump|access-date=April 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401212705/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/benghazi-memo-drafts/315398/|archive-date=April 1, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|date=May 10, 2013}}</ref> None of the ten investigations into Benghazi found that any senior Obama administration officials had acted improperly.

On September 13, [[Rachel Maddow]], during her show on [[MSNBC]], stated:

<blockquote>An organized attack. Anybody who tells you that what happened to our ambassador and our consulate in Libya was as a result of a protest over an offensive movie, you should ask them why they think that.

In June 2014, Maddow criticized the right-wing media for reporting an arrest as bad news, said that Americas are poorly served by the media, and that "the take on Fox News is that's not actually news" and now "they have to make it bad news, they have to make into maybe a scandal itself."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/media-fails-americans-on-iraq-benghazi-283294275959|title=Americans poorly served by media on Iraq, Benghazi|access-date=June 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622025028/http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/media-fails-americans-on-iraq-benghazi-283294275959|archive-date=June 22, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Maddow: U.S. Got the Suspect and 'Benghazi Central' Fox News Doesn't Care?|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/maddow-u-s-got-the-suspect-and-%E2%80%98benghazi-central%E2%80%99-fox-news-doesn%E2%80%99t-care|access-date=June 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622010913/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/maddow-u-s-got-the-suspect-and-%E2%80%98benghazi-central%E2%80%99-fox-news-doesn%E2%80%99t-care/|archive-date=June 22, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

{{Main|Investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack |Timeline of the investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack|United States House Select Committee on Benghazi}}

There were ten investigations into the Benghazi matter: one by the FBI; one by an independent board commissioned by the State Department; two by Democrat-controlled Senate Committees; and six by Republican-controlled House Committees. After the first five Republican investigations found no evidence of wrongdoing by senior Obama administration officials, Republicans in 2014 opened a sixth investigation, the [[United States House Select Committee on Benghazi|House Select Committee on Benghazi]], chaired by [[Trey Gowdy]]. This investigation also failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing by senior Obama administration officials. A possible political motive for the investigation was revealed on September 29, 2015, when Republican House majority leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], then vying to become Speaker of the House, told [[Sean Hannity]] on Fox News that the investigation was part of a "strategy to fight and win,' adding "Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?

{{quote|A two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and asserted no wrongdoing by Obama administration appointees.

Debunking a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies, the investigation of the politically charged incident determined that there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria.

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.

...

In the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to "stand down" after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.

The report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.}}

==FOIA requests==
[[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests have been made since the attack. The conservative foundation [[Judicial Watch]] filed a FOIA request to the Department of State on December 19, 2012. An acknowledgement of the request was received by Judicial Watch on January 4, 2013. When the State Department failed to respond to the request by February 4, 2013, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit, which resulted in seven photographs being delivered on June 6, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-obtains-first-photos-from-state-department-depicting-aftermath-of-benghazi-attack/|title=Judicial Watch Obtains First Photos from State Department Depicting Aftermath of Benghazi Attack|publisher=Judicial Watch|date=June 21, 2013|access-date=August 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625020018/http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-obtains-first-photos-from-state-department-depicting-aftermath-of-benghazi-attack/|archive-date=June 25, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Three of the photographs show Arabic-language spray paint graffiti.
