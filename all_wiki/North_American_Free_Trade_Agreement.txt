The '''North American Free Trade Agreement''' ('''NAFTA'''; {{lang-es|Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte}}, '''TLCAN'''; {{lang-fr|Accord de libre-échange nord-américain}}, '''ALÉNA''') was an agreement signed by [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]] that created a trilateral [[trade bloc]] in [[North America]]. The agreement came into force on January 1, 1994, and superseded the 1988 [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] between the United States and Canada.<ref>[http://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/en/view.aspx?conID=775 NAFTA Secretariat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412160000/http://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/en/view.aspx?conID=775 |date=April 12, 2013 }}. Nafta-sec-alena.org (June 9, 2010). Retrieved on July 12, 2013.</ref> The NAFTA trade bloc formed one of the largest trade blocs in the world by [[gross domestic product]].

The impetus for a North American free trade zone began with U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]], who made the idea part of his 1980 presidential campaign. After the signing of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988, the administrations of U.S. president [[George H. W. Bush]], Mexican president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], and Canadian prime minister [[Brian Mulroney]] agreed to negotiate what became NAFTA. Each submitted the agreement for ratification in their respective capitals in December 1992, but NAFTA faced significant opposition in both the United States and Canada. All three countries ratified NAFTA in 1993 after the addition of two side agreements, the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC).

Passage of NAFTA resulted in the elimination or reduction of [[trade barrier|barriers to trade]] and investment between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The effects of the agreement regarding issues such as employment, the environment, and economic growth have been the subject of political disputes. Most economic analyses indicated that NAFTA was beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/naftas-economic-impact|title=NAFTA's Economic Impact|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":9" /><ref name=":0" /> but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-nafta-politics-20170130-story.html|title=NAFTA doesn't count for much economically, but it's still a huge political football.

After U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] took office in January 2017, he sought to replace NAFTA with a new agreement, beginning negotiations with Canada and Mexico. In September 2018, the United States, Mexico, and Canada reached an agreement to replace NAFTA with the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]] (USMCA), and all three countries had ratified it by March 2020. NAFTA remained in force until USMCA was implemented.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement|title=United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement|publisher=USTR|access-date=October 1, 2018}}</ref> In April 2020, Canada and Mexico notified the U.S. that they were ready to implement the agreement.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/saturday-nafta-notification-1.5522007 CBC News, "Mexico joins Canada, notifies U.S. it's ready to implement new NAFTA" 2020/04/04] accessed 06 April 2020</ref> The USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020, replacing NAFTA.

== Negotiation, signing, ratification, and revision (1988–94)==
===Negotiation===
The impetus for a North American free trade zone began with U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]], who made the idea part of his campaign when he announced his candidacy for the presidency in November 1979.<ref name="NAFTAcdnEncyc">{{cite web|title=North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta/|website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica Canada]]|access-date=19 November 2017}}</ref> Canada and the United States signed the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA) in 1988, and shortly afterward Mexican President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] decided to approach U.S. president [[George H. W. Bush]] to propose a similar agreement in an effort to bring in foreign investment following the [[Latin American debt crisis]].<ref name="NAFTAcdnEncyc"/> As the two leaders began negotiating, the Canadian government under Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] feared that the advantages Canada had gained through the Canada–US FTA would be undermined by a US–Mexican bilateral agreement, and asked to become a party to the US–Mexican talks.<ref name="canworld">Foreign Affairs and International trade Canada: Canada and the World: A History – [http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history/canada10-en.asp 1984–1993: "Leap of Faith] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027140254/http://www.international.gc.ca/department/history/canada10-en.asp |date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Following diplomatic negotiations dating back to 1990, the leaders of the three nations signed the agreement in their respective capitals on December 17, 1992.<ref>{{cite book|title=NAFTA: Final Text, Summary, Legislative History & Implementation Directory|date=1994|publisher=Oceana Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0-379-00835-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/naftafinaltextsu00holb/page/n308 1]–3|url=https://archive.org/details/naftafinaltextsu00holb|url-access=registration}}</ref> The signed agreement then  needed to be [[Ratification|ratified]] by each nation's legislative or parliamentary branch.

===Ratification===
====Canada====
The earlier [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] had been  controversial and divisive in Canada, and featured as an issue in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 Canadian election]]. In that election, more Canadians voted for anti-free trade parties (the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democrats]]), but the split of the votes between the two parties meant that the pro-free trade [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] (PCs) came out of the election with the most seats and so took power. Mulroney and the PCs had a [[majority government|parliamentary majority]] and easily passed the 1987 Canada–US FTA and NAFTA bills. However, Mulroney was replaced as Conservative leader and prime minister by [[Kim Campbell]]. Campbell led the PC party into the [[1993 Canadian election|1993 election]] where they were decimated by the Liberal Party under [[Jean Chrétien]], who campaigned on a promise to renegotiate or abrogate NAFTA. Chrétien subsequently negotiated two supplemental agreements with Bush, who had subverted the LAC<ref>Labor Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations and Trade Policy; established under the [[Trade Act of 1974]].</ref> advisory process<ref>''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822015070683 Preliminary Report of the Labor Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations and Trade Policy on the North American Free Trade Agreement]'', dated Sept. 16, 1992 (Washington, D.C.: Executive Office of the President, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 1992), i, 1.</ref> and worked to "fast track" the signing prior to the end of his term, ran out of time and had to pass the required ratification and signing of the implementation law to incoming president [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>For an overview of the process, see [[Noam Chomsky]], [https://zcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/zbooks/www/chomsky/articles/z9302-mandate.html {{"'}}Mandate for Change', or Business as Usual"], ''Z Magazine'' 6, no. 2 (February 1993), 41.</ref>

====United States====
Before sending it to the [[United States Senate]] Clinton added two side agreements, the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) and the [[North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation]] (NAAEC), to protect workers and the environment, and to also allay the concerns of many House members. The U.S. required its partners to adhere to environmental practices and regulations similar to its own.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} After much consideration and emotional discussion, the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on November 17, 1993, 234–200. The agreement's supporters included 132 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 102 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. The bill passed the Senate on November 20, 1993, 61–38.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/3450?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22nafta%22%5D%7D |title=H.R.3450 – North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act |access-date=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Senate supporters were 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats. Republican Representative [[David Dreier]] of [[California]], a strong proponent of NAFTA since the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]], played a leading role in mobilizing support for the agreement among Republicans in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-10-28|title=Trump says many trade agreements are bad for Americans.

====Mexico====
NAFTA (TLCAN in Spanish) was approved by the [[Mexican Senate]] on November 22, 1993, and was published in the [[Official Journal of the Federation (Mexico)|Official Gazette of the Federation]] on December 8, 1993.<ref name=TLCAN-prom>{{cite act |type=Decree |index= |date=December 20, 1993 |article= |article-type= |legislature=[[Senate of the Republic (Mexico)]] |title=Decreto de promulgación del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte |trans-title=Decree of promulgation of the North American Free Trade Agreement |page= |url=http://www.economia-snci.gob.mx/sicait/5.0/doctos/TLCAN.pdf |language=Spanish}}</ref>

The goal of NAFTA was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, brought the immediate elimination of [[tariff]]s on more than one-half of Mexico's [[export]]s to the U.S. and more than one-third of U.S. exports to Mexico. Within 10 years of the implementation of the agreement, all U.S.–Mexico tariffs were to be eliminated except for some U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico, to be phased out within 15 years.<ref>Floudas, Demetrius Andreas & Rojas, Luis Fernando; [http://www.diplomacy.bg.ac.rs/mpro_sa00_4.htm "Some Thoughts on NAFTA and Trade Integration in the American Continent"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135150/http://www.diplomacy.bg.ac.rs/mpro_sa00_4.htm |date=2017-10-21 }}, 52 (2000) International Problems 371</ref> Most U.S.–Canada trade was already duty-free. NAFTA also sought to eliminate non-[[tariff]] trade barriers and to protect the [[intellectual property rights]] on traded [[product (business)|products]].

Chapter 20 provided a procedure for the international resolution of disputes over the application and interpretation of NAFTA. It was modeled after Chapter 69 of the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gantz | first = DA | year = 1999 | title = Dispute Settlement Under the NAFTA and the WTO:Choice of Forum Opportunities and Risks for the NAFTA Parties | journal = American University International Law Review | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 1025–106 }}</ref>

NAFTA is, in part, implemented by Technical Working Groups composed of government officials from each of the three partner nations.<ref name=pmra>{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/branches-agencies/pest-management-regulatory-agency.html |work=Health Canada |title=Pest Management Regulatory Agency |series=Branches and Agencies |date=nd |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>

=== Intellectual property ===
The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act made some changes to the [[copyright law of the United States]], foreshadowing the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] of 1994 by restoring [[copyright]] (within the NAFTA nations) on certain motion pictures which had entered the [[public domain]].<ref>GPO, [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr3450enr/pdf/BILLS-103hr3450enr.pdf P.L. 103-182], Section 334</ref><ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/history/mls/ML-497.pdf ML-497] (March 1995), Docket No. RM 93-13C, Library of Congress Copyright Office</ref>

=== Environment ===
The Clinton administration negotiated a side agreement on the environment with Canada and Mexico, the [[North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation]] (NAAEC), which led to the creation of the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (CEC) in 1994. To alleviate concerns that NAFTA, the first regional trade agreement between a [[developing country]] and two developed countries, would have negative [[environmental impact]]s, the commission was mandated to conduct ongoing ''[[ex post]]'' [[environmental assessment]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=IngentaConnect NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation: ongoing assessment |doi=10.3152/147154606781765048 |date=December 1, 2006 |volume=24 |issue=4 |journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal |pages=259–272|last1 = Carpentier|first1 = Chantal Line|doi-access=free }}</ref> It created one of the first ''ex post'' frameworks for environmental assessment of [[trade liberalization]], designed to produce a body of evidence with respect to the initial [[hypotheses]] about NAFTA and the environment, such as the concern that NAFTA would create a "[[race to the bottom]]" in [[environmental regulation]] among the three countries, or that NAFTA would pressure governments to increase their [[environmental protection]]s.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080910022008/http://www.cec.org/programs_projects/trade_environ_econ/pdfs/frmwrk-e.pdf Analytic Framework for Assessing the Environmental Effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement].

===Labor===
Proponents of NAFTA in the United States emphasized that the pact was a free-trade, not an economic-community, agreement.<ref name="McDowell">{{cite journal |last1=McDowell |first1=Manfred |title=NAFTA and the EC Social Dimension |journal=Labour Studies Journal |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=1 |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/labstuj20&div=5&id=&page= |access-date=11 September 2020}}</ref> The freedom of movement it establishes for goods, services and capital did not extend to labor. In proposing what no other comparable agreement had attempted—to open industrialized countries to "a major Third World country"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schliefer |first1=Jonathan |title=What price economic growth? |journal=The Atlantic Monthly |date=December 1992 |page=114}}</ref>--NAFTA eschewed the creation of common social and employment policies. The regulation of the labor market and or the workplace remained the exclusive preserve of the national governments.<ref name="McDowell" />

A "side agreement" on enforcement of existing domestic labor law, concluded in August 1993, the North American Agreement on Labour Cooperation (NAALC)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bureau of International Labor Affairs |first1=U.S. National Administrative Office |title=North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation: A Guide |url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/trade/agreements/naalcgd |website=dol.gov/agencies/ilab |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |access-date=12 September 2020}}</ref>, was highly circumscribed. Focused on health and safety standards and on child labor law, it excluded issues of collective bargaining, and its "so-called [enforcement] teeth" were accessible only at the end of "a long and tortuous" disputes process".<ref>{{cite news |title=Accords fail to redraw battle lines over pact |work=New York Times |date=14 August 1993}}</ref> Commitments to enforce existing labor law also raised issues of democratic practice.<ref name="McDowell" /> The Canadian anti-NAFTA coalition, Pro-Canada Network, suggested that guarantees of minimum standards would be "meaningless" without "broad democratic reforms in the [Mexican] courts, the unions, and the government".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Witt |first1=Matt |title=Don't trade on me: Mexican, U.S. and Canadian workers confront free trade |journal=Dollars and Sense |date=April 1990}}</ref> Later assessment, however, did suggest that NAALC's principles and complaint mechanisms did "create new space for advocates to build coalitions and take concrete action to articulate challenges to the status quo and advance workers’ interests".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Compa |first1=Lance |title=NAFTA's Labour Side Agr s Labour Side Agreement and International Labour Agreement and International Labour Solidarity |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/5125509.pdf |website=core.ac.uk/ |publisher=Cornell University ILR School |access-date=12 September 2020}}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
From the earliest negotiation, [[agriculture]] was a controversial topic within NAFTA, as it has been with almost all [[free trade agreement]]s signed within the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] framework. Agriculture was the only section that was not negotiated trilaterally; instead, three separate agreements were signed between each pair of parties. The Canada–U.S. agreement contained significant restrictions and [[tariff]] quotas on agricultural products (mainly sugar, dairy, and poultry products), whereas the Mexico–U.S. pact allowed for a wider [[liberalization]] within a framework of phase-out periods (it was the first [[North–South divide in the World|North–South]] FTA on agriculture to be signed).{{clarify|date=November 2017}}

=== Transportation infrastructure ===
NAFTA established the [[CANAMEX Corridor]] for road transport between Canada and Mexico, also proposed for use by rail, pipeline, and [[optical fiber|fiber optic]] telecommunications infrastructure. This became a High Priority Corridor under the U.S. [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] of 1991.

=== Chapter 11 – investor-state dispute settlement procedures===
Another contentious issue was the [[investor-state dispute settlement]] obligations contained in Chapter 11 of NAFTA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/NAFTA/chap-111.asp |title=NAFTA, Chapter 11 |publisher=Sice.oas.org |access-date=July 4, 2011}}</ref> Chapter 11 allowed [[corporation]]s or individuals to sue Mexico, Canada or the United States for compensation when actions taken by those governments (or by those for whom they are responsible at [[international law]], such as provincial, state, or municipal governments) violated international law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/disp-diff/nafta.aspx?lang=eng|title=The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) – Chapter 11 – Investment|first=Global Affairs Canada|last=Government of Canada|date=July 31, 2002|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref>

[[Methanex Corporation]], a Canadian corporation, filed a [[United States dollar|US$]]970 million suit against the United States. Methanex claimed that a [[California]] ban on [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl ''tert''-butyl ether]] (MTBE), a substance that had found its way into many wells in the state, was hurtful to the corporation's sales of [[methanol]]. The claim was rejected, and the company was ordered to pay US$3 million to the U.S. government in costs, based on the following reasoning: "But as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory [[regulation]] for a [[public purpose]], which is enacted in accordance with [[due process]] and, which affects, [[inter alios]], a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and [[compensable]] unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://naftaclaims.com/Disputes/USA/Methanex/Methanex_Final_Award.pdf |title= Arbitration award between Methanex Corporation and United States of America |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070616093731/http://naftaclaims.com/Disputes/USA/Methanex/Methanex_Final_Award.pdf |archive-date= June 16, 2007 |df= mdy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(1.45&nbsp;MB)}}</ref>

Barutciski acknowledged "that NAFTA and other investor-protection treaties create an anomaly in that Canadian companies that have also seen their permits rescinded by the very same Quebec legislation, which expressly forbids the paying of compensation, do not have the right (to) pursue a NAFTA claim", and that winning "compensation in Canadian courts for domestic companies in this case would be more difficult since the Constitution puts [[property rights]] in provincial hands".<ref name=gm22nov />

=== Chapter 19 – countervailing duty ===
NAFTA's Chapter 19 was a trade dispute mechanism which subjects [[antidumping]] and [[countervailing duty]] (AD/CVD) determinations to binational panel review instead of, or in addition to, conventional judicial review.<ref name="Federal Register Millan">{{cite web|last1=Millán|first1=Juan|title=North American Free Trade Agreement; Invitation for Applications for Inclusion on the Chapter 19 Roster|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-10-23/pdf/2015-26936.pdf|website=Federal Register|publisher=Office of the United States Trade Representative|access-date=19 March 2016|language=en}}</ref> For example, in the United States, review of agency decisions imposing antidumping and countervailing duties are normally heard before the [[United States Court of International Trade|U.S. Court of International Trade]], an [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article III court]]. NAFTA parties, however, had the option of appealing the decisions to binational panels composed of five citizens from the two relevant NAFTA countries.<ref name="Federal Register Millan" /> The panelists were generally lawyers experienced in international trade law. Since NAFTA did not include substantive provisions concerning AD/CVD, the panel was charged with determining whether final agency determinations involving AD/CVD conformed with the country's domestic law. Chapter 19 was an anomaly in international dispute settlement since it did not apply international law, but required a panel composed of individuals from many countries to re-examine the application of one country's domestic law.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A Chapter 19 panel was expected to examine whether the agency's determination was supported by "substantial evidence". This standard assumed significant deference to the domestic agency. Some of the most controversial trade disputes in recent years, such as the [[Canada–United States softwood lumber dispute|U.S.–Canada softwood lumber dispute]], have been litigated before Chapter 19 panels.

Decisions by Chapter 19 panels could be challenged before a NAFTA extraordinary challenge committee. However, an extraordinary challenge committee did not function as an ordinary appeal.<ref name="Federal Register Millan" /> Under NAFTA, it only vacated or remanded a decision if the decision involveed a significant and material error that threatens the integrity of the NAFTA dispute settlement system. Since January 2006, no NAFTA party had successfully challenged a Chapter 19 panel's decision before an extraordinary challenge committee.

Adams]], [[Susan Christine O'Meara Getzendanner|Susan Getzendanner]], [[George C. Pratt]], [[Charles Byron Renfrew|Charles B. Renfrew]] and [[Sandra Day O'Connor]].

According to a 2017 report by the New York City based public policy think tank report, [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR), bilateral trade in agricultural products tripled in size from 1994 to 2017 and is considered to be one of the largest economic effects of NAFTA on U.S.-Canada trade with Canada becoming the U.S. agricultural sectors' leading importer.<ref name="CFR_Sergie_2018">{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=James|last2=Sergie|first2=Mohammed Aly|title=NAFTA's Economic Impact|url=http://www.cfr.org/trade/naftas-economic-impact/p15790|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR) think tank|access-date=September 3, 2018|orig-year=February 14, 2014|date=2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516093105/http://www.cfr.org/trade/naftas-economic-impact/p15790|archive-date=May 16, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Canadian fears of losing manufacturing jobs to the United States did not materialize with manufacturing employment holding "steady".

According to a 2018 [[Sierra Club]] report, Canada's commitments under NAFTA and the [[Paris agreement]] conflicted. The Paris commitments were voluntary, and NAFTA's were compulsory.<ref>{{cite web|title=NAFTA and Climate Report 2018|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/uploads-wysiwig/NAFTA%20and%20Climate%20Report%202018.pdf|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]}}</ref>

According to a 2018 report by Gordon Laxter published by the [[Council of Canadians]], NAFTA's Article 605, energy proportionality rule ensures that Americans had "virtually unlimited first access to most of Canada's oil and natural gas" and Canada could not reduce oil, natural gas and electricity exports (74% its oil and 52% its natural gas) to the U.S., even if Canada was experiencing shortages.

=== Mexico ===
{{Main|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}
[[Maquiladora]]s (Mexican assembly plants that take in imported components and produce [[good]]s for export) became the landmark of trade in Mexico. They moved to Mexico from the United States{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, hence the debate over the loss of American jobs. Income in the maquiladora sector had increased 15.5% since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994.<ref name="Hufbauer">{{Cite journal|last2=Schott|first2=JJ|year=2005|title=NAFTA Revisited|url=https://archive.org/details/naftarevisitedac00hufb|url-access=registration|publisher=Institute for International Economics|last1=Hufbauer|first1=GC|place=Washington, DC}}</ref> Other sectors also benefited from the free trade agreement, and the share of [[export]]s to the U.S. from non-border states increased in the last five years{{when|date=November 2017}} while the share of exports from border states decreased. This allowed for rapid growth in non-border [[metropolitan area]]s such as [[Toluca]], [[León, Guanajuato|León]], and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], which were all larger in population than [[Tijuana]], [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Reynosa]].

The overall effect of the Mexico–U.S. agricultural agreement is disputed. Mexico did not invest in the [[infrastructure]] necessary for competition, such as efficient railroads and highways. This resulted in more difficult living conditions for the country's poor. Mexico's agricultural exports increased 9.4 percent annually between 1994 and 2001, while imports increased by only 6.9 percent a year during the same period.<ref>''Greening the Americas'', Carolyn L. Deere (editor). MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</ref>

One of the most affected agricultural sectors was the [[meat industry]]. Mexico went from a small player in the pre-1994 U.S. export market to the second largest importer of U.S. agricultural products in 2004, and NAFTA may have been a major catalyst for this change. Free trade removed the hurdles that impeded business between the two countries, so Mexico provided a growing market for meat for the U.S., and increased sales and [[profit (economics)|profits]] for the U.S. meat industry. A coinciding noticeable increase in the Mexican [[per capita GDP]] greatly changed meat consumption patterns as per capita meat consumption grew.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-11062006-155845/unrestricted/Clark_Georgia_Thesis.pdf |title=Clark, Georgia Rae. 2006.

In 2015, the [[Congressional Research Service]] concluded that the "net overall effect of NAFTA on the US economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of US [[GDP]]. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies." The report also estimated that NAFTA added $80 billion to the US economy since its implementation, equivalent to a 0.5% increase in US GDP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42965.pdf|title=The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)}}</ref>

The [[US Chamber of Commerce]] credited NAFTA with increasing U.S. trade in goods and services with Canada and Mexico from $337 billion in 1993 to $1.2 trillion in 2011, while the [[AFL–CIO]] blamed the agreement for sending 700,000 American manufacturing jobs to Mexico over that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b7230156-4c51-11e3-923d-00144feabdc0.html|title=Contentious Nafta pact continues to generate a sparky debate|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref>

==== Trade balances ====
The US had a [[trade surplus]] with NAFTA countries of $28.3 billion for services in 2009 and a [[trade deficit]] of $94.6 billion (36.4% annual increase) for goods in 2010.

A study published in the August 2008 issue of the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', found NAFTA increased US agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada, even though most of the increase occurred a decade after its ratification. The study focused on the effects that gradual "phase-in" periods in regional trade agreements, including NAFTA, have on trade flows. Most of the increases in members' agricultural trade, which was only recently brought under the purview of the [[World Trade Organization]], was due to very high trade barriers before NAFTA or other regional trade agreements.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541349/ "Free Trade Agreement Helped U.S. Farmers".] ''Newswise''.

=== Economy and jobs ===
{{Main|NAFTA's effect on United States employment}}

In their May 24, 2017 report, the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) wrote that the economic impacts of NAFTA on the U.S. economy were modest. In a 2015 report, the [[Congressional Research Service]] summarized multiple studies as follows: "In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.

{{See also|Commission for Environmental Cooperation}}
According to a study in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'', NAFTA reduced pollution emitted by the US manufacturing sector: "On average, nearly two-thirds of the reductions in [[Particulates#Size, shape and solubility matter|coarse particulate matter]] (PM<sub>10)</sub> and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2)</sub> emissions from the U.S. manufacturing sector between 1994 and 1998 can be attributed to trade liberalization following NAFTA."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cherniwchan|first=Jevan|title=Trade Liberalization and the Environment: Evidence from NAFTA and U.S. Manufacturing|journal=Journal of International Economics|doi=10.1016/j.jinteco.2017.01.005|volume=105|pages=130–49|year=2017|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Mobility of persons ===
According to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, during fiscal year 2006 (October 2005 – September 2006), 73,880 foreign professionals (64,633 Canadians and 9,247 Mexicans) were admitted into the United States for temporary employment under NAFTA (i.e., in the [[TN status]]). Additionally, 17,321 of their family members (13,136 Canadians, 2,904 Mexicans, as well as a number of third-country nationals married to Canadians and Mexicans) entered the U.S. in the treaty national's dependent (TD) status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/YrBk06NI.shtm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228145954/https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/YrBk06NI.shtm|url-status=dead|title=DHS Yearbook 2006.

(A discrepancy may be caused by some TN entrants leaving the country or changing status before their three-year admission period has expired, while other immigrants admitted earlier may change their status ''to'' TN or TD, or extend TN status granted earlier).

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], deaths of migrants have been on the rise worldwide with 5,604 deaths in 2016.<ref name=":12">Jones, Reese.

== Disputes and controversies ==
=== 1992 U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot ===
In the second 1992 presidential debate, Ross Perot argued:

{{quote|We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor,&nbsp;... have no health care—that's the most expensive single element in making a car—have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a [[giant sucking sound]] going south.

 ... when [Mexico's] jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/16/us/the-1992-campaign-transcript-of-2d-tv-debate-between-bush-clinton-and-perot.html|title = THE 1992 CAMPAIGN; Transcript of 2d TV Debate Between Bush, Clinton and Perot|date = 16 October 1992|website = The New York Times|publisher = New York Times Company|access-date = 16 May 2016}}</ref>}}

Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, [[Bill Clinton]], supported NAFTA, which went into effect on January 1, 1994.

Several studies rejected NAFTA responsibility for depressing the incomes of poor corn farmers. The trend existed more than a decade before NAFTA existed.

Preparations for NAFTA included cancellation of Article 27 of Mexico's constitution, the cornerstone of [[Emiliano Zapata]]'s revolution in 1910–1919. Under the historic Article 27, indigenous communal landholdings were protected from sale or [[privatization]]. However, this barrier to [[investment]] was incompatible with NAFTA. Indigenous farmers feared the loss of their remaining land and cheap imports (substitutes) from the US. The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] labelled NAFTA a "death sentence" to indigenous communities all over Mexico and later declared war on the Mexican state on January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA came into force.<ref>Subcomandante Marcos, Ziga Voa! 10 Years of the Zapatista Uprising.

=== Criticism from 2016 U.S. presidential candidates ===
In a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview in September 2015, [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential candidate]] [[Donald Trump]] called NAFTA "the single worst trade deal ever approved in [the United States]",<ref>{{cite web|title=Full transcript: First 2016 presidential debate|author=Politico Staff|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/full-transcript-first-2016-presidential-debate-228761?lo=ut_b1|publisher=Politico|access-date=27 September 2016}}</ref> and said that if elected, he would "either renegotiate it, or we will break it".<ref>Jill Colvin, [http://bigstory.ap.org/article/982f8146e10942b2b7f6a07e2077576d/trump-nafta-trade-deal-disaster-says-hed-break-it Trump: NAFTA trade deal a 'disaster,' says he'd 'break' it], Associated Press (September 25, 2015).</ref><ref>Mark Thoma, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-donald-trump-right-to-call-nafta-a-disaster/ Is Donald Trump right to call NAFTA a "disaster"?], CBS News (October 5, 2015).</ref> {{ILL|Juan Pablo Castañón|es|Juan Pablo Castañón Castañón}}, president of the trade group Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, expressed concern about renegotiation and the willingness to focus on the car industry.<ref name=":03">{{Cite news|url=http://monitoreodenoticias.com.mx/noticias/menu/noticia.php?id_tit=242|title=El Economista|last=Gonzales|first=Lilia|date=November 14, 2016}}</ref> A range of trade experts said that pulling out of NAFTA would have a range of [[unintended consequences]] for the United States, including reduced access to its  biggest [[export]] markets, a reduction in [[economic growth]], and higher [[price]]s for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables.<ref>Eric Martin, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/trump-killing-nafta-could-mean-big-unintended-consequences-for-the-u-s- Trump Killing NAFTA Could Mean Big Unintended Consequences for the U.S.], Bloomberg Business (October 1, 2015).</ref> Members of the private initiative in Mexico noted that to eliminate NAFTA, many laws must be adapted by the [[U.S. Congress]]. The move would also eventually result in legal complaints by the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref name=":03"/> The ''Washington Post'' noted that a [[Congressional Research Service]] review of academic literature concluded that the "net overall effect of NAFTA on the [[U.S. economy]] appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because [[trade]] with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. [[GDP]]".<ref name=":2" />

Democratic candidate [[Bernie Sanders]], opposing the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade agreement, called it "a continuation of other disastrous [[trade agreement]]s, like NAFTA, [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement|CAFTA]], and [[permanent normal trade relations]] with China". He believes that free trade agreements have caused a loss of American jobs and depressed American wages. Sanders said that America needs to rebuild its [[manufacturing]] base using American factories for well-paying jobs for American labor rather than [[outsourcing]] to China and elsewhere.<ref>

Shortly after his [[2016 United States presidential election|election]], [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Donald Trump]] said he would begin renegotiating the terms of NAFTA, to resolve trade issues he had campaigned on. The leaders of Canada and Mexico have indicated their willingness to work with the Trump administration.<ref>{{cite web

In July 2017, the Trump administration provided a detailed list of changes that it would like to see to NAFTA.<ref name=":13">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/us/politics/nafta-trump-mexico-canada.html|title=U.S. Calls for 'Much Better Deal' in Nafta Overhaul Plan|last=Rappeport|first=Alan|date=2017-07-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The top priority was a reduction in the United States' trade deficit.<ref name=":13" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-nafta-statement-idUSKBN1A2272|title=U.S. makes lower trade deficit top priority in NAFTA talks|date=July 18, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> The administration also called for the elimination of provisions that allowed Canada and Mexico to appeal duties imposed by the United States and limited the ability of the United States to impose import restrictions on Canada and Mexico.<ref name=":13" /> The list also alleged subsidized state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":14">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40639819|title=US calls for smaller deficits in new NAFTA talks|date=2017-07-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-GB}}</ref>

According to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Trump administration's list "is very consistent with the president's stance on liking trade barriers, liking protectionism. This makes NAFTA in many respects less of a free-trade agreement."<ref name=":13" /> The concerns expressed by the US Trade Representative over subsidized state-owned enterprises and [[currency intervention|currency manipulation]] are not thought to apply to Canada and Mexico, but rather to be designed to send a message to countries beyond North America.<ref name=":13" /> Jeffrey Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics noted that it would not be possible to conclude renegotiations quickly while also addressing all the concerns on the list.<ref name=":14" /> He also said that it would be difficult to do anything about trade deficits.<ref name=":14" />

An October 2017 [[op-ed]] in [[Toronto]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' questioned whether the United States wanted to re-negotiate the agreement or planned to walk away from it no matter what, noting that newly appointed American ambassador [[Kelly Knight Craft]] is married to the owner of [[Joe Craft|Alliance Resource Partners]], a big US coal operation. Canada is  implementing a carbon plan, and there is also the matter of a sale of [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] jets. "The Americans inserted so many poison pills into last week's talks in Washington that they should have been charged with murder", wrote the columnist, [[John Ibbitson]].<ref>{{cite news|title=US ambassador to Canada must mend an old friendship|work=The Globe and Mail|page=A5|date=October 23, 2017|author=John Ibbitson}}</ref>

"A number of the proposals that the United States has put on the table have little or no support from the U.S. business and agriculture community. It isn't clear who they're intended to benefit", said John Murphy, vice-president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.<ref name="CP">{{cite news|title=U.S. pro-NAFTA campaign ramps up to defend deal: Concerns in Congress heighten over 'potential catastrophe' from withdrawal|author=Alexander Panetta|date=November 1, 2017|newspaper=Vancouver Sun|agency=Canadian Press}}</ref> [[Pat Roberts]], the senior US senator from [[Kansas]], called for an outcry against Trump anti-NAFTA moves, saying the "issues affect real jobs, real lives and real people". Kansas is a major agricultural exporter, and farm groups warn that just threatening to leave NAFTA might cause buyers to minimize uncertainty by seeking out non-US sources.<ref name="CP" />

A fourth round of talks included a U.S. demand for a sunset clause that would end the agreement in five years, unless the three countries agreed to keep it in place, a provision U.S. Commerce Secretary [[Wilbur Ross]] has said would allow the countries to kill the deal if it was not working. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]], since Congress would have to pass legislation rolling back the treaty's provisions if Trump tries to withdraw from the pact.<ref>{{cite news |title=Canada, Mexico vow to remain at NAFTA negotiating table | author1=Laura Stone |author2=Robert Fife |work=The Globe and Mail |date=October 13, 2017 |page=A1}}</ref>

=== Impact of withdrawing from NAFTA ===
Following Donald Trump's [[2016 United States presidential election|election to the presidency]], a range of trade experts said that pulling out of NAFTA as Trump proposed would have a range of unintended consequences for the U.S., including reduced access to the U.S.'s biggest export markets, a reduction in economic growth, and increased prices for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables.<ref name=":10">Eric Martin, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/trump-killing-nafta-could-mean-big-unintended-consequences-for-the-u-s- Trump Killing Nafta Could Mean Big Unintended Consequences for the U.S.], Bloomberg Business (October 1, 2015).</ref> The worst affected sectors would be textiles, agriculture and automobiles.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/02/daily-chart-2|title=Which American producers would suffer from ending NAFTA?|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/denim-dilemma-1486900803|title=Denim Dilemma|last=Journal|first=Julie Wernau {{!}} Photographs by Mark Mahaney for The Wall Street|date=2017-02-12|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-02-12|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>

According to [[Tufts University]] political scientist [[Daniel W. Drezner]], the Trump administration's desire to return relations with Mexico to the pre-NAFTA era are misguided. Drezner argued that NAFTA made it easier for Mexico to transform to a real democracy and become a country that views itself as North American. If Trump acts on many of the threats that he has made against Mexico, it is not inconceivable that Mexicans would turn to left-wing populist strongmen, as several South American countries have. At the very least, US-Mexico relations would worsen, with adverse implications for cooperation on border security, counterterrorism, [[Mexican Drug War|drug-war operations]], deportations and managing Central American [[Human migration|migration]].<ref name=":7" />

According to Chad P. Bown (senior fellow at the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]]), "a renegotiated NAFTA that would reestablish [[trade barrier]]s is unlikely to help workers who lost their jobs—regardless of the cause—take advantage of new employment opportunities".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/15/what-is-nafta-and-what-would-happen-to-u-s-trade-without-it/|title=What is NAFTA, and what would happen to U.S. trade without it?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref>

According to Harvard economist [[Marc Melitz]], "recent research estimates that the repeal of NAFTA would not increase car production in the United States".<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=http://econofact.org/driving-home-the-importance-of-nafta|title=Driving Home the Importance of NAFTA {{!}} Econofact|website=Econofact|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> Melitz noted that this would cost manufacturing jobs.<ref name=":8" />{{clarify|date=November 2017}}

== Trans-Pacific Partnership ==
If the original [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) had come into effect, existing agreements such as NAFTA would be reduced to those provisions that do not conflict with the TPP, or that require greater trade liberalization than the TPP.<ref>{{cite news

== American public opinion on NAFTA ==
{{Main|US public opinion on the North American Free Trade Agreement}}
The American public was largely divided on its view of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with a wide partisan gap in beliefs. In a February 2018 Gallup Poll, 48% of Americans said NAFTA was good for the U.S., while 46% said it was bad.<ref name=":15">{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/204269/americans-split-whether-nafta-good-bad.aspx|title=Americans Split on Whether NAFTA Is Good or Bad for U.S.|last=Inc.|first=Gallup|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-us}}</ref>

According to a journal from the ''Law and Business Review of the Americas (LBRA)'', U.S. public opinion of NAFTA centers around three issues: NAFTA's impact on the creation or destruction of American jobs, NAFTA's impact on the environment, and NAFTA's impact on immigrants entering the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/lbramrca11&div=28&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals|title=Redirecting ...|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref>

After President Trump's election in 2016, support for NAFTA became very polarized between Republicans and Democrats. Donald Trump expressed negative views of NAFTA, calling it "the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/us/politics/transcript-debate.html|title=Transcript of the First Debate|date=2016-09-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Republican support for NAFTA decreased from 43% support in 2008 to 34% in 2017. Meanwhile, Democratic support for NAFTA increased from 41% support in 2008 to 71% in 2017.<ref name="Affairs">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/pro-trade-views-rise-partisan-divisions-nafta-widen|title=Pro-Trade Views on the Rise, Partisan Divisions on NAFTA Widen {{!}} Chicago Council on Global Affairs|last=Affairs|first=Chicago Council on Global|website=www.thechicagocouncil.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref>

The political gap was especially large in concern to views on free trade with Mexico. As opposed to a favorable view of free trade with Canada, whom 79% of American described as a fair trade partner, only 47% of Americans believed Mexico practices fair trade. The gap widened between Democrats and Republicans: 60% of Democrats believed Mexico is practicing fair trade, while only 28% of Republicans did. This was the highest level from Democrats and the lowest level from Republicans ever recorded by the Chicago Council Survey. Republicans had more negative views of Canada as a fair trade partner than Democrats as well.<ref name="Affairs"/>

NAFTA had strong support from young Americans. In a February 2017 Gallup poll, 73% of Americans aged 18–29 said NAFTA was good for the U.S, showing higher support than any other U.S. age group.<ref name=":15" /> It also had slightly stronger support from unemployed Americans than from employed Americans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/113200/opinion-briefing-north-american-free-trade-agreement.aspx|title=Opinion Briefing: North American Free Trade Agreement|last=Inc.|first=Gallup|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-us}}</ref>
