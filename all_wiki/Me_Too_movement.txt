The '''Me Too''' (or '''#MeToo''') '''movement''', with variations of related local or international names, is a [[social movement]] against [[sexual abuse]] and [[sexual harassment]] where people publicize allegations of sex crimes committed by powerful and/or prominent men.<ref name=":65" /><ref name="time17">{{cite news |url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/ |title=TIME Person of the Year 2018: The Silence Breakers |last=Edwards |first=Stephanie Zacharek, Eliana Dockterman, Haley Sweetland |website=Time|access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Strause" /> The phrase "Me Too" was initially used in this context on [[social media]] in 2006, on [[Myspace]], by sexual harassment survivor and activist [[Tarana Burke]].<ref name=":1"/>

Similar to other social justice and empowerment movements based upon breaking silence, the purpose of "Me Too", as initially voiced by Burke as well as those who later adopted the tactic, is to empower women through empathy and solidarity through strength in numbers, especially young and vulnerable women, by visibly demonstrating how many women have survived sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="LA" /><ref name=WorkplaceForbes>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2017/12/20/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-in-a-metoo-world/ |title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace in A #MeToo World |last=Smartt |first=Nicole |website=Forbes |access-date=January 16, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116193245/https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2017/12/20/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-in-a-metoo-world/#7c439e1e5a42 |archive-date=January 16, 2018}}</ref>The Me Too movement is an organization to bring change to society for women who have been sexually abused or harassed.This movement has brought on the courage for women who've been sexually abused to stand up and speak out on their traumas.

Widespread media coverage and discussion of sexual harassment, particularly in Hollywood, led to high-profile firings, as well as criticism and backlash.<ref name=":17" /><ref name=Livsey13jan18/><ref name=Williams4jan18/>

After millions of people started using the phrase and hashtag in this manner in English, the expression began to spread to dozens of other languages. The scope has become somewhat broader with this expansion, however, and Burke has more recently referred to it as an international movement for justice for marginalized people in marginalized communities.<ref name=":5"/>

==Purpose==
The original purpose of "Me Too" as used by Tarana Burke in 2006 was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="LA" />

After millions of people started using the phrase, and it spread to dozens of other languages, the purpose changed and expanded, and as a result, it has come to mean different things to different people. Tarana Burke accepts the title of "leader" of the movement, but has stated that she considers herself more of a "worker." Burke has stated that this movement has grown to include both men and women of all colors and ages, as it continues to support marginalized people in marginalized communities.<ref name=":17">{{cite web |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104 |title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors |last=Jeffries |first=Zenobia |website=[[Yes!

===Awareness and empathy===
Analyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the [[World Health Organization]] to affect one-third of all women worldwide. A 2017 poll by [[ABC News]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also found that 54% of American women report receiving "unwanted and inappropriate" sexual advances with 95% saying that such behavior usually goes unpunished. Others state that #MeToo underscores the need for men to intervene when they witness demeaning behavior.<ref name=":262">{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world |title=How #MeToo has awoken women around the world |last=Radu |first=Sintia |date=October 25, 2017 |website=[[U.S. News & World Report|US News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120413/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=January 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2 |title=The problem with asking women to say 'Me Too' |last=Chapin |first=Angelina |date=October 16, 2017 |website=[[HuffPost]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102235158/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2 |archive-date=January 2, 2018 |url-status=live|access-date=December 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/ |title=A new poll on sexual harassment suggests why 'Me Too' went so insanely viral |last=Zillman |first=Claire |date=October 17, 2017 |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |access-date=January 13, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093211/http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/ |archive-date=January 13, 2018}}</ref>

===Policies and laws===
Burke has stated the current purpose of the movement is to give people the resources to have access to healing, and to advocate for changes to laws and policies. Burke has highlighted goals such as processing all untested [[rape kit]]s, re-examining local school policies, improving the vetting of teachers, and updating sexual harassment policies.<ref name=":52">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12 |title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed |last1=Snyder |first1=Chris |last2=Lopez |first2=Linette |date=December 13, 2017 |website=[[Business Insider]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12 |archive-date=December 29, 2017 |url-status=live|access-date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> She has called for all professionals who work with children to be [[fingerprint]]ed and subjected to a [[background check]] before being cleared to start work. She advocates for sex education that teaches kids to report predatory behavior immediately.<ref name=":172" /> Burke supports the #MeToo bill in the [[US Congress]], which would remove the requirement that staffers of the federal government go through months of "cooling off" before being allowed to file a complaint against a Congressperson.<ref name=":52" />

Milano states that a priority for #MeToo is changing the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault, for example instituting protocols that allow sufferers in all industries to file complaints without retaliation. She supports legislation making it difficult for publicly traded companies to hide cover-up payments from their stockholders and would like to make it illegal for employers to require new workers to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s as a condition of employment.<ref name=":272" /> Gender analysts such as [[Anna North]] have stated that #MeToo should be addressed as a labor issue due to the economic disadvantages to reporting harassment. North suggested combating underlying power imbalances in some workplaces, for example by raising the tipped minimum wage, and embracing innovations like the "portable [[panic button]]s" mandated for hotel employees in [[Seattle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo |title=What I've learned covering sexual misconduct this year |website=Vox |access-date=January 17, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118064612/https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo |archive-date=January 18, 2018|date=December 27, 2017 }}</ref>

Others have suggested that barriers to employment must be removed, such as the job requirement by some employers to sign non-disclosure agreements or other agreements that prevent an employee from talking about their employment publicly, or taking disputes (including sexual harassment claims) to arbitration rather than to legal proceedings. It's been suggested that legislation should be passed that bans these types of mandatory pre-employment agreements.<ref name=":65">{{Cite news |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/ |title=From Politics to Policy: Turning the Corner on Sexual Harassment – Center for American Progress |date=January 31, 2018 |work=Center for American Progress|access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref>

Some policy-based changes that have been suggested include increasing managerial oversight; creating clear internal reporting mechanisms; more effective and proactive disciplinary measures; creating a culture that encourages employees to be open about serious problems;<ref name=":65" /> imposing financial penalties for companies that allow workers to remain in their position when they have repeatedly sexually harassed others; and forcing companies to pay huge fines or lose tax breaks if they decide to retain workers who are sexual harassers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=2f23c864-96db-4e51-9cb9-29daeb95d19b@pdc-v-sessmgr06&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=edsbig.A553402477&db=edsbig |title=Time's Up: As the Me Too movement continues to shed light on sexual harassm...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ |website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=November 29, 2018}}</ref>

===Media coverage===
In the coverage of #MeToo, there has been widespread discussion about the best ways to stop sexual harassment and abuse - for those currently being victimized at work, as well as those who are seeking justice for past abuse and trying to find ways to end what they see as a widespread culture of abuse. There is general agreement that a lack of effective reporting options is a major factor that drives unchecked sexual misconduct in the workplace.<ref name=":02">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY |title=Despite #MeToo, U.S. workers fear speaking out about sexual harassment |date=November 10, 2017 |work=Reuters |access-date=January 17, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011233/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY |archive-date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>

False reports of sexual assault are very rare, but when they happen, they are put in the spotlight for the public to see. This can give the false impression that the most of the reported sexual assaults are false. However, false reports of sexual assault account for only 2% to 10% of all reports.<ref name="Kay 2018"/><ref name="Lisak Gardinier Nicksa Cote 2010 pp. 1318–1334"/> These figures do not take into account that the majority of victims do not report when they are assaulted or harassed. Misconceptions about false reports are one of the reasons why women are scared to report their experiences with sexual assault - because they are afraid that no one will believe them, that in the process they will have embarrassed and humiliated themselves, in addition to opening themselves up to retribution from the assailants.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/the-glaring-blind-spot-of-the-me-too-movement/546458/ |title=The Glaring Blind Spot of the 'Me Too' Movement |last=White |first=Gillian B. |date=November 22, 2017 |work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/2012-03/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf|title=False Reporting}}</ref>

There is a discussion on the best ways to handle [[whisper network]]s, or private lists of "people to avoid" that are shared unofficially in nearly every major institution or industry where sexual harassment is common due to power imbalances, including government, media, news, and academia. These lists have the stated purpose of warning other workers in the industry and are shared from person-to-person, on forums, in private social media groups, and via [[spreadsheet]]s. However, it has been argued that these lists can become "weaponized" and be used to spread unsubstantiated gossip - an opinion which has been discussed widely in the media.<ref name=":110">{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-whisper-network-sexual-misconduct-allegations-719009 |title=What is a whisper network?

Defenders say the lists provide a way to warn other vulnerable people in the industry if worried about serious retribution from the abusers, especially if complaints have already been ignored. They say the lists help victims identify each other so they can speak out together and find safety in numbers.<ref name=":110" /><ref name=":210" /> Sometimes these lists are kept for other reasons. For example, a spreadsheet from the United Kingdom called "High Libido MPs" and dubbed "the spreadsheet of shame" was created by a group of male and female Parliamentary researchers, and contained a list of allegations against nearly 40 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. It is also rumored that [[whip (politics)|party whips]] (who are in charge of getting members of Parliament to commit to votes) maintain a "black book" that contains allegations against several lawmakers that can be used for [[blackmail]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html |title=Sexual Harassment Claims Surface in U.K. Parliament |last=Castle |first=Stephen |date=October 30, 2017 |website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2018 |issn=0362-4331 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011016/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html |archive-date=January 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/ |title=Making Sense of the Lewd Sexual Harassment Scandal Roiling the U.K |website=Fortune |access-date=January 17, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031182703/http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/ |archive-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dirty-dossier-accuses-mps-of-harassment-and-sex-in-offices-6f7q8kn8b |title=Dirty dossier accuses MPs of harassment and sex in offices |last1=McGrath |first1=Hannah |last2=Kenber |first2=Billy |date=October 30, 2017 |website=The Times|access-date=January 17, 2018 |issn=0140-0460|url-access=registration}}</ref> When it is claimed a well-known person's sexual misconduct was an "open secret", these lists are often the source.<ref name=":110" /> In the wake of #MeToo, several private whisper network lists have been leaked to the public.<ref name=":110" /><ref name=":210">{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/1/11/16878316/shitty-media-men-list-katie-roiphe-moira-donegan |title=The creator of the Shitty Media Men List has come forward.

Professor [[Daniel W. Drezner|Daniel Drezner]] stated that #MeToo laid the groundwork for two major cultural shifts. One is the acceptance that sexual harassment (not just sexual assault) is unacceptable in the workplace. The other is that when a powerful person is accused of sexual harassment, the reaction should be a presumption that the less powerful accuser is "likely telling the truth, because the risks of going public are great." However, he states society is struggling with the speed at which change is being demanded.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/02/14/metoo-and-the-trouble-with-norms/ |title=Perspective {{!}} #MeToo and the trouble with new norms|last=Drezner|first=Daniel W.|date=February 14, 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=February 20, 2018|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Author and former [[Seduction community|pick-up artist]] [[Michael Ellsberg]] encourages men to reflect on past behavior and examples of questionable sexual behavior, such as the viral story [[Cat Person]], written from the perspective of a twenty-year-old woman who goes on a date with a much older man and ends up having an unpleasant sexual experience that was consensual but unwanted.

Relationship instructor Kasia Urbaniak said the movement is creating its own crisis around [[masculinity]]. "There's a reflective questioning about whether they're going to be next and if they’ve ever hurt a woman. There's a level of anger and frustration. If you’ve been doing something wrong but haven't been told, there's an incredible sense of betrayal and it’ll provoke a backlash. I think silence on both sides is incredibly dangerous." Urbaniak says she would like women to be allies of men and to be curious about their experience. "In that alliance there's a lot more power and possibility than there is in men stepping aside and starting to stew."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/dominatrix-classes-be-more-assertive-work-and-life |title=Want to be more assertive in life?

The role of men is essential when it comes to the #MeToo movement. Usually people will say that all men have to do is stop sexually assaulting women, but it's more than that. There are four things that men can do to be more involved in the #MeToo movement. First, men need to accept the fact that they are more powerful than women, physically, and have more control over women because of their masculinity. Second, men need to realize what women go through. Men have to understand that this happens to women and they always make sure that it doesn't happen to them because it's not fun to go through something so traumatic. Third, they have to approach women in a nice way. When men see another man make a sexual comment to a female, they have to stand up and let it be known that it is wrong to say that. Lastly, men need to fight for the rights of all people. If men speak upon the issues, then more people will start to listen from a man's point of view.<ref name=":410">{{Cite web|title=A Role for Men in the #MeToo Movement|url=https://www.asaecenter.org:443/en/resources/articles/an_plus/2018/august/a-role-for-men-in-the-metoo-movement|access-date=2020-11-11|website=ASAE}}</ref>

Price in her book ''Directions in Sexual Harassment Law'' describes how "a major argument for why [laws against] sexual harassment won't work in education is that issues of sexuality can't be regulated (similar to the debate in employment) or that adolescent behavior is too unpredictable to be legally controlled" (Price 62).<ref>{{Cite book|date=November 10, 2003|editor-last=MacKinnon|editor-first=Catharine A.|editor2-last=Siegel|editor2-first=Reva B.|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|journal=Nova Law Review|volume=31|issue=2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/directi_xxx_2004_00_9966/page/225 225–236]|doi=10.12987/yale/9780300098006.001.0001|isbn=9780300098006|url=https://archive.org/details/directi_xxx_2004_00_9966/page/225}}</ref>

The Me Too movement still struggle with getting laws passed in certain areas of the United States. In the US government, there have not been any laws passed for sexual harassment and abuse because Congress is holding out on it. Because no laws are not being passed, the movement stands up and continues to fight for social change. As they keep fighting, they get some changes across the US.<ref name=":310">{{Cite web|last=North|first=Anna|date=2019-10-04|title=7 positive changes that have come from the #MeToo movement|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/10/4/20852639/me-too-movement-sexual-harassment-law-2019|access-date=2020-11-08|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref> In some states, there has been banning of nondisclosure agreements because of the situation with Harvey Weinstein. He kept his assistant from speaking out for 20 years because of the nondisclosure agreement that Weinstein made him sign. So this banning has been enforced in states such as California, New Jersey, and New York. There has been cases where the victims have been paid for their traumas. An example would be the case with [[Larry Nassar]], who used to be the doctor for the USA Gymnastics team. Nassar was sent to jail between 40 and 175 years for sexually assaulting more than 100 gymnast on the team. Americans have seen power in a whole different perspective which is who most of the laws are being enforced today.

[[Jackie Speier]] proposed the Member and Employee Training and Oversight on Congress Act (ME TOO Congress Act) on November 15, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress |title='Me Too' Legislation Aims To Combat Sexual Harassment in Congress |publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121201936/https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress |archive-date=January 21, 2018}}</ref> The full language of the bipartisan bill was revealed by the House on January 18, 2018 as an amendment to the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436 |title=House unveils landmark sexual harassment overhaul bill |publisher=NBC News |access-date=January 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122073057/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436 |archive-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref> The purpose of the bill is to change how the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government treats sexual harassment complaints. Under the old system, complaints regarding the legislative branch were channeled through the [[United States Congress Office of Compliance|Office of Compliance]], which required complete confidentially through the process and took months of counseling and mediation before a complaint could actually be filed. Any settlement payments were paid using federal taxes, and it was reported that within a decade, $15&nbsp;million of tax money had been spent settling harassment and discrimination complaints. The bill would ensure future complaints could only take up to 180 days to be filed. The bill would also allow the staffers to transfer to a different department or otherwise work away from the presence of the alleged harasser without losing their jobs if they requested it. The bill would require Representatives and Senators to pay for their own harassment settlements. The Office of Compliance would no longer be allowed to keep settlements secret, and would be required to publicly publish the settlement amounts and the associated employing offices. For the first time, the same protections would also apply to unpaid workers, including pages, fellows and interns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies |title=Lawmakers unveil 'ME TOO Congress' bill to overhaul sexual harassment policies |last=Marcos |first=Cristina |date=November 15, 2017 |website=TheHill|access-date=January 4, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223010703/http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies |archive-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481 |title=House unveils sweeping harassment overhaul after wave of scandals |website=POLITICO |access-date=January 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072858/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481 |archive-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled |title=Bill Changes How Congressional Sexual Harassment Claims Are Handled |publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122024352/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled |archive-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref>

Manning claims that he was just pulling a prank by "[[mooning]]" another athlete in the room as Naughright bent over to examine him.  Both Naughright and the other athlete deny Manning's story. Naughright settled with the university for $300,000 for its alleged failure in four incidents, and resigned from the school.  She had initially made a list of 33 complaints about the school.<ref name="chronicle.augusta.com">{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/1997/08/20/oth_213271.shtml |title=Trainer's settlement involved more than Manning's mooning |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Augusta Chronicle]] |date=August 20, 1997}}</ref> Naughright filed a defamation lawsuit against Peyton Manning and three other parties in 2002.

Several groups of Christians, conservative women, and [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]] have argued that #MeToo demonstrates pornography causes women to be viewed as sexual objects and contributes to the prevalence of sexual harassment. As a result, these groups believe the production and consumption of pornography should be greatly restricted or made illegal.<ref name=":010"/>

Other social advocates and feminists have responded by pointing out that attempts to suppress pornography in the U.S. have historically never been effective at reducing consumption. They note that porn consumption in the U.S. is currently at what is likely the highest levels in history, but overall levels of sexual violence and rape are far lower today than when the [[Anti-pornography movement in the United States|anti-pornography movement in the U.S.]] first emerged during the 1960s. Additionally, many feminists argue that laws which make pornography illegal only further restrict women as far what they are and are not allowed to do with their bodies.<ref name=":010"/>

Many feminists have stated that pornography can be empowering or enjoyable for women and depicting female sexuality is not always objectification.<ref name=":010"/><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://dailytrojan.com/2018/04/05/you-do-uterus-female-sexuality-isnt-always-objectification/ |title=You Do Uterus: Female sexuality isn't always objectification {{!}} Daily Trojan|date=April 5, 2018|work=Daily Trojan|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref> Others point out that a lot of porn is made by women and for women.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.alternet.org/conservative-trying-use-metoo-movement-ban-pornography |title=This Conservative Is Trying to Use the #MeToo Movement to Ban Pornography |last=Fenwick |first=Cody |date=February 12, 2018 |work=AlterNet|access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref> Award-winning porn actress and director [[Angela White]] says there is a "large positive shift within the industry" to more women directing and producing their own content and "to represent women as powerful sexual beings."<ref name=":58"/> Anti-porn activist [[Melissa Farley]] has said this ignores the "choicelessness" faced by many actresses in porn.<ref name=":010"/> Liberal advocates argue that anti-pornography movements in the U.S. have historically never tried to increase choices for vulnerable adult performers, and taking away a person's right to act in porn may hurt them economically by reducing their choices. Many adult performers have stated that the social stigma surrounding their type of work is already a major barrier when they're seeking help, and making porn illegal would leave them few options if they are suffering from sexual abuse.<ref name=":58"/>

As a result of #MeToo, many adult performers, sex worker advocates and feminists have called for greater protections for pornographic actresses, for example reducing social stigmas, mandating training courses that teach performers their rights, and providing access to independent hotlines where performers can report abuse. They argue that making porn illegal would only cause the production of porn to go underground where there are even fewer options for help. Some liberal activists have argued to compromise by raising the legal age of entry into adult entertainment from 18 to 21, which would prevent some of the most vulnerable women from being taken advantage of, while allowing adult women to still do what they want with their own bodies.<ref name=":58"/>

Some have pointed out that many young people who do not receive a sex education adopt ideas about sex and sexual roles from pornography, whose fantasy depictions of those behaviors are not accurate to life, as they are designed for purposes of adult entertainment, and not educating the public on the reality of sexual behavior.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html |title=What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn |date=February 7, 2018 |work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Some areas of the United States teach [[Birth control|birth-control]] methods only by [[abstinence]] from sex.

Sophie Richardson, the [[Human Rights Watch]] director for China, stated the Chinese government regularly suppresses discussion of women's rights, for example an incident in 2015 where [[Li Tingting]] and four other activists were arrested when the government learned they planned to hand out stickers about preventing sexual harassment on public transportation.<ref name=":31" />

Zhou Xiaoxuan, a 25-year-old screenwriter in Beijing, stated that the [[China Central Television]] host and anchor [[Zhu Jun (host)|Zhu Jun]] assaulted her in his dressing room while she was an intern of his in 2014.

So for years, Ms. Zhou kept what had happened a secret, only known by herself, her parents, and some close friends. That was until one day, where she saw a "#MeToo" post, and decided to share her own story.

There were reports of mass sexual assaults during the 2018 new year's celebrations in [[Bangalore]], which have been associated with #MeToo.

Several lists of alleged rapists and harassers started spreading on social media in India, including "The List" which initially included the names of about sixty highly respected academic men.

As part of the #MeToo movement, [[Shiori Itō]] went public alleging that she was raped by [[Noriyuki Yamaguchi]], a prominent TV journalist and acquaintance of Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]],<ref name="BBC2018-06-28a">{{cite news |title=Japan's secret shame |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b8cfcj/japans-secret-shame |date=June 20, 2018 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> an admission she says was unthinkable for a woman to do in Japan. Yamaguchi rejects her accusations, and says that sex was consensual.<ref name="BBC2018-06-28a" /> She said her experience with Japan's legal system showed her that victims of sex crimes were undermined and ignored. She called for the Japanese parliament to update Japan's laws regarding rape, which were over a century old. She explains how she could not get information on which hospital provides rape kits without going through a preliminary interview in person. When she went to the police, she was discouraged from filing a report, and informed her career would be ruined for no reason if she did this. She was told she did not act like a victim, and had to be interviewed by several officers, including one who made her reenact the rape with a dummy while he took pictures. Although they initially said they would arrest Yamaguchi, the case and charges were unexpectedly dropped. Itō then went to the media, but no one would take her story. When she spoke about the experience at a press conference, she made national news and immediately started receiving a negative backlash, hate mail, and threats.<ref name=":1522" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/22/asia/shiori-ito-japan-metoo-intl/index.html |title=Ignored, humiliated: How Japan is accused of failing survivors of sexual abuse |last1=Stewart |first1=Anna |last2=McKirdy |first2=Euan |last3=Ogura |first3=Junko |publisher=CNN}}</ref> She has been unsuccessful in her attempts to have criminal charges brought against Yamaguchi, but as of 2018 she was still pursuing a civil case against him, which he was defending.<ref name="BBC2018-06-28a" /> After reflecting on her experience with reporting sexual assault, Itō notes that there "is little concept of sexual consent in the law or in society" which indicates a need for more education in schools especially given the prevalence of rape culture and power imbalances in Japanese society.<ref name=":1522" /> Itō further stated that the #MeToo Movement was small in Japan but that "what's happened in the United States and elsewhere has provided an opening in our media to discuss sexual harassment and assault here, and to raise awareness".<ref name=":1522" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/takumiharimaya/japan-metoo|website=BuzzFeed|language=ja|script-title=ja:日本でも広がる「#metoo」 しかし、勘違いしないでほしい|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020650/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/takumiharimaya/japan-metoo|archive-date=January 14, 2018|access-date=January 5, 2018}}</ref>

As a result of the severe culture of victim blaming, the slogan #WeToo was developed in conjunction with #MeToo. The slogan was launched to spur more women to openly support the feminist agenda of revealing the prevalence of sexual harassment and showing [[solidarity]] with victims. By replacing "Me" with "We", the slogan allowed women to contribute to the movement without having to speak of their own experience with sexual harassment, which is associated with the risk of receiving stigma, shame, and [[Ostracism|ostracization]]. The slogan was developed by Monica Fukuhara, who had first hand experience in the difficulty women in Japan face in regards to the fear of speaking of their experience with sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/15/national/social-issues/becomes-victim-blaming-japan/|title=Me Too becomes We Too in victim-blaming Japan|last1=Mori|first1=Kurumi|date=2018-05-15|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2019-11-15|last2=Oda|first2=Shoko|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>

Another manifestation of the MeToo movement in Japan was the following development of the KuToo campaign. Based on the Japanese word "kutsu" for shoes and the word for pain "kutsuu", the campaign was launched in response to the corporate norm that expects women at the workplace to always wear high heels. Similarly, women are pressured to wear high heels when job hunting, so as to raise the prospects of finding a competitive position in a corporation. Founded and supported by writer [[Yumi Ishikawa]], the campaign gained enough support to result in a petition being sent to labour ministry officials. Specifically, KuToo aims to prompt officials to create anti-sexual harassment and discrimination laws that will prohibit companies from restricting women from wearing anything other than high heels at the workplace.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/women-in-japan-protest-against-having-to-wear-high-heels-to-work-kutoo-yumi-ishikawa|title=#KuToo: Japanese women submit anti-high heels petition|last1=Weaver|first1=Matthew|date=2019-06-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-15|last2=France-Presse|first2=Agence|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

====Brenda Uphopho case====
She had been assaulted three times by three different men. The first incident took place at age five. At that time, she was too young to understand what happened until a similar incident occurred at age 18. She was at a party when a stranger forced her to have sex with him. Upon her refusal, he beat her up and raped her. Due to the stigma attached to being raped, she resorted to silence. The final experience took place at her workplace when her boss forcibly put his hand under her skirt. She still remained silent with the notion of not being believed and being judged by others. Realizing she could not remain silent and needing to make an impact, Uphopho currently works with her husband to break the "culture of silence" around abuse in Nigeria. They produced a play called ''Shattered'' which seeks to encourage victims of sexual abuse to speak up.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/02/africa/nigeria-rape-survivors-metoo-asequals/index.html |title=The #MeToo stories you haven't heard: Meet the women speaking out in Nigeria |author1=Stephanie Busari |author2=Torera Idowu|access-date=April 24, 2018}}</ref>

With hashtags such as #BoycottAliZafar, #BoycottTeefainTrouble, and #TeefaisTrouble, a huge wave of activists built a momentum on social media ahead of the movie's premiere and subsequent screenings. A few major Pakistani media outlets outright ignored the demonstrations but others had to give in when protestors turned up at cinemas and police and other law enforcement agencies got involved.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://cutacut.com/2018/07/21/police-detain-protesters-at-ali-zafars-teefa-in-trouble-screening-in-neuplex-karachi/ |title=Police detain protesters at Ali Zafar's Teefa in Trouble screening in Nueplex Karachi |work=cutacut|access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>

Protestors again showed up at Lahore's CineStar to voice their anger and disappointment at both the promotion of the film of an alleged harasser and the celebrities pouring in to support him. The controversy deepened when, in one instance, the demonstrators asked Waleed Zaman, the creative director of women's clothing brand Kayseria, the reason he was backing the film, to which Zaman responded by saying: "We support sexual harassment of women."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/pakistan/we-support-sexual-harassment-pakistani-businessman-1.2254722 |title=We support sexual harassment: Pakistani businessman |editor-last=Khan |editor-first=Rabab |date=July 21, 2018 |work=Gulf News|access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/22/white-lies-273/ |title=White Lies |website=Pakistan Today|access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>

A series of allegations concerning the involvement of British politicians in cases of [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault|assault]] arose in October and November 2017, the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals]]. Allegations were prompted by discussions among junior staff employed in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] at Westminster following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] in Hollywood earlier in October, and the subsequent rise of Me Too. The journalists [[Jane Merrick]] and Kate Maltby made allegations against the Defence Minister [[Michael Fallon]] and de facto Deputy Prime Minister [[Damian Green]], respectively. These led to the departures of both from Theresa May's cabinet, the latter after a two-month inquiry that also considered allegations that Green had lied about copious amounts of pornography found on his parliamentary computer. Both Merrick and Maltby cited the #MeToo movement as inspiring their allegations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/britains-metoo-movement-is-uncovering-a-culture-of-rampant-sexism-and-harassment-in-londons-corridors-of-power.html |title=That Charity Dinner Was Just the Tip of the Iceberg of the British Elite's Culture of Sexism and Harassment |first=Julia |last=Rampen |website=Slate}}</ref>

The related hashtag [[Him Too movement|#HimToo]] emerged in popularity with the #MeToo movement. Although dating back to at least 2015, and initially associated with politics or casual communication, #HimToo took on new meanings associated with #MeToo in 2017, with some using it to emphasize male victims of sexual harassment and abuse, and others using it to emphasize male perpetrators. In September and October 2018, during the [[Sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh|sexual assault allegations raised during Brett Kavanaugh's nomination]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, #HimToo became used by supporters of Kavanaugh and to highlight male victims of false accusations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Amanda |title=#HimToo: Left And Right Embrace Opposing Takes On Same Hashtag |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656293787/-himtoo-left-and-right-embrace-opposing-takes-on-same-hashtag |publisher=NPR |date=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ellis |first1=Emma Grey |title=How #HimToo Became the Tagline of the Men's Rights Movement |url=https://www.wired.com/story/brett-kavanaugh-hearings-himtoo-metoo-christine-blasey-ford/ |website=WIRED |date=September 27, 2018}}</ref>

In January 2019, a [[tertiary institution]]'s lecturer from Hong Kong also came out in the spotlight to announce his establishment of a [[support group]] aimed at "gathering all men who have suffered from false allegations of sexual crimes to speak out" in an interview by [[Apple Daily|a local newspaper]]. He claimed that he was a victim of this movement, which he considered as "encouraging unethical females to frame males they hate, who, under conventional stereotypes, are usually assumed to hold indecent urge for women". He did add that he "was not opposed to this movement", but was concerned about its "abuses that could ruin the life of many innocent men".<ref>{{cite news |title=【MeToo無辜男】召集被屈同路人伸冤 前大專講師：唔敢再望女人 |date=January 13, 2019 |newspaper=Apple Daily |url=https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20190113/59134252}}</ref>

Many commentators have responded that the number of [[false accusation of rape|false reports]] is expected to be low, citing figures obtained by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and other organizations that have generally found that around 2-10% of rape and sexual assault allegations reported to police are determined to be false after a thorough investigation.

Creator [[Tarana Burke]] has laid out specific goals for the #MeToo movement, including: processing all untested rape kits in the United States, investigating the vetting of teachers, better protecting children at school, updating sexual harassment policies, and improving training in workplaces, places of worship, and schools. She has stated that everyone in a community, including men and women, must act to make the #MeToo movement a success. She also supports the #MeToo Congress bill and hopes it will inspire similar legal changes in other parts of the country.<ref name=":5" />

Tarana Burke said in January 2018, "Those of us who do this work know that backlash is inevitable." While describing the backlash as carrying an underlying sentiment of fairness, she defended her movement as "not a witch hunt as people try to paint it". She stated that engaging with the cultural critique in #MeToo was more productive than calling for it to end or focusing on accused men who "haven't actually touched anybody".<ref name=":17" /> [[Ronan Farrow]], who published the Weinstein exposé in the [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] that helped start the #MeToo resurgence (alongside ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporters [[Megan Twohey]] and [[Jodi Kantor]]), was asked in late December 2017 whether he thought the movement had "gone too far". Farrow called for a careful examination of each story to guard against false accusations but also recalled the alleged sexual abuse his sister Dylan Farrow claims she went through at the hands of his father [[Woody Allen]]. He stated that after decades of silence, "My feeling is that this is a net benefit to society and that all of the people, men, and women, pouring forward and saying 'me too' deserve this moment.

Despite the prevalence{{where?|date=October 2018}} of sexual misconduct, some have pointed out the lack of discussion in the #MeToo movement regarding law-enforcement misconduct.<ref name=":55">{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/metoo-ignore-police-sexual-misconduct-757033 |title=Why aren't we talking about sexual misconduct by police? {{!}} Opinion|date= December 22, 2017|work= Newsweek|access-date= April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":56">{{Cite news |url=https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/copstoo-when-police-officers-use-sexual-assault-to-te-1823081788 |title=#CopsToo: When Police Officers Use Sexual Assault to Terrorize Vulnerable Communities |last=Butler |first=Danielle |work=Very Smart Brothas|access-date= April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-sexual-misconduct-metoo/ |title=As Hollywood & Politicians Get Spotlight, Why Has Police Sexual Abuse Escaped #MeToo Movement? |date=December 25, 2017 |work=The Free Thought Project|access-date= April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":57">

Police sexual misconduct disproportionately affects women of color, though women from all walks of life are affected.<ref name=":57" /> The [[Cato Institute]] reported that in 2010, more than 9% of police misconduct reports in 2010 involved sexual abuse, and there are multiple indications that "sexual assault rates are significantly higher for police when compared to the general population."<ref name=":56" /> Fear of retribution is considered{{by whom|date=October 2018}} one reason some law-enforcement officers are not subjected to significant consequences for known misconduct.<ref name=":55" /> Police-reform activist Roger Goldman stated that an officer who is fired for sexual misconduct from one police department often gets rehired by a different department, where they can continue the misconduct in a new environment.<ref name=":55" /> Some states (such as Florida and Georgia) have licensing laws that can decertify a law-enforcement officer who has committed major misconduct, which prevents decertified officers from being hired again in that state.<ref name=":55" /> Some have called for sexual misconduct allegations against police to be investigated by third parties to reduce bias (as opposed to the common practice of investigations being led by fellow law-enforcement officers or colleagues in the same department).<ref name=":57" />

=== Lack of representation of minority women ===
Many have pointed to a lack of representation of minority women in the #MeToo movement or its leadership.<ref name=":35">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theroot.com/these-are-the-women-of-color-who-fought-both-sexism-and-1823720002 |title=These Are the Women of Color Who Fought Both Sexism and the Racism of White Feminists |last=Branigin |first=Anne |work=The Root|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":48">{{cite web |url=https://qz.com/1150028/gloria-steinem-on-metoo-black-women-have-always-been-more-feminist-than-white-women/ |title=Gloria Steinem on #MeToo: Black women have always been more feminist than white women — Quartz |last=Fessler |first=Leah |website=Quartz|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":49">{{Cite news |url=https://work.qz.com/1147950/metoo-hijacked-black-womens-work-on-race-and-gender-equality/ |title=#MeToo hijacked black women's work on race and gender equality |work=Quartz at Work|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":50">{{Cite news |url=http://valleyadvocate.com/2018/01/31/metoo-black-women-periphery-movement/ |title=#MeToo?

Minority women are overrepresented in industries with the greatest number of sexual harassment claims, for example hotels, health, food services, and retail.<ref name=":49" /> It has been pointed out that undocumented minority women often have no recourse if they're experiencing sexual violence.<ref name=":54">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hollywood-having-metoo-moment-women-color-have-fought-battle-decades-n841121 |title=Hollywood is having a #MeToo moment.

Former victim [[Farah Tanis]] stated there are also additional barriers for black women who want to participate in the #MeToo movement. She pointed out that social pressure discourages reports against black men, especially from church and family, because many would view that as a betrayal against their "brothers."<ref name=":54" /> Additionally, black women are less likely to be believed if they do speak out.<ref name=":54" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.healthline.com/health/black-women-metoo-antirape-movement#9 |title=There Is No #MeToo Without Black Women |work=Healthline|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref>

Some have argued that the American judicial system acknowledges the term "sexual harassment" only because of successful sexual harassment lawsuits by three black women: [[Diane R. Williams|Diane Williams]] and Paulette Barnes against the US government, and Mechelle Vinson against a bank.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/ |title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women |last=Lipsitz |first=Raina |date=October 20, 2017 |work=The Nation|access-date=April 7, 2018 |issn=0027-8378}}</ref> Vinson's case of [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]] led to the unanimous 1986 Supreme Court decision that sexual harassment violates the [[Civil Rights Act]].<ref name=":48" /><ref name=":49" /> Black law professor [[Anita Hill]] again brought sexual harassment to public discourse in 1991 with her testimony against Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]].<ref name=":48" /><ref name=":49" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/27/560231232/women-are-speaking-up-about-harassment-and-abuse-but-why-now |title=Women Are Speaking Up About Harassment And Abuse, But Why Now? |publisher=NPR|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref>

Tarana Burke initially criticized the movement for ignoring the work of black women in creating dialogue addressing sexual assault. However, she did salute those who partook in the movement and credited Milano for acknowledging Burke's own similar movement.<ref name="Hill">{{cite web |url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano |title=Black woman Tarana Burke founded the 'Me Too' movement |last=Hill |first=Zahara |date=October 16, 2017 |website=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |access-date=October 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017035553/http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano |archive-date=October 17, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> As well as this, she pleaded to black women not to drop out of the movement just because the media isn't listening saying "This is your movement, too."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tarana-burke-tells-black-women-me-too-is-your-movement-too_us_5b967c8fe4b0162f472f65f6 |title=Tarana Burke Tells Black Women Me Too Is 'Your Movement, Too' |last=Vagianos |first=Alanna |date=September 10, 2018 }}</ref>

American feminist and journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] said there is a blind spot surrounding [[intersectionality]] between race and gender, and a major problem with today's feminists is they are not acknowledging "that women of color in general—and especially black women—have always been more likely to be feminist than white women."<ref name=":35" /> Steinem argues that #MeToo could never have happened without the work of these women, and women in the #MeToo movement have a responsibility: "If you have more power, remember to listen as much as you talk. And if you have less power, remember to talk as much as you listen."<ref name=":48" />

=== Overemphasis on specific cases ===
The #MeToo movement has been criticized for putting too much public focus on the consequences of specific individuals who have been accused of sexual misconduct, as opposed to discussing policies and changes to institutional norms that would help people currently experiencing sexual abuse.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/ |title=6 Perspectives on the Future of #MeToo |last1=Fonda |first1=Jane |date=December 13, 2017 |work=The Nation |access-date=February 1, 2018 |last2=Covert |first2=Bryce |issn=0027-8378 |last3=Pollitt |first3=Katha |last4=Meyerson |first4=Collier |last5=Lipsitz |first5=Raina |last6=Walsh |first6=Joan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131001011/https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/ |archive-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref> It's been noted that although allegations surrounding high-profile public figures tend to attract the most attention, the stories of regular workers often go unacknowledged.<ref name=":65" /> Yet to ensure meaningful change, these workers’ experiences must be at the center of any policy solutions that lawmakers pursue. Tarana Burke has voiced similar misgivings, pointing out one problematic aspect of #MeToo is "All of this media attention is on the perpetrator. All of the conversation about fairness and due process is focused on the perpetrator." She states the movement should focus on specific steps to help current and future sufferers.<ref name=":173">{{cite web |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104 |title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors |last=Jeffries |first=Zenobia |date=January 4, 2018 |website=[[Yes!

=== Disregard for incarcerated women ===
[[Prisoners' rights]] are significantly limited and the power imbalance between female inmates and male officers allows and promotes [[prison rape]] and other forms of abuse.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-brown-me-too-women-prisons_us_5ac28e1de4b00fa46f854abf |title=Women in Prison Are Still Waiting For Their Me Too Moment |last=Brown |first=Kim |date=April 10, 2018 |work=HuffPost|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":67">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/words-prison-sexual-abuse-prison |title=Words From Prison: Sexual Abuse in Prison |website=American Civil Liberties Union|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":68">{{cite web |url=https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2014/09/christina-piecora-female-inmates/ |title=Female Inmates and Sexual Assault |last=Piecora |first=Christina |website=jurist.org|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref> In addition, most [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women who are incarcerated]] for the murder of their [[Intimate partner violence|intimate partners]] acted in [[Self-defense|protection of themselves]].<ref name=":67" /><ref name=":68" /> Many people have criticized the prison system for punishing women who act in self defense.<ref name=":69">{{cite web |url=https://rewire.news/article/2018/01/08/survivors-prison-rape-saying-isnt-option/ |title=For Survivors of Prison Rape, Saying 'Me Too' Isn't an Option |website=Rewire.News|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref> Others criticize the main outreach of the Me Too movement for failing to address the [[Prisoner abuse|systemic imprisonment of abused women and men]].<ref name=":69" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/09/20/when-prisoners-say-metoo |title=When Prisoners Say #MeToo |last=Project |first=Hokyoung Kim for The Marshall |date=September 21, 2018 |website=The Marshall Project|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/opinion/letters/female-prisoners-metoo.html |title=Opinion {{!}} Female Prisoners and #MeToo|date=October 8, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 19, 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
