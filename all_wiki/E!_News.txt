'''''E! News''''', previously known as '''''E! News Daily''''' and '''''E! News Live''''', is the [[infotainment]] operation for the cable network [[E!]] in the United States. Its former on-air weekday newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reported on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, along with overall [[film industry]] and [[television]] industry news. Although the on-air network newscasts were discontinued in March 2020, the news operation continues to function in full through E!'s website.

==Overview==
[[File:E News logo.jpg|thumb|200px|E! News logo used from 1991–2012.]]
The program first aired on September 12, 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/e-news/episode-194-season-17/todays-top-stories/191490/|title=E! News|website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> It was originally hosted by [[Dagny Hultgreen]]. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named ''E! News Live''). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Giuliana Rancic]]. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by [[Jason Kennedy (TV personality)|Jason Kennedy]]. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), though she reassured viewers that she would return under a new three-year agreement to ''E! News'' and ''[[Fashion Police]]'' after her leave; [[Catt Sadler]] took over her anchoring duties, and eventually became a main anchor as Rancic reduced her duties over time. From 2006 until late 2010, ''[[The Daily 10]]'', hosted by [[Selema Masekela]], Sadler, and at one point [[Debbie Matenopoulos]], [[hammocking]] of ''E! News''.

On September 21, 2010, E! announced the cancellation of ''[[The Daily 10]]''. At this time, it was announced that ''E! News'' would be expanded to a one-hour format. The expansion became effective beginning on October 25, 2010. The series also debuted a new news set and began broadcasting in [[high-definition television]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/457412-E_Expands_Weeknight_Newscast_To_One_Hour.php |title=E! Expands Weeknight Newscast To One Hour |publisher=Multichannel News |date= |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> Some talent previously featured on ''The Daily 10'', including [[Catt Sadler]], [[Clinton Sparks]] and Robbie Laughlin, were integrated into ''E! News'', along with the addition of a segment called ''The Daily 10 Take'' and the inclusion of some former ''Daily 10'' segments.

The ''E! News'' program was dark on major holidays, including [[Memorial Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Thanksgiving]], and [[Christmas]], with special pre-taped programs, the show's weekend edition or other E! programs airing instead, depending on where the holiday fell.

In December 2017, Catt Sadler departed the network upon learning she [[gender pay gap]] compared to her male counterpart, [[Jason Kennedy (TV personality)|Jason Kennedy]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/tv/catt-sadler-leaves-e-news-pay-gap-cohost-jason-kennedy/|title=Catt Sadler Leaves E!

In August 2019, it was announced that starting on January 6, 2020, the ''E! News'' newscast would move to [[New York City]], along with the launch of a companion program, ''[[Pop of the Morning]]''. It would become a [[breakfast television]] airing live at 7 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone]], though at the peril of being too early for [[West Coast of the United States]] audiences at 4 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone]]. The new iteration of ''E! News'' would originate from [[NBC Studios (New York City)|NBC Studios]] at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]. The move was done to allow the network to become a stop on the common New York morning show circuit, and to allow for more [[vertical integration]] promotion for NBCUniversal programming and attractions in an hour where [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' is usually exclusively devoted to [[infotainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/e-news-set-become-new-york-based-morning-show-1229604 |title='E!

In October 2019, Rancic announced that she would be resigning her anchor position and staying in Los Angeles, and remain with the network for red carpet coverage, citing that she wanted to be more hands-on with her family and business interests in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://people.com/tv/giuliana-rancic-explains-why-shes-leaving-e-news-its-nice-having-a-little-more-flexibility/|title=Giuliana Rancic Explains Why She's Leaving E!

On December 5, 2019, it was announced that [[Lilliana Vazquez]] and [[Scott Tweedie]] would be the new co-anchors of the New York-based morning iteration of ''E! News'' which began airing on January 6, 2020. On March 13, 2020, it was announced that effective immediately, all of E!'s studio programming would go on an indefinite hiatus due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United states|COVID-19 pandemic]]. On August 5, 2020, E! canceled both New York-based shows, along with ''In The Room'', one of the first of many program and employee cuts and staff realignments announced across [[NBCUniversal]] that week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=https://deadline.com/2020/08/e-news-pop-of-the-morning-in-the-room-canceled-e-financial-1203005259/|title=‘E!

===International===
In the UK the show airs weekdays at 8 a.m., 9 a.m., 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. In Europe, excluding the UK, ''E! News'' is often edited into a 30-minute version, but the Hour version is aired at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. [[Central European Time]]. The show also keeps changing airing times from week to week.

== International versions ==

=== Latin American  ===
In [[Latin America]] the show was presented by [[Daniela Kosán]] and [[Renato López]]. Although ''E! News Latin America'' had different anchors, the video clips were the same. The show was cancelled in late 2008 and as of May 20, 2009 the show has been replaced by its American counterpart, with a two-minute recap of Latin American entertainment news retained, along with a 'week in review' half-hour program on Thursday nights. Both were hosted by [[Renato López]] until his dead in 2016.

=== Asia ===
Introduced in 2010, ''E! News Asia'' was a weekly round-up of entertainment stories from Hollywood and Asia, formerly anchored by Dominic Lau and [[Marion Caunter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/entertainment/tv/news/2010/03/27/caunter-and-vj-dom-land-e-news-asia-hosting-job/ |title=Caunter and VJ Dom land E! News Asia hosting job |publisher=Ecentral.my |date=2010-03-27 |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> Now produced as short form content, ''E! News Asia'' is currently hosted by [[Yvette King]], with correspondents [[Raymond Gutierrez]] in the Philippines and Elizabeth and [[Maria Rahajeng]] in Indonesia. ''E! News Asia'' is available in 15 countries around the Asian region.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, in addition to the U.S. version, a weekly Canadian program titled ''E! News Weekend'' aired from 2008 to 2009 on the [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E! broadcast system]] owned by [[Canwest]]. This was a weekly 30-minute program hosted by Jason Ruta and Arisa Cox from the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in downtown [[Toronto]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/382103/-e-news-weekend-debuts-friday-march-7-direct-from-the-heart-of-canada-s-entertainment-capital|title="E! News Weekend" Debuts Friday, March 7 Direct From The Heart Of Canada's Entertainment Capital|publisher=[[Canwest]]|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> The broadcast service ceased operations in August 2009, and this program was not carried over to the [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|unaffiliated cable channel]] which picked up the E! brand in late 2010.

The aforementioned E! system was unique in that it was transmitted through local broadcast stations which produced and aired their own local newscasts, similar to other North American broadcast networks – however, these programs specifically did not carry the ''E! News'' brand. For example, the system's flagship station [[CHCH-DT]] simply titled its newscasts ''CHCH News''. This decision was made at least partly to avoid confusion with the U.S. (and later Canadian) entertainment news programs, but it was likely also intended to ensure that local newscasts were not themselves perceived as celebrity-oriented. However, this was an anomaly among Canadian networks which by that point had all, apart from E!, adopted network-based branding (''[[CTV News]]'', etc.) for their stations' local newscasts (even the Canadian E! network, under its previous branding as "CH", had used such branding).
