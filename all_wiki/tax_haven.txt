Traditional tax havens, like [[Jersey]], are open about zero rates of taxation, but as a consequence have limited bilateral [[tax treaty|tax treaties]].  Modern [[corporate tax haven]]s have non-zero "headline" rates of taxation and high levels of [[OECD]] compliance, and thus have large networks of bilateral [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]].  However, their [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tools enable corporates to achieve "effective" tax rates closer to zero, not just in the haven but in all countries with which the haven has tax treaties; putting them on tax haven lists.  According to modern studies, the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} include corporate-focused havens like the Netherlands, Singapore, Ireland and the U.K., while Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the Caribbean (the Caymans, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands) and Switzerland feature as both major traditional tax havens and major corporate tax havens.

The FSI does not assess tax rates or BEPS flows in its calculation; but it is often misinterpreted as a tax haven definition in the financial media,{{efn|name=FSI}} particularly when it lists the US and Germany as major "secrecy jurisdictions".<ref name="Drucker2016"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Robert W.|title=The World's Next Top Tax Haven Is...America|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/01/27/the-worlds-next-top-tax-haven-is-america|access-date=7 June 2016|work=Forbes|date=27 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810004528/http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/01/27/the-worlds-next-top-tax-haven-is-america/|archive-date=10 August 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ana|title=How the U.S. became one of the world's biggest tax havens|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/05/how-the-u-s-became-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens/|access-date=23 April 2016|work=Washington Post|date=5 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421005012/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/05/how-the-u-s-became-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-tax-havens/|archive-date=21 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  However, many types of tax havens also rank as secrecy jurisdictions.

==Groupings==
{{See also|Tax haven#History}}

While tax havens are diverse and varied, tax academics sometimes recognise three major "groupings" of tax havens when discussing the history of their development:<ref name="ronen.palan2"/><ref name="sol.piccolo"/><ref name="jason"/><ref name="nicholas.shaxson"/>

===European-related tax havens===
As discussed in {{slink|#History}}, the first recognized tax haven hub was the Zurich-Zug-Liechtenstein triangle created in the mid-1920s; later joined by Luxembourg in 1929.<ref name="ronen.palan2"/>  Privacy and secrecy were established as an important aspect of European tax havens.  However, modern European tax havens also include corporate-focussed tax havens, which maintain higher levels of OECD transparency, such as the Netherlands and Ireland.{{efn|Ireland is also connected to the British Empire-related tax havens as Ireland's common law legal system, and company tax system, are more derived from the UK, then from Continental Europe.}} European tax havens act as an important part of the global flows to tax havens, with three of the five major global Conduit OFCs being European (e.g. the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Ireland).<ref name="xx"/> Four European-related tax havens appear in the various notable {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} lists, namely: the Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, and Luxembourg.

===British Empire-related tax havens===
[[File:British Overseas Territories (at the same geographic scale).svg|thumb|British Overseas Territories (same geographic scale) includes leading traditional and corporate tax global tax havens, including the U.K. itself.]]
Many tax havens are former or current dependencies of the United Kingdom and still use the same core legal structures.<ref name="sol.piccolo"/>  Six British Empire-related tax havens appear in the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} lists, namely: Caribbean tax havens (e.g. Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, and the Cayman Islands), Channel Islands tax havens (e.g. Jersey) and Asian tax havens (e.g. Singapore and Hong Kong). As discussed in {{slink|#History}}, the United Kingdom created its first "non-resident company" in 1929, and led the [[Offshore financial centre#Shadow banking and securitisation|Eurodollar offshore financial centre market]] post World War II.<ref name="ronen.palan2"/><ref name="sol.piccolo"/>  Since the reform of its corporate tax code in 2009–2012, the UK has re-emerged as a major corporate-focused tax haven.<ref name="uk1">{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/tax-reform-uk-reversed-tide-corporate-tax-inversions/#_ftn4|title=Tax Reform in the UK Reversed the Tide of Corporate Tax Inversions|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|author=William McBride|date=14 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417155717/https://taxfoundation.org/tax-reform-uk-reversed-tide-corporate-tax-inversions/#_ftn4|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Two of the five major global Conduit OFCs are from this grouping (e.g. the U.K. and Singapore).<ref name="xx"/>

===Emerging market-related tax havens===
As discussed in {{slink|#History}}, most of these tax havens date from the late 1960s and effectively copied the structures and services of the above groups.<ref name="ronen.palan2"/>  Most of these tax havens are not OECD members, or in the case of British Empire-related tax havens, don't have a senior OECD member at their core.<ref name="ronen.palan2"/><ref name="jason"/>  Some have suffered setbacks during various OECD initiatives to curb tax havens (e.g. Vanuatu and Samoa).<ref name="ronen.palan2"/>  However, others such as Taiwan (for AsiaPAC), and Mauritius (for Africa), have grown materially in the past decades.<ref name="jason"/>  Taiwan has been described as "Switzerland of Asia", with a focus on secrecy.<ref name="TaiwanTJN"/>  While no Emerging market-related tax haven ranks in the five major global Conduit OFCs or any {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} lists, both Taiwan and Mauritius rank in the top ten global Sink OFCs.<ref name="xx"/>

(*) Appears as a top ten tax haven in all three lists; 9 major tax havens meet this criterion, ''Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland and the Netherlands (the Conduit OFCs), and the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Bermuda (the Sink OFCs)''.<br/>

(Δ) Identified on the first, and largest, OECD 2000 list of 35 tax havens (the OECD list only contained Trinidad & Tobago by 2017).<ref name="OECDh"/><ref name="fttt"/>

The strongest consensus amongst academics regarding the world's largest tax havens is therefore: Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland and the Netherlands (the major Conduit OFCs), and the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Bermuda (the major Sink OFCs), with the United Kingdom (a major Conduit OFC) still in transformation.

Of these ten major havens, all except the United Kingdom and the Netherlands featured on the original [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines-Rice 1994 list|Hines–Rice 1994 list]].  The United Kingdom was not a tax haven in 1994, and Hines estimated the Netherlands's effective tax rate in 1994 at over 20% (Hines identified Ireland as having the lowest effective tax rate at 4%). Four of them, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland (3 of the 5 top Conduit OFCs), and Hong Kong (a top 5 Sink OFC), featured in the Hines–Rice 1994 list's ''7 major tax havens'' subcategory; highlighting a lack of progress in curtailing tax havens.<ref name="h3"/>

In terms of [[Corporate haven#Proxy tests|proxy indicators]], this list, excluding Canada, contains all seven of the countries that received more than one US [[tax inversion]] since 1982 (see [[Tax inversion#US inversions|here]]).<ref name="bbb"/> In addition, six of these major tax havens are in the top 15 [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita#Distorted GDP-per-capita for tax havens|GDP-per-capita]], and of the four others, three of them, the Caribbean locations, are not included in IMF-World Bank GDP-per-capita tables.

===Broad lists of tax havens===
Post–2010 research on tax havens is focused on quantitative analysis (which can be ranked), and tends to ignore very small tax havens where data is limited as the haven is used for individual tax avoidance rather than corporate tax avoidance.  The last credible broad unranked list of global tax havens is the [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|James Hines 2010 list]] of 52 tax havens.  It is shown below but expanded to 55 to include havens identified in the July 2017 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs]] study that were not considered havens in 2010, namely the United Kingdom, Taiwan, and Curaçao.  The James Hines 2010 list contains 34 of the original 35 OCED tax havens;<ref name="OECDh"/> and compared with the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} and {{slink|#Top 20 tax havens}} above, show OECD processes focus on the compliance of tiny havens.

Major sovereign States which feature on financial secrecy lists (e.g. the [[Financial Secrecy Index]]), but not on [[corporate tax haven]] or traditional tax haven lists, are:

* United States – noted for secrecy, per the [[Financial Secrecy Index]], (see [[United States as a tax haven]]); makes a "controversial" appearance on some lists.<ref name="Drucker2016">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/the-world-s-favorite-new-tax-haven-is-the-united-states|title=The World's Favorite New Tax Haven Is the United States|author=Jesse Drucker|date=27 January 2016|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=11 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311164127/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/the-world-s-favorite-new-tax-haven-is-the-united-states|archive-date=11 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
* [[Germany]] – similar to the U.S., Germany can be included on lists for its tax secrecy, per the Financial Secrecy Index<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/finance/a-german-tax-haven-626845|title=A German Tax Haven|website=Handelsblatt Global|date=25 October 2016|first=Konrad|last=Fischer|access-date=23 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524004334/https://global.handelsblatt.com/finance/a-german-tax-haven-626845|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Neither the U.S. nor Germany have appeared on any tax haven lists by the main academic leaders in tax haven research, namely: [[James R. Hines Jr.]], [[Dhammika Dharmapala]] or [[Gabriel Zucman]].  There are no known cases of foreign firms executing [[tax inversion]]s to the U.S. or Germany for tax purposes, a basic characteristic of a [[corporate tax haven]].<ref name="bbb"/>

===Former tax havens===
* [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] formerly had a reputation as the only tax haven in the [[Middle East]]. However, this changed after the [[Intra Bank]] crash of 1966,<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945606-1,00.html|title =Lebanon: Election Under Fire|work =Time Magazine|date =17 May 1976|url-access =subscription|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930191003/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945606-1,00.html|archive-date =30 September 2007|url-status =live|df =dmy-all}}</ref> and the subsequent political and military deterioration of Lebanon dissuaded foreign use of the country as a tax haven.
* [[Liberia]] had a prosperous [[flag of convenience|ship registration industry]]. The series of violent and bloody [[First Liberian Civil War|civil wars]] in the 1990s and early 2000s severely damaged confidence in the country. The fact that the ship registration business still continues is partly a testament to its early success, and partly a testament to moving the national shipping registry to New York, United States.
* [[Tangier]] had a short existence as a tax haven in the period between the end of effective control by the Spanish in 1945 until it was formally reunited with [[Morocco]] in 1956.

Estimating the financial scale of tax havens is complicated by their inherent lack of transparency.<ref name=FDNS/>  Even jurisdictions that comply with OECD–transparency requirements such as Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, provide alternate secrecy tools (e.g. Trusts, [[QIAIF]]s and [[Unlimited company|ULL]]s).<ref name="james2"/>  For example, when the EU Commission discovered [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|Apple's tax rate in Ireland was 0.005%]], they found Apple's had used Irish ULLs to avoid filing Irish public accounts since the early 1990s.<ref name="eu1">{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases/253200/253200_1851004_674_2.pdf|title=COMMISSION DECISION of 30.8.2016 on STATE AID SA. 38373 (2014/C) (ex 2014/NN) (ex 2014/CP) implemented by Ireland to Apple|date=30 August 2016|publisher=[[EU Commission]]|quote=Brussels. 30.8.2016 C(2016) 5605 final.

Additionally, there is sometimes confusion between figures that focus on the ''amount of annual taxes'' lost due to tax havens (estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of USD), and figures that focus on the ''amount of capital'' residing in tax havens (estimated to be in the trillions of USD).<ref name="james2"/>

{{As of |March 2019}}, the most credible methods for estimating the financial scale have been:<ref name="james2"/>
{{ordered list|type=lower-roman
| Banking data.  Estimating the amount of capital in the private and/or offshore banking system through [[IMF]]–[[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]] bank filings; associated with several NGOs.

There have been many other "guesstimates" produced by NGOs which are either crude derivatives of the first method ("Banking data"), and are often criticised for taking mistaken interpretations and conclusions from aggregate global banking and financial data, to produce unsound estimates.<ref name="james2"/><ref name="Gordon & Morriss" />

In several research papers, [[James R.

===Promoters of growth===

A controversial area of research into tax havens is the suggestion that tax havens actually promote global economic growth by solving perceived issues in the tax regimes of higher-taxed nations (e.g. the above discussion on the U.S. "worldwide" tax system as an example).  Important academic leaders in tax haven research, such as Hines,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/tax-havens-and-treasure-hunts/|title=Tax havens and treasure hunts|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|quote=Some economists champion tax havens. In an article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives published last fall (also titled “Treasure Islands”), James R. Hines Jr. of the University of Michigan argued that they contribute to financial market competition, encourage investment in high-tax countries and promote economic growth.  Like many economists, Professor Hines expresses far more confidence in the market than in the state. He worries more about possible overtaxation than about undertaxation of corporate income. He does not engage with such concepts as “tax justice.”|date=11 April 2011|access-date=23 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812115602/https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/tax-havens-and-treasure-hunts/|archive-date=12 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Dharmapala,<ref name="dhh"/> and others,<ref name="praise"/> cite evidence that, in certain cases, tax havens appear to promote economic growth in higher-tax countries, and can support beneficial hybrid tax regimes of higher taxes on domestic activity, but lower taxes on international sourced capital or income:

{{quote|Tax havens change the nature of tax competition among other countries, very possibly permitting them to sustain high domestic tax rates that are effectively mitigated for mobile international investors whose transactions are routed through tax havens.

However, other notable tax academics strongly dispute these views, such as work by [[Joel Slemrod|Slemrod]] and Wilson, who in their {{slink|#Important papers on tax havens}}, label tax havens as ''parasitic'' to jurisdictions with normal tax regimes, that can damage their economies.<ref name="slemrod">{{cite journal|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/SlemrodWilson09.pdf|title=Tax competition with parasitic tax havens|date=6 September 2009|journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]]|author1=Joel Slemrod|author2=John D.

The boundaries with wider contested economic theories on the effects of corporate taxation on economic growth, and whether there should be corporate taxes, are easy to blur.

In 2019, non-academic groups, such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], realised the scale of U.S. corporate use of tax havens:

''Tax justice'' groups interpreted Hines' research as the U.S. engaging in tax competition with higher-tax nations (i.e. the U.S. exchequer earning excess taxes at the expense of others).  The 2017 TCJA seems to support this view with the U.S. exchequer being able to levy a 15.5% repatriation tax on over $1 trillion of untaxed offshore profits built up by U.S. multinationals with BEPS tools from non-U.S. revenues.  Had these U.S. multinationals paid taxes on these non-U.S. profits in the countries in which they were earned, there would have been the little further liability to U.S. taxation.  Research by Zucman and Wright (2018) estimated that most of the TCJA repatriation benefit went to the shareholders of U.S. multinationals, and not the U.S. exchequer.<ref name="zucwright"/>{{efn|Zucman and Wright's analysis assumed that U.S. multinationals were going to pay a U.S. 35% rate eventually (e.g. they would repatriate their untaxed offshore cash at some stage in the future); if the assumption is made that they were going to permanently leave their offshore cash outside of the U.S., then the U.S. exchequer was the main beneficiary}}

Even when a corporation executes a tax inversion to a tax haven, it also needs to ''shift'' (or [[earnings stripping|earnings strip]]) its untaxed profits to the new tax haven.<ref name="hallCBO"/>  These are called [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) techniques.<ref name="be"/>  Notable BEPS tools like the [[Double Irish]] with a [[Dutch Sandwich]] were used by US corporations to build up untaxed offshore cash reserves of US$1–2 trillion in tax havens like Bermuda (e.g. Apple's [[Bermuda Black Hole]]) from 2004–2017.<ref name=ThurmLinebaugh>{{cite news|title=More U.S. Profits Parked Abroad, Saving on Taxes|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324034804578348131432634740|access-date=19 March 2013|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=10 March 2013|author=Scott Thurm|author2=Kate Linebaugh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213023222/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324034804578348131432634740|archive-date=13 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  As discussed in {{slink|#Financial scale}}, in 2017, the OCED estimated that BEPS tools shielded US$100 to US$200 billion in annual corporate profits from tax; while in 2018, Zucman estimated that the figure was closer to US$250 billion per annum.  This was despite the 2012–2016 OECD BEPS Project.  In 2015, Apple executed the largest recorded BEPS transaction in history when it moved US$300 billion of its IP to Ireland, in what was called a hybrid-tax inversion.

The largest [[Base erosion and profit shifting#Tools|BEPS tools]] are the ones that use [[intellectual property]] (IP) accounting to ''shift'' profits between jurisdictions.  The concept of a corporation charging its costs from one jurisdiction against its profits in another jurisdiction (i.e. [[transfer pricing]]) is well understood and accepted.  However, IP enables a corporation to "revalue" its costs dramatically.  For example, a major piece of software might have cost US$1 billion to develop in salaries and overheads.  IP accounting enables the legal ownership of the software to be relocated to a tax haven where it can be revalued to being worth US$100 billion, which becomes the new price at which it is charged out against global profits.  This creates a ''shifting'' of all global profits back to the tax haven.  IP has been described as "the leading corporate tax avoidance vehicle".<ref name="ucla">{{cite journal | url=https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | page=4 | title=Intellectual Property Law Solutions to Tax Avoidance | journal=UCLA Law Review | volume=62 | issue=2 | date=2015 | author=Andrew Blair-Stanek | quote=Intellectual property (IP) has become the leading tax avoidance vehicle in the world today. | access-date=2 May 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232500/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | archive-date=16 March 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="fordam">{{cite web | url=http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | author=Ted Mulvany | title=Intellectual Property and Tax Avoidance in Ireland | publisher=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media & Entertainment Law Journal]] | date=30 August 2016 | access-date=27 April 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502112434/http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | archive-date=2 May 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Corporate tax haven===
{{Main|Corporate tax haven}}

Traditional tax havens, such as the Caribbean or Channel Island havens, are often clear about the tax-free nature of their status to individuals and corporates.  However, because of this, they are unable to sign full bilateral [[tax treaties]] with other higher-tax jurisdictions.  Instead, their tax treaties are restricted and limited so as to avoid the use of the tax haven (e.g. withholding taxes on transfers to the haven).  To solve this issue, other tax havens maintain higher non-zero "headline" rates of corporate taxation, but instead provide complex and confidential BEPS tools and PTRs which bring the "effective" corporate tax rate closer to zero; they all feature prominently in the leading jurisdictions for IP law (see graphic).  These "corporate tax havens" (or Conduit OFCs), further increase respectability by requiring the corporate using their BEPS tools/PTRs to main a "substantial presence" in the haven; this is called an [[Corporate tax haven#employment tax|employment tax]], and can cost the corporate circa 2–3% of revenues.   However, these initiatives enable the corporate tax haven to maintain large networks of full bilateral tax treaties, that allow corporates based in the haven to ''shift'' global untaxed profits back to the haven (and on to Sink OFCs, as shown above).  These "corporate tax havens" strongly deny any association with being a tax haven and maintain high levels of compliance and transparency, with many being OECD-whitelisted (and are OECD or EU members).  Many of the {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}} are "corporate tax haves".

===Conduits and Sinks===
{{Main|Conduit and Sink OFCs}}
In 2017, the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s [[CORPNET]] research group published the results of their multi-year [[big data]] analysis of over 98 million global corporate connections.  CORPNET ignored any prior definition of a tax haven or any legal or tax structuring concepts, to instead follow a purely quantitative approach.  CORPNET's results split the understanding of tax havens into [[Sink OFC]]s, which are traditional tax havens to which corporates route untaxed funds, and [[Conduit OFC]]s, which are the jurisdictions that create the OECD-compliant tax structures that enable the untaxed funds to be routed from the higher-tax jurisdictions to the Sink OFCs.  Despite following a purely quantitative approach, CORPNET's top 5 Conduit OFCs and top 5 Sink OFCs closely match the other academic {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}}.  CORPNET's Conduit OFCs contained several major jurisdictions considered OECD and/or EU tax havens, including the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Ireland.<ref name="xx"/><ref name="RTEconduit"/><ref name="WPaidan.regan"/>  Conduit OFCs are strongly correlated with modern "corporate tax havens" and Sink OFCs with the "traditional tax havens".

===Tax-free wrapper===
{{Main|Section 110 SPV|QIAIF}}
As well as corporate structures, tax havens also provide tax-free (or "tax neutral") legal wrappers for holding assets, also known as [[special purpose vehicles]] (SPVs) or [[special purpose companies]] (SPCs).<ref name="nicholas.shaxson"/>  These SPVs and SPCs are not only free of all taxes, duties, and VAT, but are tailored to the regulatory requirements, and the banking requirements of specific segments.<ref name="nicholas.shaxson"/>  For example, the zero-tax [[Section 110 SPV]] is a major wrapper in the global securitization market.<ref name="WPaidan.regan">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/25/ireland-is-tax-haven-thats-becoming-controversial-home/?noredirect=on|title=Ireland is a tax haven — and that's becoming controversial at home|author=Aidan Regan|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=25 April 2019|access-date=25 April 2019}}</ref>  This SPV offers features including [[orphan structures]], which is facilitated to support requirements for [[bankruptcy remote]]ness, which would not be allowed in larger [[financial centres]], as it could damage the local tax base, but are needed by banks in securitizations.

==Countermeasures==
The various countermeasures that higher-tax jurisdictions have taken against tax havens can be grouped into the following types:
* Transparency.  Actions that promote visibility into the entities operating within the tax haven, and including data and information sharing.
* Blacklists.  A coercive tool used by both the OECD and the EU to encourage cooperation by tax havens with their transparency initiatives.
* Specific. Sets of legislative and/or regulatory actions targeted at specifically identified issues regarding tax havens.
* Fundamental.  Where the higher-tax jurisdictions conduct a reform of their taxation systems to remove to incentives to use tax havens.

At the [[2009 G-20 London summit|London G20 summit]] on 2 April 2009, [[G20]] countries agreed to define a [[blacklist]] for tax havens, to be segmented according to a four-tier system, based on compliance with an "internationally agreed tax standard."<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-tax-havens|title= G20 declares door shut on tax havens|work= The Guardian|date= 2 April 2009|first1= Nicholas|last1= Watt|first2= Larry|last2= Elliott|first3= Julian|last3= Borger|first4= Ian|last4= Black|access-date= 13 December 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160721220651/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-tax-havens|archive-date= 21 July 2016|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The list as per 2 April 2009 can be viewed on the OECD website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/42497950.pdf |title=A Progress Report on The Jurisdictions Surveyed by The OECD Global Forum in Implementing The Internationally Agreed Tax Standard |date=2009-04-02 |publisher=OECD |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812004348/http://www.oecd.org/ctp/42497950.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The four tiers were:

# Those that have substantially implemented the standard (includes most countries but [[China]] still excludes [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]).
# Tax havens that have committed to – but not yet fully implemented – the standard (includes [[Montserrat]], [[Nauru]], [[Niue]], [[Panama]], and [[Vanuatu]])
# Financial centres that have committed to – but not yet fully implemented – the standard (includes [[Guatemala]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Uruguay]]).
# Those that have not committed to the standard (an empty category)

Those countries in the bottom tier were initially classified as being 'non-cooperative tax havens'. Uruguay was initially classified as being uncooperative. However, upon appeal the OECD stated that it did meet tax transparency rules and thus moved it up. The Philippines took steps to remove itself from the blacklist and [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Najib Razak]] had suggested earlier that Malaysia should not be in the bottom tier.<ref>{{cite news |title=OECD names and shames tax havens |work=BBC News |date=2009-04-03 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7980848.stm |access-date=2009-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404232656/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7980848.stm |archive-date=4 April 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===== Portugal =====
{{Main|Portugal's List of Tax Havens}}
Since the early 2000s [[Portugal]] has adopted a jurisdiction specific list of jurisdictions deemed as tax havens by the Government, associated to said list are a set of tax penalties on Portuguese resident taxpayers. Nevertheless, the list has been critiqued<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jm-madeira.pt/opinioes/ver/2761/Hipocrisia_Tributaria|title=Hipocrisia Tributária|date=2019-08-01|website=JM Madeira|language=pt-PT|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> for not being objective nor rational from an economic standpoint.

===Specific===
====Anti-inversion====
{{main|Tax inversion#Countermeasures}}
To prevent [[naked tax inversion]]s of US corporations to mostly Caribbean-type tax havens (e.g. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands), the US Congress added Regulation 7874 to the IRS code with the passing of the [[American Jobs Creation Act of 2004]].  While the legislation was effective, further US Treasury regulations were required in 2014–2016 to prevent the much larger [[merger tax inversion]]s, which culminated with the effective block of the proposed 2016 USD$160 billion of Pfizer-Allergan in Ireland.  Since these changes, there have been no further material US tax inversions.

====Anti-BEPS====
{{main|Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD project)}}
At the [[2012 G20 Los Cabos summit]], it was agreed that the OECD undertake a project to combat [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) activities by corporates.  An OECD BEPS [[Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting|Multilateral Instrument]], consisting of "15 Actions" designed to be implemented domestically and through bilateral tax treaty provisions, were agreed at the [[2015 G20 Antalya summit]].  The OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument ("MLI"), was adopted on 24 November 2016 and has since been signed by over 78 jurisdictions; it came into force in July 2018.  The MLI has been criticised for "watering down" several of its proposed initiatives, including country–by–country–reporting ("CbCr"), and for providing several opt-outs which several OECD and EU tax havens availed of.  The US did not sign the MLI.

====Anti-Double Irish====
{{main|Double Irish arrangement}}
The Double Irish was the largest BEPS tool in history which by 2015, was shielding over US$100 billion in mostly US corporate profits from US taxation.  When the EU Commission [[EU illegal State aid case against Apple in Ireland|fined Apple €13 billion for using an illegal hybrid-Double Irish structure]], their report noted that Apple had been using the structure from at least as far back as 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2014.369.01.0022.01.ENG&toc=OJ:C:2014:369:TOC|title=State aid SA.38373 (2014/C) (ex 2014/NN) — Alleged aid to Apple|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=14 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116115619/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2014.369.01.0022.01.ENG&toc=OJ:C:2014:369:TOC|archive-date=16 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Several Senate and Congressional inquiries in Washington cited public knowledge of the Double Irish from 2000 onwards.

====US====
The US followed a broadly similar reform to the UK with the passing of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (TCJA), which reduced the US headline corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, changed the US corporate tax code from a "worldwide tax system" to a hybrid-"territorial tax system", and created new IP-based BEPS tools such as the FDII tax, as well as other anti-BEPS tools such as the BEAT tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/treatment-foreign-profits-tax-cuts-jobs-act/|title=A Hybrid Approach: The Treatment of Foreign Profits under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|author=Kyle Pomerleau|date=3 May 2018|access-date=15 April 2019|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|quote=While lawmakers generally refer to the new system as a “territorial” tax system, it is more appropriately described as a hybrid system.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401141245/https://taxfoundation.org/treatment-foreign-profits-tax-cuts-jobs-act/|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="TF1">{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/inversions-new-tax-law/|title=Inversions under the new tax law|author=Kyle Pomerleau|date=13 March 2018|access-date=15 April 2019|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415120425/https://taxfoundation.org/inversions-new-tax-law/|archive-date=15 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In advocating for the TCJA, the President's [[Council of Economic Advisors]] (CEA) heavily relied on the work of academic [[James R. Hines Jr.]] on the US corporate use of tax havens and the likely responses of US corporations to the TCJA.<ref name="CRS2"/> Since the TCJA, Pfizer has guided global aggregate tax rates that are very similar to what they expected in their aborted 2016 inversion with Allergan plc in Ireland.

====OECD====
In January 2019, the OECD released a policy note regarding new proposals to combat the BEPS activities of multinationals, which commentators labeled "BEPS 2.0".  In its press release, the OECD announced its proposals had the backing of the U.S., as well as China, Brazil, and India.  The new proposals contain more fundamental reforms to corporate taxation around the taxing of profits where a product is consumed, rather than where the product's value is created (as currently done).  While the EU had been a long-term advocate of this concept, the US had traditionally blocked it.  However, it is believed the passing of the 2017 TCJA has changed Washington's view on US corporate use of tax havens, who still remain the largest users of tax havens in the world.  In response to this new OECD initiative, the EU, and the French in particular, dropped their "Digital Tax" proposal in favour of allowing the OECD BEPS 2.0 initiative reach a conclusion, which it is scheduled to do by 2020.

==History==
===General phases===
While areas of low taxation are recorded in Ancient Greece, tax academics identify what we know as tax havens as being a modern phenomenon,<ref name="ronen.palan2"/><ref name="sol.piccolo">{{cite book | author=Sol Piccolo | year=1992 | title=International Business Taxation | url=https://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Picciotto%201992%20International%20Business%20Taxation.pdf | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0899307770 | author-link=Sol Piccolo | access-date=23 April 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103035111/http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Picciotto%201992%20International%20Business%20Taxation.pdf | archive-date=3 January 2019 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and note the following phases in their development:

* ''19th Century New Jersey and Delaware Corporations''.  In the 1880s, New Jersey was in financial difficulty and the Governor, [[Leon Abbett]], backed a plan by a New York lawyer, Mr. Dill, to create a more liberal regime for establishing corporate structures, including availability "off-the-shelf companies" (but not non-resident companies).  Delaware followed with the ''General Incorporation Act in 1898'', on the basis of lobbying from other New York lawyers.  Because of the restrictive incorporation regime in the Anglo-Saxon world as a result of the [[South Sea Bubble]], New Jersey and Delaware were successful, and though not explicitly tax havens (e.g. US Federal and State taxes applied), many future tax havens would copy their "liberal" incorporation regimes.<ref name="ronen.palan2">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-of-tax-havens|title=History of Tax Havens|author=Ronen Palan|publisher=History & Policy|date=1 October 2009|access-date=23 April 2019|author-link=Ronen Palan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007200857/http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/history-of-tax-havens|archive-date=7 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
* ''Post World War I''.  The modern concept of a tax haven is generally accepted to have emerged at an uncertain point in the immediate aftermath of [[World War I]].<ref name="ronen.palan2"/><ref>"[T]he tax haven is a creature of the twentieth century, and began to be used extensively because of the high levels of tax which prevailed after the First World War" at para 26.1, ''Tolley's International Tax Planning'' (2002), {{ISBN|0-7545-1339-4}}</ref> [[Bermuda]] sometimes claims to have been the first tax haven based upon the creation of the first [[offshore company|offshore companies]] legislation in 1935 by the newly created law firm of [[Conyers Dill & Pearman]].<ref>See generally, Introduction to ''Tolley's International Initiatives Affecting Financial Havens'' (2001), {{ISBN|0-406-94264-1}}</ref> However most tax academics identify the Zurich-Zug-Liechtenstein triangle as the first "tax haven hub" created during the mid-1920s.<ref name="ronen.palan2"/><ref>The ''Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht'' of 20 January 1926</ref>  Liechtenstein's 1924 Civil Code created the infamous ''Anstalt'' corporate vehicle, while Zurich an Zug developed the ''Societé Anonyme'' and other [[Brass plate company|brass plate companies]].<ref name="ronen.palan2"/>   Tax academic [[Ronen Palan]] identifies two of the three major groups of tax havens, as emerging during this period:
:* ''British Empire-based tax havens''.  The 1929 court case of ''Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd. V. Todd'' in Britain created the "non-resident corporation" and recognised a British-registered company with no business activities in Britain is not liable to British taxation. Tax academic [[Sol Picciotto]] noted the creation of such "non-resident" companies was "a loophole which, in a sense, made Britain a tax haven".  The ruling applied to the British Empire, including Bermuda, Barbados, and The Cayman Islands.<ref name="ronen.palan"/><ref name="sol.piccolo"/>
:* ''European-based tax havens''. The Zurich-Zug-Litchenstien triangle expanded and was joined by Luxembourg in 1929 when they created tax-free ''holding companies''.<ref name="ronen.palan2"/>  However in 1934, as a reaction to the global depression, the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 put bank secrecy under Swiss criminal law.<ref name="ronen.palan"/>  Secrecy and privacy would become an important and distinctive part of the European-based tax havens, in comparison with other tax havens.<ref name="sol.piccolo"/>

* ''Post World War II Offshore financial centres''.  Currency controls enacted post World War II led to the creation of the Eurodollar market and the rise in [[offshore financial centre]]s (OFCs).<ref name="imf"/>  Many of these OFCs were traditional tax havens from the Post World War I phase, including The Caymans and Bermuda, however new centres such as Hong Kong, and Singapore began to emerge.<ref name="imf"/>  London's position as a global [[financial centre]] for these OFCs was secured when the [[Bank of England]] ruled in 1957 that transactions executed by UK banks on behalf of a lender and borrower who were not located in the UK, were not to be officially viewed as having taken place in the UK for regulatory or tax purposes, even though the transaction was only ever recorded as taking place in London.<ref name="ronen.palan"/><ref name="sol.piccolo"/><ref name="eurodollar">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world|title=The real Goldfinger: the London banker who broke the world|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 September 2017|access-date=23 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331045225/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/07/the-real-goldfinger-the-london-banker-who-broke-the-world|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The rise of OFCs would continue so that by 2008, The Cayman Islands would be the 4th largest financial centre in the world, while Singapore and Hong Kong had become major [[Financial centre|Regional Financial Centre]]s (RFCs).<ref name="ronen.palan"/>  By 2010, tax academics would consider OFCs to be synonymous with tax havens, and that most of their services involved taxation.<ref name="missing profits"/><ref name="nicholas.shaxson"/>
* ''Emerging economy-based tax havens''.  As well as the dramatic rise in OFCs, from the late 1960s onwards, new tax havens began to emerge to service developing and emerging markets, which became Palan's third group.  The first Pacific tax haven was [[Norfolk Island]] (1966), a self-governing external territory of Australia.  It was followed by Vanuatu (1970–71), Nauru (1972), the Cook Islands (1981), Tonga (1984), Samoa (1988), the Marshall Islands (1990), and Nauru (1994).<ref name="ronen.palan2"/>  All these havens introduced familiar legislation modeled on the successful British Empire and European tax havens, including near-zero taxation for exempt companies, and non-residential companies, Swiss-style bank secrecy laws, trust companies laws, offshore insurance laws, flags of convenience for shipping fleets and aircraft leasing, and beneficial regulations for new online services (e.g. gambling, pornography, etc.).<ref name="ronen.palan"/><ref name="jason">{{cite book|title=Havens in a Storm: The Struggle for Global Tax Regulation|author=Jason Sharman|year=2006|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|pages=224|jstor=10.7591/j.ctt7z6jm|chapter=The Struggle for Global Tax Regulation|isbn=9780801445040}}</ref>
* ''Corporate-focused tax havens''.  In 1981, the US IRS published the ''Gordon Report'' on the use of tax havens by US taxpayers, which highlighted the use by tax havens by US corporations.<ref name="gordon2"/>  In 1983, US corporation McDermott International executed the first [[tax inversion]] to Panama.<ref name="hallCBO"/>  The EU Commission showed that Apple Inc. had begun to use the infamous [[Double Irish]] BEPS tool as early as 1991.  US tax academic [[James R. Hines Jr.]] showed in 1994 that US corporations were achieving effective rates of taxation of circa 4% in corporate-focused OECD tax havens like Ireland.<ref name="h3"/>  When in 2004, the US Congress stopped "naked tax inversions" by US corporations to Caribbean tax havens with the introduction of IRS Regulation 7874, a much larger wave of US corporate "merger inversions" started that involved moving to OECD tax havens.<ref name="hallCBO"/>  A new class of corporate tax haven had emerged that was OECD-compliant, transparent, but offered complex [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tools that could achieve net tax rates similar to traditional tax havens.<ref name="jason"/><ref name="nicholas.shaxson"/>  Initiatives by the OECD to curb tax havens would mainly impact Palan's third group of ''Emerging economy-based tax havens'', however, the corporate-focused tax havens were drawn from the largest OFCs that had emerged from the ''British Empire-based tax havens'' and ''European-based tax havens'', and included the Netherlands, Singapore, Ireland, and the U.K., and even reformed traditional tax havens such as Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the Caribbean (the Cayman, Bermuda, and the British Virgin Islands) and Switzerland.<ref name="nicholas.shaxson"/>  The scale of their BEPS activities meant that this group of 10 jurisdictions would dominate academic tax haven lists from 2010, including [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|Hines' 2010 list]], the [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit and Sink OFC 2017 list]], and [[Gabriel Zucman#Tørsløv-Wier-Zucman 2018 list|Zucman's 2018 list]].

===Notable events===
* 1929. British Courts rule in ''Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Co. Ltd. V. Todd.'' that a British-registered company with no business activities in Britain is not liable to British taxation. [[Sol Picciotto]] noted the creation of such "non-resident" companies was "a loophole which, in a sense, made Britain a tax haven".  The ruling applied to the British Empire, including Bermuda, Barbados, and The Cayman Islands.<ref name="ronen.palan"/>
* 1934. As a reaction to the global depression, the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 put bank secrecy under Swiss criminal law. The law required "absolute silence in respect to a professional secret" (i.e. accounts in Swiss banks).  "Absolute" means protection from any government, including the Swiss. The law even made inquiry or research into the "trade secrets" of Swiss banks, a criminal offense.<ref name="ronen.palan"/>
* 1981. The US Treasury and the US Attorney General are given: ''Tax havens and their use by United States taxpayers: An Overview'' by Richard A. Gordon Special Counsel for International Taxation at the IRS.  The Gordon Report identifies new types of ''corporate'' tax havens such as Ireland (described as a ''manufacturing tax haven'').<ref name="gordon2">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/taxhavenstheirus01gord|title=Tax Havens and their use by United States Taxpayers, An Overview|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|date=12 January 1981|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527103008/https://archive.org/details/taxhavenstheirus01gord|archive-date=27 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
* 1983. The first officially recognized US corporate [[tax inversion]] as [[McDermott International]] moves from [[Texas]] to tax haven, Panama.<ref name="bloomberg1"/><ref name="hallCBO"/>
* 1994. [[James R. Hines Jr.]] publishes the important [[James R. Hines Jr.#Tax haven research|Hines–Rice paper]], producing the first academic list of 41 tax havens, including 7 ''major tax havens''.  The Hines-Rice paper used the term ''profit shifting'', and showed that while many tax havens had higher ''headline'' tax rates, their ''effective'' tax rates were much lower.  Hines shows that the US is a major user of tax havens.<ref name="h3"/>
* 2000.  The OECD produces its first formal list of 35 tax havens who have met two of three OECD ''[[#OECD–IMF non-quantitative (1998–2002)|Criteria]]''; none of the existing 35 OECD members, or EU–28 members, were listed as tax havens.<ref name="OECDh"/>  By 2008, only Trinidad & Tobago met the OECD's Criteria to be a tax haven.<ref name="fttt"/>  Academics start using the terms "OECD tax havens" and "EU tax havens".
* 2000.  The [[Financial Stability Forum|FSF]]–[[IMF]] define an [[offshore financial centre]] (OFC) with a list of [[Offshore financial centre#FSF–IMF 2000 list|42–46 OFCs]] using a qualitative list of criteria;<ref name="IMF2000Paper"/> in 2007, the IMF produced a revised quantitative-based list of [[Offshore financial centre#IMF 2007 list|22 OFCs]],<ref name="imf"/> and in 2018, another revised quantitative-based list of [[Offshore financial centre#IMF 2018 list|8 major OFCs]], who are responsible for 85% of OFC financial flows.<ref name="imfx"/> By 2010, tax academics consider [[Offshore financial centre#Link to Tax Havens|OFCs and tax havens as synonymous]].<ref name="missing profits"/> 
* 2004.  US Congress passes the [[American Jobs Creation Act of 2004]] (AJCA) with IRS Section 7874 that effectively ends [[naked inversion]]s by US corporations to Caribbean tax havens.<ref name="hallCBO"/>
* 2009. The [[Tax Justice Network]] introduced the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] ("FSI") and the term "secrecy jurisdiction",<ref name="tjn10"/> to highlight issues in regard to OECD-compliant countries who have high tax rates and do not appear on academic lists of tax havens, but have transparency issues.
* 2010. [[James R. Hines Jr.]] publishes a list of [[James R. Hines Jr.#Hines 2010 list|52 tax havens]], and unlike all past tax haven lists, were scaled quantitatively by analysing corporate investment flows.<ref name="h1"/> The Hines 2010 list was the first to estimate the ten largest global tax havens, only two of which, Jersey and the British Virgin Isles, were on the OECD's 2000 list.<ref name="h1"/>
* 2015. [[Medtronic]] completes the largest tax inversion in history in a US$48 billion merger with [[Covidien plc]] in Ireland, while [[Apple Inc.]] complete the largest hybrid-tax inversion in history moving US$300 billion of [[intellectual property]] to Ireland (called [[leprechaun economics]]); by 2016, the US Treasury tighten the inversion rules, causing Pfizer to abort their US$160 billion merger with [[Allergan plc]].<ref name="hallCBO"/> 
* 2017. The [[University of Amsterdam]]'s CORPNET group using on a purely quantitive approach, splits the understanding of OFCs into [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]] and [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFCs]].  CORPNET's lists of top five Conduit OFCs and top five Sink OFCs, matched 9 of the top 10 havens in Hines' 2010 list, only differing in the United Kingdom, which only [[Corporate haven#U.K. transformation|transformed their tax code in 2009–12]].<ref name="uk1"/><ref name="xx"/>
* 2017. The [[EU Commission]] produces its first formal list of tax havens with 17 countries on its 2017 blacklist and 47 on its 2017 greylist;<ref name="eu havens"/> however, as with the previous 2010 OECD list, none of the jurisdictions are OECD or EU–28 countries, nor are they in the list of {{slink|#Top 10 tax havens}}.<ref name="ced"/><ref name="ft.com"/>
* 2018. Tax academic [[Gabriel Zucman]] (''et alia'') estimates ''aggregate'' corporate "profit shifting" (i.e. [[BEPS]]) is shielding over US$250 billion per year from taxes.<ref name="zucwsj"/><ref name="gbz"/>  Zucman's 2018 list of top 10 havens matched 9 of the top 10 havens in Hines' 2010 list, but with Ireland as the largest global haven.<ref name="zux"/>  Zucman shows that US corporations are almost half of all profits shifted.<ref name="zucwright"/><ref name="japantimes"/><ref name="zucwsj2"/><ref name="zucbi"/>
* 2019.  [[European Parliament]] votes to accept a report by 505 votes in favour to 63 against, identifying five "EU tax havens" that should be included on the [[EU Commission]] list of tax havens.{{efn | The [[European Parliament]] vote is not binding on the [[EU Commission]] to formally include these "EU tax havens" in the official EU list of tax havens (blacklist or greylist); to be binding, it must be a unanimous vote by all member states.<ref name="dutchnl"/>}}<ref name="Simon Bowers"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/is-ireland-a-tax-haven-european-parliament-says-yes-1.3841668?mode=sample&auth-failed=1&pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fis-ireland-a-tax-haven-european-parliament-says-yes-1.3841668|title=Is Ireland a tax haven?
