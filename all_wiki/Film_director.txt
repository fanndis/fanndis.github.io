A '''film director''' controls a [[film]]'s artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the [[screenplay]] (or script) while guiding the [[technical crew]] and [[actor]]s in the fulfilment of that [[Goal|vision]]. The director has a key role in choosing the [[Casting (performing arts)|cast members]], production design and all the creative aspects of [[filmmaking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://careertrend.com/average-film-director-salary-per-movie-7732.html|title=The Average Film Director Salary Per Movie|last=Bean-Mellinger|first=Barbara|date=December 27, 2018|website=Career Trend|publisher=[[Leaf Group]]|accessdate=February 28, 2019}}</ref> Under [[European Union law]], the director is viewed as the [[auteur|author]] of the film.<ref name="Kamina2002">{{cite book|author=Pascal Kamina|title=Film Copyright in the European Union|url=https://archive.org/details/filmcopyrightine0000kami|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43338-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/filmcopyrightine0000kami/page/153 153]}}</ref>

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the [[budget]].

There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[Film producer|producers]], [[Film editing|film editors]] or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some [[Outline (list)|outline]] a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films or compose the music score for their films.<ref name="career">{{cite web|title=TV or film director|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-director|website=National Careers Service|publisher=British Government|accessdate=May 10, 2017|location=[[United Kingdom]]|date=April 2017}}</ref>

Because the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict-resolution skills to mediate whenever necessary.<ref>{{cite news |title=I Want Your Job: Film Director |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/i-want-your-job-film-director-480500.html|accessdate=March 3, 2013 | location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alex |last=McRae |date=June 1, 2006|quote=You have to be a diplomat.

Generally, the sole superiors of the director are the [[Film producer|producers]] and the studio that is financing the film, although sometimes the director can also be a producer of the same film.<ref name="Film schools"/><ref>{{cite web|title=What Producers and Directors Do|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/producers-and-directors.htm#tab-2|website=[[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|accessdate=February 28, 2019|quote=Although directors are in charge of the creative aspects of a show, they ultimately answer to producers.

Directors also play an important role in [[post-production]]. While the film is still in production, the director sends "[[dailies]]" to the [[Film editing|film editor]] and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an [[editor's cut]]. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the [[director's cut]]. Well-established directors have the "[[final cut privilege]]", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.

The director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every [[Filmmaking#Stages of production|stage of film production]]. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.<ref name="Princeton">{{cite web|title=Film Director|url=https://www.princetonreview.com/careers/65/film-director|website=[[Princeton Review]]|accessdate=February 28, 2019}}</ref> It has been said that "20-hour days are not unusual".<ref name="Film schools"/> Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.

Under [[European Union]] law, the film director is considered the "author" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of [[auteur|auteur theory]].<ref name="Kamina2002"/> Auteur theory is a [[film criticism]] concept that holds that a film director's [[film]] reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the [[French language|French]] word for "author").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|title=Auteur theory {{!}} Definition & Directors|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2018-02-08|language=en}}</ref> In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.

==Career pathways==
Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[Film editing|film editors]], [[Film producer|producer]]s, [[actor]]s, or [[Film criticism|film critics]], as well as directing for similar media like television and commercials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Director: Occupations in Alberta|url=https://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/occupations-in-alberta/occupation-profiles/film-director/|website=Alberta Learning Information Service (ALIS)|publisher=[[Politics of Alberta|Government of Alberta]]|accessdate=February 28, 2019|quote=Many are experienced actors, editors or writers}}</ref><ref name="wexman">{{cite book |last=Wexman |first=Virginia Wright |date=2017 |title=Directing |location=New Brunswick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=7 |isbn=9780813564296}}</ref> Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the Coen brothers' DP; [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s three Batman films made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]'' (2014).
