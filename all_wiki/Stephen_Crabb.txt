In 2016, Crabb was briefly [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]].  He has previously been a government [[Whip (politics)|whip]], a junior minister for [[Wales]] and the [[Secretary of State for Wales]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-19495797 |publisher=BBC News |title=The reshuffle: twist in the tail |date=5 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-19495871 |publisher=BBC News |title=MP Stephen Crabb wins Wales Office promotion |date=5 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-19499236 |publisher=BBC News |title=Stephen Crabb MP on his new job in Wales Office |date=6 September 2012}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Although born in [[Inverness]], to a Scottish mother, Crabb's upbringing was mostly in [[Haverfordwest]], the county town of [[Pembrokeshire]] in [[Wales]].

His father began claiming long-term sickness benefit – known then as [[Incapacity Benefit#History of Incapacity Benefit|Invalidity Benefit]] – the year before Crabb was born.<ref name=tele26032016>{{cite news |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=26 March 2016 |title=From council house to cabinet: the unlikely childhood of Stephen Crabb |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12204410/From-council-house-to-Cabinet-the-unlikely-childhood-of-Stephen-Crabb.html}}</ref> His mother separated from his father when Crabb was eight years old.<ref name="meetthetorieswelshwizard">{{cite news |last1=Hardman |first1=Isabel |title=Meet the Tories' Welsh Wizard: an interview with Stephen Crabb |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/07/meet-the-tories-welsh-wizard-an-interview-with-stephen-crabb/ |accessdate=19 March 2016 |work=[[The Spectator]] |location= London |date=18 July 2015}}</ref> She raised him and his two brothers on a council estate, living on benefits and receiving help from family, friends and the Baptist church.<ref>{{cite news |title= Stephen Crabb to be Welsh secretary |last=Mason|first= Rowena |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/15/stephen-crabb-new-welsh-secretary |accessdate=15 July 2014 |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=15 July 2014}}</ref>

Crabb has said that his early experiences informed his views on welfare: "The most powerful thing to me, looking back, is the way that my mother went through a crisis in her life and became welfare-dependent. She started working just a few hours each week, increasing her hours and then moving to a position where with extra training she was able to move into full-time work, become a car owner, and reach full economic independence."<ref name="Indie mini bio">{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/stephen-crabb-the-welsh-mp-and-new-work-and-pensions-secretary-who-once-worked-as-a-labourer-a6940991.html |title=Stephen Crabb profile: How a working-class boy rose through Tory ranks to become Work and Pensions Secretary |work=The Independent |location= London |date=19 March 2016 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="Crabb crunching">{{cite web|date=26 February 2015 |publisher=PoliticsHome.com |title=Crabb crunching |url= https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/house/71652/crabb-crunching}}</ref> He also said: "I was brought up in a home where a huge amount of emphasis was put on work...so work and education as routes out of poverty were drummed into us".<ref name="Crabb crunching"/>

Crabb was educated at local primary schools. From 1984 to 1991 he attended [[Tasker Milward VC School|Tasker Milward School]] in Haverfordwest, created in 1978 after the closure of a former boys' grammar school and the local girls school, and which was a [[voluntary controlled school]].<ref name="About Stephen">{{cite web|title=About Stephen |url=http://www.stephencrabb.com/About-Stephen/About-Stephen.aspx |website=stephencrabb.com |access-date=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717090752/http://www.stephencrabb.com/About-Stephen/About-Stephen.aspx |archive-date=17 July 2014 }}</ref> He has said the education there was "second to none...I tasted [the] very best of what a state education can provide".<ref name="Crabb crunching"/>

Crabb went on to study politics at the [[University of Bristol]] and graduated in 1995. He joined the Conservative Party after graduating from university.<ref name="Crabb crunching"/> Later, he gained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] at the [[London Business School]].<ref name="About Stephen"/><ref name="Stephen Crabb Secretary of State for Wales"/>

==Early career==
Upon graduating from university, Crabb took an unpaid post as a [[Christian Action Research and Education]] parliamentary intern.<ref name="Tele1">{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1975933/Christian-fundamentalists-fighting-spiritual-battle-in-Parliament.html |title=Christian fundamentalists fighting spiritual battle in Parliament |last=Modell |first=David |date=18 May 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=20 May 2009 |location=London}}</ref>

In 1996, he became the Parliamentary Affairs Officer for the [[National Council for Voluntary Youth Services]]. In 1998, he served as an [[election monitoring|election monitor]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and started working as a policy manager at the [[London Chamber of Commerce & Industry|London Chamber of Commerce]].<ref name="Debretts"/> In 2002, he became a marketing consultant.<ref name="Stephen Crabb Secretary of State for Wales" />

In 1998, whilst living in London, Crabb was elected as the chairman of the [[North Southwark and Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark North and Bermondsey]] Conservative Association, a position he held until 2000.<ref name="Debretts">{{cite web|title=Stephen Crabb|url=http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/29463/Stephen-CRABB|website=Debrett's People of Today|publisher=Debrett's|access-date=19 March 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401153327/http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/29463/Stephen-CRABB|archive-date=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Parliamentary career==
Crabb stood for Parliament in the constituency where he grew up, [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]], in 2001. He finished in second place, but at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], he gained the seat from Labour with a majority of 607 votes, becoming one of three Welsh Conservative MPs who ended the "Tory free zone" that had existed in Wales since 1997. Crabb was the youngest member of the 2005 Conservative intake.<ref name="Stephen Crabb Secretary of State for Wales">{{cite press release |title= Stephen Crabb MP appointed Secretary of State for Wales |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/news/stephen-crabb-mp-appointed-secretary-of-state-for-wales |publisher= Wales Office |date=15 July 2014}}</ref> He made his [[maiden speech]] on 25 May 2005.<ref name="Maiden">{{cite journal|title=Oral Answers to Questions (25 May 2005) |journal=Hansard |volume=434 |issue=79 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050525/debtext/50525-21.htm#50525-21_spnew0 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222145604/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050525/debtext/50525-21.htm |archive-date=22 December 2015 }}</ref>

At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Crabb retained his seat with a majority of 4,605 votes, and 42.79% of the vote.<ref name="Stephen Crabb UK Parliament">{{cite web|title=Stephen Crabb MP|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/stephen-crabb/1554|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election on 7 May 2015]], Crabb retained his seat with a majority of 4,969 votes and 40.4% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|title=Preseli Pembrokeshire 2015 Results |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/W07000065 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |publisher=BBC News |date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

===Backbench career===
In 2010, Crabb chaired the cross-party group for Democracy in Burma and was patron of the [[Burma Campaign UK]].<ref name="wdtburma">{{cite news |title=Burmese campaigner joins Stephen Crabb on his election campaign |url= http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/8107919.Stephen_Crabb_welcomes_Burmese_campaigner_to_Pembrokeshire/ |accessdate=26 March 2016 |work=[[Western Telegraph]] |location= Haverfordwest |date=19 April 2010}}</ref> The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] website describes Crabb as someone who "takes a strong interest in international development and believes firmly in the importance of UK aid". From 2010 until 2012, he led the Conservative Party's Project Umubano, which works in [[Rwanda]] and [[Sierra Leone]].<ref name="Stephen Crabb - Conservative" />

Crabb has served on the [[Welsh Affairs Select Committee]], the [[International Development Select Committee]] and the [[Treasury Select Committee]]. He was appointed to the Conservative front bench in 2009 as Junior Whip; when the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition was elected in 2010, Crabb was made Assistant Government Whip.<ref name="Stephen Crabb - Conservative">{{cite web |title=Stephen Crabb |url= http://www.conservatives.com/OurTeam/Members_of_Parliament/Crabb_Stephen.aspx |publisher=The Conservative Party |accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>

====MPs' expenses scandal====
During the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 parliamentary expenses scandal]], it was reported that Crabb had claimed £8,049 for refurbishments to his flat in London that was carried out from July 2006. He sold the flat the following year and switched his second home expenses to the house he had recently bought for his family in Pembrokeshire, allowing him to claim back £9,300 in stamp duty and £1,325 a month in mortgage interest for almost a year while designating another London flat he was renting with a fellow MP as his main home. Crabb said in response: "I haven't claimed for things like plasma TVs, even though the rules allow it. My claims were always within the letter and the spirit of the rules".<ref>"{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5318954/Stephen-Crabb-nominates-fellow-MPs-flat-as-main-home-MPs-expenses.html |title=Stephen Crabb nominates fellow MP's flat as main home: MPs' expenses |last=Swaine |first=Jon |date=14 May 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=19 March 2016 |location=London}}</ref>

===Junior minister in the Wales Office===
In 2012, Crabb was promoted to [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for Wales and became a [[Lord Commissioner of Treasury|Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury]], meaning he was a government minister and a government whip at the same time, which the BBC said had led to "political pundits and opposition politicians scratching their heads".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-19497621 | publisher=BBC News | title=The unexpected Wales Office call for Baroness Randerson | date=5 September 2012}}</ref> Labour's [[Owen Smith (politician)|Owen Smith]], whose parliamentary career has mirrored that of Crabb, called the arrangement "highly unusual and unsatisfactory", adding, "it's unheard of to have a whip also acting as a minister in a department".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Wales Online|title=Reshuffle: Jenny Randerson and Stephen Crabb join Wales Office|date=5 September 2012|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/reshuffle-jenny-randerson-stephen-crabb-2023626}}</ref>

At the [[Office of the Secretary of State for Wales|Wales Office]], Crabb worked on maintaining the competitiveness of Wales' energy-intensive industries in the face of high energy costs.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/news/stephen-crabb-lowering-energy-costs-vital-for-international-competitiveness-of-uk-manufacturing |publisher=Wales Office |title=Stephen Crabb: "Lowering energy costs vital for international competitiveness of UK manufacturing|date=27 March 2014 |accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref> In the 2014 Spring Budget, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] announced that the British government would compensate energy-intensive industries hit hard by the rising cost of energy.<ref>{{cite news| first=Graham|last= Henry |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/budget-2014-what-george-osbornes-6851158 | work=Wales Online | title=Budget 2014: What will George Osborne's Budget statement mean for Wales?  | date=19 March 2014}}</ref>

Crabb was named 'Member to Watch' in the Welsh Yearbook Political Awards 2012. His citation read: {{quote|He's recently emerged from the shadowy world of the whips' office at Westminster to become the Welsh Secretary's deputy in the Commons.

===Secretary of State for Wales===
In the [[2014 United Kingdom Cabinet reshuffle|reshuffle of July 2014]], Crabb was promoted to [[Secretary of State for Wales]] and joined the Cabinet.<ref name="Stephen Crabb UK Parliament" /> One of his first acts as Welsh Secretary was to abandon his taxpayer subsidised car in favour of public transport.<ref>{{cite news| first=Steffan |last=Rhys |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/welsh-secretary-stephen-crabb-scraps-7461404 | work=Wales Online | title=No Jags: New Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb scraps Jaguar on first day | date=20 July 2014}}</ref> He has said his proudest moment in the post was brokering a deal between the Treasury and the devolved Welsh government to extend the electrification of the [[Great Western Main Line]] to Swansea and [[South Wales Valleys|The Valleys]].<ref name="Crabb crunching"/>

Crabb remained in the job after the post-general election cabinet reshuffle held on 11 May 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title= Election 2015:Stephen Crabb to remain as Welsh Secretary |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32681095 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |publisher=BBC News |date=11 May 2015}}</ref> He welcomed the impact of [[Iain Duncan Smith]]'s welfare reforms in Wales, saying: "We can't go soft on [[welfare reform]] in a place like Wales – it's precisely the place that needs it."<ref name="Indie mini bio"/>

====Cuts to sickness benefits====
On 2 March 2016, Crabb voted with the government to reduce by £30 per week the amount of [[Employment and Support Allowance]] (ESA) paid to disabled people newly placed in the cohort of recipients known as the work-related activity group from April 2017.<ref name="How they">{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/see-how-your-mp-voted-10988939 |title=See how your MP voted on controversial cuts to ESA disability benefits |work=Wales Online |date=4 March 2016 |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> Crabb's constituency office was vandalised afterwards, with graffiti asking: "Why do you hate the sick?" seen on its facade on 12 March.<ref name=Pembrokeshire>{{cite web|url=http://www.pembrokeshire-herald.com/22732/22732/|title=Haverfordwest: Stephen Crabb MP's office vandalised following controversial vote|work=The Pembrokeshire Herald – Pembrokeshire's News|accessdate=19 March 2016|date=13 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milfordmercury.co.uk/news/pembrokeshire_news/14344286.Tory_MP_s_office_vandalised_after_controversial_Parliament_vote/|title=Tory MP's office vandalised after controversial Parliament vote|work=Milford Mercury|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4717893.ece |title=Calls for Crabb to quit charity role |work=The Times |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref>

In a statement about the outcome of the vote issued on 14 March, Crabb explained: "What this actually means is that those individuals who are considered to be able to work in the future will now access the same level of benefit as those on Jobseekers Allowance, but will be given better-tailored support to help them into employment. It doesn't affect those already claiming ESA. Of course, we are protecting those that are 'too ill to work'. There is no question about that."<ref name=Pembrokeshire/> Three days later, Crabb claimed on his [[Facebook]] page that "only those who are fit to work and actively seeking work are included in the work-related activity group".<ref name="Guardian WRAG">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/crabb-under-pressure-over-support-for-cut-disability-aid |title=Stephen Crabb under pressure over support for cut in disability aid |work=The Guardian |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> His post had to be amended: [[Work Capability Assessment|the work-related activity group]] contains ESA claimants deemed 'too ill to work' but capable of participating in work-related activities, such as job-coaching and pre-employment training, who are assessed as likely to work within two years, not immediately.

The following week, [[Debbie Abrahams]] MP, Labour's spokesperson on disabilities, said: "It doesn't bode well for David Cameron that the man he chooses to make the new work and pensions secretary doesn't even know the status of people in the ESA WRAG", while Jonathan Portes, a former DWP chief economist and an expert on welfare policy, was puzzled that Crabb, as a Cabinet Minister, could vote on important changes to ESA while appearing to be confused about what the vote was about.<ref name="Guardian WRAG"/>

===Secretary of State for Work and Pensions===
On 19 March 2016, Crabb was appointed to succeed [[Iain Duncan Smith]] as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] following the latter's sudden, unexpected resignation over proposed changes to the [[Personal Independence Payment]] (PIP), a disability benefit unrelated to the employment status of the claimant. In his first parliamentary statement as Welfare Secretary, Crabb said that the Government "will not be going ahead with the changes to PIP that were put forward. We have no further plans to make welfare savings beyond the very substantial savings legislated for by parliament two weeks ago [cuts to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)] which we will now focus on implementing."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35863776 |title=Stephen Crabb: 'No further plans' for welfare cuts |publisher=BBC News |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CCbcA8OXV0 |title=Stephen Crabb announces disability benefits cuts U-turn (subtitled) |publisher=ITV News (via YouTube) |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref>

Shortly after being appointed, he outlined his views on social security: "Every party should want to see welfare spending come down. That should be an aspiration for all of us because what you're saying is we are working towards a society where there are fewer people caught in dependency, fewer people who are out of work and need that intervention from the state." He also said: "You have always got to handle issues of welfare with care because you are dealing with support mechanisms for Britain's most vulnerable people".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/03/what-the-new-work-and-pensions-secretary-stephen-crabb-thinks-about-welfare-reform/ |work=The Spectator |location= London |title=Stephen Crabb: how my mother inspired my vision of welfare reform |date=19 March 2016 |accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref>

In early April 2016, Crabb gave an interview where he was critical of ESA and its eligibility test. He said: "ESA was a benefit the previous Labour government brought in when they brought in [[Work Capability Assessment]]s (WCA) and the truth is it's never worked like it was intended. The WCA was a mess, it didn't recognise mental health issues and it didn't recognise other types of disability".<ref>{{cite news| date=7 April 2016 |first=Sam |last=Kurtz |work=Western Telegraph |title=Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Stephen Crabb on his new job, 'gay cure claims' and the bedroom tax |location= Haverfordwest |url= http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/14410614.EXCLUSIVE_INTERVIEW__Stephen_Crabb_MP___I_do_not_and_have_never_believed_in_gay_cure_therapy_/}}</ref>

Crabb promised to create a £100&nbsp;billion "Growing Britain Fund", which he would use for flood defences, [[Fiber-optic communication|fibre-optic]] [[broadband]], and [[Crossrail 2]]. He hoped to finance this through new government bonds, because "the cost of borrowing is incredibly low. Spending government money on infrastructure has therefore never been more affordable".<ref name="BBC News £100bn 2016">{{cite web | title=Tory contender Stephen Crabb pledges £100bn fund | website=BBC News | date=4 July 2016 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36700080 | accessdate=4 July 2016}}</ref> He also said he would: allow the [[Expansion of Heathrow Airport#Third runway and sixth terminal|third runway at Heathrow to go ahead]];<ref name="Evening Standard leadership 2016">{{cite web |title=Stephen Crabb: I'd give go-ahead for third runway at Heathrow |website=Evening Standard |date=4 July 2016 | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/stephen-crabb-i-d-give-goahead-for-third-runway-at-heathrow-a3287356.html |accessdate=4 July 2016 |last=Murphy |first=Joe}}</ref> create an advisory council with members from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London to help with negotiations with the EU; and not hold a [[snap election]] nor a second EU referendum.<ref name="BBC News Snap Election 2016">{{cite web |title=Stephen Crabb: No snap election if I am new Tory leader |website=BBC News |date=29 June 2016 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-36659421 |accessdate=4 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="Irish Hughes 2016">{{cite web |last=Hughes |first=David |title=Stephen Crabb first senior Tory to launch leadership bid |website=Irish Examiner |date=30 June 2016 |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/stephen-crabb-first-senior-tory-to-launch-leadership-bid-407636.html |accessdate=4 July 2016}}</ref>
