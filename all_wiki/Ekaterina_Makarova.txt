With a chance to complete her set of having reached at least the quarterfinals at all four Majors, she lost to [[2008 French Open|former champion]] Ana Ivanovic in three sets, and thus failed to reach her first French Open quarterfinal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/french-open-winner-ivanovic-moves-quarters-150531141247241.html |title=French Open: Former winner Ivanovic moves into quarters |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=31 May 2015 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>

Makarova and Vesnina became runners-up at [[2015 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], losing to Hingis and Mirza in three sets, after leading 5–3 in the last set.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/11/martina-hingis-sania-mirza-win-wimbledon-womens-doubles-final |title=Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza win Wimbledon women's doubles final |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Tim Lewis |date=11 July 2015 |accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> In singles, Makarova surprisingly lost to [[Magdaléna Rybáriková]] in the second round.

===2016: Olympic champion, WTA Finals doubles champion===
In January, Makarova took a break in doubles and started the 2016 season in the Premier tournaments [[2016 Brisbane International|Brisbane]] and [[2016 Apia International Sydney|Sydney]], reaching the second round and quarterfinals, respectively. In the [[2016 Australian Open|Australian Open]], she reached the fourth round and lost there to [[Johanna Konta]] in a very tight match.

Makarova reached the quarterfinals in both singles and doubles at the [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]]. In doubles, she paired with [[Barbora Strýcová]]. She reunited with Vesnina in doubles in [[2016 Madrid Open|Madrid]], reaching the semifinals. In the next tournaments, the duo reached two finals in a row; in [[2016 Rome Masters|Rome]] they lost to Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza, while at the [[2016 French Open|French Open]] they lost to [[Caroline Garcia]] and [[Kristina Mladenovic]]. At [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], the pair lost in the quarterfinals to the Williams sisters. Makarova also progressed in grass court in singles, winning six out of eight matches, only to lose against doubles partner Elena Vesnina in the fourth round.

The duo finally won their first tournament title at the [[2016 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]] and won the gold medal at the [[Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] for [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]]; this was the very first time that a Russian duo had won in the Olympic doubles event.

Makarova made it to the third round of the [[2016 Connecticut Open – Singles|Connecticut Open]], but lost to Petra Kvitová in the third round. Ekaterina had the worst possible luck at the [[2016 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]] by drawing the number-one-player in the world, Serena Williams in singles to whom she lost in straight sets. Makarova and Vesnina had a good showing in doubles. They made it to the semifinals, but lost to eventual champions, Mattek-Sands and Šafářová.

Makarova defeated her doubles partner Elena Vesnina in the first round of the [[2016 China Open – Women's Singles|China Open]]. However, she lost to Agnieszka Radwańska in the second round. In doubles, Makarova and Vesnina were stunned in the second round by Peng Shuai and [[Christina McHale]]. Her next tournament was the [[2016 Kremlin Cup – Women's Singles|Kremlin Cup]], in her home country of Russia. She beat qualifier [[Nicole Gibbs]] in the first round, but lost to fellow countrywoman [[Daria Kasatkina]] in the second round. She was also seeded as the top seed alongside her doubles partner Elena Vesnina, but were beaten in the first round by [[Daria Gavrilova]] and the same woman she lost to in singles, Daria Kasatkina.

Makarova and Vesnina [[2016 WTA Finals|qualified]] for their third joint [[WTA Finals]], defeating Hlavackova/Hradecka, Hingis/Mirza, and Mattek-Sands/Safarova en route to win their first WTA Finals title.

===2017: Wimbledon doubles champion, 3rd singles title===
Makarova began her season at the [[2017 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]]. She lost in the first round to [[Misaki Doi]] 6–7, 4–6.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pliskova Marches Past Putintseva in Brisbane Opener|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/pliskova-marches-past-putintseva-brisbane-opener|accessdate=6 August 2017|publisher=Women's Tennis Association (WTA)|date=1 January 2017}}</ref> However, in doubles, she and [[Elena Vesnina]] reached the final, losing the match to Bethanie Mattek-Sands/Sania Mirza in straight sets.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brisbane International: Sania Mirza wins title, loses World No 1 rank to partner Bethanie Mattek-Sands|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/brisbane-international-sania-mirza-wins-title-loses-world-no-1-rank-to-partner-bethanie-mattek-sands-3193226.html|accessdate=6 August 2017|date=7 January 2017}}</ref> In Melbourne, the Russians reached the quarterfinals. At the St. Petersburg Open, she lost in the first round to doubles partner Vesnina. In [[2017 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]], she reached the third round before losing to [[Lauren Davis]]. The doubles team, however, won the trophy by defeating Hlaváčková/Peng in three sets. After reaching the semifinals of the [[2017 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Masters]], the duo had the chance to become the new number-one ranked doubles players if they had won the title, but they only reached the quarterfinals, suffering there an unpredictable loss to [[Gabriela Dabrowski]] amd [[Xu Yifan]], the eventual champions.

Makarova faced top-ranked Kerber in the first round of the [[2017 French Open|French Open]], beating her in two sets; this was the first time in the French Open history and the first time in the Open Era tennis history since 2001 that a number-one ranked player failed to reach the second round.<ref>[http://www.wtatennis.com/news/makarova-scores-kerber-upset-roland-garros Makarova scores Kerber upset at Roland Garros]</ref> According to WTA Insider, Makarova after her win over Kerber was ranked fourth among active players by number of top-ten wins at Grand Slam tournaments, with 10.<ref>[https://twitter.com/WTA_insider/status/868820884320137217 Active Players - Most Top 10 Wins at Grand Slams]</ref>

She and Vesnina won their third joint and individual Grand Slam doubles title in [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], crushing runners-up [[Hao-Ching Chan]]/[[Monica Niculescu]], 6–0, 6–0. This was the first "[[double bagel]]" in the women's doubles tournament final since 1953.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2017/07/15/kubot-and-melo-win-mens-doubles-title-at-wimbledon/103719066/|title=Kubot-Melo, Makarova-Vesnina win doubles titles at Wimbledon|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref> The Russian went on winning the [[2017 Citi Open|Citi Open]] in singles, beating players as Olympic champion [[Monica Puig|Puig]] and world No. 2, Simona Halep. In the finals, she prevailed over Julia Görges, winning her third WTA singles title.<ref>{{cite web| title=Makarova returns to winner's circle, triumphs at Citi Open | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/makarova-returns-winners-circle-rallies-past-goerges-win-citi-open | date = 6 August 2017 | accessdate = 14 August 2017}}</ref>

Makarova got into the third round of the [[2017 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]], defeating seventh-seeded Johanna Konta en-route but eventually losing to Lucie Safarova. She again reached third round at the [[2017 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati Masters]], crushing third-seeded Kerber en-route but losing to Sloane Stephens. Makarova thrice in a row defeated a top-10 in the second round of the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], 5th-seeded Caroline Wozniacki, for the first time in her career after seven losses in a row against her.

===2018: World No. 1 doubles player===
Makarova at best could reach the second round of any tournament this season. One of her best result that season was beating world No. 7, [[Jelena Ostapenko]] at the [[2018 Sydney International]]. She rebounded at [[2018 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], reaching the fourth round after beating [[Petra Martic]], second-seeded [[Caroline Wozniacki]] and [[2015 French Open]] finalist [[Lucie Safarova]] all in three sets, before falling to [[Camila Giorgi]] in the fourth round in straight sets.
 
In doubles, she and Vesnina reached the top position of the world ranking for the first time in their careers. This happened after their resultative performances, by reaching the finals of the [[2018 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and the [[2018 Miami Open|Miami Open]] and by collecting the [[2018 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Open]] trophy. Following the [[2018 French Open – Women's Doubles|French Open]], the pair became the new world No. 1, even though both did not get beyond the first round there (both played with other partners).

==Playing style==
[[File:Ekaterina Makarova at 2014 Rome Masters.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Makarova practicing at the 2014 Rome Masters]]
Makarova is an all-court player who uses power and angles to set up passing shots.<ref name=tc>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Pagliaro |title=Dubai: S. Williams d. Makarova |work=Tennis.com |date=18 February 2014 |accessdate=3 September 2014 |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/02/dubai-s-williams-d-makarova/50650/}}</ref><ref name=aus>{{cite news |first=Margie |last=McDonald |title=No serenity as Russian dethrones the Open's queen Serena Williams |work=[[The Australian]] |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/no-serenity-as-russian-dethrones-the-opens-queen-serena-williams/story-fnbe6xeb-1226251709838?nk=5188e50e65f8a1b7718c79a31971d40f}}</ref>

She is noted for her left-handed slice serve, often used to stretch opponents into uncomfortable positions. She attacks the return by shifting her wrist to disguise the direction of her forehand, or by hitting deep and aggressively with her backhand.<ref name=tc /><ref name=tctwo>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Pagliaro |title=Australian Open: Makarova d. Williams |work=Tennis.com |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014 |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2012/01/australian-open-makarova-d-williams/42588/}}</ref> She will usually seek to end the rally by maneuvering an opponent around the court and hitting a winner near the sidelines.<ref name=aus />

Makarova hits powerfully on both wings, and is largely known for her aggressive groundstrokes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Khoa |last=Tran |title=Radwanska to play in Rogers Cup final |work=Front Page News |date=9 August 2014 |accessdate=3 September 2014 |url=http://www.frontpagenews.ca/?p=7289}}</ref> Journalists have noted her cross-court forehand, describing it as a powerful finishing shot.<ref name=tctwo /> In an article from ''WTATennis.com'', her backhand was labeled "devastatingly good".<ref name=wta>{{cite news |first=Craig |last=O'Shannessy |title=Brain Game: Radwanska Vs Makarova |work=WTATennis.com |date=9 August 2014 |accessdate=3 September 2014 |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/4064079/title/brain-game-radwanska-vs-makarova}}</ref> Similarly, Richard Pagliaro of ''Tennis.com'' has noted her "bold" backhand as a primary strength.<ref name=tctwo />

Being a left-handed player, she is particularly comfortable hitting backhands in the deuce court, with several of her winners coming from that side. During the 2014 Rogers Cup, Agnieszka Radwańska repeatedly targeted Makarova's forehand in the ad court, occasionally exposing it as a vulnerability.<ref name=wta />

When returning first serves, Makarova often makes a series of quick stomps in place before blocking the shot back across the net; she attacks second serves by moving inside the baseline and hitting the ball at an angle.<ref name=tctwo />

As of August 2017, Makarova is one of just two left-handed players (the other being [[Angelique Kerber]]) to have ever beaten Serena Williams in a Grand Slam match, doing so at the 2012 Australian Open.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/4787840/title/an-historic-week-for-left-handers |title=AN HISTORIC WEEK FOR LEFT-HANDERS |publisher=WTA Official Website |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>
