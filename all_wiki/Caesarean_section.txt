==Uses==
[[File:Cesarean section scar and linea nigra.JPG|thumb|right|A 7-week old caesarean section [[scar]] and [[linea nigra]] visible on a 31-year-old mother: Longitudinal incisions are still sometimes used.]]
Caesarean section is recommended when [[vaginal delivery]] might pose a risk to the mother or baby. C-sections are also carried out for personal and social reasons on [[Caesarean delivery on maternal request|maternal request]] in some countries.

===Medical uses===
Complications of labor and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery include:
* abnormal presentation ([[Breech birth|breech]] or [[:wikt:transverse|transverse positions]]).
* prolonged [[Childbirth|labor]] or a failure to progress ([[obstructed labour]], also known as dystocia) 
* [[fetal distress]]
* [[cord prolapse]]
* [[uterine rupture]] or an elevated risk thereof
* [[hypertension]] in the mother or baby after [[amniotic fluid|amniotic rupture]] (the waters breaking)
* [[tachycardia]] in the mother or baby after amniotic rupture (the waters breaking)
* [[placenta]] problems ([[placenta praevia]], [[placental abruption]] or [[placenta accreta]])
* failed [[labor induction]]
* failed instrumental delivery (by [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]] or [[ventouse]] (Sometimes, a trial of forceps/ventouse delivery is attempted, and if unsuccessful, the baby will need to be delivered by caesarean section.)
* large baby weighing > 4,000 grams ([[macrosomia]])
* umbilical cord abnormalities ([[vasa previa]], multilobate including bilobate and succenturiate-lobed placentas, [[velamentous insertion]])

Other complications of pregnancy, pre-existing conditions, and concomitant disease, include:
* [[pre-eclampsia]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turner R |title=Caesarean Section Rates, Reasons for Operations Vary Between Countries |journal=Fam Plann Perspect |volume=22 |issue=6|pages=281–2 |year=1990 |doi=10.2307/2135690 |jstor=2135690 }}</ref>
* previous (high risk) fetus
* [[HIV]] infection of the mother with a high [[viral load]] (HIV with a low maternal viral load is not necessarily an indication for caesarean section)
* An outbreak of [[genital herpes]] in the third trimester<ref>{{cite web |title=Management of Genital Herpes in Pregnancy |url=https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2020/05/management-of-genital-herpes-in-pregnancy |website=ACOG |access-date=3 May 2020 |date=May 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> (which can cause infection in the baby if born vaginally)
* previous classical (longitudinal) caesarean section
* previous uterine rupture
* prior problems with the healing of the [[perineum]] (from previous childbirth or [[Crohn's disease]])
* [[bicornuate uterus]]
* rare cases of [[posthumous birth]] after the death of the mother

Other
* Decreasing experience of accoucheurs with the management of breech presentation. Although obstetricians and midwives are extensively trained in proper procedures for breech presentation deliveries using simulation mannequins, there is decreasing experience with actual vaginal breech delivery, which may increase the risk.<ref name=Savage07>{{cite journal | author = Savage W | title = The rising Caesarean section rate: a loss of obstetric skill? | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 339–46 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17654182 | doi = 10.1080/01443610701337916 | s2cid = 27545840 }}</ref>

===Prevention===
The prevalence of caesarean section is generally agreed to be higher than needed in many countries, and physicians are encouraged to actively lower the rate, as a caesarean rate higher than 10-15% is not associated with reductions in maternal or infant mortality rates,<ref name="WHO2015" /> although some evidence support that a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.<ref name=Mol2015/>

Some of these efforts are: emphasizing a long [[Childbirth#First stage: latent phase|latent phase]] of labor is not abnormal and not a justification for C-section; a new definition of the start of active labor from a cervical dilatation of 4&nbsp;cm to a dilatation of 6&nbsp;cm; and allowing women who have previously given birth to push for at least 2 hours, with 3 hours of pushing for women who have not previously given birth, before [[Tocolytic|labor arrest]] is considered.<ref name=ACOG2014/> [[Physical exercise]] during pregnancy decreases the risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Domenjoz|first1=I|last2=Kayser|first2=B|last3=Boulvain|first3=M|title=Effect of physical activity during pregnancy on mode of delivery |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=October 2014|volume=211|issue=4|pages=401.e1–11|pmid=24631706|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2014.03.030}}</ref>

In those who are low risk, the [[mortality rate|risk of death]] for caesarean sections is 13 per 100,000 vs. for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world.<ref name=ACOG2014/> The United Kingdom [[National Health Service]] gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=71&sectionId=7681 |title=Caesarean Section |publisher=[[NHS Direct]] |access-date=26 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201155120/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=71&sectionId=7681 |archive-date=1 February 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:Normal post-Caesarean.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] of a uterus years after a caesarean section, showing the characteristic scar formation in its anterior part]]
A caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction), and wound infections.<ref name=Pai00>{{cite journal |author=Pai, Madhukar|title=Medical Interventions: Caesarean Sections as a Case Study |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=35 |issue=31 |pages=2755–61 |year=2000}}</ref> If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors.

Women who had caesarean sections are more likely to have problems with later pregnancies, and women who want larger families should not seek an elective caesarean unless medical indications to do so exist. The risk of [[placenta accreta]], a potentially life-threatening condition which is more likely to develop where a woman has had a previous caesarean section, is 0.13% after two caesarean sections, but increases to 2.13% after four and then to 6.74% after six or more.  Along with this is a similar rise in the risk of emergency hysterectomies at delivery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Silver |first1=Robert M. |last2=Landon |first2=Mark B. |last3=Rouse |first3=Dwight J. |last4=Leveno |first4=Kenneth J. |last5=Spong |first5=Catherine Y. |last6=Thom |first6=Elizabeth A. |last7=Moawad |first7=Atef H. |last8=Caritis |first8=Steve N. |last9=Harper |first9=Margaret |last10=Wapner |first10=Ronald J. |last11=Sorokin |first11=Yoram |last12=Miodovnik |first12=Menachem |last13=Carpenter |first13=Marshall |last14=Peaceman |first14=Alan M. |last15=O’Sullivan |first15=Mary J. |last16=Sibai |first16=Baha |last17=Langer |first17=Oded |last18=Thorp |first18=John M. |last19=Ramin |first19=Susan M. |last20=Mercer |first20=Brian M. |title=Maternal Morbidity Associated With Multiple Repeat Cesarean Deliveries |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |date=June 2006 |volume=107 |issue=6 |pages=1226–1232 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000219750.79480.84 |pmid=16738145 |s2cid=257455 |lay-url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/123/115093?action=related_link |lay-source=WebMD }}</ref>

Women who have had a caesarean for any reason are somewhat less likely to become pregnant again as compared to women who have previously delivered only vaginally.<ref name="Gurol-UrganciBou-Antoun2013">{{cite journal |last1=Gurol-Urganci |first1=I. |last2=Bou-Antoun |first2=S. |last3=Lim |first3=C.P. |last4=Cromwell |first4=D.A. |last5=Mahmood |first5=T.A. |last6=Templeton |first6=A. |last7=van der Meulen |first7=J.H. |title=Impact of Caesarean section on subsequent fertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Human Reproduction |date=July 2013 |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=1943–1952 |doi=10.1093/humrep/det130 |pmid=23644593 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Women who had just one previous caesarean section are more likely to have problems with their second birth.<ref name=ACOG2014/> [[Delivery after previous caesarean section]] is by either of two main options:
*Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)
*[[Elective surgery|Elective]] repeat caesarean section (ERCS)

Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of [[uterine rupture]] (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or [[endometritis]] (10 per 1,000), and [[perinatal death]] of the child (0.25 per 1,000).<ref name=rcog2007>{{cite web |url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |title=Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth, Green-top Guideline No. 45 |date=February 2007 |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207031819/https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |archive-date=7 December 2014  }}</ref> Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section.<ref name="americanpregnancy"/><ref name="mayoclinic"/> On the other hand, VBAC confers less [[maternal morbidity]] and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.<ref name="American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63">{{cite journal|last=American Congress of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=ACOG Practice bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Aug 2010|volume=116|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=450–63|pmid=20664418|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb251}}</ref>

====Adhesions====
[[File:Suturing uterus.JPG|thumb|Suturing of the uterus after extraction]]
[[Image:C-sec suture.jpg|thumb|right|Closed incision for ''low transverse abdominal incision'' after stapling has been completed]]
There are several steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of [[adhesions]]. Such techniques and principles may include:

:• Handling all tissue with absolute care
:• Using powder-free surgical gloves
:• Controlling bleeding
:• Choosing sutures and implants carefully
:• Keeping tissue moist
:• Preventing infection with antibiotics given intravenously to the mother before skin incision

Despite these proactive measures, adhesion formation is a recognized complication of any abdominal or pelvic surgery. To prevent adhesions from forming after caesarean section, [[adhesion barrier]] can be placed during surgery to minimize the risk of adhesions between the uterus and ovaries, the small bowel, and almost any tissue in the abdomen or pelvis. This is not current UK practice, as there is no compelling evidence to support the benefit of this intervention.

Adhesions can cause long-term problems, such as:

:• [[Female Infertility|Infertility]], which may end when adhesions distort the tissues of the ovaries and tubes, impeding the normal passage of the egg (ovum) from the ovary to the uterus.  One in five infertility cases may be adhesion related (stoval)
:• Chronic pelvic pain, which may result when adhesions are present in the pelvis. Almost 50% of chronic pelvic pain cases are estimated to be adhesion related (stoval)
:• Small bowel obstruction: the disruption of normal bowel flow, which can result when adhesions twist or pull the small bowel.

The risk of adhesion formation is one reason why vaginal delivery is usually considered safer than elective caesarean section where there is no medical indication for section for either maternal or fetal reasons.

===Child===
Non-medically indicated (elective) childbirth before 39 weeks gestation "carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother." Newborn mortality at 37 weeks may be up to 3 times the number at 40 weeks, and is elevated compared to 38 weeks gestation. These early term births were associated with more death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks (full term).<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.patientsafetycouncil.org/uploads/MOD_39_Weeks_Toolkit.pdf |title=Elimination of Non-medically Indicated (Elective) Deliveries Before 39 Weeks Gestational Age |access-date=13 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120003529/http://www.patientsafetycouncil.org/uploads/MOD_39_Weeks_Toolkit.pdf |archive-date=20 November 2012  }}</ref> Researchers in one study and another review found many benefits to going full term, but no adverse effects in the health of the mothers or babies.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"/><ref name="urlTerm Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics & Gynecology">{{cite journal|title=Term Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics & Gynecology|journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology|volume=117|issue=6|pages=1279–1287|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182179e28|pmid=21606738|pmc=5485902|year=2011|last1=Reddy|first1=Uma M.|last2=Bettegowda|first2=Vani R.|last3=Dias|first3=Todd|last4=Yamada-Kushnir|first4=Tomoko|last5=Ko|first5=Chia-Wen|last6=Willinger|first6=Marian}}</ref>

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] and medical policy makers review research studies and find more incidence of suspected or proven [[sepsis]], RDS, hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, and need for hospitalization > 4–5 days.

==Classification==
Caesarean sections have been classified in various ways by different perspectives.<ref name="AlthabeTorloni2011">{{cite journal |last1=Torloni |first1=Maria Regina |last2=Betran |first2=Ana Pilar |last3=Souza |first3=Joao Paulo |last4=Widmer |first4=Mariana |last5=Allen |first5=Tomas |last6=Gulmezoglu |first6=Metin |last7=Merialdi |first7=Mario |last8=Althabe |first8=Fernando |title=Classifications for Cesarean Section: A Systematic Review |journal=PLOS ONE |date=20 January 2011 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=e14566 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0014566 |pmid=21283801 |pmc=3024323 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...614566T }}</ref> One way to discuss all classification systems is to group them by their focus either on the urgency of the procedure, characteristics of the mother, or as a group based on other, less commonly discussed factors.<ref name="AlthabeTorloni2011"/>

It is most common to classify caesarean sections by the urgency of performing them.<ref name="AlthabeTorloni2011"/>

===By urgency===
Conventionally, caesarean sections are classified as being either an [[elective surgery]] or an [[emergency]] operation.<ref name="classification 2000">{{cite journal|last1=Lucas|first1=DN|last2=Yentis|first2=SM|last3=Kinsella|first3=SM|last4=Holdcroft|first4=A|last5=May|first5=AE|last6=Wee|first6=M|last7=Robinson|first7=PN|title=Urgency of caesarean section: a new classification |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=Jul 2000|volume=93|issue=7|pages=346–50|pmid=10928020|pmc=1298057|doi=10.1177/014107680009300703}}</ref> Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform [[general anesthesia]] or [[regional anesthesia]] (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important and is based on many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman.<ref name="classification 2000"/> Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery is an important issue affecting this decision.

A planned caesarean (or elective/scheduled caesarean), arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical indications which have developed before or during the pregnancy, and ideally after 39 weeks of gestation. In the UK, this is classified as a 'grade 4' section (delivery timed to suit the mother or hospital staff) or as a 'grade 3' section (no maternal or fetal compromise but early delivery needed).
Emergency caesarean sections are performed in pregnancies in which a vaginal delivery was planned initially, but an indication for caesarean delivery has since developed. In the UK they are further classified as grade 2 (delivery required within 90 minutes of the decision but no immediate threat to the life of the woman or the fetus) or grade 1 (delivery required within 30 minutes of the decision: immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby or both.)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miheso|first1=Johnstone|last2=Burns|first2=Sean|title=Care of women undergoing emergency caesarean section|url=https://www.wwl.nhs.uk/Library/FOI/Requests/2013-2014/July_2013/1678_Emergency_Caesarean_Section_Jul12.pdf|website=NHS Choices|access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref>

====After previous caesarean====
{{See also|Delivery after previous caesarean section}}
Mothers who have previously had a caesarean section are more likely to have a caesarean section for future pregnancies than mothers who have never had a caesarean section. There is discussion about the circumstances under which women should have a vaginal birth after a previous caesarean.

Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is the practice of [[Childbirth|birthing a baby]] vaginally after a previous baby has been delivered by caesarean section (surgically).<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-vbac-overview Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) – Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230133854/http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-vbac-overview |date=30 December 2009 }}, [[WebMD]]</ref> According to [[The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), successful VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies.<ref name="American College of Obstetricians and 450–63">{{cite journal|last=American College of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=ACOG Practice bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Aug 2010|volume=116|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=450–63|pmid=20664418|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb251}}</ref> According to the American Pregnancy Association, 90% of women who have undergone caesarean deliveries are candidates for VBAC.<ref name="americanpregnancy">{{cite web |url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |title=Vaginal Birth after Cesarean (VBAC) |publisher=American Pregnancy Association |access-date=16 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621050450/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |archive-date=21 June 2012  }}</ref> Approximately 60–80% of women opting for VBAC will successfully give birth vaginally, which is comparable to the overall vaginal delivery rate in the United States in 2010.<ref name="americanpregnancy"/><ref name="mayoclinic">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/VB99999 Vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC) guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312103525/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/vb99999 |date=12 March 2010 }}, [[Mayo Clinic]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |title=NCHS Data Brief: Recent Trends in Cesarean Delivery in the United States Products |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=March 2010 |access-date=16 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517145002/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |archive-date=17 May 2012  }}</ref>

====Breech birth====
{{main|Breech birth}}
A breech birth is the birth of a baby from a breech [[presentation (obstetrics)|presentation]], in which the baby exits the pelvis with the [[buttocks]] or [[foot|feet]] first as opposed to the normal [[cephalic presentation|head-first presentation]]. In breech presentation, fetal heart sounds are heard just above the umbilicus.

Babies are usually born head first. If the baby is in another position the birth may be complicated. In a 'breech presentation', the unborn baby is bottom-down instead of head-down. Babies born bottom-first are more likely to be harmed during a normal (vaginal) birth than those born head-first. For instance, the baby might not get enough oxygen during the birth. Having a planned caesarean may reduce these problems. A review looking at planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation with planned vaginal birth, concludes that in the short term, births with a planned caesarean were safer for babies than vaginal births. Fewer babies died or were seriously hurt when they were born by caesarean. There was tentative evidence that children who were born by caesarean had more health problems at age two. Caesareans caused some short-term problems for mothers such as more abdominal pain. They also had some benefits, such as less urinary incontinence and less perineal pain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hofmeyr |first1=G Justus |last2=Hannah |first2=Mary |last3=Lawrie |first3=Theresa A |title=Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=7 |pages=CD000166 |date=21 July 2015 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000166.pub2 |pmid=26196961 |pmc=6505736 }}</ref>

The bottom-down position presents some hazards to the baby during the process of birth, and the mode of delivery (vaginal versus caesarean) is controversial in the fields of [[obstetrics]] and [[midwifery]].

Though vaginal [[childbirth|birth]] is possible for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal breech birth. The majority of breech babies born in the United States and the UK are delivered by caesarean section as studies have shown increased risks of morbidity and mortality for vaginal breech delivery, and most obstetricians counsel against planned vaginal breech birth for this reason.  As a result of reduced numbers of actual vaginal breech deliveries, obstetricians and midwives are at risk of de-skilling in this important skill. All those involved in delivery of obstetric and midwifery care in the UK undergo mandatory training in conducting breech deliveries in the simulation environment (using dummy pelvises and mannequins to allow practice of this important skill) and this training is carried out regularly to keep skills up to date.

====Resuscitative hysterotomy====
{{main|Resuscitative hysterotomy}}
A resuscitative [[hysterotomy]], also known as a peri-mortem caesarean delivery, is an emergency caesarean delivery carried out where maternal [[cardiac arrest]] has occurred, to assist in [[resuscitation]] of the mother by removing the [[aortocaval compression syndrome|aortocaval compression]] generated by the gravid uterus. Unlike other forms of caesarean section, the welfare of the fetus is a secondary priority only, and the procedure may be performed even prior to the limit of [[fetal viability]] if it is judged to be of benefit to the mother.

===Other ways, including the surgery technique===
There are several types of caesarean section (CS). An important distinction lies in the type of incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the [[uterus]], apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a [[Pfannenstiel incision]] but there is no way of knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.
* The classical caesarean section involves a [[sagittal plane|longitudinal]] midline incision on the uterus which allows a larger space to deliver the baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the lower segment of the uterus is unformed as it is safer in this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. Any woman who has had a classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision is much more likely to rupture in labor than the transverse incision.
* The [[lower uterine segment section]] is the procedure most commonly used today; it involves a [[transverse cut]] just above the edge of the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. It results in less [[Bleeding|blood loss]] and has fewer early and late complications for the mother, as well as allowing her to consider a vaginal birth in the next pregnancy.
* A caesarean [[hysterectomy]] consists of a caesarean section followed by the removal of the [[uterus]]. This may be done in cases of intractable bleeding or when the [[placenta]] cannot be separated from the uterus.

The [[EXIT procedure]] is a specialized surgical delivery procedure used to deliver babies who have airway compression.

The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of [[Misgav Ladach]], a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montréal in 1994<ref>Stark M. Technique of cesarean section: Misgav Ladach method. In: Popkin DR, Peddle LJ (eds): Women’s Health Today. Perspectives on current research and clinical practice. Proceedings of the XIV World Congress of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Montreal. Parthenon Publishing group, New York, 81–5</ref> and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. There is also an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.<ref name="pmid17904561">{{cite journal | author = Nabhan AF | title = Long-term outcomes of two different surgical techniques for cesarean | journal = Int J Gynaecol Obstet | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17904561 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2007.07.011 | s2cid = 5847957 }}</ref><ref name="pmid22752598">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hudić I, Bujold E, Fatušić Z, Skokić F, Latifagić A, Kapidžić M, Fatušić J | title = The Misgav-Ladach method of cesarean section: a step forward in operative technique in obstetrics | journal = Arch.

The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense [[nerve block]].

General anesthesia may be necessary because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when there is no time to perform a regional anesthesia.

Some doctors believe that during a caesarean section, mechanical [[cervical dilation]] with a finger or forceps will prevent the obstruction of blood and [[lochia]] drainage, and thereby benefit the mother by reducing the risk of death. The evidence {{As of|2018|lc=y}} neither supported nor refuted this practice for reducing postoperative morbidity, pending further large studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liabsuetrakul |first1=Tippawan |last2=Peeyananjarassri |first2=Krantarat |title=Mechanical dilatation of the cervix during elective caesarean section before the onset of labour for reducing postoperative morbidity |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=8 |pages=CD008019 |date=10 August 2018 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008019.pub3 |pmid=30096215 |pmc=6513223 }}</ref>

[[Pliny the Elder]] theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of [[Gaius Julius Caesar (name)#The cognomen Caesar|the etymology of ''Caesar'']]). Some stories involve Caesar himself being born from the procedure; this almost certainly false, as Caesar's mother [[Aurelia Cotta]] lived until his mid-40s. The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth, a practice sometimes called the ''Caesarian law''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-10-25|title=The Truth About Julius Caesar and "Caesarean" Sections|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/10/caesarean-sections-named-emperor-julius-caesar/|access-date=2020-10-09|website=Today I Found Out|language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[patron saint]] of caesarean section is [[Caesarius of Terracina|Caesarius]], a young deacon martyred at [[Terracina]], who has replaced and Christianized the pagan figure of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]].<ref>Caesarius Diaconus, testi e illustrazioni di Giovanni Guida, [s.l.: s.n.], 2015</ref> The martyr (Saint Cesareo in Italian) is invoked for the success of this surgical procedure, because it was considered the new "Christian Caesar" – as opposed to the "pagan Caesar" – in the Middle Ages it began to be invoked by pregnant women to wish a physiological birth, for the success of the expulsion of the baby from the uterus and, therefore, for their salvation and that of the unborn. The practice continues, in fact the martyr Caesarius is invoked by the future mothers who, due to health problems or that of the baby, must give birth to their child by caesarean section.<ref>Pasero Roberta, Cesareo di Terracina, un santo poco conosciuto: è il protettore del parto cesareo, in "DiPiù", anno XIV, n° 48, 3 dicembre 2018.</ref>

Speculation that the Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]] was born by the method now known as C-section are false.<ref>"Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed," by Christopher Wanjek, p. 5 (John Wiley & Sons, 2003)</ref> Although caesarean sections were performed in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery.<ref name="vanDongen-2009"/><ref>"...could not survive the trauma of a Caesarean" ''Oxford Classical Dictionary, Third Edition'', "Childbirth"</ref> As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician [[Maimonides]] expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant.<ref>Commentary to Mishnah Bekhorot 8:2</ref> The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb ''[[wikt:caedere|caedere]]'', "to cut", with children delivered this way referred to as ''caesones''.  [[Pliny the Elder]] refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as ''ab utero caeso'', "cut from the womb" giving this as an explanation for the [[cognomen]] "Caesar" which was then carried by his descendants.<ref name="vanDongen-2009"/> Nonetheless, even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a [[false etymology]], it has been widely believed. For example, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines caesarean birth as "the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Caesar".<ref>"Caesarean | Caesarian, adj. and n.".

Some link with Julius Caesar or with Roman emperors exists in other languages as well.  For example, the modern [[German language|German]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] terms are respectively ''Kaiserschnitt'', ''keisersnitt'', ''kejsersnit'', ''keizersnede'', ''kejsarsnitt'', ''keisarinleikkaus'', ''sezaryen'' and ''császármetszés'' (literally: "emperor's cut").<ref>For a summary (in German), of an article (also in German) that deals usefully with many of the relevant historical and linguistic questions raised here, go here [http://www.etymologie.info/~e/d_/de-medizi.html#Kaiserschnitt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106021301/http://www.etymologie.info/~e/d_/de-medizi.html|date=6 January 2007}}.</ref> The German term has also been imported into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (帝王切開 ''teiōsekkai'') and [[Korean language|Korean]] (제왕 절개 ''jewang jeolgae''), both literally meaning "emperor incision". The Dutch term has been imported into [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''bedah sesar'' means "emperor’s or caesar’s surgery". Similarly, in western Slavic (Polish) ''cięcie cesarskie'', (Czech) ''císařský řez'' and (Slovak) ''cisársky rez'' means "emperor's cut", whereas the south Slavic term is [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''царски рез'' and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''cárski réz'', literally ''[[Tsar|tzar]]'s cut''. The [[Russian language|Russian]] term ''kesarevo secheniye'' (Кесарево сечение ''késarevo sečénije'') literally means ''Caesar's section''. The Arabic term (ولادة قيصرية ''wilaada qaySaríyya'') also means "caesarean birth." The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ניתוח קיסרי (''nitúakh Keisári'') translates literally as caesarean surgery. In Romania and Portugal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/cesariana |title=Consulte o significado / Definição de cesariana no Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa, o dicionário online de português contemporâneo |access-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019193949/http://www.priberam.pt/DLPO/cesariana |archive-date=19 October 2014  }}</ref> it is usually called ''cesariana'', meaning from (or related to) [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Finally, the Roman ''[[praenomen]]'' (given name) [[Caeso (praenomen)|Caeso]] was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just [[folk etymology]] made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blumenfeld-Kosinski|first1=Renate|title=Not of woman born : representations of caesarean birth in medieval and Renaissance culture|date=1991|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-8014-9974-6|edition=1st}} "Appendix: Creative Etymology: ''Caesarean Section'' from Pliny to Rousset" (pp. 143-153) presents an excellent history of the legend of caesarean births in Western culture.</ref>

=== Spelling ===
{{See also|American and British English spelling differences}}
The term ''caesarean'' is spelled in various accepted ways, [[wikt:Caesarean#Alternative forms|as discussed at Wiktionary]]. The [[Medical Subject Headings|Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)]] of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|United States National Library of Medicine (NLM)]] uses ''cesarean section'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68002585 |title=Cesarean Section |language=en}}</ref> while some other American medical works, e.g. ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', use ''caesarean'',<ref name="fd">{{Cite web | url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/caesarean | title=Caesarean}}</ref> as do most British works.

In [[Judaism]], there is a dispute among the ''[[poskim]]'' (Rabbinic authorities) as to whether the first-born son from a caesarean section has the laws of a ''[[bechor]]''.<ref>See Chok Yaakov 470:2; Kaf ha-Chayim 470:3; {{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/pesach.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818005722/http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/pesach.html |archive-date=18 August 2010  }}</ref> Traditionally, a male child delivered by caesarean is not eligible for the ''[[Pidyon HaBen]]'' dedication ritual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://judaism.about.com/od/lifeevents/g/pidyonhaben.htm |title=Pidyon HaBen&nbsp;— Definition of Pidyon HaBen (Redemption of the Firstborn) |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=19 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019184726/http://judaism.about.com/od/lifeevents/g/pidyonhaben.htm |archive-date=19 October 2011 |access-date=15 August 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cohen-levi.org/the_cohens_heritage/pidyon_ha_ben.htm |title=Kohanim forever from the sources, who is a cohen, the blessing of the Cohanim,.

In rare cases, caesarean sections can be used to remove a dead [[fetus]]; otherwise, the woman has to labour and deliver a baby known to be a [[stillbirth]]. A [[late-term abortion]] using caesarean section procedures is termed a [[hysterotomy abortion]] and is very rarely performed.<ref name="Medscape Abortion">{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Francis E|title=Elective Abortion|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/252560-overview|website=Medscape|publisher=Medscape|access-date=18 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214092044/http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic3311.htm|archive-date=14 December 2004}}</ref>
