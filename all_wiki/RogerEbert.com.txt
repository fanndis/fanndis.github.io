'''''RogerEbert.com''''' is an American [[film review]] website that archives reviews written by film critic [[Roger Ebert]] for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and also shares other critics' reviews and essays. Ebert handpicked writers from around the world to contribute to the website. After Ebert died in 2013, the website was relaunched under Ebert Digital, a partnership founded between Ebert, his wife [[Chaz Ebert|Chaz]], and friend Josh Golden.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hernandez | first=Brian Anthony | url=https://mashable.com/2013/04/09/rogerebert-website-redesign/#zqJcdNSqksqw| title=Roger Ebert's Website for Film Reviews Gets Makeover | work=[[Mashable.com]] | date=April 9, 2013 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}</ref>

==Background==
Two months after Ebert's death, [[Chaz Ebert]] hired film and television critic [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] as editor-in-chief for the website<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Abramovitch | first=Seth | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-zoller-seitz-named-editor-562541 | title=Matt Zoller Seitz Named Editor of RogerEbert.com | magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=June 4, 2013 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}</ref> because his [[IndieWire]] blog PressPlay shared multiple contributors with RogerEbert.com, and because both websites promoted each other's content.<ref name="osenlund">{{cite news | last=Osenlund | first=R.

''[[The Dissolve]]''{{'}}s Noel Murray described the website's collection of Ebert reviews as "an invaluable resource, both for getting some front-line perspective on older movies, and for getting a better sense of who Ebert was." Murray said the website included reviews Ebert rarely discussed in conversation, such as those for ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'' (1966) and ''[[Good Times (film)|Good Times]]'' (1967), written when Ebert was in his twenties.<ref>{{cite news | last=Murray | first=Noel | url=https://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/638-roger-eberts-oldest-least-republished-reviews-are-/ | title=Roger Ebert's oldest, least-read reviews reveal the writer he'd become | work=[[The Dissolve]] | date=June 30, 2014 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}</ref> R. Kurt Osenlund of ''[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]'' said in 2013 that other contributors (including Seitz, Sheila O'Malley, and Odie Henderson) had "a lot of first-person narrative" in their work like Ebert did, adding, "but there are other contributors, like Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who donâ€™t do so much of that. The overall diversity makes the site a kind of [[Artist collective|artists' collective]]."<ref name="osenlund" />

RogerEbert.com has routinely hosted a "Women Writer's Week" in honor of [[Women's History Month]], featuring content from female contributors for the entire week.<ref>{{cite news | last=Bonazzo | first=John | url=http://observer.com/2016/03/rogerebert-com-holds-women-writers-week-to-celebrate-diversity/ | title=RogerEbert.com Holds Women Writer's Week to Celebrate Diversity | work=[[observer.com|Observer]] | date=March 31, 2016 | accessdate=June 22, 2017 }}</ref> Following the [[2016 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 2016]], the "Women Writer's Week" in 2017 was described by ''[[observer.com|Observer]]'' to be "overtly political thanks to President Donald Trump". Chaz Ebert said the [[2017 Women's March]] helped motivate female contributors to contribute their perspective to film and politics.<ref>{{cite news | last=Bonazzo | first=John | url=http://observer.com/2017/03/roger-ebert-women-writers-week-trump/ | title=How a Movie Review Site Is Using Women Writers to Protest Trump | work=[[observer.com|Observer]] | date=March 27, 2017 | accessdate=June 27, 2017 }}</ref>
