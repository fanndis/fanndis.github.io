Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, the [[Nasdaq Composite]] [[stock market index]] rose 400%, only to fall 78% from its peak by October 2002, giving up all its gains during the bubble. During the crash, many [[online shopping]] companies, such as [[Pets.com]], [[Webvan]], and [[Boo.com]], as well as several communication companies, such as [[Worldcom]], [[NorthPoint Communications]], and [[Global Crossing]], failed and shut down.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-greatest-defunct-web-sites-and-dotcom-disasters/ |title=The greatest defunct Web sites and dotcom disasters |work=[[CNET]] |date=June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref name=valuation>{{cite book |title=Valuation: Theories and Concepts|last=Kumar |first=Rajesh |date=December 5, 2015|publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=25}}</ref> Some companies, such as [[Cisco]], whose stock declined by 86%,<ref name=valuation/> [[Amazon.com]], and [[Qualcomm]], lost a large portion of their market capitalization but survived.

==Prelude to the bubble==
The 1993 release of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] and subsequent [[web browser]]s gave computer users access to the [[World Wide Web]], greatly popularizing use of the Internet.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.news-gazette.com/news/mosaic-started-web-rush-internet-boom/article_a459cd7f-dafe-5de4-a5fe-c3723a009af2.html |title=Mosaic started Web rush, Internet boom |first=Greg |last=Kline |work=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]] |date=April 20, 2003}}</ref> Internet use increased as a result of the reduction of the "[[digital divide]]" and advances in connectivity, uses of the Internet, and computer education. Between 1990 and 1997, the percentage of households in the United States owning computers increased from 15% to 35% as computer ownership progressed from a luxury to a necessity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/computer-ownership-up-sharply-in-the-1990s.pdf |title=Issues in labor Statistics |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]] |year=1999}}</ref> This marked the shift to the [[Information Age]], an economy based on [[information technology]], and many new companies were founded.

At the same time, a decline in interest rates increased the availability of capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-dot-com-bubble-in-photos-2016-2/ |title=If you're too young to remember the insanity of the dot-com bubble, check out these pictures |first=Matt |last=Weinberger |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> The [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]], which lowered the top marginal [[capital gains tax in the United States]], also made people more willing to make more speculative investments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-the-dot-com-bubble-began-and-why-it-popped-2010-12 |title=Here's Why The Dot Com Bubble Began And Why It Popped |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> [[Alan Greenspan]], then-[[Chair of the Federal Reserve]], allegedly fueled investments in the stock market by putting a positive spin on stock valuations.<ref name=enigma/> The [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] was expected to result in many new technologies from which many people wanted to profit.<ref name=now />

==The bubble==
As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any [[dot-com company]], especially if it had one of the [[Internet-related prefixes]] or a "[[.com]]" [[suffix]] in its name. [[Venture capital]] was easy to raise. [[Investment bank]]s, which profited significantly from [[initial public offering]]s (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.<ref name=swindle /> A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the [[quaternary sector of the economy]] and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the [[price–earnings ratio]], and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a [[stock market bubble]].<ref name=enigma>{{cite journal |last=Teeter |first=Preston |last2=Sandberg |first2=Jorgen |year=2017 |title=Cracking the enigma of asset bubbles with narratives |journal=Strategic Organization |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=91–99 |doi=10.1177/1476127016629880}}</ref> Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%.

Even though the Nasdaq Composite rose 85.6% and the [[S&P 500 Index]] rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/03/business/the-year-in-the-markets-1999-extraordinary-winners-and-more-losers.html |title=THE YEAR IN THE MARKETS; 1999: Extraordinary Winners and More Losers |first=Floyd |last=Norris |authorlink=Floyd Norris |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 3, 2000}}</ref>

An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and stories of people quitting their jobs to trade on the financial market were common.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991726,00.html |title=Day Trading: It's a Brutal World |first=Daniel |last=Kadlec |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 9, 1999 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> The [[news media]] took advantage of the public's desire to invest in the stock market; an article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' suggested that investors "re-think" the "quaint idea" of profits, and [[CNBC]] reported on the stock market with the same level of suspense as many networks provided to the [[broadcasting of sports events]].<ref name=enigma/><ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofcrashgr00roge |url-access=registration |title=Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing |first=Roger |last=Lowenstein |authorlink=Roger Lowenstein |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59420-003-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofcrashgr00roge/page/115 115]}}</ref>

At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a [[public company]] via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue. People who received [[employee stock option]]s became instant paper millionaires when their companies executed IPOs; however, most employees were barred from selling shares immediately due to [[lock-up period]]s.<ref name="swindle">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Totally_Wired.html?id=GoDuPQAACAAJ |title=Totally Wired: On the Trail of the Great Dotcom Swindle |authorlink=Andrew Smith (author) |first=Andrew |last=Smith |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Books]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84737-449-3}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2019}} The most successful entrepreneurs, such as [[Mark Cuban]], sold their shares or entered into [[Hedge (finance)|hedges]] to protect their gains.

===Spending tendencies of dot-com companies===
Most dot-com companies incurred [[net operating loss]]es as they spent heavily on advertising and promotions to harness [[network effect]]s to build [[market share]] or [[mind share]] as fast as possible, using the mottos "get big fast" and "get large or get lost". These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough [[brand awareness]] to charge profitable rates for their services in the future.<ref name=lessons>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/business/23proto.html |title=Lessons of Survival, From the Dot-Com Attic |first=LESLIE |last=BERLIN |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 21, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB958412442522904320 |title=MotherNature.com's CEO Defends Dot-Coms' Get-Big-Fast Strategy |first=John |last=Dodge |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=May 16, 2000 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

The "growth over profits" mentality and the aura of "[[new economy]]" invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish spending on elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Upon the launch of a new product or website, a company would organize an expensive event called a [[dot com party]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2000/04/25/party_5/ |title=Dot-com party madness |first=Damien |last=Cave |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=April 25, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-dec-25-mn-4559-story.html |title=Dot-Com Parties Dry Up |first=P.J. |last=HuffStutter |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 25, 2000}}</ref>

===Bubble in telecom===

Partially a result of greed and excessive optimism, especially about the growth of data traffic fueled by the rise of the Internet, in the five years after the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] went into effect, [[telecommunications equipment]] companies invested more than $500 billion, mostly financed with debt, into laying fiber optic cable, adding new switches, and building wireless networks.<ref name=now>{{cite news | url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-telecommunications-crash-what-to-do-now/ | title=The Telecommunications Crash: What To Do Now? | first=Robert E. | last=Litan | work=[[Brookings Institution]] | date=December 1, 2002}}</ref> In many areas, such as the [[Dulles Technology Corridor]] in Virginia, governments funded technology infrastructure and created favorable business and tax law to encourage companies to expand.<ref>{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Sally B. |last2=Zagorin |first2=Adam |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,52073-2,00.html |title=D.C.

Around the turn of the millennium, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the [[Year 2000 problem]]. There were concerns that computer systems would have trouble changing their clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000 which might trigger wider social or economic problems, but there was virtually no impact or disruption.

On January 10, 2000, [[America Online]], led by [[Steve Case]] and [[Ted Leonsis]], announced a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] with [[Time Warner]], led by [[Gerald M. Levin]]. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/01/10/deals/aol_warner/ |title=Thats AOL folks |first=Tom |last=Johnson | work=[[CNN]] |date=January 10, 2000}}</ref>

On January 30, 2000, almost 20 percent [12 ads] of the 61 ads for Super Bowl XXXIV were purchased by dot-com's (however this estimate ranges from 12-19 companies depending on the source and the context in which the term "dot-com" company implies). At that time, the cost for a 30-second commercial cost between $1.9 million and $2.2 million.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/Dot-Com-Super-Bowl-Advertisers-Fumble-But-Down-2739134.php|title=Dot-Com Super Bowl Advertisers Fumble / But Down Under, LifeMinders.com may win at Olympics | last=Pender |first=Kathleen | website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=September 13, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/ads-2000-dot-com-super-bowl.html |title=Revisiting the Ads From 2000's 'Dot-Com Super Bowl'| last=Kircher |first=Madison Malone | work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=February 3, 2019}}</ref>

In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, [[Alan Greenspan]] announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

On Friday March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked at 5,048.62.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/0310nasdaq-bust/ |title=March 10, 2000: Pop Goes the Nasdaq! |first=Tony |last=Long |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=March 10, 2010}}</ref>

On March 20, 2000, ''[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]]'' featured a cover article titled "Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast", which predicted the imminent bankruptcy of many Internet companies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.barrons.com/articles/SB953335580704470544 |title=Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast |first=Jack |last=Willoughby |work=[[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] |date=March 10, 2010 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> This led many people to rethink their investments.

On April 3, 2000, judge [[Thomas Penfield Jackson]] issued his ''conclusions of law'' in the case of [[United States v. Microsoft Corp.

This led to a one-day 15% decline in the value of shares in Microsoft and a 350-point, or 8%, drop in the value of the Nasdaq. Many people saw the legal actions as bad for technology in general.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2000/04/03/markets/markets_newyork/ |title=Nasdaq sinks 350 points | work=[[CNN]] |date=April 3, 2000}}</ref> That same day, [[Bloomberg News]] published a widely read article that stated: "It's time, at last, to pay attention to the numbers".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2000-04-02/commentary-earth-to-dot-com-accountants |title=Commentary: Earth To Dot Com Accountants |first=Catherine |last=Yang | work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=April 3, 2000}}</ref>

On Friday, April 14, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index fell 9%, ending a week in which it fell 25%.

==Aftermath==
After venture capital was no longer available, the operational mentality of executives and investors completely changed. A dot-com company's lifespan was measured by its [[burn rate]], the rate at which it spent its existing capital. Many dot-com companies ran out of capital and went through [[liquidation]]. Supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for services fell. However, many companies were able to endure the crash; 48% of dot-com companies survived through 2004, albeit at lower valuations.<ref name=lessons/>

Several companies and their executives, including [[Bernard Ebbers]], [[Jeffrey Skilling]], and [[Kenneth Lay]], were accused or convicted of [[fraud]] for misusing shareholders' money, and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] levied large fines against investment firms including [[Citigroup]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] for misleading investors.

After suffering losses, retail investors transitioned their investment portfolios to more cautious positions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hard Times Investing: For Some, Cash Is Everything And Only Thing |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/38308960 |first=Rob |last=Reuteman | work=[[CNBC]] |date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> Popular [[Internet forum]]s that focused on [[high tech]] stocks, such as [[Silicon Investor]], [[RagingBull.com]], [[Yahoo!

===Legacy===
As growth in the technology sector stabilized, companies consolidated; some, such as [[Amazon.com]], [[eBay]], and [[Google]] gained market share and came to dominate their respective fields. The most valuable public companies are now generally in the technology sector.

In a 2015 book, venture capitalist [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]], who funded many dot-com companies and lost 90% of his net worth when the bubble burst, said about the dot-com bubble:

{{quote|A friend of mine has a great line. He says "Nothing important has ever been built without [[irrational exuberance]]." Meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever. And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high [[throughput]] backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives... that's what all this speculative mania built.<ref>{{cite news |title=Here's what the future of bitcoin looks like—and it's bright |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/14/heres-what-the-future-of-bitcoin-looks-like-and-its-bright/ |first=Jacob |last=Donnelly |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=February 14, 2016}}</ref>}}
