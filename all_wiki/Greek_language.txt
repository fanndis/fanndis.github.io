'''Greek''' (modern {{lang|el|Ελληνικά}}, <small>romanized:</small> ''Elliniká'', [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] {{lang|grc|Ἑλληνική}}, ''Hellēnikḗ'') is an independent branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages, native to [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Albania]], other parts of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and the [[Black Sea]].

Among the Indo-European languages, its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now-extinct [[Anatolian languages]].

=== Periods ===
[[File:Proto Greek Area reconstruction.png|thumb|[[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]]-speaking area according to linguist [[Vladimir I. Georgiev]]]]

The Greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods:
* '''[[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]]''': the unrecorded but assumed last ancestor of all known varieties of Greek. The unity of Proto-Greek would have ended as Hellenic migrants entered the [[Geography of Greece|Greek peninsula]] sometime in the [[Neolithic]] era or the [[Bronze Age]]. {{NoteTag|A comprehensive overview in J.T. Hooker's ''Mycenaean Greece'' ({{harvnb|Hooker|1976|loc=Chapter 2: "Before the Mycenaean Age", pp. 11–33 and passim}}); for a different hypothesis excluding massive migrations and favoring an autochthonous scenario, see Colin Renfrew's "Problems in the General Correlation of Archaeological and Linguistic Strata in Prehistoric Greece: The Model of Autochthonous Origin" ({{harvnb|Renfrew|1973|pp=263–276, especially p. 267}}) in ''Bronze Age Migrations'' by R.A. Crossland and A. Birchall, eds. (1973).}}
* '''[[Mycenaean Greek]]''': the language of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]]. It is recorded in the [[Linear B]] script on tablets dating from the 15th century BC onwards.
* '''[[Ancient Greek]]''': in its various [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialects]], the language of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek civilization]]. It was widely known throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. Ancient Greek fell into disuse in western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], but remained officially in use in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world and was reintroduced to the rest of Europe with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] migration to western Europe.
* '''[[Koine Greek]]''': The fusion of [[Ionian Greek|Ionian]] with [[Attic Greek|Attic]], the dialect of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], began the process that resulted in the creation of the first common Greek dialect, which became a [[lingua franca]] across the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Near East]]. Koine Greek can be initially traced within the armies and conquered territories of [[Alexander the Great]] and after the Hellenistic colonization of the known world, it was spoken from [[Egypt]] to the fringes of [[India]]. After the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquest of Greece, an unofficial [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of Greek and [[Latin]] was established in the city of [[Rome]] and Koine Greek became a first or second language in the [[Roman Empire]]. The origin of [[Christianity]] can also be traced through Koine Greek, because the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] used this form of the language to spread Christianity. It is also known as '''Hellenistic Greek''', '''New Testament Greek''', and sometimes '''Biblical Greek''' because it was the original language of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Old Testament]] was translated into the same language via the [[Septuagint]].

[[Cappadocian Greek]] in green, with green dots indicating individual Cappadocian Greek villages.<ref>{{harvnb|Dawkins|Halliday|1916}}.</ref>]]
* '''[[Medieval Greek]]''', also known as '''Byzantine Greek''': the continuation of Koine Greek, up to the demise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 15th century. ''Medieval Greek'' is a cover phrase for a whole continuum of different speech and writing styles, ranging from vernacular continuations of spoken Koine that were already approaching [[Modern Greek]] in many respects, to highly learned forms imitating classical Attic. Much of the written Greek that was used as the official language of the Byzantine Empire was an eclectic middle-ground variety based on the tradition of written Koine.
* '''[[Modern Greek]]''' (Neo-Hellenic):<ref name="Ethnologue">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ell|title=Greek|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Stemming from Medieval Greek, Modern Greek usages can be traced in the Byzantine period, as early as the 11th century. It is the language used by the modern Greeks, and, apart from Standard Modern Greek, there are several [[Varieties of Modern Greek|dialects]] of it.

===Diglossia===
{{Main|Greek language question}}

In the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of [[diglossia]]: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the [[Greek language question]] was a polarization between two competing varieties of [[Modern Greek]]: [[Demotic Greek|Dimotiki]], the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and [[Katharevousa]], meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and [[Ancient Greek]], which was developed in the early 19th century, and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to [[Standard Modern Greek]], which is used today for all official purposes and in [[education in Greece|education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The modern Greek language : a descriptive analysis of standard modern Greek|last=Peter|first=Mackridge|date=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-815770-0|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|oclc=11134463}}</ref>

===Historical unity===
[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas]]

The historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language are often emphasized. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.<ref>{{harvnb|Browning|1983}}.</ref> It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages. According to one estimation, "[[Homeric Greek]] is probably closer to [[Demotic Greek|Demotic]] than 12-century [[Middle English]] is to [[Modern English|modern spoken English]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Alexiou|1982|p=161}}.</ref>

==Geographic distribution==

[[File:Greek USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Spread of Greek in the United States]]

Greek is spoken today by at least 13 million people, principally in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] along with a sizable Greek-speaking minority in [[Greeks in Albania|Albania]] near the Greek-Albanian border.<ref name=" Ethnologue" /> A significant percentage of Albania's population has some basic knowledge of the Greek language due in part to the [[Albanian immigrants in Greece|Albanian wave of immigration to Greece]] in the 1980s and '90s. Prior to the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and the resulting [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange in 1923]] a very large population of Greek-speakers also existed in [[Greeks in Turkey|Turkey]], though very few remain today.<ref name=":1" /> A small Greek-speaking community is also found in [[Greeks in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] near the Greek-Bulgarian border. Greek is also spoken worldwide by the sizable [[Greek diaspora]] which as notable communities in the [[Greek Americans|United States]], [[Greek Australians|Australia]], [[Greek Canadians|Canada]], [[Greek South Africans|South Africa]], [[Greek Chilean|Chile]], [[Greek Brazilians|Brazil]], [[Greek Argentines|Argentina]], [[Greeks in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russia]], [[Greeks in Ukraine|Ukraine]], the [[Greeks in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and throughout the [[European Union]], especially in [[Greeks in Germany|Germany]].

Historically, significant Greek-speaking communities and regions were found throughout the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], in what are today [[Southern Italy]], [[Turkey]], Cyprus, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], and [[Libya]]; in the area of the [[Black Sea]], in what are today Turkey, [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan]]; and, to a lesser extent, in the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in and around [[Greek colonisation|colonies]] such as [[History of Marseille|Massalia]], [[Monoikos]], and [[Mainake (Greek settlement)|Mainake]]. It was also used as a liturgical language in Christian Nubian kingdom of [[Makuria]] which was in modern day [[Sudan]].{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=239}} 

===Official status===
Greek, in its modern form, is the [[official language]] of Greece, where it is spoken by almost the entire population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html|title=Greece|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=23 January 2010}}</ref> It is also the official language of Cyprus (nominally alongside [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).<ref name=GreekCyprus>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of Cyprus, App. D., Part 1, Art. 3 |url-status=dead |url=http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/0/302578ad62e1ea3ac2256fd5003b61d4?OpenDocument&ExpandSection=3&Click=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407035710/http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/portal/portal.nsf/0/302578ad62e1ea3ac2256fd5003b61d4?OpenDocument&ExpandSection=3&Click=|archivedate=7 April 2012}} states that ''The official languages of the Republic are Greek and Turkish''.

==Characteristics==
{{See also|Ancient Greek grammar|Koine Greek grammar|Modern Greek grammar}}

The [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[vocabulary]] of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period. The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodizations, relatively arbitrary, especially because at all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.

===Phonology===
{{See also|Modern Greek phonology}}

[[File:Seferisrede.ogg|thumb|Spoken [[Modern Greek]]]]

Across its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see [[Koine Greek phonology]] for details):
* replacement of the [[pitch accent]] with a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]].
* simplification of the system of [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s: loss of vowel length distinction, monophthongisation of most diphthongs and several steps in a [[chain shift]] of vowels towards {{IPA|/i/}} ([[iotacism]]).
* development of the [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|plosives]] {{IPA|/pʰ/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} to the voiceless [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}, respectively; the similar development of {{IPA|/kʰ/}} to {{IPA|/x/}} may have taken place later (the phonological changes are not reflected in the orthography, and both earlier and later phonemes are written with [[Phi (letter)|φ]], [[Theta|θ]], and [[Chi (letter)|χ]]).
* development of the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} to their voiced fricative counterparts {{IPA|/β/}} (later {{IPA|/v/}}), {{IPA|/ð/}}, and {{IPA|/ɣ/}}.

=== Morphology ===
In all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding<ref>{{harvnb|Ralli|2001|pp=164–203}}.</ref> and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future, and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by [[periphrastic]] (analytical) forms.

==== Nouns and adjectives ====
Pronouns show distinctions in [[grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and decline for [[grammatical case|case]] (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language).{{NoteTag|The four cases that are found in all stages of Greek are the nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative. The dative/locative of Ancient Greek disappeared in the late Hellenistic period, and the instrumental case of Mycenaean Greek disappeared in the Archaic period.}} Nouns, articles, and adjectives show all the distinctions except for a person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.

==== Verbs ====
The inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have [[synthetic language|synthetic]] inflectional forms for:

Most Greek linguists advocate abandoning the traditional terminology (Anna Roussou and Tasos Tsangalidis 2009, in ''Meletes gia tin Elliniki Glossa'', Thessaloniki, Anastasia Giannakidou 2009 "Temporal semantics and polarity: The dependency of the subjunctive revisited", Lingua); see [[Modern Greek grammar#The verb|Modern Greek grammar]] for explanation.}} and imperative (other modal functions are expressed by periphrastic constructions)
|-
! Voice
| [[active voice|active]], [[middle voice|middle]], and [[passive voice|passive]]
| active and [[mediopassive voice|medio-passive]]
|}

===Syntax===
Many aspects of the [[syntax]] of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the [[Modern Greek grammar|modern form of the language]]. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead of having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.

===Vocabulary===
Modern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of [[Pre-Greek substrate|borrowings]] from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks,<ref>{{harvnb|Beekes|2009}}.</ref> some documented in [[Linear B|Mycenaean texts]]; they include a large number of Greek [[toponym]]s. The form and meaning of many words have evolved. [[Loanword]]s (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Venetian language#History|Venetian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]/[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) and [[Eastern Romance languages]] ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).

===Greek loanwords in other languages===
{{details|English words of Greek origin}}
{{details|Greek and Latin roots in English}}

Greek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English: ''[[mathematics]]'', ''[[physics]]'', ''[[astronomy]]'', ''[[democracy]]'', ''[[philosophy]]'', ''[[:wikt:athletics|athletics]], [[theatre]], [[rhetoric]]'', ''[[baptism]]'', ''[[:wikt:evangelist|evangelist]]'', etc. Moreover, Greek words and [[morpheme|word elements]] continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: ''[[anthropology]]'', ''[[photography]]'', ''[[telephony]]'', ''[[isomer]]'', ''[[biomechanics]]'', ''[[cinematography]]'', etc. and form, with [[Scientific Latin|Latin words]], the [[International scientific vocabulary|foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary]] like all words ending with ''–logy'' ("discourse"). There are many [[English words of Greek origin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scheler|1977}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsit.gr/ellada/poso-ellinikes-einai-oi-ksenes-glosses/2918001/|title=Πόσο "ελληνικές" είναι οι ξένες γλώσσες|last=|first=|date=18 November 2019|website=NewsIt|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The ancient language most closely related to it may be [[Ancient Macedonian language|ancient Macedonian]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hamp|2013|pp=8–10, 13}}.</ref> which most scholars suggest may have been a [[Ancient Greek dialects|dialect of Greek]] itself,<ref name= Crespo2018>{{cite book | last = Crespo | first = Emilio | chapter = The Softening of Obstruent Consonants in the Macedonian Dialect | title = Studies in Ancient Greek Dialects: From Central Greece to the Black Sea | editor1-last = Giannakis | editor1-first = Georgios K. | editor2-last = Crespo | editor2-first = Emilio | editor3-last = Filos | editor3-first = Panagiotis | date = 2018 | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | page = 329 | isbn = 978-3-11-053081-0 }}</ref><ref name= Hatzopoulos2018>{{cite book | last = Hatzopoulos | first = Miltiades B. | chapter = Recent Research in the Ancient Macedonian Dialect: Consolidation and New Perspectives | title = Studies in Ancient Greek Dialects: From Central Greece to the Black Sea | editor1-last = Giannakis | editor1-first = Georgios K. | editor2-last = Crespo | editor2-first = Emilio | editor3-last = Filos | editor3-first = Panagiotis | date = 2018 | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XXFLDwAAQBAJ&q=ancient+macedonian+speech&pg=PT301 | page=299 | isbn = 978-3-11-053081-0 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Babiniotis|1992|pp=29–40}}; {{harvnb|Dosuna|2012|pp=65–78}}.</ref> but it is poorly attested and it is difficult to conclude. Independently of the Macedonian question, some scholars have grouped Greek into [[Graeco-Phrygian]], as Greek and the extinct [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] share features that are not found in other Indo-European languages.<ref>{{Glottolog|grae1234|Graeco-Phrygian}}</ref> Among living languages, some Indo-Europeanists suggest that Greek may be most closely related to [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (see [[Graeco-Armenian]]) or the [[Indo-Iranian languages]] (see [[Graeco-Aryan]]), but little definitive evidence has been found for grouping the living branches of the family.<ref>{{harvnb|Renfrew|1990}}; {{harvnb|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1990|pp=110–116}}; {{harvnb|Renfrew|2003|pp=17–48}}; {{harvnb|Gray|Atkinson|2003|pp=435–439}}.</ref> In addition, [[Albanian language|Albanian]] has also been considered somewhat related to Greek and [[Armenian language|Armenian]] by some linguists. If proven and recognized, the three languages would form a new Balkan sub-branch with other dead European languages.<ref>{{harvnb|Holm|2008|pp=628–636}}.</ref>

===Linear B===
{{Main|Linear B}}

[[Linear B]], attested as early as the late 15th century BC, was the first script used to write Greek.<ref name=":0"/> It is basically a [[syllabary]], which was finally deciphered by [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]] in the 1950s (its precursor, [[Linear A]], has not been deciphered and most likely encodes a non-Greek language).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Linear B : an introduction|last=T.|first=Hooker, J.|date=1980|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=978-0-906515-69-3|location=Bristol|oclc=7326206}}</ref> The language of the Linear B texts, [[Mycenaean Greek language|Mycenaean Greek]], is the earliest known form of Greek.<ref name=":0" />

===Cypriot syllabary===
{{Main|Cypriot syllabary}}
[[File: Cypriot syllabic inscription 600-500BC.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription in Cypriot syllabic script]]
Another similar system used to write the Greek language was the [[Cypriot syllabary]] (also a descendant of [[Linear A]] via the intermediate [[Cypro-Minoan syllabary]]), which is closely related to Linear B but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences. The Cypriot syllabary is attested in [[Cyprus]] from the 11th century BC until its gradual abandonment in the late Classical period, in favor of the standard Greek alphabet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/Cypriot-syllabary/28419|title=Cypriot syllabary|work=Britannica Academic|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref>

===Greek alphabet===
{{Main|Greek alphabet|Greek orthography}}
[[File:Greek alphabet variants.png|thumb|Ancient epichoric variants of the Greek alphabet from [[Euboea]], [[Ionia]], [[Athens]], and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] comparing to modern Greek]]

Greek has been written in the Greek alphabet since approximately the 9th century BC. It was created by modifying the [[Phoenician alphabet]], with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the vowels. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] variant, introduced for writing classical [[Attic Greek|Attic]] in 403&nbsp;BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of [[ink]] and [[quill]].

The Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase ([[capital letter|majuscule]]) and lowercase ([[lower case|minuscule]]) form. The letter [[sigma]] has an additional lowercase form (ς) used in the final position:

|}

====Diacritics====
{{main|Greek diacritics}}

In addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of [[diacritic|diacritical signs]]: three different accent marks ([[acute accent|acute]], [[grave accent|grave]], and [[circumflex]]), originally denoting different shapes of [[pitch accent]] on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks ([[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the [[trema (diacritic)|diaeresis]], used to mark the full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in [[penmanship|handwriting]] saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in [[typography]].

After the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified [[Greek diacritics|monotonic orthography]] (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of [[Ancient Greek]].

====Punctuation====
In Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (•), known as the ''[[Interpunct#Ano teleia|ano teleia]]'' ({{lang|grc|άνω τελεία}}). In Greek the [[comma]] also functions as a [[silent letter]] in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing {{lang|el|{{linktext|ό,τι}}}} (''ó,ti'', 'whatever') from {{lang|el|{{linktext|ότι}}}} (''óti'', 'that').<ref>{{cite web|last=Nicolas |first=Nick |title=Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation |year=2005 |url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |accessdate=7 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120806003722/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/punctuation.html |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Ancient Greek texts often used ''scriptio continua'' ('continuous writing'), which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The concise Oxford dictionary of linguistics|last=Hugoe|first=Matthews Peter|date=March 2014|publisher=|others=Oxford University Press.|isbn=978-0-19-967512-8|edition=Third|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=881847972}}</ref>  [[Boustrophedon]], or bi-directional text, was also used in Ancient Greek.

===Latin alphabet===
Greek has occasionally been written in the [[Latin script]], especially in areas under [[Stato da Màr|Venetian rule]] or by [[Roman Catholicism in Greece|Greek Catholics]]. The term {{lang|grc-Latn|Frankolevantinika}} / {{lang|grc|Φραγκολεβαντίνικα}} applies when the Latin script is used to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism (because {{lang|grc-Latn|Frankos}} / {{lang|grc|Φράγκος}} is an older Greek term for West-European dating to when most of (Roman Catholic Christian) West Europe was under the control of the [[Frankish Empire]]). {{lang|grc-Latn|Frankochiotika}} / {{lang|grc|Φραγκοχιώτικα}} (meaning 'Catholic Chiot') alludes to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of [[Chios]]. Additionally, the term [[Greeklish]] is often used when the Greek language is written in a Latin script in online communications.<ref>{{harvnb|Androutsopoulos|2009|pp=221–249}}.</ref>

The Latin script is nowadays used by the [[Griko dialect|Greek-speaking]] communities of [[Southern Italy]].

===Hebrew alphabet===
The [[Yevanic]] dialect was written by [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] and [[Constantinopolitan Karaite]] Jews using the [[Hebrew Alphabet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omniglot.com/writing/yevanic.htm|title=Yevanic alphabet, pronunciation and language|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>

===Arabic alphabet===
Some [[Greek Muslim]]s [[Cretan Muslim|from Crete]] wrote their [[Cretan Greek]] in the [[Arabic alphabet]].
The same happened among [[Epirote Muslim]]s in [[Ioannina]].
This usage is sometimes called [[aljamiado]] as when [[Romance language]]s are written in the Arabic alphabet.<ref name="Kotzageorgis">{{cite book

In the Ottoman Empire, the primary criterion for the selection of an alphabet in which to write was religion. Thus, people who did not speak—or even know—the official language of their religion used to write their religious texts in the languages that they knew, though in the alphabet where the sacred texts of that religion were written. Thus, the Grecophone Catholics of Chios wrote using the Latin alphabet, but in the Greek language (''[[frangochiotika]]''); the Turcophone Orthodox Christians of Cappadocia wrote their Turkish texts using the Greek alphabet (''[[karamanlidika]]''); and the Grecophone Muslims of the Greek peninsula wrote in Greek language using the Arabic alphabet (''[[tourkogianniotika]]'', ''[[tourkokretika]]''). Our case is much stranger, since it is a quite early example for that kind of literature and because it is largely concerned with religious themes."; p. 306. The audience for the Greek ''[[Mi'rājnāma]]'' was most certainly Greek-speaking Muslims, in particular the so-called ''[[Tourkogianniot]]es'' (literally, the Turks of Jannina). Although few examples have been discovered as yet, it seems that these people developed a religious literature mainly composed in verse form. This literary form constituted the mainstream of Greek ''[[Aljamiado]]'' literature from the middle of the seventeenth century until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. Tourkogianniotes were probably of Christian origin and were Islamized sometime during the seventeenth century. They did not speak any language other than Greek. Thus, even their frequency in attending mosque services did not provide them with the necessary knowledge about their faith. Given their low level of literacy, one important way that they could learn about their faith was to listen to religiously edifying texts such as the Greek ''Mi'rājnāma''.}}</ref>
