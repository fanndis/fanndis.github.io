'''Interscope Records''' is an American [[record label]] owned by [[Universal Music Group]] through its [[Interscope Geffen A&M Records|Interscope Geffen A&M]] imprint.

In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from the [[hardcore hip hop]] label [[Death Row Records|Death Row]], whose artists included [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s [[Gangsta rap#Criticism and debate|gangsta rap controversy]]. As a result, [[Time Warner]], owning Atlantic, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115&nbsp;million in 1995.

==History==

===1989–1995: Origins, early success, and joint ventures===
In 1989, Ted Field began to build Interscope Records as a division of his film company, [[Interscope Communications]].  To run it, he hired John McClain, who had played a central role in [[Janet Jackson]]'s success at [[A&M Records]],  and Tom Whalley, who had been the head of [[A&R]] at [[Capitol Records]]. Separately, Iovine, who had produced records for [[U2]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[John Lennon]], among others, was trying to raise money to start a label.  "I thought, 'Music is going to change,'" Iovine said in 1997. "'Young bands aren't going to be asking for me.' But I love working with the new thing. I always liked the part of the business that's the first time you hear something, and I knew I wasn't in that business anymore."<ref name="Rolling Stone Wild" />

Iovine and Field were introduced by [[Paul McGuinness]], then [[U2]]'s manager.  After a series of negotiations led by [[David Geffen]], they came to an agreement, and in 1990, Interscope Records was founded as a joint venture with [[Atlantic Records]].  In a 1997 article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[David Wild]] wrote: "Interscope's start-up coincided with a period of incredible change in the music world. Nirvana had ushered in the alternative revolution... While the major labels were packed with rosters full of expensive veteran artists who had to redefine themselves for a new rock era, Interscope was in the business of signing new artists and could – as Iovine puts it – 'move on a dime.'"<ref name="Rolling Stone Wild">{{cite news|last1=Wild|first1=David|title=Interscope Records: Inside the Hit Factory|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/interscope-records-inside-the-hit-factory-19970403|access-date=September 15, 2015|work=Rolling Stone|date=April 3, 1997}}</ref><ref name="Phillips McClain">{{cite news|last1=Philips|first1=Chuck|title=Back in the Club|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/26/business/fi-32786|access-date=September 15, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 26, 1998}}</ref><ref name="Interscope book">{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Diane|title=The Story of Interscope Records|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=Mason Crest|location=New York|isbn=978-1422221150|pages=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfTBAAAQBAJ&q=why+did+ted+field+start+interscope&pg=PT11|access-date=September 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=829601 |title=Interscope Records, Inc.: Private Company Information |work=Businessweek |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>

Based in [[Westwood, California]], Interscope was run by "music men".  It was a departure from the music industry practices of the 1970s and 1980s, when labels traditionally appointed lawyers and promotion executives to senior positions.  A founding tenet of the label was that artists would have complete creative control.<ref name="1993 Hilburn LA Times" />

Interscope's first release was "[[Rico Suave (song)|Rico Suave]]" by Ecuadorian rapper [[Gerardo Mejía|Gerardo]] in December 1990; the single reached number seven on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' charts in April 1991. [[Primus (band)|Primus]]' Interscope debut, ''[[Sailing the Seas of Cheese]]'', was released in May, followed by [[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]]'s ''[[Music for the People (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch album)|Music for the People]]'' in July.  It included the number-one single "[[Good Vibrations (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch song)|Good Vibrations]]". Two days after first hearing his demo, Whalley signed [[Tupac Shakur]] in August 1991, and by November, Interscope released ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'', Shakur's studio debut.<ref name="Becker & Meyer">{{cite book|last1=Monjauze, Molly and|first1=Robinson, Staci|title=Tupac Remembered: Bearing Witness to a Life and Legacy|date=February 1, 2008|publisher=Becker & Meyer|isbn=978-1932855760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwIexeXLKecC&q=tom+whalley+tupac&pg=PT37|access-date=September 16, 2015}}</ref>

Interscope began to develop a significant presence in the [[Alternative music|alternative]] genre in 1992. In addition to a second Primus album, the label released [[No Doubt]]'s self-titled debut, [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]]'s ''[[Meantime (album)|Meantime]]'', [[4 Non Blondes]]' ''[[Bigger, Better, Faster, More!]],'' acquired and re-released [[Rocket from the Crypt]]'s ''[[Circa: Now!]]'', and, through a joint venture with [[TVT Records|TVT]]/[[Nothing Records]], the [[Nine Inch Nails]] EP ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]].'' However, Interscope's success with alternative and rock music was eclipsed by controversy which began in September 1992, when Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] called on Interscope to withdraw ''2Pacalypse Now,'' stating that it was responsible for the death of a Texas state trooper, who was shot to death in April by a suspect who allegedly was listening to the album on the tape deck of a stolen truck when he was stopped by the officer.  The trooper's family filed a civil suit against Shakur and Interscope, claiming the record's violence-laden lyrics incite "imminent lawless action."<ref name="Becker & Meyer"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Broder|first1=James|title=Quayle Calls for Pulling Rap Album Tied to Murder Case|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-23/news/mn-1144_1_rap-album|access-date=September 17, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 23, 1992}}</ref>

Earlier in 1992, Interscope negotiated a $10-million deal with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Marion "Suge" Knight]] to finance and distribute their label, [[Death Row Records]].  It was initiated by McClain, who met Dre when he was recording his solo debut, ''[[The Chronic]].'' Original plans had called for the album to be released through Sony, but Sony passed on ''The Chronic''  due to "the crazy things going on around Death Row" and the contractual status of Dr. Dre. After hearing the album, Iovine agreed to put it out, although doing so required a complicated distribution agreement with Priority Records, Dre's label as a member of [[N.W.A]]. ''The Chronic'' was released in December 1992.<ref name="Chronic oral history">{{cite news|last1=Westhoff|first1=Ben|title=The Making of the Chronic|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-making-of-the-chronic-2407719|access-date=September 16, 2015|work=LA Weekly|date=November 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Dre splits Death Row LA Times">{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Chuck|title=Rapper Dr. Dre to part ways with Death Row, start new record label|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-fi-dredeathrow22march2296-story.html|access-date=September 17, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 22, 1996}}</ref>

By the end of the following year, ''The Chronic'' had sold almost 3&nbsp;million copies. [[Snoop Dogg]]'s debut ''[[Doggystyle]]'' had sold more than 800,000 copies in its first week alone, and Primus and 4 Non-Blondes had released records which hit the US Top 20.  In 1993, with an estimated gross of $90&nbsp;million, Interscope became profitable ahead of projections.<ref name="LA Times Warner Split">{{cite news|last1=Hilburn, Robert and|first1=Philips, Chuck|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-29/business/fi-51464_1_time-warner/2|title=COMPANY TOWN : Q & A : Vocal Session : Interscope's Iovine Reflects on Time Warner Split|date=September 29, 1995|access-date=September 17, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Markman|first1=Rob|title=20 Years Later, Snoop Dogg Has 'Never' Listened To Doggystyle|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1717998/snoop-dogg-doggystyle-20-years-never-listened/|access-date=September 17, 2015|publisher=MTV|date=November 22, 2013}}</ref>

Interscope further established its strength in the alternative and rock genres in 1994.  A $2.5&nbsp;million investment to establish a joint venture with [[Trauma Records]] yielded three number-one Modern Rock tracks and a platinum-certified album with [[Bush (band)|Bush]]'s ''[[Sixteen Stone]]''. The Nine Inch Nails album ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' went to number two on the US charts and was widely acclaimed. [[Marilyn Manson]]'s ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'', [[The Toadies]] album ''[[Rubberneck (album)|Rubberneck]]'' and Helmet's ''[[Betty (Helmet album)|Betty]]'' were commercially successful and critically embraced.<ref name="Trauma WSJ">{{cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Patrick M.|title=Dissonance Mars the Alliance Between Trauma and Interscope|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB860623460143283000|access-date=September 18, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=April 10, 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Keith|title=1994: The 40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative's Greatest Year|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/1994-the-40-best-records-from-mainstream-alternatives-greatest-year-20140417/green-day-dookie-19691231|access-date=September 18, 2015|work=Rolling Stone|date=April 17, 2014}}</ref>

===1995–2000: Gangsta rap controversy, acquisition by MCA, Aftermath and Shady===
In May 1995, the controversy related to gangsta rap and explicit lyrics intensified as [[U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bob Dole]] accused Interscope of releasing music that glorified violence and degraded women. Among others, the label was criticized by [[William J. Bennett]], a former Education Secretary, and [[C. DeLores Tucker]], the chairwoman of the National Political Congress of Black Women.  In September, Time Warner announced it would disassociate itself from Interscope by selling its half-interest in the company to Field and Iovine for $115&nbsp;million.<ref name="LA Times Warner Split" /><ref name="NYT fuchs">{{cite news|last1=Landler|first1=Mark|title=Time Warner Seeks to Sell Stake in Gangsta Rap Label|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/10/business/time-warner-seeks-to-sell-stake-in-gangsta-rap-label.html|access-date=September 17, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=August 10, 1995}}</ref>  Ownership in Interscope was aggressively pursued by [[EMI Records|EMI]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[PolyGram]] and MCA. On December 1, 1995, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that with five albums on that week's pop charts and sales of $350&nbsp;million over the previous three years, "what may have been a smart move politically for Time Warner is now looking like a financial fiasco."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Philips|first1=Chuck|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-01/business/fi-9207_1_time-warner|title=Company Town : 4 Music Companies Wooing Interscope : Recording: Time Warner's move to distance itself from the controversial label may prove to be politically savvy but financially disastrous|date=December 1, 1995|access-date=September 18, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>   In February 1996, [[MCA Records]]—then owned by [[Seagram]]—bought 50% of Interscope for a reported $200&nbsp;million.

MCA was not required to distribute material that it deemed offensive.<ref name="MCA buys LA Times">{{cite news|last1=Philips|first1=Chuck|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-19/business/fi-26268_1_interscope-records|title=MCA Offers $200 Million Acquire a 50% Stake in Interscope Records|date=January 19, 1996|access-date=September 17, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

Dre left Death Row in mid-1996 due to what was then reported as tension over the creative direction of the label, and founded [[Aftermath Entertainment]], a new joint venture with Interscope. In November that same year, Aftermath debuted with the album  ''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]]''.  The Death Row deal remained in place until 1998, when Knight was imprisoned for parole violations.<ref name="Dre Aftermath Phillips">{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Chuck|title=The Doctor, Unmasked|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-13/entertainment/ca-53256_1_death-row|access-date=September 19, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 13, 1996}}</ref><ref name="Dre Rolling Stone Bio">{{cite web|title=Dr. Dre Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/dr-dre/biography|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Neil|title=Rap Empire Unraveling As Stars Flee|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/business/rap-empire-unraveling-as-stars-flee.html|access-date=September 20, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 28, 1998}}</ref>

In November 1996, with records by Bush, Snoop Dogg, No Doubt, and Tupac Shakur, Interscope became the first label in 20 years to hold the top 4 positions on the ''Billboard'' charts.  Six additional Interscope releases were in the Top 100.  The label was frequently criticized for overspending on artist acquisitions and joint ventures, however, with revenue for 1996 estimated at $250&nbsp;million, it operated at a profit.<ref name="More Phillips Writing Interscope is GREAT! 1996">{{cite news|last1=Philips|first1=Chuck|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-28/business/fi-3681_1_pop-chart|title=Interscope Is Golden on the Pop Chart|date=November 28, 1996|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=September 19, 2015}}</ref>

In 1996, MCA Music Entertainment was renamed [[Universal Music Group]].  In 1998, the Universal Music Group parent company Seagram acquired [[PolyGram Records]]. MCA's [[Geffen Records]] and PolyGram's the [[A&M Records]] were merged into Interscope, and in early 1999, Interscope Records began operating under the umbrella of [[Interscope Geffen A&M Records]], with Iovine and Field serving as co-chairmen.<ref name="Strauss Merger NYT">{{cite news|last1=Neil|first1=Strauss|title=A Major Merger Shakes Up the World of Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/21/arts/a-major-merger-shakes-up-the-world-of-rock.html|access-date=September 18, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1998}}</ref>

Iovine's assistant (and former intern) Dean Geistlinger saw Eminem perform at the Rap Olympics in Los Angeles in 1997 and passed Eminem's CD on to Iovine; Iovine, in turn, passed it on to Dre.

By the close of the decade, Interscope sales accounted for nearly one-third of Seagram's 27% share of the U.S. music market.   Records by Eminem, Dre, [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Blackstreet]], [[Smash Mouth]] and others generated an estimated $40&nbsp;million in profit during the final six months of 1999.<ref name="Seagram Info on 90s LA Times">{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Chuck|title=Interscope Emerges as Star Act for Seagram|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/14/business/fi-43807|access-date=September 23, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 14, 1999}}</ref>

===2000–2010: Departure of Field, DreamWorks, Cherrytree Records and Beats===
Interscope/Shady released Eminem's ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' on May 23, 2000.

In 2006, Dre and Iovine established [[Beats Electronics]].  Dre had been approached by his attorney to start a line of sneakers, and when he told Iovine about the idea, Iovine said: "You know speakers, not sneakers."  'Beats by Dr. Dre Studio Headphones' were introduced in January 2008 at the annual [[Consumer Electronics Show]]. "It took us two years to get them right, but when I heard I knew it was going to be big," Iovine said in 2010. "It's just like listening to a hit record."  The marketing for Beats integrated endorsements from Interscope artists including [[Gwen Stefani]], [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] and [[Pharrell]], Lady Gaga, and [[will.i.am]].

I had meetings in the South of France, and I said, 'I know this isn't a commercial album, I just want you to do your best,' and they dropped it like a fucking turd.

===Trauma and JCOR===
In 1997, Trauma filed a $100&nbsp;million lawsuit against Interscope that charged the company with fraud and the unfulfillment of a two-year promise to assign No Doubt to Trauma's roster.

In 2002, JCOR founder [[Jay Faires]] filed a $30&nbsp;million breach-of-contract suit that alleged that Interscope had withheld millions of dollars in an effort to drive it out of business.
