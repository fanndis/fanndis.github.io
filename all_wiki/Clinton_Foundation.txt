According to the Clinton Foundation's website, neither Bill Clinton nor his daughter, Chelsea Clinton (both are members of the governing board), draws any salary or receives any income from the Foundation.

Beginning in 2015, the Foundation was accused of wrongdoing, including a bribery and [[pay-to-play]] scheme, but multiple investigations through 2019 found no evidence of malfeasance. ''The New York Times'' reported in September 2020 that a federal prosecutor appointed by attorney general [[Bill Barr]] to investigate the origins of the 2016 FBI [[Crossfire Hurricane (FBI investigation)|Crossfire Hurricane investigation]] had also sought documents and interviews regarding how the FBI handled an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/us/politics/durham-clinton-foundation-investigation.html|title=In Politically Charged Inquiry, Durham Sought Details About Scrutiny of Clintons|first1=Adam|last1=Goldman|first2=William K.|last2=Rashbaum|first3=Nicole|last3=Hong|date=September 24, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Bill Clinton portrait (2015).jpg|thumb|left|Former [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]]]]
The origins of the foundation go back to 1997, when then-president [[Bill Clinton]] was focused mostly on [[fundraising]] for the future [[Clinton Presidential Center]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].<ref name="wapo-story">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-inside-story-of-how-the-clintons-built-a-2-billion-global-empire/2015/06/02/b6eab638-0957-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html?tid=HP_more?tid=HP_more|title=The inside story of how the Clintons built a $2 billion global empire|first1=David A.|last1=Fahrenthold|first2=Tom|last2=Hamburger|first3=Rosalind S.|last3=Helderman |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 2, 2015}}</ref> He founded the William J.

Additional Clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include [[John Podesta]] and Laura Graham.<ref name="nyt-aug13"/>

The foundation's success is spurred by Bill Clinton's worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives, celebrities, and government officials.<ref name="nyt-aug13">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/us/politics/unease-at-clinton-foundation-over-finances-and-ambitions.html?hp&_r=1&&pagewanted=all|title=Unease at Clinton Foundation Over Finances and Ambitions|first1=Nicholas|last1=Confessore|first2=Amy|last2=Chozick|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 13, 2013|page=A1}}</ref> Similarly, the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever Bill suddenly felt an interest in.<ref name="nyt-aug13"/>

Preceding [[Barack Obama]]'s 2009 nomination of Hillary Clinton as [[United States Secretary of State]], Bill Clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the Clinton Presidential Center and the Clinton Global Initiative.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/washington/30clinton.html|title=Bill Clinton to Name Donors as Part of Obama Deal|author=Baker, Peter|author-link=Peter Baker (author)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 29, 2008|access-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> Accordingly, a list of donors was released in December 2008.<ref name=Eclectic>Philip Rucker, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/01/AR2010010101906.html Eclectic bunch of donors – near, far, left, even right – gave to Clinton group], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 2, 2010.</ref>

By 2011, [[Chelsea Clinton]] was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board.<ref name="nyt-aug13"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/foundation-renamed-for-all-three-clintons-89759.html?hp=r1|title=Foundation renamed for all three Clintons|publisher=Politico|access-date=June 13, 2013|first=Maggie|last=Haberman|date=April 8, 2013}}</ref> To raise money for the Foundation, she gave paid speeches, such as her $65,000 2014 address at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City|University of Missouri]] in Kansas City for the opening of the Starr Women's Hall of Fame.<ref>"Chelsea Clinton Made $65,000 for 1-Hour Appearance", ''AOL News'', July 1, 2015.[http://on.aol.com/video/chelsea-clinton-made--65-000-for-1-hour-appearance-518917282?icid=maing-grid7%7Chtmlws-sb-bb%7Cdl16%7Csec3_lnk3%26pLid%3D-1009890104], aol.com; retrieved July 2, 2015.</ref>

In 2013, Hillary Clinton joined the foundation following her [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|tenure as Secretary of State]]. She planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/nyregion/hillary-clinton-joins-husbands-foundation.html?_r=0|title=Clinton Hires Ex-State Dept.

In July 2013, Eric Braverman was named CEO of the foundation.<ref name="pr-ceo">{{cite press release |url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/news-and-media/press-releases-and-statements/eric-braverman-named-chief-executive-officer-of-the-clinton-foundation.html |title=Eric Braverman Named Chief Executive Officer of the Clinton Foundation |publisher=Clinton Foundation |date=July 2, 2013}}</ref> He is a friend and former colleague of Chelsea Clinton from [[McKinsey & Company]].<ref name="nyt-aug13"/><ref name="pol-aug13"/>  At the same time, Chelsea Clinton was named vice chair of the foundation's board.<ref name="nyt-aug13"/><ref name="pr-ceo"/>  The foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the [[Time-Life Building]] in Midtown Manhattan.<ref name="nyt-aug13"/>

Chelsea Clinton moved the organization to an outside review, conducted by the firm of [[Simpson Thacher & Bartlett]]. Its conclusions were made public in mid-2013.<ref name="pol-aug13">{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/hillary-clinton-family-foundation-95468.html?hp=t1|title=Hillary Clinton's next act: The family foundation |first=Maggie |last=Haberman |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=August 13, 2013}}</ref> The main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president's fundraising abilities, how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization, and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond Bill Clinton's lifetime.<ref name="nyt-aug13"/><ref name="pol-aug13"/> [[Dennis Cheng]], a former Hillary Clinton campaign official and State Department deputy chief, was named to oversee a $250 million endowment drive.<ref name="nyt-aug13"/> The review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements, including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities.<ref name="pol-aug13"/> Additionally, the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation's conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process.<ref name="pol-aug13"/>

In January 2015, Braverman announced his resignation. ''[[Politico]]'' attributed the move to being "partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of Clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/clinton-foundation-eric-braverman-115598.html#.VPz65uEYEsI |title=Eric Braverman Tried to Change the Clinton Foundation.

In August 2016 [[The Boston Globe]]'s editorial board suggested that the Clinton Foundation cease accepting donations. ''The Globe''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editorial board offered praise for the foundation's work but added that "as long as either of the Clintons are in public office, or actively seeking it, they should not operate a charity, too" because it represents a conflict of interest and a political distraction.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pager |first1=Tyler |title=Boston Globe calls for freeze on Clinton Foundation donations|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/boston-globe-clinton-foundation-donations-227079|website=Politico|access-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, [[Reuters]] reported that the Clinton Foundation suspected that it had been the target of a [[Cyberwarfare|cyber security breach]]. As a consequence of the suspected cyber security breach, Clinton Foundation officials retained a security firm, [[FireEye]], to evaluate its data systems. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with [[cyberattack]]s that targeted other institutions, such as the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|Democratic National Committee]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-democrats-idUSKCN10T01G|title=Clinton Foundation hired cyber firm after suspected hacking: sources|last1=Hosenball|first1=Mark|last2=Volz|first2=Dustin|last3=Walcott|first3=John|publisher=Reuters|date=August 17, 2016|access-date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>

In October 2016, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that four [[FBI field office]]s—in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, and Little Rock—had been collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether "there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling". In a reported separate investigation, the Washington field office was investigating [[Terry McAuliffe]] before he became a board member of the Clinton Foundation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/laptop-may-include-thousands-of-emails-linked-to-hillary-clintons-private-server-1477854957|title=FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe|first=Devlin|last=Barrett|date=October 30, 2016}}</ref> CNN reported in January 2018 that the [[FBI]] is investigating allegations of corruption at the Clinton Foundation in Arkansas.

===Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI)===

In August 2006, Bill Clinton started a program to fight climate change, the Clinton Foundation's Climate Initiative (CCI)
.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/news-and-media/press-releases-and-statements/press-release-president-clinton-announces-landmark-program-to-reduce-energy-use.html|title=Press Release: President Clinton Announces Landmark Program to Reduce Energy Use in Buildings Worldwide|website=Clinton Foundation}}</ref>  The CCI directly runs various programs to prevent deforestation and to rehabilitate forests and other landscapes worldwide, develop clean energy, and help island nations threatened by rising ocean levels.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Callahan|first1=David|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/6/23/what-the-heck-does-the-clinton-foundation-actually-do.html |title=What the Heck Does the Clinton Foundation Actually DO?|publisher=Inside Philanthropy|date=June 23, 2016 |access-date=January 29, 2017}}</ref>

On August 1, 2006, the Foundation entered into a partnership with the [[Large Cities Climate Leadership Group]], agreeing to provide resources to allow the participating cities to enter into an energy-saving product purchasing consortium and to provide technical and communications support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=8786 |title=Former President Clinton launches climate change initiative |access-date=October 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185404/http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=8786 |archive-date=September 30, 2007  }}</ref>

In May 2007, CCI announced its first project which will help some large cities cut greenhouse gas emissions by facilitating retrofitting of existing buildings. Five large banks committed $1 billion each to help cities and building owners make energy-saving improvements aimed at lowering energy use and energy costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/051607-nr-cf-pr-cci-president-clinton-announces-landmark-program-to-reduce-energy-use-in-buildings-worldwide.htm |title=President Clinton Announces Landmark Program to Reduce Energy Use in Buildings Worldwide |access-date=October 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704034934/http://www.clintonfoundation.org/051607-nr-cf-pr-cci-president-clinton-announces-landmark-program-to-reduce-energy-use-in-buildings-worldwide.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=July 4, 2007}}</ref>  At the 2007 Clinton Global Initiative, Bill Clinton announced the [[1Sky]] campaign to accelerate bold federal policy on global warming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbf.org/resources/resources_show.htm?doc_id=540866|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025102114/http://www.rbf.org/resources/resources_show.htm?doc_id=540866|url-status=dead|title=Rockefeller Brothers Fund: News & Resources: Multimedia: President Clinton Recognizes 1Sky Campaign on Global Warming<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=October 25, 2007}}</ref> The 1Sky campaign supports at least an 80% reduction in climate pollution levels by 2050.

===Clinton Development Initiative (CDI)===
The Clinton Development Initiative, originally the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative, was formed in 2006 as a partnership with Scottish philanthropist Sir [[Tom Hunter]]'s Hunter Foundation to target the root causes of [[poverty in Africa]] and promote sustainable economic growth.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/10/international/europe/10hunter.html |title=A Scotsman Wields a Not-So-Invisible Hand in Africa – NY Times |access-date=October 2, 2007 |work=The New York Times |first=Alan |last=Cowell |date=December 10, 2005}}</ref>

===The Alliance for a Healthier Generation===
The Alliance for a Healthier Generation is a partnership between the Clinton Foundation and the [[American Heart Association]] that was working to end the childhood obesity epidemic in the United States by 2010.

The [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], which provided an initial $8 million to start the Healthy Schools Program, awarded a $20 million grant to expand the program to over 8,000 schools in states with the highest obesity rates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rwjf.org/newsroom/activitydetail.jsp?productid=18234&typeid=109 |title=Healthy Schools Program |access-date=October 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518083124/http://www.rwjf.org/newsroom/activitydetail.jsp?productid=18234&typeid=109 |archive-date=May 18, 2008}}</ref>

At the industry level, the Alliance struck agreements with major food and beverage manufacturers to provide kids with nutritional options, and established nutrition guidelines for school vending machines, stores and cafeterias to promote healthy eating.  Some of the companies involved in these efforts are [[Coca-Cola]], [[Cadbury plc]], [[Campbell Soup Company]], [[Groupe Danone]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] and [[PepsiCo]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/education/07snack.html?_r=1&n=Top%2fNews%2fBusiness%2fCompanies%2fPepsiCo%20Inc%2e&oref=slogin |title=Producers Agree to Send Healthier Foods to Schools – NY Times |access-date=October 2, 2007 |work=The New York Times |first=Marian |last=Burros |date=October 7, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1191823,00.html |title=How Bill Put the Fizz in the Fight Against Fat – TIME Magazine |access-date=October 2, 2007 |work=Time |date=May 7, 2006}}</ref>

===Clinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI)===
In November 2012, Bill Clinton announced the launch of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI). CHMI is a national initiative, building on the Clinton Foundation's work on global health and childhood obesity, that works to improve the health and well-being of people across the United States by activating individuals, communities, and organizations to make meaningful contributions to the health of others. CHMI holds an annual Health Matters conference every January in the [[Coachella Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kesq.com/news/valley-organizations-pleased-clinton-foundation-keeping-health-matters-initiative/41359084|title=Valley organizations pleased Clinton Foundation keeping Health Matters Initiative|last=LAKANA|date=August 25, 2016}}</ref>

===Disaster relief===

The Foundation has funded extensive disaster relief programs following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. Shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit, President [[George W. Bush]] asked former Presidents [[George H. W. Bush]] and Bill Clinton to raise funds to help rebuild the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] region. The two Presidents, having worked together to assist victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami, established the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund to identify and meet the unmet needs in the region, foster economic opportunity, and to improve the quality of life of those affected.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/05/national/nationalspecial/05clinton.html |title=Clinton Lends His Expertise and an Ear in Louisiana – NY Times |access-date=October 2, 2007 |work=The New York Times |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |date=October 5, 2005}}</ref> In the first month after the hurricane, the Fund collected over 42,000 online donations alone; approximately $128.4 million has been received to date from all 50 states and $30.9 million from foreign countries.

Both the foundation and the Clintons personally have been involved in Haiti before and after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref name="nyt-aug13" /><ref name="KQ_Haiti">{{cite web |last1=Katz |first1=Jonathan |title=The King and Queen of Haiti |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/05/clinton-foundation-haiti-117368 |website=Politico |access-date=September 21, 2016 |date=May 4, 2015}}</ref> Bill Clinton was named the head of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC) in 2010 after serving as UN special envoy to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The Clinton Foundation itself raised $30m and played an important part in the creation of the [[Caracol Industrial Park]].

===No Ceilings project===
In 2013, [[Hillary Clinton]] established a partnership between the foundation and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the United Nations [[Fourth World Conference on Women|Fourth World Conference On Women]] in Beijing in 1995.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/13/hillary-clinton-launches-global-data-project-on-women-and-girls/ |title=Hillary Clinton launches global data project on women and girls |work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref name="foundationcenter">{{cite web |url=http://www.philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/wyss-clinton-foundations-partner-on-full-participation-by-women-and-girls |title=Wyss, Clinton Foundations Partner on Full Participation by Women and Girls |author=Foundation Center |work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)}}</ref> This is called "No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project."<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/><ref name="foundationcenter"/> The project released a report in March 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6884850 |title='No Ceilings' Report Shows There's Still A Long Way To Go In Achieving Women's Equality |work=Huffington Post |date=March 17, 2015 |access-date=May 2, 2015}}</ref>

==Charity review sources==
In March 2015, the charity watchdog group [[Charity Navigator]] added the Clinton Foundation to a watch list (a designation meant to warn donors that questions have been raised about an entity's practices), after several news organizations raised questions over donations from corporations and foreign governments. It removed the foundation from its watch list in late December of that year.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Neil|first1=Megan|title=Charity Navigator Removes Clinton Foundation From Watch List|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Charity-Navigator-Removes/234700|website=The Journal of Philanthropy|access-date=November 23, 2016|date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>  In September 2016, it gave it its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after its customary review of the Foundation's financial records and tax statements.<ref>Sullivan, Eileen.

In 2015, based on revenue of $223 million and an [[Expense ratio#Nonprofit organizations|expense ratio]] of 12% the foundation spent in excess of $26 million to complete its mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-foundation/478|title=Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation - Charity Ratings - America's Most Independent Charity Watchdog - CharityWatch}}</ref>

==Private philanthropy==
The Clinton Foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate.  Due to their similar names, the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the Clinton Family Foundation, which is reserved for the Clintons' private philanthropy.  The two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources.<ref name="WSJCFF" /> The significantly smaller Clinton Family Foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving.<ref name="DCAA"/> Headquartered in [[Chappaqua, New York]], it received nearly all of the approximately $14 million the Clintons gave to charity from 2007–13.<ref name="WSJCFF"/>

==Controversies==
===Transparency===
Around 2007, the Clinton Foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency. Although U.S. law did not require charities, including presidential foundations, to disclose the identities of their contributors, critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because Hillary Clinton was [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|running to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States]]. Commentator [[Matthew Yglesias]] opined in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' op-ed that the Clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance
of impropriety.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-yglesias4oct04,0,6253673.story?coll=la-opinion-center |title=Who's Giving Money to Bill Clinton? – ''Los Angeles Times'' |access-date=February 24, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Matthew |last=Yglesias |date=October 4, 2007}}</ref>

A lengthy donors list was then released by the Foundation in December 2008,<ref name=Eclectic/> which included several politically sensitive donors, such as the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] and [[Blackwater Worldwide]].<ref name="ny">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/us/politics/w19clinton.html |work=The New York Times |title=In Clinton List, a Veil Is Lifted on Foundation |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Charlie |last2=Savage |date=December 19, 2008 |access-date=April 30, 2010}}</ref> The Foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that "not even the appearance of a conflict of interest" would exist once Hillary Clinton was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].<ref name="ny"/>

The foundation has been criticized for receiving donations from [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] countries which are seen to oppress women (stoning for adultery, not being able to drive, requiring a male guardian, etc.).

The ethics agreement between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation that had been put into force at the beginning of Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State in 2009 came under scrutiny from the news media during February 2015 as polls showed her the likely 2016 Democratic nominee for president.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2016-polls-show-clinton-leads-key-states-gop-field-wide-n306106 |title=2016 Polls Show Clinton Leads in Key States, GOP Field Wide Open |date=February 15, 2015 |work=NBC News}}</ref>  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-government-gifts-to-clinton-foundation-on-the-rise-1424223031 |title=Foreign Government Gifts to Clinton Foundation on the Rise |first1=James V. |last1=Grimaldi |first2=Rebecca |last2=Ballhaus |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 17, 2015}}</ref>  Contributions from foreign donors, which are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the U.S., constitute a major portion of the foundation's income. An investigation by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' of 2014 donations showed that there was "substantial overlap between the Clinton political machinery and the foundation". The investigation revealed that almost half of the major donors who had backed [[Ready PAC|Ready for Hillary]], a group which supported her 2016 presidency bid, had given at least $10,000 to the foundation, either personally or through foundations or companies they run. The Clinton Foundation's chief communications officer Craig Minassian explained that it is a "false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldn’t also support philanthropic work."<ref name="wapo-2b"/>

A subsequent ''The Washington Post'' inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the Secretary's tenure found, in addition to six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became Secretary as envisioned under the agreement, one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review, but did not.<ref name="wapo-6-1">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html|title=Foreign governments gave millions to foundation while Clinton was at State Dept.|first1=Rosalind S.|last1=Helderman|first2=Tom|last2=Hamburger|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 25, 2015}}</ref> Foundation officials said that if the former Secretary decided to run for president in 2016, they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations.<ref name="wapo-6-1"/> But in general, they stressed that, "As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, organizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way.

According to the report, the subpoena focused on "documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from federal government during Hillary Clinton's term as secretary of state" and "also asked for records related to [[Huma Abedin]], longtime Clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation, Clinton's personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons."<ref name="SUBPOENA-WP">Hamburger, Tom.
