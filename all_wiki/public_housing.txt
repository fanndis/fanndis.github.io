'''Public housing''' is a form of [[housing tenure]] in which the property is usually owned by a [[government authorities|government authority]], either central or local.

'''Social housing''' is any [[rental housing]] that may be owned and managed by [[the state]], by [[non-profit organizations]], or by a combination of the two, usually with the aim of providing [[affordable housing]].

== History ==
[[File:Boundary Street 1890.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Boundary Estate|Boundary Street]] 1890; three years later, the [[London County Council]] began [[slum clearance]].|alt=]]

Social housing had existed sporadically prior to modern developments. The oldest still in use is the 16th century [[Fuggerei]] in [[Augsburg]], [[Bavaria]].

The origins of modern municipal housing lie in the dramatic urban population increase caused by the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th century. In the large cities of the period, many social commentators, such as [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. [[Henry Mayhew]], visiting [[Bethnal Green]], wrote in ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'':
{{quote|text=... roads were unmade, often mere alleys, houses small and without foundations, subdivided and often around unpaved courts. An almost total lack of drainage and sewerage was made worse by the ponds formed by the excavation of brickearth. Pigs and cows in back yards, noxious trades like boiling tripe, melting tallow, or preparing cat's meat, and slaughter houses, dustheaps, and "lakes of putrefying [[night soil]]" added to the filth.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22751 |contribution=Bethnal Green: Building and Social Conditions from 1837 to 1875 |title=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green |year=1998 |pages=120–126 |accessdate=14 November 2006}}</ref>}}

Some [[philanthropists]] began to provide housing in [[Apartment building|tenement blocks]], and some factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as [[Saltaire]] in 1853 and [[Port Sunlight]] in 1888. It was in 1885, after the report from a [[Royal Commission]] in England, that the state first took an interest. This led to the [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885|Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1885]], which empowered [[Local Government Board]]s to shut down unhealthy properties and encouraged them to improve the housing in their areas.

The [[City of London Corporation]] built [[tenements]] in the [[Farringdon Road]] in 1865.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tarn|first=J.

[[Arthur Morrison]] wrote the influential ''[[A Child of the Jago]]'', an account of the life of a child in the slum, which sparked a public outcry. Construction of the [[Boundary Estate]] was begun in 1890 by the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] and completed by the then-recently formed [[London County Council]] in 1900.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22752 |title=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green |year=1998 |pages=126–132 |accessdate=14 November 2006}}</ref>

The success of this project spurred many local councils to embark on similar construction schemes in the early 20th century. The [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s [[Garden city movement|garden city ideas]] led to the leafy [[London County Council]] [[cottage estate]]s such as firstly [[Totterdown Fields]] and later [[Old Oak and Wormholt|Wormholt and Old Oak]]. The [[First World War]] indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the [[British Army]] was noted with alarm. In 1916, 41% of conscripts were unfit to serve. This led to a campaign known as ''[[Homes fit for heroes]]'' and in 1919 the Government first compelled councils to provide housing, helping them to do so through the provision of [[subsidies]], under the [[Housing Act 1919]].<ref name="Hollow 2011">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1593132 |title=Suburban Ideals on England's Interwar Council Estates |first=Matthew |last=Hollow |year=2011 |accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> Public housing projects were tried out in some European countries and the United States in the 1930s, but only became widespread globally after [[the Second World War]].

In Canada, public housing is usually a block of purpose-built [[subsidized housing]] operated by a government agency, often simply referred to as community housing, with easier-to-manage townhouses. Canada, especially [[Toronto]], still maintains large high-rise clustered developments in working-class neighborhoods, a system that has fallen into disfavour in both the United States and the United Kingdom. However, [[Toronto Community Housing Corporation|Toronto Community Housing]], the second largest public housing agency in North America, has a variety of buildings and communities ranging from individual houses to townhouse communities and mid-rise and high-rise apartments in both working-class and middle-class neighborhoods that house a significant number of low-income Canadians.

Following the decentralisation of public housing to local municipalities, [[Social Housing Services Corporation]] (SHSC) was created in the [[Province of Ontario]] in 2002 to provide group services for social housing providers (public housing, [[non-profit housing]] and [[co-operative housing]]). It is a non-profit corporation which provides Ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing, insurance, investment and information services that add significant value to their operations.

Recently,{{When|date=February 2020}} there has been a move toward the integration of public housing with market housing and other uses. Revitalization plans for properties such as in the notorious [[Downtown Eastside]] of [[Vancouver]], and [[Regent Park]], [[Lawrence Heights]] and [[Alexandra Park, Toronto|Alexandra Park]] in Toronto, aim to provide better accommodations for low-income residents, and connect them to the greater community. In Toronto, for instance, the aims of the reconstruction plans of Regent Park are to better integrate it into the traditional grid of streets, improve leisure and cultural amenities, and force poor people out of the downtown Toronto. However, the residents of these communities have had little effective input in the plans and have had mixed reactions to the construction.

In 2014, [[Vancouver]], long considered one of the least affordable cities in the world,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.biv.com/article/2015/1/ho-hum-vancouver-still-second-least-afforda/g | title=Vancouver second-least affordable city in group of nine developed countries for at least fourth straight year | last=O'Brien | first=Frank | date=21 January 2015 | publisher=Business in Vancouver | access-date=15 March 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> changed the definition of social housing to mean rental housing in which a minimum of 30 percent of dwelling units are occupied by households that cannot pay market rents, due to lack of income.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.straight.com/news/412421/city-vancouver-revisits-definition-social-housing | title=City of Vancouver revisits definition of social housing | last=Pablo | first=Carlito | date =18 March 2015 | newspaper =Georgia Straight | access-date=18 March 2015}}</ref>

At the end of the Second World War, enriched by US investments and an [[oil boom]], Mexico had its first demographic boom, in which the primary destination for rural immigrants was [[Mexico City]]. {{lang|es|[[Mario Pani|Mario Pani Darqui]]|italic=no}}, a famous architect at time, was charged to build its first large-scale public housing project. Built for the {{lang|es|[[Dirección de Pensiones Civiles y Retiro]]}} (the National Pensions office, today ISSSTE), the {{lang|es|Centro Urbano}} (or {{lang|es|Multifamiliar}}) {{lang|es|Miguel Alemán|italic=no}} (1947–50) and the {{lang|es|Centro Urbano}} (or {{lang|es|Multifamiliar}}) {{lang|es|Benito Juárez|italic=no}} (1951–52), both in the {{lang|es|[[Colonia Roma]]|italic=no}}, introduced formal ideas from [[Le Corbusier]]'s {{lang|fr|[[Ville Radieuse]]}} into the urban fabric.

His later project, the [[Conjunto Urbano Nonoalco Tlatelolco|{{lang|es|Conjunto Urbano|italic=no|nocat=y}} {{lang|nah|Tlatelolco Nonoalco|italic=no|nocat=y}}]] built in 1960–65, was meant to develop one of the poorest parts of the city, [[Tlatelolco, Mexico City|{{lang|es|Santiago|italic=no|nocat=y}} {{lang|nah|Tlatelolco|italic=no|nocat=y}}]], which was becoming a slum. Unfortunately, after a while, instead of giving the residences to the previous residents of {{lang|nah|Tlatelolco|italic=no}}, corruption took place and most of the dwellings were handed to state employees.

During the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|earthquake of 1985]], both the {{lang|es|Benito Juárez|italic=no}} and {{lang|nah|Nonoalco-Tlaltelolco|italic=no}} complexes suffered major damage, with some buildings collapsing. Today most of the {{lang|es|Multifamiliar Benito Juárez|italic=no}} has been demolished.

Mexico has had experience with housing projects since {{lang|es|[[Porfirio Díaz]]|italic=no}}'s regime (1877–1880, 1884–1911). One of those still remains and is the {{lang|es|Barrio}} of {{lang|es|Loreto|italic=no}} in {{lang|es|[[San Ángel]], [[Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City|Álvaro Obregón]]|italic=no}} in Mexico City, that was a project for a paper factory workers.

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, government involvement in housing for the poor was chiefly in the introduction of [[building standards]]. [[Atlanta, Georgia]]'s [[Techwood Homes]], dedicated in 1935, were the nation's first public housing project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.atlhousing.org/introduction/ |title=Atlanta Housing Interplay|accessdate=2 May 2018 |publisher=Emory Center for Digital Scholarship |quote=Plotting Atlanta on the Interwar Housing Map }}</ref> Most housing communities were developed from the 1930s onward and initial public housing was largely [[slum]] clearance, with the requirement insisted upon by private builders that for every unit of public housing constructed, a unit of private housing would be demolished.

This also eased concerns of the establishment by eliminating or altering neighborhoods commonly considered a source of disease, and reflected [[Progressive Era|progressive-era]] sanitation initiatives. Moreover, public housing, along with the [[Federal-aid highway program|Federal Highway Program]], demolished the older, substandard housing of communities of color across the United States.

However, the advent of makeshift tent communities during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] caused concern in the Administration. The Federal public housing program was created by the 1937 Act, in which operations were "sustained primarily by tenant rents."<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCarty |first1=Maggie |title=Introduction to Public Housing |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41654.pdf |website=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=May 30, 2020}}</ref> As a result, public housing in its earliest decades was usually much more working-class and middle-class and white than it was by the 1970s. Many Americans associate large, multi-story towers with public housing, but early projects were actually low-rise, though [[Le Corbusier]] [[city block|superblock]]s caught on before World War II.

A unique US public housing initiative was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late [[New Deal]] (1940–42) under the auspices of the [[Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division]] of the [[Federal Works Agency]] under the direction of [[Colonel Lawrence Westbrook]]. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as [[Housing cooperative|mutual housing corporations]] owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort.

Public housing was only built with the blessing of the local government, and projects were almost never built on suburban [[greenfield land|greenfields]], but through regeneration of older neighborhoods. The destruction of [[tenement]]s and eviction of their low-income residents consistently created problems in nearby neighborhoods with "soft" real estate markets. Houses, apartments or other residential units are usually subsidized on a rent-geared-to-income (RGI) basis. Some communities have now embraced a mixed income, with both assisted and market rents, when allocating homes as they become available.

A significant change in the program took place in 1969, with the passage of the Brooke Amendment.  Rents now became set at 25% of a tenant's income with the result that the program began serving the "poorest tenants."<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCarty |first1=Maggie |title=Introduction to Public Housing |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41654.pdf |website=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=May 30, 2020}}</ref>

Other attempts to solve these problems include the 1974<ref>1974 Housing and Community Development Act</ref> [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] Housing Program, which encourages the private sector to construct affordable homes, and subsidized public housing.  This assistance can be "project-based", subsidizing properties, or "tenant-based", which provides tenants with a voucher, accepted by some landlords.

It is popularly called an {{lang|es|apartamento}} (English: 'apartment'), whether or not its resident owns the unit or lives it as a renter.)

The public-owned housing system was established when the [[Communist Party of China]] started the [[planned economy]] in the 1950s as part of its [[Great Leap Forward]]. The system was funded by the central government's budget and were administered and distributed by state-owned enterprises. The occupants of the public housing were usually the employees of the enterprises and their family, who were subject to pay rent at a very low price. The size and the type of room the households received were dependent on their job title or administrative level. The central government found it difficult to upkeep the public housing due to the low rent it received; the distribution policy that was intended to be "[[equalitarianism]]" was actually corrupt.<ref name="gongfang">{{cite book|author=贾绍华|title=房地产业健康发展的税收政策研究：基于海南国际旅游岛房地产业的分析|publisher=中国财政经济出版社|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hu9_DwAAQBAJ&q=%E5%85%AC%E6%88%BF+%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E&pg=PT143|isbn=9-787-5095-4636-9|language=zh|date=15 July 2013}}</ref>

In the recent years,{{When|date=February 2020}} the government provides public housing through various sources, such as new housing, abandoned properties, and old flats which are rented at a low price and called "Lian Zu Fang" (literally 'low-rent house' or 'low-rent housing', {{lang-zh|廉租房}}). Additional housing is built by providing free land and exemption from fees to estate developers, the resulting houses are called "Jing Ji Shi Yong Fang" (literally 'the economically applicable housing', {{lang-zh|经济适用房}}).

The concept of the low-cost rental housing can be traced to a 1998 policy statement,{{clarify|date=January 2012}} but did not truly take off until 2006 due to limited funding and administrative problems. The provision of more affordable housing is one of the key components of China's [[Twelfth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Twelfth Five-year Plan]], which targets the construction of 36 million homes by 2015.

Indonesia has undertaken ''One Million Houses program'' for low-income people. The program has been implementing since 2015 to achieve an ambitious target of building 10 million houses. The proportion of the housing is 70 percent for low-income people and 30 percent for non-low-income people. This program is a joint movement between the Central Government, regional governments, real estate developers and the community. The program is targeted to reach one million housing units annually.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/05/jokowi-inaugurates-low-cost-houses-in-bekasi.html|title=Jokowi inaugurates low-cost houses in Bekasi|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://en.antaranews.com/news/98557/indonesia-to-start-implementation-of-one-million-houses-program|title=Indonesia To Start Implementation of One Million Houses Program|newspaper=Antara News|accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref> In 2015, about 700,000 homes were built, increasing to approximately 800,000 in 2016 and around 904,000 by the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/06/govt-to-continue-1-million-houses-program.html|title=Govt to continue 1 million houses program|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://gapurajakarta.com/news/2018/09/10/will-indonesia-finally-achieve-jokowis-one-million-houses/1536562694|title=Will Indonesia finally achieve Jokowi's One Million Houses?|newspaper=Gapura Jakarta|accessdate=26 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Danchi}}
{{nihongo|Danchi|団地|literally "group land"}} is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings or houses of a particular style and design, typically built as public housing by government authorities.

The Japan Housing Corporation (JHC), now known as the [[Urban Renaissance Agency]] (UR), was founded in 1955. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the JHC built many {{lang|ja-Latn|danchi}} in suburban areas to offset the increasing housing demand during the [[Japanese economic miracle|post-World War II economic boom]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Tsutomu |last=Yamashita |title=Showa 30s Movie Revives Interest in Danchi |work=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |page=15 |date=9 December 2007 }}</ref> It introduced the Japanese [[salaryman]] to a life around the [[nuclear family]] in contrast with the multi-generation homes before the war.<ref name="NYT 2017-11-30">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/world/asia/japan-lonely-deaths-the-end.html |title=A Generation in Japan Faces a Lonely Death |author=Norimitsu Onichi |date=30 November 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref>

The rent payment for a {{lang|ja-Latn|danchi}} is much cheaper than that of an apartment or a mortgage, but for a public {{lang|ja-Latn|danchi}} the prospective tenant must usually participate in a lottery to be assigned an open apartment.

{{Main|Public housing in Singapore}}
In Singapore, the public housing program, particularly the planning and development of new public housing and the allocation of rental units and resale of existing ownership units, is managed by the [[Housing and Development Board]]. Day-to-day management of public housing communities has been delegated to Town Councils headed by the local members of parliament.

In 2018, 78.7% of Singaporeans live in public residential developments, ranging from studio units to executive condominiums provided by the HDB, a major factor in Singapore having one of the highest home-ownership rates - over 90% of the resident population - in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singapore Resident Households by dwellings|url=https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/-/media/Files/visualising_data/infographics/Population/singapore-population13022019|accessdate=13 February 2019}}</ref>

Public housing was an important issue right from the foundation of the [[Republic of German-Austria]] in 1918. The population was faced with a great deal of uncertainty particularly as regards food and fuel. This led to a significant number of less affluent people to move to the periphery of towns, often building makeshift homes to be closer to where they could grow food. They were called {{lang|de|Siedler}} ('settlers'). As the political situation became stabilised with foundation of the [[First Austrian Republic]] in September 1919, the {{lang|de|Siedler}} movement started creating formal organizations like the [[Austrian Association for Settlements and Small Gardens]].<ref name=Vossoughian>{{cite book |last1=Vossoughian |first1=Nader |title=Otto Neurath: The Language of the Global Polis |date=2008 |publisher=NAi |location=The Hague |isbn=978-90-5662-350-0 }}</ref> The electoral victory of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] in the elections for the Viennese {{lang|de|Gemeinderat}} (city parliament) gave rise to [[Red Vienna]]. Part of their programme was the provision of decent homes for the Viennese working class who made up the core of their supporters. Hence the German word {{lang|de|Gemeindebau}} (plural: {{lang|de|Gemeindebauten}}) for "municipality building". In Austria, it refers to residential buildings erected by a municipality, usually to provide public housing.  These have been an important part of the architecture and culture of [[Vienna]] since the 1920s.

=== Belgium ===
Social housing is a responsibility of the regions in Belgium. The regions don't directly own the houses, semi-private social housing corporations do. The government regulates and mostly finances this corporations. Below a certain income limit, people are eligible for social housing. Because there is a major shortage of social housing in Belgium, other priority conditions are often imposed, such as having children to care for.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sociale huisvesting: inschrijving en toewijzing |url=https://www.belgium.be/nl/huisvesting/sociale_huisvesting/inschrijving_en_toewijzing |website=Belgium.be |publisher=Federal Government of Belgium |accessdate=27 December 2018|date=9 April 2015 }}</ref> Social housing accounts for approximately 6.5% of the Belgian housing market. This is much lower than neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands and France. As of 2018 [[Flanders]], [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]] are responsible for 280.687 social houses, 212.794 people are on the waiting list. For the people on the waiting list there are other possibilities such as subsidies and sociale rental agencies in Flanders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Feiten en cijfers over sociale huisvesting |url=http://www.armoedebestrijding.be/cijfers_sociale_huisvesting.htm |website=Armoedebestrijding.be |publisher=Steunpunt tot bestrijding van armoede, bestaansonzekerheid en sociale uitsluiting |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, public housing is called {{lang|da|Almennyttigt Boligbyggeri}} and is owned and administered by approximately 700 self-governing, democratic and non-profit organizations by and for the tenants themselves. Many of the public housing organizations in Denmark are rooted in the early history of the [[labor union]]s and currently forms about 20% of the total housing stock with about 7,500 departments countrywide. A membership of a housing organization is usually required to obtain a rental and they are granted with regard to length of membership.<ref name=FactSheet>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbbl.dk/sites/mbbl.dk/files/dokumenter/publikationer/fact_sheet_on_the_danish_social_housing_sector.oct2014.pdf|title=Fact sheet on the Danish social housing sector |publisher=Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs |accessdate=28 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204220306/http://www.mbbl.dk/sites/mbbl.dk/files/dokumenter/publikationer/fact_sheet_on_the_danish_social_housing_sector.oct2014.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2015 }}</ref><ref name=retsinformation>{{cite web |url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/r0710.aspx?id=151792 |title=Almenboligloven |trans-title=Law on Public Housing |website=retsinformation.dk |publisher=The Department of Civil Affairs |language=da |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}</ref>

Although the buildings are owned and administered by self-governing and economically independent organizations, the State of Denmark is strongly regulating public housing in the country. By law, the municipalities have access to 25% of the rentals, usually reserving them for the poor, the unemployed, the disabled or mentally ill or any other group dependent on social benefits from the municipality. Over the years, these regulations have created many 'especially vulnerable residential areas' – so called "ghettos" – within the country. Danish public housing has never had any income restrictions, but in recent years new state regulations has made it mandatory for several of them to favor fully employed renters and disfavor unemployed or part-time employed people. This is a relatively new effort by the state to counter the ghettoisation, which is now an officially recognized problem countrywide.<ref name=FactSheet/><ref name=retsinformation/>

As in Sweden, state and municipal policies carried out throughout the first decade of the 21st century, has led to an increased privatization of public housing. In many areas, residents have been offered to buy their own flats, thereby effectively changing the status of the property. The privatization of public housing was initiated as part of an ideological program by the right wing governments of the early 21st century and was launched a few years after the closure of the former Ministry of Housing Affairs in 2001.<ref>The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had been in operation for more than 50 years, from 1947–2001.</ref> The former ministry was re-opened as Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs in October 2011, when a new coalition government led by [[socialdemokraterne|social-democrats]] was formed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mbbl.dk/english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105085928/http://www.mbbl.dk/english|url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2011 |title=Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs |date=29 April 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boligforskning.dk/housing-problems |title=Present and Future Housing Problems in Denmark – and predictable Changes in Housing Policy |publisher=Center for Housing and Welfare |author=Hans Kristensen |date=2 July 2005 |accessdate=28 May 2015 }}</ref>

=== Finland ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}
The earliest public housing project in [[Finland]] was in [[Helsinki]]. In 1909, four wooden houses designed by the architect {{lang|sv|A. Nyberg|italic=no}} were built on {{lang|fi|Kirstinkuja|italic=no}} (formerly {{lang|fi|Kristiinankatu|italic=no}}) for the city's workers. The residents were mainly working-class families with several children. The apartments had an average of five people per room, sometimes up to eight. The tiny apartments were equipped with running water, a pantry and an attic cupboard. Every apartment had its own toilet in the cellar. Electric lighting was installed in 1918.

The homes and lives of worker families in Helsinki from 1909 to 1985 are presented in a museum near the {{lang|fi|Linnanmäki|italic=no}} amusement park.

After [[World War II]], the population increased at a rate previously unknown, the rural exodus increased, while war damage had reduced the number of houses in many cities. Rental prices dramatically rose, and the government made a law in 1948 to block them, effectively ending the economic benefits of housing investment. Rents were gradually deregulated until debate in the 1980s led to the current rental law of 1989 theoretically balancing landlord and tenant relations. However, there was a major homelessness crisis in the winter of 1953–4 and the necessary laws were gradually mobilized producing high levels of construction almost continuously from the 1960s. Social landlords were a major source of expertise as well as construction actors with links to national and local bodies.<ref name="Jean-Marc Stébé 1998">{{cite book |author=Jean-Marc Stébé |date=1998 |title=Le logement social en France |trans-title=Social housing in France |location=Paris |publisher=[[Presses Universitaires de France]] }}</ref> The construction industry was at the time inadequate so political support was needed

It is incorrect to refer to French social housing as public housing. The origins of French social housing lie in the private sector, with the first State aid provided to limited-profit companies by the {{lang|fr|loi Siegfried}} in 1793. The originally socialist idea was promoted by some French employers in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Public housing companies followed before World War I.<ref name="Jean-Marc Stébé 1998"/> There are still different social housing movements, public, private and some cooperative.  Social landlord organizations all have similar regulation and similar access to government loans but there are significant differences<ref>Much is found in the {{lang|fr|Code de la Construction et de l'Habitation}} (the Building and Housing Code), Book IV (with social housing allocation and funding elsewhere in the Code).</ref>

The government launched a series of major construction plans, including the creation of [[new town]]s ({{lang|fr|villes nouvelles}}) and new suburbs with [[HLM]] ({{lang|fr|Habitation à Loyer Modéré}}, "low-rent housing"). The state had the funds and [[eminent domain|the legal means to acquire the land]] and could provide some advantages to the companies that then built its huge housing complexes of hundreds of apartments. Quality was also effectively regulated, resulting in decent or even top quality housing for the standard of the 1950s and 1960s. The construction of HLMs were subject to much political debate. Much smaller developments are now the norm. This housing is now generally referred to as {{lang|fr|l'habitat social}}, a slightly wider sphere than just housing.

France still retains this system, a recent law making it an obligation for every town to have at least 20% HLM. Nowadays HLM represents roughly half of the rental market (46% in 2006).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/donnees_chiffrees.pdf |title=Quelques données chiffrées sur le parc locatif privé |trans-title=Some data on the private rental market |accessdate=22 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603095252/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/donnees_chiffrees.pdf |archive-date=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Social housing is not all for disadvantaged people who are just one of the target groups.

While they succeeded in giving lower-income families a place to live in the drive to provide popular housing, this system also led to the creation of suburban ghettos, with a problem of disrepair. There has been a long-term problem of gradual impoverishment of social tenants<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Michel Amzallag |author2=Claude Taffin |year=2003 |title=Le Logement Social |trans-title=Social Housing |location=Paris |publisher=[[LGDJ]] }}</ref> There, deprived strata of the population, mostly of immigrant origin and suffering massive under-employment, might in the past have been left to simmer away from the more affluent urban centres, sometimes becoming rife with social tensions and violence. This affects a minority of social housing but has a high profile and still produces serious tension.

Tackling this problem at its roots is all but simple, and social mix policies can break up populations seen as difficult by redevelopment. This has not had the hoped for results. It has also been sought to resolve the problem of access to the system by disadvantaged people by a new system where certain groups can apply to court to be housed if refused, the "right to housing".  This tends to intensify the controversy over social housing allocation, who should be housed.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Noémie Houard (coord.)&thinsp;: ''Loger l'Europe.

=== Germany ===
{{Main|Plattenbau}}

Between 1925 and 1930 Germany was the site of innovative and extensive municipal public housing projects, mostly in [[Berlin]], Hamburg, [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]].  These housing estates ({{lang|de|Siedlungen}}), were made necessary by the dreadful living conditions of pre-war urban tenements.  The right to healthy housing was written into the 1919 [[Weimar Constitution]], but few homes were built until the economy stabilised in 1925.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The new German housing estates were low-rise, no more than five stories, and in suburban settings.  Residents were provided access to light, air, and sun.  The size, shape, orientation and architectural style of Germany's public housing were informed by the recent experience of the Viennese, the Dutch, the anti-urban [[Garden City Movement]] in Britain, the new industrialized mass-production and pre-fabrication building techniques, the novel use of steel and glass, and by the progressive-liberal policies of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 1930 in the industrial city of {{lang|de|[[Dessau]]|italic=no}}, the {{lang|de|[[Laubenganghäuser]]}} ('Houses with Balcony Access') were designed by [[Bauhaus]] director {{lang|de|[[Hannes Meyer]]|italic=no}} for a [[housing cooperative]] that wanted apartments it could let for no more than a quarter of the occupant's income. Working on a tight budget inspired money and space saving innovations, such as using balcony walkways for access to the apartments rather than having internal corridors and clever use of the internal space in the {{convert|47|m2|abbr=on|adj=on}} apartments.<ref>[https://www.laubenganghaeuser.de/ Wohnungsgenossenschaft Dessau.

Beyond technical research May also published two magazines and embarked on a significant public-relations project, with films and classes and public exhibitions, to make {{lang|de|[[Neues Bauen]]}} acceptable to the public.  In the late 1920s the principles of equal access to {{lang|de|Licht, Luft und Sonne}} ('light, air and sun') and the social effects of a state-guaranteed {{lang|de|Existenzminimum}} ("minimum subsistence level") became a matter of lively popular debate all over Germany.  One indirect result of this publicity was the American housing movement: a young [[Catherine Bauer]] attended one of May's conferences in 1930, and wrote her influential book ''Modern Housing'' (1934) based on research done in Frankfurt and with Dutch architect {{lang|nl|[[JJP Oud]]|italic=no}}.<ref>{{cite book |author=Catherine Bauer |year=1974 |title=Modern Housing |location=New York |publisher=Arno Press |orig-year=1934 }}</ref>

Increasing pressure from the rising [[Nazism|Nazis]] brought this era to an end in 1933.  A majority of the German public housing experts had social democrat or communist sympathies and were forced out of the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In [[East Germany]], the communist administration built monolithic {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} apartment blocks and estates. Most new residential buildings from the 1960s onward were built in this style, as it was a quick and relatively cheap way to solve the country's severe housing shortage, which had been caused by wartime bombing raids and the [[flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|large influx of German refugees from further east]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, public housing and [[halting site]]s (sites used by semi-nomadic [[Irish Traveller|Traveller]] communities) have been built by local authorities and are known as [[Local Authority Accommodation]]. [[Dublin Corporation]] and the former [[Dublin County Council]] provided the lion's share of Irish local authority housing, with [[County Longford]] having the largest ratio of local authority to private housing in the state. The government has promoted tenant purchase on favourable terms, and many former social housing areas are now completely or almost completely privately owned. Housing associations now play a significant role in social housing provision. As the Irish state's ability to borrow is diminished government policy favours an increased role for private financing of housing associations instead of capital grants for local authorities.

=== Netherlands ===

In the [[Netherlands]], the rent for the cheaper rental homes is kept low through governmental oversight and regulation. These types of homes are known as {{lang|nl|sociale huurwoningen}}.

In practice this is accomplished by non-profit private housing foundations or associations ({{lang|nl|toegelaten instellingen}}). Due to frequent mergers the number of these organizations dropped to around 430 by 2009. They manage 2.4&nbsp;million dwellings. The majority of the low-rent apartments in the Netherlands are owned by such organisations. Since the policy changed in 1995 the social housing organizations have become financially independent, focusing on their role as social entrepreneurs. In most Dutch municipalities there came to exist a certain minimum capacity of social housing throughout the last decades. In many cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] the percentage of social housing approaches or even passes 50 percent. The public (financial) supervision is done by the central fund for housing ({{lang|nl|Centraal Fonds Volkshuisvesting}}).

The Dutch housing policy is based on a concept of universal access to affordable housing for all and the prevention of segregation.

Beginning in 1974, systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a "multilaterally developed socialist society". In 2012, 2.7&nbsp;million flats date from the communist period, accounting for 37% of total housing in Romania and for about 70% in cities and towns. Subsequent to post-communist privatization, the homeownership rate in this form of housing reached of 99.9%.<ref>NIS, 2010 Statistical Yearbook 2010: Time Series 1990–2009 (National Institute of Statistics: Bucharest) http://www.insse.ro/cms/rw/pages/anuarstatistic2010.en.do {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113154228/http://www.insse.ro/cms/rw/pages/anuarstatistic2010.en.do |date=13 November 2012 }}</ref> The new Home Owner Associations (HOAs) were challenged internally by the cumulative effect of defaulting contributions, lack of affordability and the established practice of casual resident service in HOAs, which often triggered mismanagement. On the other hand, HOAs were challenged from outside by non-effective mechanisms to address their internal problems, such as non-existent fast court procedures against defaulting, poor financial assistance to socially disadvantaged households and a private sector unprepared to take on condominium management.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Soaita | first1 = A.

Spaniards' reluctance to home rental, and government spending cuts in the 1980s, reduced rented public housing in Spain to a minimum. Rented public houses were relatively common in the [[Francoist Spain|Franco era]] (1939–75). With the advent of [[history of Spain (1975–present)|democracy]] and the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|1978 Constitution]], the management of social housing depended mostly on the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous regions]]. This resulted in a wide variety of laws, which make the issue highly dependent on the region.

In spite of this, a scheme for {{lang|es|viviendas de protección oficial}} (VPO) has been widely used, consisting of local councils allowing for building contractors and developers to build in public sites or with public loans on condition that a certain percentage of apartments remain subsidized and under control of the local authorities. This is known as {{lang|es|VPO de promoción privada}} ('privately developed'), as opposed to the {{lang|es|VPO de promoción pública}} ('publicly developed'), in which the whole property is owned and managed by a government authority.

A new plan ({{lang|es|Plan estatal español de vivienda y rehabilitación para el período 2009–2012}}) was put forward by the {{lang|es|[[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|Rodríguez Zapatero]]|italic=no}} government, aiming to make near a million homes available for public housing, relying both on new construction and refurbishment of unused houses.

Major parts of Spanish cities have been expanded{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} in the last 20 years with projects heavily dependent on public and collective housing projects, which has stressed its importance inside the main architecture schools, that have answered the challenge with the development of several specialized courses and formation plans, such as the Madrid UPM - ETH Zurich combined MCH Master in Collective Housing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mchmaster.com/ |title=MCH: Master in Collective Housing |language=es |access-date=2018-06-06 }}</ref>

Swedish public housing is called {{lang|sv|Allmännyttigt bostadsföretag}}, and consists mostly of flats owned by the local council. Unlike its counterparts in Great Britain, for instance, the Swedish Public Housing has never had any income restrictions. Instead, for large parts of the period between 1920 and 1990 (for instance, during the era of [[Million Programme]]), the public housing companies such as {{lang|sv|[[Svenska Bostäder]]|italic=no}} were the major operators in housing projects as well as in projects aiming to acquire old and worn down buildings. Although not carrying out house-building nor acquisition projects in recent times, the policies lead to a ubiquitous presence of publicly-owned buildings throughout the cities of Sweden, including attractive urban areas, with a rather wide range of income among the tenants.

Policies carried out in the Swedish cities throughout the first decade of the 21st century have led to the tenants of public housing having bought the publicly owned buildings in which they live, which in turn has led to a significant decrease of publicly owned buildings in attractive urban areas, subsequently leading to an increased development of processes related to gentrification.

Forms of housing projects may vary in [[Slovakia]]. In the former [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]) during the [[Communist era of Czechoslovakia|communist era]] in Czechoslovakia, a construction of large [[housing estate]]s ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''[[sídlisko]]'', [[Czech language|Czech]]: ''sídliště'') was an important part of building plans in the former Czechoslovakia. The government wanted to provide large quantities of fast and [[affordable housing]] and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a "collectivist nature" in people. People living in these housing projects can either usually own their [[apartment]]s or rent them, usually through a private landlord. There's usually a mix of [[social class]]es in these housing projects.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zachrante nase panelaky, tlaci na EU Cesko|url=http://reality.ihned.cz/1-10009430-15804060-K00000_detail-92|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822011039/http://reality.ihned.cz/1-10009430-15804060-K00000_detail-92|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-08-22|last=iHNed.cz|website=ihned.cz/|language=cs|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom public housing is often referred to by the British public as "[[council house|council housing]]" and "council estates", based on the historical role of district and borough councils in running public housing. Mass council house building began in about 1920 in order to replace older and dilapidated properties.<ref name="Hollow 2011"/> This followed the [[Addison Act|1919 'Addison' Act]] and the provison of central state subsidies; some local authority or municipal housing was provided before 1914.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcastleareas.wordpress.com/2019/08/11/100-years-exhibition-the-1919-act/|title=100 years exhibition – the 1919 Act|last=Geography|first=Kay's|date=11 August 2019|website=Newcastle residential areas|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>

Housing was a major policy area under [[First Wilson ministry|Wilson's Labour government]], 1964 to 1970, with an accelerated pace of new building, as there was still a great deal of unfit housing needing replacement. Tower blocks, first built in the 1950s, featured prominently in this era. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the nation's housing total,<ref name="shorthistory">A Short History of the Labour Party by Alastair J. Reid and Henry Pelling</ref> while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Allowing for demolitions, 1.3&nbsp;million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970.<ref>Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History of the British Labour Party'', Palgrave, {{ISBN|978-0-333-92908-7}}</ref> To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income house buyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to [[mortgage interest relief at source|tax relief on mortgage interest payments]]).<ref>Housing policy: an introduction by Paul N.

Since the 1970s, non-profit [[housing association]]s have been operating an increasing share of social housing properties in the United Kingdom.  From 1996 they have also been known as Registered Social Landlords (RSLs), and public housing has been referred to as "social housing" to encompass both councils and RSLs.  Despite being non-profit based, RSLs generally charge higher rents than councils.  However, the Westminster Government introduced a "rent re-structuring" policy for housing associations in England in 2002, which aimed to bring council and RSL rents into line in England by 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=27/01 Rent influencing regime – implementing the rent restructuring framework| url=http://www.housingcorp.gov.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.2370|publisher=[[Housing Corporation]]| accessdate=19 December 2012 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100113205514/http://www.housingcorp.gov.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.2370|archive-date=13 January 2010 |date=22 October 2001}}</ref> Local planning departments may require private-sector developers to offer "affordable housing" as a condition of [[planning permission]] ([[section 106 agreement]]).  This accounts for another £700m of Government funding each year for tenants in part of the United Kingdom. As of 2012, Housing Associations are now also referred to as "Private Registered Providers of Social Housing" (PRPs).<ref>{{cite web|title=Housing association homes|url=https://www.gov.uk/housing-association-homes/apply-for-a-home|publisher=[[GOV.UK]]|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>

Local authorities have been discouraged from building council housing since 1979 following the election of Conservative leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] as prime minister.  The [[Parker Morris Committee|Parker Morris]] standard was abolished for those that were built, resulting in smaller room sizes and fewer facilities. The [[Right to Buy Scheme|Right to Buy]] was introduced, resulting in the move of some of the best stock from public tenanted to private owner occupation.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Since the year 2000, "choice-based lettings" (CBL)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingmanagementcare/choicebasedlettings/ |title=Choice-Based Lettings |author=Housing |work=Content under review |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627184309/http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingmanagementcare/choicebasedlettings/ |archive-date = 27 June 2008}}</ref> have been introduced to help ensure social housing was occupied speedily as tenants moved. This can still favour the local over the non-local prospective tenant.  In a number of local authority areas, due to the shortage of council housing, three out of four properties may be designated for priority cases (those living in poor overcrowded conditions, with medical or welfare needs, or needing family support) or homeless applicants in order to meet the councils' legal obligations to rehouse people in need.  The percentage of properties set aside for vulnerable groups will vary dependent on the demand for council housing in the area.  All local authorities have a Housing Strategy to ensure that council houses are let fairly and fulfil the council's legal obligations; deal with people in need; and contribute to sustainability of housing estates, neighbourhood regeneration, and social inclusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/strategiesandreviews/localauthorityhousing/ |title=Local authority strategic housing role |author=Housing |work=Content under review |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080328105627/http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/strategiesandreviews/localauthorityhousing/ |archive-date = 28 March 2008}}</ref>

The 1997–2010 Labour Government wished to move council housing away from local authority management.  At first, this was through Large Scale Voluntary Transfers (LSVT) of stock from councils to Housing Associations (HAs).  Not all council property could be transferred, as in some local authorities, their housing stock was in poor condition and had a capital value less than the remaining debts from construction costs—in effect, the council stock was in negative equity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cih.org/display.php?db=policies&id=62 |title=Response Paper |year=1999 |publisher=Chartered Institute of Housing |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062619/http://www.cih.org/display.php?db=policies&id=62 |archive-date=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In some local authority areas, the tenants rejected the transfer option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/council-tenants-vote-against-housing-transfer-plans-656887.html |title=Council tenants vote against housing transfer plans |author=Lorna Duckworth |date=9 April 2002 |department=Social Affairs Correspondent  |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref>

The Labour Government introduced a "third way": the [[Arms Length Management Organisation]] (ALMO), where the housing stock stays with the Local Authority but is managed by a not-for-profit organisation at arm's length from the Local Authority.  It also introduced the [[Decent Homes Standard|Decent Homes]] programme, a capital fund to bring social housing up to a modern physical standard.  To use this fund, the manager, whether ALMO or HA, had to achieve a 2 or 3 star rating from its inspection by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/housing/inspection/pages/default.aspx |title=Housing inspections |accessdate=14 September 2010}}
</ref> This was intended to drive up management standards.  Council landlords cannot access this funding, another incentive to transfer management of council housing to an ALMO or HA.

Governments since the early 1990s have also encouraged "mixed [[housing tenure|tenure]]" in regeneration areas and on "new-build" housing estates, offering a range of ownership and rental options, with a view to engineering social harmony through including "social housing" and "[[affordable housing]]" options. A recent research report<ref>[http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/chp/hsa/papers/tunstall.pdf The Promotion of 'Mixed Tenure': In Search of the Evidence Base] Paper by Dr. Rebecca Tunstall on tenure mixing</ref> has argued that the evidence base for tenure mixing remains thin. Social housing occupants may be stigmatised and forced to use a [[poor door]] that is separate and less convenient than the door the unsubsidised occupants use and social housing may be less desirably situated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jul/30/poor-door-social-housing-apartheid|title='Poor doors': not the worst thing about social housing|first=Oliver|last=Wainwright|date=30 July 2014|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

Most UK social housing tenants have the right to swap homes with another tenant even if their landlords are different. This is called a "[[mutual exchange]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In the [[Soviet Union]], most of the houses built after World War II were usually 3–5 stories high, with small apartments. In these boroughs, the goal was saving space and creating as many apartments as possible. Construction starting in the 1970s favored 9- and 16-story concrete panel municipal housing in major cities, 7–12 stories in smaller urban areas. These housing projects are still used in some countries, especially in countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe|central and eastern Europe]], and most of them are slowly being renovated.

Public housing in Australia is provided by departments of state governments, with funding provided by both the state and federal government. There are over 300,000 public housing dwellings in Australia, consisting of low-density housing on master-planned estates located in suburban areas, and also inner-city high-rise apartments in Melbourne and Sydney.

In recent decades, rooming and relief housing for the homeless has been privatised, and in recent years this housing has been sold off to avoid maintenance costs and capitalise on sales in a booming property market. In Melbourne, public housing stocks have been in decline for some time, sparking the recent [[Bendigo street housing campaign]] in which homeless people are being housed by the community campaign in homes left empty by the state government.

In 1937 the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] launched a major public-housing system—it became known as "state housing"—for citizens unable to afford private rents. Most state housing built between 1937 and the mid-1950s consisted of detached two-to-three-bedroom cottage-style houses; only 1.5% of state houses in 1949 formed part of apartment blocks, all of them in [[Auckland]] or in greater [[Wellington]]. After World War II ended in 1945, most{{quantify|date=October 2015}} [[List of former territorial authorities in New Zealand|local authorities]] also started providing social housing, mainly for elderly people with low incomes.
