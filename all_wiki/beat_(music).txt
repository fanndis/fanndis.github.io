[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|350px|Metric levels: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]

In [[music]] and [[music theory]], the '''beat''' is the basic unit of time, the [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (regularly repeating event), of the ''mensural level''<ref>Berry, Wallace (1976/1986). ''Structural Functions in Music'', p. 349. {{ISBN|0-486-25384-8}}.</ref> (or ''beat level'').<ref>Winold, Allen (1975). "Rhythm in Twentieth-Century Music", ''Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music'', p. 213. With, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice–Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.</ref> The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music, or the numbers a musician [[counting (music)|counts]] while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect (often the first multiple level). In popular use, ''beat'' can refer to a variety of related concepts, including [[pulse (music)|pulse]], [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], specific [[rhythm]]s, and [[groove (popular music)|groove]].

Rhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of [[#On-beat and off-beat|stressed and unstressed beats]] (often called "strong" and "weak") and divided into [[bar (music)|bars]] organized by [[time signature]] and [[tempo]] indications.

Beats are related to and distinguished from pulse, rhythm (grouping), and meter:

{{Quote|Meter is the measurement of the number of pulses between more or less regularly recurring accents.<!--3--> Therefore, in order for meter to exist, some of the pulses in a series must be accented—marked for consciousness—relative to others.<!--4--> When pulses are thus counted within a metric context, they are referred to as ''beats''.|[[Leonard B. Meyer]] and [[Grosvenor Cooper|Cooper]] (1960)<ref>Cooper, Grosvenor and Meyer, Leonard B. Meyer (1960). ''The Rhythmic Structure of Music'', p.3-4. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-11521-6}}/{{ISBN|0-226-11522-4}}.</ref>}}

[[Meter (music)#Metric structure|Metric levels]] faster than the beat level are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels. Beat has always been an important part of music.  Some [[music genre]]s such as [[funk]] will in general de-emphasize the beat, while other such as [[disco]] emphasize the beat to accompany dance.<ref name="hhd">{{cite book |title=Hip Hop Dance |last=Rajakumar |first=Mohanalakshmi |year=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313378461 |page=5 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jGZhfy9UaGIC |access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>

==Division==
{{Main|Metre (music)#Metric structure}}

As beats are combined to form measures, each beat is divided into parts. The nature of this combination and division is what determines meter. Music where two beats are combined is in [[duple meter]], music where three beats are combined is in [[triple meter]]. Music where the beat is split in two are in simple meter, music where the beat is split in three are called compound meter. Thus, simple duple (2/4, 4/4, 2/2, etc.), simple triple (3/4), compound duple (6/8), and compound triple (9/8). Divisions which require numbers, [[tuplet]]s (for example, dividing a quarter note into five equal parts), are irregular divisions and subdivisions. Subdivision begins two levels below the beat level: starting with a quarter note or a dotted quarter note, subdivision begins when the note is divided into sixteenth notes.

The ''downbeat'' is the first beat of the [[bar (music)|bar]], i.e. number 1. The ''upbeat'' is the '''last beat''' in the '''previous bar''' which immediately '''precedes,''' and hence anticipates, the '''downbeat'''.<ref name=Groveupbeat>{{cite web |title=Upbeat |url=http://www.grovemusic.com|access-date=2007-02-10 |last= Dogantan|first= Mine|year= 2007 |work=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Grove Music Online | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041031/http://www.grovemusic.com/| archive-date=May 16, 2008<!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Both terms correspond to the direction taken by the hand of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]].

{{Quote|This idea of directionality of beats is significant when you translate '''its''' effect on music. The crusis of a measure or a phrase is a beginning; it propels sound and energy forward, so the sound needs to lift and have forward motion to create a sense of direction. The anacrusis leads to the crusis, but doesn't have the same 'explosion' of sound; it serves as a preparation for the crusis.<ref>Cleland, Kent D. and Dobrea-Grindahl, Mary (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wvTSsKLSxWsC&pg=PT34&dq=anacrusis+example&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGwKqWiaPWAhVL82MKHVfyBAcQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&q=anacrusis%20example&f=false Developing Musicianship Through Aural Skills]'', unpaginated. Routledge. {{ISBN|9781135173050}}.</ref>}}

An anticipatory note or succession of notes occurring before the first barline of a piece is sometimes referred to as an upbeat figure, section or phrase. Alternative expressions include "pickup" and "[[anacrusis]]" (the latter ultimately from Greek ''ana'' ["up towards"] and ''krousis'' ["strike"/"impact"] through French ''anacrouse''). In English, ''anákrousis'' translates literally as "pushing up". The term anacrusis was borrowed from the field of [[poetry]], in which it refers to one or more unstressed extrametrical [[syllable]]s at the beginning of a line.<ref name=Groveupbeat/>

In typical Western music [[Quadruple time|{{music|time|4|4}} time]], [[counting (music)|counted]] as "<tt>1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4, 1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4...</tt>", the first beat of the bar (downbeat) is usually the strongest [[Accent (music)|accent]] in the melody and the likeliest place for a chord change, the third is the next strongest: these are "on" beats. The second and fourth are weaker—the "off-beats". Subdivisions (like eighth notes) that fall between the pulse beats are even weaker and these, if used frequently in a rhythm, can also make it "off-beat".<ref name=beat>{{cite web |title= Beat: Accentuation. (i) Strong and weak beats. |access-date=2007-02-10 |url=http://www.grovemusic.com |year= 2007 |work=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Grove Music Online |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041031/http://www.grovemusic.com/ |archive-date=May 16, 2008<!--DASHBot--> |url-status = live|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

The effect can be easily simulated by evenly and repeatedly counting to four. As a background against which to compare these various rhythms a bass drum strike on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on ride cymbal have been added, which would be counted as follows ('''bold''' denotes a stressed beat):
* <tt>'''1''' 2 3 4 '''1''' 2 3 4</tt>  —{{audio|Backbeat example eighth notes.mid|play eighth notes and bass drum alone}}
* <tt>'''1''' 2 '''3''' 4 '''1''' 2 '''3''' 4</tt>—the stress here on the "on" beat {{audio|Backbeat example unsyncopated.mid|play}} But one may syncopate that pattern and alternately stress the odd and even beats, respectively:
*<tt>1 '''2''' 3 '''4''' 1 '''2''' 3 '''4'''</tt> —the stress is on the "unexpected" or syncopated beat {{audio|Backbeat example.mid|play}}

So "off-beat" is a musical term, commonly applied to [[syncopation]] that emphasizes the weak even beats of a bar, as opposed to the usual on-beat. This is a fundamental technique of [[African polyrhythm]] that transferred to popular western music. According to Grove Music, the "Offbeat is [often] where the downbeat is replaced by a rest or is tied over from the preceding bar".<ref name=beat/> The downbeat can never be the off-beat because it is the strongest beat in {{music|time|4|4}} time.<ref>{{cite web |title= Off-beat|url=http://www.grovemusic.com  |access-date=2007-02-10 |year= 2007 |work=Oxford Music Online |publisher=Grove Music Online | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516041031/http://www.grovemusic.com/| archive-date=May 16, 2008<!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Certain genres tend to emphasize the off-beat, where this is a defining characteristic of rock'n'roll and [[ska]] music.

Slap bass executions on the backbeat are found in styles of country western music of the 1930s, and the late '40s early '50s music of Hank Williams reflected a return to strong backbeat accentuation as part of the honky tonk style of country.<ref>{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D. |first=Gary Neville |last=Tamlyn |title=The Big Beat: Origins and Development of Snare Backbeat and other Accompanimental Rhythms in Rock'n'Roll |publisher=??? |year=1998 |pages=342–43}}</ref>
