'''ABC Online''', largely indistinguishable from just the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], is the formal name for the online services of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] as managed by the [[ABC Digital Network Division]]. It covers a large network of websites including those for [[ABC News and Current Affairs|ABC News]], [[ABC Television (Australia)|television]], [[ABC Radio and Regional Content|radio]], and [[video-on-demand]] through [[ABC iView]].

ABC News is one of Australia's largest and most-visited [[web site]]s, according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] the eleventh-most popular in the country. It currently contains over 5 million pages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/documents/mark_scott_npc_address_10.09.08.pdf |title=Address to National Press Club 10 September 2008 |access-date=26 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012164616/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/documents/mark_scott_npc_address_10.09.08.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}
The ABC established its original Multimedia Unit in 1995,<ref name="abc-90s">{{cite web

Although the unit at first relied upon funding allocation to the Corporation's [[ABC Television (Australia)|television]] and [[ABC Radio and Regional Content|radio]] operations, in subsequent budgets it began to receive its own.<ref name="abc-90s" /> The ABC provided live, online election coverage for the first time in 1996, and limited news content began to be provided in 1997.<ref name="abc-90s" />

ABC Online became a part of ABC New Media and Digital Services when the Multimedia division was renamed and changed to an 'output division' similar to Television or Radio.<ref name="abc-00s">{{cite web

In 2008, [[Crikey]] reported that certain ABC Online mobile sites in development were planned to carry commercial advertising.<ref>{{Citation|author=Andrew Dodd |title=New ABC Mobile service to include advertising |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-Arts-and-Sports/20080908-ABC-advertising.html |publisher=[[Crikey.com.au]] |date=2008-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911121619/http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-Arts-and-Sports/20080908-ABC-advertising.html |archivedate=2008-09-11 }}</ref> Screenshots, developed in-house, of an [[ABC Grandstand]] sport page include advertising for two private companies. ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' later revealed that the websites were to be operated by [[ABC Commercial]] and distinguished from the main, advertising-free, mobile website by a distinct logo.<ref>{{Citation |title=ABC Designs for the future |url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2365258.htm |date=2008-09-15 |author=Media Watch|publisher=ABC Online}}</ref>

In December 2019, a refreshed ABC homepage was launched as default. It was available for public testing earlier in the year however.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001175195-Why-has-the-ABC-Homepage-changed-|title=Why has the ABC Homepage changed?|website=ABC Help|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> It's likely that other ABC sites and pages (such as news articles) will be updated to this new style in the near future.
