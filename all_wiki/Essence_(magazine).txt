'''''Essence''''' is a monthly [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[magazine]] covering [[fashion]], [[beauty]], entertainment, and culture. First published in 1970, the magazine is written for [[African-American]] women.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Woodard |first=Jennifer Bailey |date=November 1, 2005 |title=Black Womanhood: Essence and its Treatment of Stereotypical Images of Black Women |journal=Journal of Black Studies |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=264–281 |doi=10.1177/0021934704273152 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1018.2605 |s2cid=144676210 }}</ref> 

==History==
At the apartment of Carol Bailey in East Orange, New Jersey, five BUPPIES were having a get together. Present were Carol Bailey an art teacher, Sherilyn Crooks designer of the 1968 Olympic men's track and field uniforms, Emma Howard a teacher and social worker, Jonathan Blount AT&T yellow page salesman, and myself, Fred Pierce a systems analyst. The women were discussing the fact that Emma, having a very dark complexion, could not find cosmetics to cover a skin condition she had. We all discussed how the "uncle Tom" major black magazines promoted and sold skin whitening concoctions and hair straightening so people of color could look more white. At some point someone suggested that maybe a competitive magazine should be in order.

Near the end of the meeting Jonathan asked if I could do a magazine. I said I thought is was a good idea. But I knew "Jive" Jonathan was a bit of a blow-hard so I said if he could interest some others, I would consider it, and so on. A week or so later Jonathan said he wanted me to meet some other guys. We met with Cecil Hollingsworth and some other guy I forgot because he didn't stick around. We agreed we could do the project if I got the information I needed with their help. 

No one had any publishing experience but I was exploring a high-tech methodology called PERT with which I intended to create the first visual "business plan." The three beautiful women had the vision for Essence. I was the "man with a plan" that created and implemented the project with the help of the women who provided me with critical information need to construct the plan. Smith and Lewis came on board just before we went to Wall Street because I needed more "critical mass" for my plan to work. I could not represent with Jonathan and Cecil because the only payable in the plan was to myself and I needed to be arm's length from the presentation on wall street. I appointed Jonathan as the first president to go to that Wall Street meeting with Hollingsworth, Smith and Lewis to get the bucks.

Ebony and Jet magazines inspired us in a negative way to create Essence to offset their step-and-fetch-it mentality. Jonathan did bring people together, Cecil made good contributions to the visuals I was creating, the women did the research needed to get the information I needed. Smith and Lewis had nothing to do with Essence until the end when Jonathan and the other three men simply took the check and ran away with it. leaving the people who did the work in the lurch.

Edward Lewis, Clarence O. Smith, Cecil Hollingsworth and Jonathan Blount founded Essence Communications Inc. (ECI) in 1968. It began publishing ''Essence'' magazine in May 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magazines in Alphabetical Order|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_womens_magazines|work=Radcliffe Institute|access-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Krishnan, Satya P.|display-authors=etal|title=Coverage of AIDS in Popular African American Magazines |journal=Health Communication |date=1997 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=273–288|doi=10.1207/s15327027hc0903_5|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/n/x/nxy906/COMPS/messageframing/media%20framing%20lit/krishnanAIDSframing.pdf|access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> Lewis and Smith called the publication a "lifestyle magazine directed at upscale African American women".

=== Imagery in advertisements ===
''Essence'' issues in the early 2000s featured mostly black woman models with lighter skin complexions.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Hazell|first=Vanessa|date=September 2008|title=Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines|jstor=40282545|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=39|issue=1|pages=5–21|doi=10.1177/0021934706291402|citeseerx=10.1.1.1008.142|s2cid=144876832}}</ref> The magazine then began to include a greater number of models with darker skin complexions.<ref name=":3" />

In terms of hair types, long and wavy hairstyles were almost equally represented as short and curly styles.<ref name=":3" /> The sizes of the noses and lips of most of the models were considered average.<ref name=":3" /> The bodies of the models were not often displayed.<ref name=":3" /> When they were, thinner and average body types were more likely to be shown than fuller body types.<ref name=":3" />

These observations rose out of a study titled "Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines."<ref name=":3" /> They were then used to comment on what the image practices of ''Essence'' may say about how black media represents black people, chiefly black women, and how these representations may reflect and reveal larger truths about how black people themselves.<ref name=":3" />

==Controversy==
The 2005 purchase of Essence Communications Inc. marked the first time an [[African-American]] magazine would be owned by a white man, sparking controversy because of the company's 34 years under African-American ownership.<ref name="The New York Times" />

In 2011, the magazine engaged with controversy when the editor-in-chief, Constance C. R. White, announced that the magazine's new managing editor was a white male by the name of Michael Bullerdick. White assured readers that Bullerdick had no control over the content of the magazine and was only to oversee the day-to-day operations of the magazine.<ref>Watkins, Boyce. "Should Essence Magazine Have a White Male Managing Editor?." yourblackworld.com.</ref> In April 2012, Bullerdick parted ways with the magazine after politically conservative views that ran counter to what Essence has historically stood for were discovered on his private Facebook page.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theroot.com/node/62118|title=Essence Shifts White Male Managing Editor|magazine=[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]|year=2012|access-date=April 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705052144/http://www.theroot.com/node/62118|archive-date=July 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In July 2020, controversy rose again when anonymous magazine staffers alleged mistreatment and abuse under the leadership of Richelieu Dennis. In a post called "Black Female Anonymous" on Medium, it is alleged that senior staffers subjected Black female employees to sexual harassment, pay inequity and bullying. Dennis subsequently stepped down and named Caroline Wanga as interim CEO.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Dalvin|title=Essence magazine names temporary CEO; launches internal investigation into anonymous claims|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/07/01/essence-magazine-names-new-temporary-ceo-amid-toxic-workplace-claims/5354634002/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Robertson|first=Katie|date=2020-09-08|title=Essence Names Interim Chief After Claim of 'Abusive Work Culture'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/media/essence-magazine-accusations.html|access-date=2020-09-17|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Fuster|first=Jeremy|date=2020-06-29|title=Essence Magazine Staffers Demand Resignation of Leadership Amid Accusations of Toxic Workplace Culture|url=https://www.thewrap.com/essence-magazine-staffers-demand-resignation-of-leadership-amid-accusations-of-toxic-workplace-culture/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=TheWrap|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-01|title=Essence Responds to 'Toxic Culture' Allegations; Names New Interim CEO|url=https://www.blackenterprise.com/essence-responds-to-toxic-culture-allegations-names-new-interim-ceo/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Black Enterprise|language=en-US}}</ref>
