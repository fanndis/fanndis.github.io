{{Main|History of the American Legion}}
[[File:Paris Caucus-March1919.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Caucus]]
The American Legion was established in [[Paris]], [[France]], March 15, 1919, by a thousand officers and men, [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s from all the units of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Forces (A. E. F.)]] to an organization [[caucus]] meeting, which adopted a [[Provisional constitution|tentative constitution]]. The action of the Paris meeting was confirmed and endorsed by a similar meeting held in [[St. Louis]], May 8 to 10, 1919, when the Legion was formally recognized by the troops who served in the United States. The Paris caucus appointed an Executive Committee of seventeen officers and men to represent the troops in France in the conduct of the Legion. The St. Louis caucus appointed a similar Committee of Seventeen. These two national executive committees amalgamated and were the initial governing body of the Legion. The temporary headquarters was located in [[New York City|New York]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheat|1919|p=206-207}}</ref>
