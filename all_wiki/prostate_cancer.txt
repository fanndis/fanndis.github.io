==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Diagram showing prostate cancer pressing on the urethra CRUK 182.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of prostate cancer pressing on the urethra, which can cause symptoms]]
[[File:Prostate Cancer.png|thumb|Prostate cancer]]
Early prostate cancer usually has no clear symptoms. When they do appear, they are often similar to those of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. These include frequent urination, [[nocturia]] (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, [[hematuria]] (blood in the urine) and [[dysuria]] (painful urination). One study found that about a third of diagnosed patients had one or more such symptoms.<ref name=prostateCApresentation />

Prostate cancer is associated with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the [[prostatic urethra]]. Changes within the gland directly affect urinary function. Because the [[vas deferens]] deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving [[erection]] or painful [[ejaculation]].<ref name=prostateCApresentation>{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller DC, Hafez KS, Stewart A, Montie JE, Wei JT | title = Prostate carcinoma presentation, diagnosis, and staging: an update form the National Cancer Data Base | journal = Cancer | volume = 98 | issue = 6 | pages = 1169–78 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12973840 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.11635 | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/34379/1/11635_ftp.pdf | hdl = 2027.42/34379 | s2cid = 22077473 }}</ref>

[[Metastatic]] prostate cancer can cause additional symptoms. The most common symptom is [[bone pain]], often in the [[vertebrae]] (bones of the spine), [[pelvis]], or [[rib]]s. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the [[femur]] is usually to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|part of the bone nearer to the prostate]]. Prostate cancer in the [[vertebral column|spine]] can compress the [[spinal cord]], causing tingling, leg weakness, and [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Cruijsen-Koeter IW, Vis AN, Roobol MJ, Wildhagen MF, de Koning HJ, van der Kwast TH, Schröder FH | title = Comparison of screen detected and clinically diagnosed prostate cancer in the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer, section rotterdam | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 174 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–5 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15947595 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000162061.40533.0f }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Prostatelead.jpg|right|thumb]]

The [[prostate]] is part of the male [[reproductive system]] that helps make and store [[seminal fluid]]. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3&nbsp;cm long and weighs about 20 g.<ref>{{Cite book| vauthors = Aumüller G | title=Prostate Gland and Seminal Vesicles| publisher=Springer-Verlag| location=Berlin-Heidelberg| year=1979}}</ref> It is located in the [[pelvis]], under the [[urinary bladder]] and in front of the [[rectum]].

Superiorly, the prostate base is contiguous with the bladder outlet. Inferiorly, the prostate's apex heads in the direction of the urogenital diaphragm, which is pointed anterio-inferiorly. The prostate can be divided into four anatomic spaces: peripheral, central, transitional, and anterior fibromuscular [[Stroma (tissue)|stroma]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McNeal|first=J. E.|date=1984|title=Anatomy of the prostate and morphogenesis of BPH|journal=Progress in Clinical and Biological Research|volume=145|pages=27–53|issn=0361-7742|pmid=6201879}}</ref> The peripheral space contains the posterior and lateral portions of the prostate, as well as the inferior portions of the prostate. The central space contains the superior portion of the prostate including the most proximal aspects of the urethra and bladder neck. The transitional space is located just anterior to the central space and includes urethra distal to the central gland urethra. The neurovascular bundles course along the posterolateral prostate surface and penetrate the prostatic capsule there as well.

Most of the glandular tissue is found in the peripheral and central zones (peripheral zone: 70-80% of glandular tissue; central zone: 20% of glandular tissue).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oh|first1=William K.|last2=Hurwitz|first2=Mark|last3=D'Amico|first3=Anthony V.|last4=Richie|first4=Jerome P.|last5=Kantoff|first5=Philip W.|date=2003|title=Biology of Prostate Cancer|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13217/|journal=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine. 6th Edition|language=en}}</ref> Some is found in the transitional space (5% of glandular tissue).

None is found in the anterior fibromuscular stroma since no glands are in that anatomic space.

The prostate glands require male [[hormone]]s, known as [[androgen]]s, to work properly. Androgens include [[testosterone]], which is made in the [[testes]]; [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], made in the [[adrenal gland]]s; and [[dihydrotestosterone]], which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for [[secondary sex characteristic]]s such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.

Because of the prostate's location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely [[defecation]]. In prostate cancer, the cells of these glands [[Mutation|mutate]] into cancer cells.

[[File:Diagram showing prostate cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes CRUK 184.svg|thumb|left|Prostate cancer that has metastasized to the lymph nodes]]
[[File:Diagram showing prostate cancer that has spread to the bones CRUK 183.svg|thumb|left|Prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone]]

Most prostate cancers are classified as [[adenocarcinoma]]s, or glandular cancers, that begin when semen-secreting gland cells mutate into cancer cells. The region of the prostate gland where the adenocarcinoma is most common is the peripheral zone. Initially, small clumps of cancer cells remain within otherwise normal prostate glands, a condition known as [[carcinoma in situ|carcinoma ''in situ'']] or [[prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia]] (PIN). Although no proof establishes that PIN is a cancer precursor, it is closely associated with cancer. Over time, these cells multiply and spread to the surrounding prostate tissue (the [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]) forming a [[tumor]].

Eventually, the tumor may grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the [[seminal vesicles]] or the rectum, or tumor cells may develop the ability to travel in the [[bloodstream]] and [[lymphatic system]].

Prostate cancer is considered a [[malignant]] tumor because it can invade other areas of the body. This invasion is called [[metastasis]]. Prostate cancer most commonly metastasizes to the [[bone]]s and [[lymph node]]s, and may invade the rectum, [[bladder]], and lower ureters after local progression. The route of metastasis to bone is thought to be [[Vein|venous]], as the [[prostatic venous plexus]] draining the prostate connects with the vertebral veins.<ref name="metastasis-route">{{cite web|url=http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/gu/prostate3.cfm |title=Male Genitals - Prostate Neoplasms |access-date=2011-04-28 |work=Pathology study images |publisher=University of Virginia School of Medicine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720193027/http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/gu/prostate3.cfm |archive-date=2011-07-20 |quote=There are many connections between the prostatic venous plexus and the vertebral veins. The veins forming the prostatic plexus do not contain valves and it is thought that straining to urinate causes prostatic venous blood to flow in a reverse direction and enter the vertebral veins carrying malignant cells to the vertebral column. |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The prostate is a [[zinc]]-accumulating, [[citrate]]-producing organ. [[Transport protein]] [[ZIP1]] is responsible for the transport of zinc into prostate cells. One of zinc's important roles is to change the cell's metabolism to produce citrate, an important semen component. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and prostate cells require enormous amounts of energy ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) to accomplish this task. Prostate cancer cells are generally devoid of zinc. Prostate cancer cells save energy by not making citrate, and use the conserved energy to grow, reproduce and spread.

The absence of zinc is thought to occur via silencing the gene that produces ZIP1. It is called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene ''[[SLC39A1]]''. The cause of the [[epigenetic]] silencing is unknown. Strategies that transport zinc into transformed prostate cells effectively eliminate these cells in animals. Zinc inhibits [[NF-κB]] pathways, is antiproliferative, and induces [[apoptosis]] in abnormal cells. Unfortunately, oral ingestion of zinc is ineffective since high concentrations of zinc into prostate cells is not possible without ZIP1.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1186/1476-4598-5-17| pmid=16700911| pmc=1481516| year=2006| last1=Costello| first1=Leslie C.| title=The clinical relevance of the metabolism of prostate cancer; zinc and tumor suppression: Connecting the dots| journal=Molecular Cancer| volume=5| pages=17| last2=Franklin| first2=Renty B.}}</ref>

Loss of cancer suppressor genes, early in prostatic carcinogenesis, have been localized to chromosomes'' 8p'', ''10q'', ''13q'', and ''16q''. [[P53]] mutations in the primary prostate cancer are relatively low and are more frequently seen in metastatic settings, hence, p53 mutations are a late event in the pathology.

Several other tests can be used to gather information about the prostate and the urinary tract. Digital [[rectal examination]] may allow a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. [[Cystoscopy]] shows the urinary tract from inside the bladder, using a thin, flexible camera tube inserted in the [[urethra]]. [[Transrectal ultrasonography]] creates a picture of the prostate using sound waves from a probe in the rectum, but the only test that can fully confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a [[biopsy]], the removal of small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination.

===Imaging===
{{more medical citations needed|section|date=March 2020}}
[[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasound]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) are the two main imaging methods used for prostate cancer detection.

==== MRI ====

==== Appearance of prostate on MRI ====
On MRI, the central and transitional zones both have lower T2 signal than the peripheral zone. Since the central and transitional zones cannot be distinguished from each other, they can be best described as the central gland on MRI. Thus, the peripheral gland has a higher signal on T2WI than the central gland. In the peripheral gland, prostate cancer appears as a low-intensity [[lesion]]. However, in the central gland, low-intensity lesions cannot be distinguished from the low-intensity central gland. Diffusion restriction is instrumental in identifying and characterizing central gland lesions. Combined diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for distinguish malignant from benign prostate lesions can be used. The merged  images,  of  DW  and  MRI  with  dynamic  contrast  enhancement, can  visualise areas with low signal intensity and fast wash-out effect - characteristic of carcinomas.<ref>Georgiev, A. (2016). Case of prostate cancer with anterior localization - Multiparametric MRI study. Rentgenologiya i Radiologiya, 55(4), 285–287.</ref> [[Lymphadenopathy]] can be seen best on postcontrast, fat-suppressed T1WI. Other regions can be described on MRI. The anterior fibromuscular stroma and the prostate capsule along the posterior and lateral prostate have a low T2WI signal, in contrast with the bright signal of the peripheral zone. Extraprostatic extension can be seen with disruption of capsule integrity.

==== MRI for the detection of prostate cancer ====
As of 2011, MRI was used to identify targets for prostate biopsy using fusion MRI with ultrasound (US) or MRI-guidance alone. One study reported that given a clinical suspicion, MRI-guided fusion biopsy detected clinically significant cancer in 38% compared to 26% in the standard biopsy group.<ref>{{cite journal|display-authors=6|vauthors=Kasivisvanathan V, Rannikko AS, Borghi M, Panebianco V, Mynderse LA, Vaarala MH, Briganti A, Budäus L, Hellawell G, Hindley RG, Roobol MJ, Eggener S, Ghei M, Villers A, Bladou F, Villeirs GM, Virdi J, Boxler S, Robert G, Singh PB, Venderink W, Hadaschik BA, Ruffion A, Hu JC, Margolis D, Crouzet S, Klotz L, Taneja SS, Pinto P, Gill I, Allen C, Giganti F, Freeman A, Morris S, Punwani S, Williams NR, Brew-Graves C, Deeks J, Takwoingi Y, Emberton M, Moore CM|date=May 2018|title=MRI-Targeted or Standard Biopsy for Prostate-Cancer Diagnosis|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=378|issue=19|pages=1767–1777|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1801993|pmid=29552975|doi-access=free}}</ref> In candidates for active surveillance, fusion MR/US-guided prostate biopsy detected 33% of cancers compared to 7% with standard ultrasound-guided biopsy.<ref name="pmid21555104">{{cite journal|vauthors=Natarajan S, Marks LS, Margolis DJ, Huang J, Macairan ML, Lieu P, Fenster A|date=May 2011|title=Clinical application of a 3D ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy system|journal=Urologic Oncology|volume=29|issue=3|pages=334–42|doi=10.1016/j.urolonc.2011.02.014|pmc=3432280|pmid=21555104}}</ref>

Following an MRI, regions of interest within the scan which may be cancer are often graded on a likelihood scale between 1 and 5. One such scale is the [[PI-RADS|prostate imaging-reporting and data system]] (PI-RADS) scale which defines standards of clinical service for multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), including image creation and reporting. PI-RADS version 2 scoring has shown a specificity and sensitivity of 73% and 95%, respectively, for detection of prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang X, Bao J, Ping X, Hu C, Hou J, Dong F, Guo L|date=September 2018|title=The diagnostic value of PI-RADS V1 and V2 using multiparametric MRI in transition zone prostate clinical cancer|journal=Oncology Letters|volume=16|issue=3|pages=3201–3206|doi=10.3892/ol.2018.9038|pmc=6096261|pmid=30127915}}</ref>

==== Other uses for MRI ====

==== Biological basis for prostate cancer visibility on MRI ====
The biological properties which determine whether or not a tumour is visible on MRI is poorly understood. One theory is that tumour cells undergo several genetic changes during [[Carcinogenesis|transformation]] which alter the cellular rate of growth and formation of new blood vessels, leading to tumours with more aggressive [[Pathology|histological]] patterns, [[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic]] regions and increased cell density among other features.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Norris|first1=Joseph M.|last2=Simpson|first2=Benjamin S.|last3=Freeman|first3=Alex|last4=Kirkham|first4=Alex|last5=Whitaker|first5=Hayley C.|last6=Emberton|first6=Mark|title=Conspicuity of prostate cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: A cross-disciplinary translational hypothesis|url=https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fj.202001466R|journal=The FASEB Journal|year=2020|language=en|volume=n/a|issue=n/a|pages=14150–14159|doi=10.1096/fj.202001466R|pmid=32920937|s2cid=221675029|issn=1530-6860}}</ref> Having larger, more dense tumours with changes in blood vessel distributions may feasibly alter signal on MRI through restriction of water and/or fluid movement.<ref name=":4" />

=== Ultrasound ===
Ultrasound imaging can be obtained transrectally and is used during prostate biopsies. Prostate cancer can be seen as a hypoechoic lesion in 60% of cases. The other 40% of cancerous lesions are either hyperechoic or isoechoic. On Color Doppler, the lesions appear hypervascular.

===Biopsy===
{{See|Prostate biopsy}}
[[File:Prostate Needle Biopsy.png|thumb|Prostate needle biopsy]]
If cancer is suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy, a [[urology|urologist]] or [[radiology|radiologist]] obtains tissue samples from the prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six on each side of the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization.

===Staging===
{{Main|Prostate cancer staging}}
[[File:Diagram showing T1-3 stages of prostate cancer CRUK 278.svg|thumb|Diagram showing T1-3 stages of prostate cancer.]]
An important part of evaluating prostate cancer is determining the [[Cancer staging|stage]], or degree of spread. Knowing the stage helps define [[prognosis]] and is useful when selecting therapies. The most common system is the four-stage [[TNM staging system|TNM system]] (abbreviated from tumor/nodes/metastases). Its components include the size of the tumor, the number of involved [[lymph node]]s, and the presence of any other [[Metastasis|metastases]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/besttreatments/prostate-cancer-how-far-has-your-cancer-spread-the-tnm-system |title= Prostate cancer: How far has your cancer spread? The TNM system |author=BMJ Group |date=8 December 2009 |website=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |access-date=9 August 2010 |location=London}}{{dead link|date=March 2019}}</ref>

The most important distinction made by any staging system is whether the cancer is confined to the prostate. In the TNM system, clinical T1 and T2 cancers are found only in the prostate, while T3 and T4 cancers have metastasized. Several tests can be used to look for evidence of spread. [[Specialty (medicine)|Medical specialty]] [[professional organizations]] recommend against the use of [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis.<ref name="ASCOfive">{{cite journal |author=American Society of Clinical Oncology | title = Five things physicians and patients should question | journal = The Journal of the Oklahoma State Medical Association | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 150–1 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23795527 | url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120731073425/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf | author-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology | archive-date = 2012-07-31 }}

Bone scans should reveal [[osteoblast]]ic appearance due to ''increased'' bone density in the areas of [[bone metastasis]]—the reverse of what is found in many other metastatic cancers.

After a biopsy, a [[pathology|pathologist]] examines the samples under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the [[Grading (tumors)|grade]] of the tumor. The grade tells how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue and suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The pathologist assigns a Gleason number from 1 to 5 for the most common pattern observed under the microscope, then does the same for the second-most common pattern. The sum of these two numbers is the Gleason score. The [[Whitmore-Jewett stage]] is another method.

In men with high-risk localised prostate cancer, staging with PSMA PET/CT may be appropriate to detect nodal or distant metastatic spread. In 2020, a randomised phase 3 trial compared Gallium-68 PSMA PET/CT to standard imaging (CT and bone scan). It reported superior accuracy of [[Gallium-68 PSMA-11]] PET/CT (92% vs 65%), higher significant change in management (28% vs 15%), less equivocal/uncertain imaging findings (7% vs 23%) and lower radiation exposure (10 msV vs 19 mSv).

Approaches in which treatment is postponed are termed "expectant management".<ref name=":0" /> Expectant management is divided into two approaches: [[Watchful waiting]], which has [[Palliative care|palliative intent]] (aims to treat symptoms only), and [[Active surveillance of prostate cancer|active surveillance]], which has curative intent (aims to prevent the cancer from advancing).<ref name=":0" />

Which option is best depends on disease stage, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are age, general health and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because most treatments can have significant [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s, such as [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[urinary incontinence]], treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations.

Therefore, interest grew in aggressive treatment modalities such as surgery or radiation even for localized disease.

Alternatively, an 18-item questionnaire was proposed to learn whether patients have adequate knowledge and understanding of their treatment options. In one 2015 study, most of those who were newly diagnosed correctly answered fewer than half of the questions.<ref name="pmid21842788" />

===Surveillance===
Many men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer are eligible for active surveillance. The tumor is carefully observed over time, with the intention of initiating treatment if signs of progression appear. Active surveillance is ''not'' synonymous with [[watchful waiting]], a term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that only palliative treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.<ref name=":0" />

Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for growth or symptoms, which trigger treatment. The monitoring process may involve PSA tests, digital rectal examination, and/or repeated biopsies every few months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancercareontario.ca/en/guidelines-advice/types-of-cancer/2286|title=Active Surveillance for the Management of Localized Prostate Cancer|website=Cancer Care Ontario|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410154624/https://www.cancercareontario.ca/en/guidelines-advice/types-of-cancer/2286|archive-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> The goal of active surveillance is to postpone treatment, and avoid [[overtreatment]] and its side effects, given a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that in most people is unlikely to cause problems.

==== Surgery ====
[[Prostatectomy|Radical prostatectomy]] is considered the mainstay of surgical treatment of prostate cancer, where the surgeon removes the prostate, [[seminal vesicle]]s, and surrounding [[lymph node]]s. It can be done by an open technique (a skin incision at the lower abdomen), or [[Laparoscopy|laparoscopically]]. [[Radical retropubic prostatectomy]] is the most commonly used open surgical technique.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} [[Robot-assisted surgery|Robotic-assisted]] prostatectomy has become common.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/treating/surgery.html|title=Surgery for Prostate Cancer|website=www.cancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Men with localized prostate cancer, having [[laparoscopic radical prostatectomy]] or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, might have shorter stays in the hospital and get fewer blood transfusions than men undergoing open radical prostatectomy.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ilic D, Evans SM, Allan CA, Jung JH, Murphy D, Frydenberg M|date=September 2017|title=Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=9|pages=CD009625|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009625.pub2|pmc=6486168|pmid=28895658}}</ref> How these treatments compare with regards to overall survival or recurrence-free survival is unknown.<ref name=":1" />

[[Transurethral resection of the prostate]] <!-- (TURP) --> is the standard surgical treatment for [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|benign enlargement of the prostate]].<ref name=":2" /> In prostate cancer, this procedure can be used to relieve symptoms of [[urinary retention]] caused by a large prostate tumor, but it is not used to treat the cancer itself. The procedure is done under spinal anesthesia, a [[Cystoscope|resectoscope]] is inserted inside the penis and the extra prostatic tissue is cut to clear the way for the urine to pass.

==== Complications ====
The two main complications encountered after prostatectomy and prostate radiotherapy are [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[urinary incontinence]], mainly [[Stress incontinence|stress-type]]. Most men regain continence within 6 to 12 months after the operation, so doctors usually wait at least one year before resorting to invasive treatments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.continence.org.au/pages/continence-management-following-prostate-surgery.html|title=Continence management following prostate surgery|website=Continence Foundation of Australia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410155813/https://www.continence.org.au/pages/continence-management-following-prostate-surgery.html|archive-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

[[Stress incontinence|Stress urinary incontinence]] usually happens after prostate surgery or radiation therapy due to factors that include damage to the urethral sphincter or surrounding tissue and nerves. The prostate surrounds the urethra, a muscular tube that closes the urinary bladder. Any of the mentioned reasons can lead to incompetent closure of the urethra and hence incontinence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Singla|first1=Nirmish|last2=Singla|first2=Ajay K.|date=March 2014|title=Post-prostatectomy incontinence: Etiology, evaluation, and management|journal=Turkish Journal of Urology|volume=40|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.5152/tud.2014.222014|issn=2149-3235|pmc=4548645|pmid=26328137}}</ref> Initial therapy includes [[bladder training]], lifestyle changes, [[kegel exercise]]s, and the use of [[incontinence pad]]s. More invasive surgical treatment can include the insertion of a [[urethral sling]] or an [[artificial urinary sphincter]], which is a mechanical device that mimics the function of the urethral sphincter, and is activated manually by the patient through a switch implanted in the [[scrotum]]. The latter is considered the gold standard in patients with moderate or severe stress urinary incontinence.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018|title=EAU Guidelines on Urinary Incontinence in Adults|url=https://uroweb.org/wp-content/uploads/EAU-Guidelines-on-Urinary-Incontinence-2018-large-text.pdf|journal=European Association of Urology}}</ref>

Erectile dysfunction happens in different degrees in nearly all men who undergo prostate cancer treatment, including radiotherapy or surgery; however, within one year, most of them will notice improvement. If nerves were damaged, this progress may not take place. Pharmacological treatment includes [[PDE5 inhibitor|PDE-5 inhibitors]] such as [[Sildenafil|viagra]] or [[Tadalafil|cialis]], or injectable intracavernous drugs injected directly into the penis ([[prostaglandin E1]] and vasoactive drug mixtures). Other nonpharmacological therapy includes vacuum constriction devices and [[penile implant]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/erectile-dysfunction-after-prostate-cancer|title=Erectile Dysfunction After Prostate Cancer|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Many prostate cancers are not destined to be lethal, and most men will ultimately not die as a result of the disease. Mortality varies widely across geography and other elements. In the United States, five-year survival rates range from 29% (distant metastases) to 100% (local or regional tumors).<ref name="SEER2017">{{cite web|title=Cancer of the Prostate - Cancer Stat Facts|url=https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html|website=seer.cancer.gov|access-date=11 April 2017|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318055053/https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html|archive-date=18 March 2017}}</ref> In Japan, the fatality rate rose to 8.6/100,000 in 2000.<ref name="pmid15714967">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakai K | title = [Descriptive epidemiology of prostate cancer in Japan and Western countries] | language = ja | journal = Nihon Rinsho.

In patients who undergo treatment, the most important clinical prognostic indicators of disease outcome are the stage, pretherapy PSA level, and Gleason score.

Androgen ablation therapy causes remission in 80–90% of patients undergoing therapy, resulting in a median progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months.

===Classification systems===
[[File:Prostate cancer with Gleason pattern 4 low mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of prostate [[adenocarcinoma]], acinar type, the most common type of prostate cancer. Needle [[biopsy]], [[H&E stain]]]]
Several tools are available to help predict outcomes, such as pathologic stage and recurrence after surgery or radiation therapy. Most combine stage, grade, and PSA level, and some include the number or percentage of biopsy cores positive, age, and/or other information.

*The D'Amico classification stratifies men by low, intermediate, or high risk based on stage, grade and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major downside to the three-level system is that it does not account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score ''and'' high PSA) in stratifying patients.
*The Partin table]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eifler JB, Feng Z, Lin BM, Partin MT, Humphreys EB, Han M, Epstein JI, Walsh PC, Trock BJ, Partin AW | display-authors = 6 | title = An updated prostate cancer staging nomogram (Partin tables) based on cases from 2006 to 2011 | journal = BJU International | volume = 111 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–9 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22834909 | pmc = 3876476 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.11324.x }}</ref> predict pathologic outcomes (margin status, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion) based on the same three variables and are published as lookup tables.
*The Kattan nomograms predict recurrence after surgery and/or radiation therapy, based on data available at the time of diagnosis or after surgery. The Kattan score represents the likelihood of remaining free of disease at a given time interval following treatment.
*The UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score predicts both pathologic status and recurrence after surgery. It offers accuracy comparable to the Kattan preoperative nomogram and can be calculated without tables or a calculator.

===Life expectancy===
Life expectancy projections are averages for an entire male population, and many medical and lifestyle factors modify these numbers. For example, studies have shown that a 40-year-old man will lose 3.1 years of life if he is overweight (BMI 25–29) and 5.8 years of life if he is obese (BMI 30 or more), compared to men of normal weight. If he is both overweight and a smoker, he will lose 6.7 years, and if obese and a smoker, he will lose 13.7 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/prostate.htm|title=CDC FastStats|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728022146/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/prostate.htm|archive-date=2017-07-28}}</ref>

No evidence shows that either surgery or beam radiation has an advantage over the other in this regard. The lower death rates reported with surgery appear to occur because surgery is more likely to be offered to younger men with less severe cancers. Insufficient information is available to determine whether seed radiation extends life more readily than the other treatments, but data so far do not suggest that it does.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/understanding-prostate-cancer-treatment|title=Treatment Choices for Men With Early-Stage Prostate Cancer|publisher=National Cancer Institute|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404184205/http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/understanding-prostate-cancer-treatment|archive-date=2015-04-04|date=2014-10-17}}</ref>

Men with low-grade disease (Gleason 2–4) were unlikely to die of prostate cancer within 15 years of diagnosis. Older men (age 70–75) with low-grade disease had a roughly 20% overall survival at 15 years due to deaths from competing causes. Men with high-grade disease (Gleason 8–10) experienced high mortality within 15 years of diagnosis, regardless of their age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eggener SE, Badani K, Barocas DA, Barrisford GW, Cheng JS, Chin AI, Corcoran A, Epstein JI, George AK, Gupta GN, Hayn MH, Kauffman EC, Lane B, Liss MA, Mirza M, Morgan TM, Moses K, Nepple KG, Preston MA, Rais-Bahrami S, Resnick MJ, Siddiqui MM, Silberstein J, Singer EA, Sonn GA, Sprenkle P, Stratton KL, Taylor J, Tomaszewski J, Tollefson M, Vickers A, White WM, Lowrance WT | display-authors = 6 | title = Gleason 6 Prostate Cancer: Translating Biology into Population Health | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 194 | issue = 3 | pages = 626–34 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25849602 | pmc = 4551510 | doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2015.01.126 }}</ref>

Prostate cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death in men, exceeded by lung cancer and colorectal cancer. It accounts for 19% of all male cancers and 9% of male cancer-related deaths.

Cases ranged from an estimated 230,000 in 2005<ref name="pmid15661684" /> to an estimated 164,690 In 2018.

Deaths held steady around 30,000 in 2005<ref name="pmid15661684">{{cite journal|display-authors=6|vauthors=Jemal A, Murray T, Ward E, Samuels A, Tiwari RC, Ghafoor A, Feuer EJ, Thun MJ|year=2005|title=Cancer statistics, 2005|journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians|volume=55|issue=1|pages=10–30|doi=10.3322/canjclin.55.1.10|pmid=15661684|s2cid=22356919}}</ref> and 29,430 in 2018.

Age-adjusted incidence rates increased steadily from 1975 through 1992, with particularly dramatic increases associated with the spread of PSA screening in the late 1980s, later followed by a fall in incidence. A decline in early-stage incidence rates from 2011 to 2012 (19%) in men aged 50 years and older persisted through 2013 (6%).

Declines in mortality rates in certain jurisdictions may reflect the interaction of PSA screening and improved treatment. The estimated lifetime risk is about 14.0%, and the lifetime mortality risk is 2.6%.

Between 2005 and 2011, the proportion of disease diagnosed at a locoregional stage was 93% for whites and 92% for African Americans; the proportion of disease diagnosed at a late stage was 4% for whites and 5% for African Americans.

Prostate cancer is more common in the [[African American]] population than the [[White American]] population.<ref name="WCR2014" /> An autopsy study of White and Asian men also found an increase in occult prostate cancer with age, reaching nearly 60% in men older than 80 years. More than 50% of cancers in Asian men and 25% of cancers in White men had a Gleason score of 7 or greater, suggesting that Gleason score may be an imprecise indicator of clinically insignificant cases.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK65945/|title=PDQ Cancer Information Summaries|last=PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board|date=2002|publisher=National Cancer Institute (US)|location=Bethesda (MD)|pmid=26389383|chapter=Prostate Cancer Screening (PDQ®): Health Professional Version}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

Surgical removal of the testes ([[orchiectomy]]) to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, with limited success. [[Transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction in the middle of the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function.

In 1941, [[Charles B. Huggins]] published studies in which he used [[estrogen]] to oppose testosterone production in men with metastatic prostate cancer.

Disparities extend into detection, with governments failing to fund or mandate prostate cancer screening while fully supporting breast cancer programs.

Hence, 5-LOX inhibitors have been targeted for their chemopreventive effects. Inhibition of 5-LOX activity is shown to block prostate cancer cell proliferation as well as carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis (119, 120).&nbsp;... Both 5-HETE and 12-HETE are also products of lipoxygenase and are involved in tumor progression (12). Exogenous 5-HETE can stimulate the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and act as a survival factor (137, 138). These results require relatively high concentrations (at a concentration of 10 μM). Blocking the formation of 5-HETE, by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, results in massive apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells (139). }}</ref><ref name="MEDRS review 2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishayee K, Khuda-Bukhsh AR | title = 5-lipoxygenase antagonist therapy: a new approach towards targeted cancer chemotherapy | journal = Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 709–19 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23752617 | doi = 10.1093/abbs/gmt064 | quote = Recent studies demonstrated the involvement of growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neurotensin in the 5-LOX-mediated tumor progression in prostate cancer [22,23]. Recent studies with 5-LOX siRNA [10] and specific blocker of 5-LOX [24] revealed the relation of this gene with the tumor cell proliferation.&nbsp;... Meclofenamate sodium (MS) is known for its anti-inflammatory activity, and apart from this, Boctor et al. [37] reported that it caused reduction in the formation of 5-HETE in human leucocytes when used. MS can thus be considered a dual inhibitor of 5-LOX and COX pathways of arachidonic acid cascade. Further investigation with this substance revealed that it could interfere with the LT receptors in the lung carcinoma [38]. In a recent study, a group of scientists have shown the effect of MS on prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [39], and their result suggests a profound reduction in the tumor growth and cancer metastasis.&nbsp;... While the commonly used inhibitors produced strong cytotoxicity, notably, zileuton, the only commercialized 5-LOX inhibitor, failed to induce an anti-proliferative or cytotoxic response in all other types of tumor cells where 5-LOX was in inactive state (e.g. HeLa cells).  But where 5-LOX was in active state, zileuton could effectively inhibit progression, as in case of prostate cancer. | doi-access = free }}</ref> In particular, [[arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors]] produce massive, rapid programmed cell death in prostate cancer cells.<ref name="Primary source cited in 1st review" /><ref name="MEDRS review 1" /><ref name="MEDRS review 2" />

===Cancer models===
Scientists have established prostate cancer [[cell lines]] to investigate disease progression. [[LNCaP]], PC-3 ([[PC3]]), and DU-145 ([[DU145]]) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express AR, but PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR.

The proliferation of LNCaP cells is [[androgen]]-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is [[androgen]]-insensitive.

===Diagnosis===
One active research area and non-clinically applied investigations involves non-invasive methods of tumor detection. A molecular test that detects the presence of cell-associated [[PCA3]] mRNA in fluid obtained from the prostate and first-void urine sample is under investigation. PCA3 mRNA is expressed almost exclusively by prostate cells and has been shown to be highly over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. The test result is currently reported as a specimen ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA.

The PCA3 test attempts to help decide whether, in men suspected of having prostate cancer (especially if an initial biopsy fails to explain the elevated serum PSA), a biopsy/rebiopsy is needed. The higher the expression of PCA3 in the sample, the greater the likelihood of a positive biopsy.<ref name="pmid21176272">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bourdoumis A, Papatsoris AG, Chrisofos M, Efstathiou E, Skolarikos A, Deliveliotis C | title = The novel prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) biomarker | journal = International Braz J Urol | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 665–8; discussion 669 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21176272 | doi = 10.1590/S1677-55382010000600003 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The CDC's Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention Working Group discourages clinical use.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-19|title=Does PCA3 Testing for the Diagnosis and Management of Prostate Cancer improve patient health outcomes|url=https://www.cdc.gov/egappreviews/recommendations/PCA3.html|access-date=2020-08-09|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref>
