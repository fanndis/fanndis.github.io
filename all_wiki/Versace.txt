}} usually referred to simply as '''Versace''', is an Italian [[luxury goods|luxury]] fashion company and trade name founded by [[Gianni Versace]] in 1978. The main collection of the brand is Versace, which produces upmarket Italian-made [[ready-to-wear]] and [[leather]] accessories. The Versace logo is the head of [[Medusa]], a Greek mythological figure. The logo came from the floor of ruins in the area of [[Reggio Calabria]] that the Versace siblings played in as children. Gianni Versace chose Medusa as the logo because she made people fall in love with her and they had no way back. He hoped his company would have the same effect on people and on those who wore his clothes and shoes.

The Versace brand is known for its innovative designs having symbolic flashy prints and bright colors but with style.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Versace|last=Davis|first=Daniel|publisher=Infobase Learning|year=2011|isbn=9781604139808|location=New York, NY|pages=29}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Carol|date=Autumn 2001|title=Transformation Parlor|journal=Art Journal|volume=60|pages=42–47}}</ref> The company announced in 2018 that it would stop using fur in its collections.<ref>"Versace and Furla join designer labels ditching fur," [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fashion-fur-versace-furla/versace-and-furla-join-designer-labels-ditching-fur-idUSKCN1GR1NW Reuters], 15 March 2018.</ref> On 25 September 2018, [[Capri Holdings|Michael Kors Holdings]] acquired all outstanding shares in Gianni Versace S.r.l. for $2.12 billion (USD);<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://investors.michaelkors.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2018/Michael-Kors-Holdings-Limited-to-Be-Renamed-Capri-Holdings-Limited/default.aspx|title=Michael Kors Holdings Limited to Be Renamed Capri Holdings Limited|website=investors.michaelkors.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref> the acquisition was completed on 31 December 2018,<ref>[http://www.capriholdings.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2018/Capri-Holdings-Limited-Completes-Acquisition-of-Versace/default.aspx Capri Holdings press release]</ref> keeping on [[Donatella Versace]] as head of creative design.
