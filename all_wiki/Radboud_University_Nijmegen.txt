==Coat of arms==
[[File:Radboud Universiteit Wapen in kleur.png|left|thumb|108x108px|[[Coat of arms]] ]]
Radboud University's coat of arms was designed at the time of the founding of the university by the goldsmith workshop of the Brom family in Utrecht. The lower part is the coat of arms of the [[Catholic Church in the Netherlands]]. The dove in the upper part of the coat of arms is the symbol of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The entire shield is surmounted by the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] because Nijmegen was once home to Frankish King [[Charlemagne]]. Underneath the coat of arms one finds the university's motto "In Dei Nomine Feliciter"<ref>Judith van Beukering (red.) ''80 jaar KU Nijmegen - 80 objecten. Tachtig jaar Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen in voorwerpen van wetenschap, geschiedenis en kunst'' (Nijmegen 2003) 15.</ref>, meaning "happily in the name of God". The coat of arms is used on most of the university's official documents, including the university's bachelor, master and PhD certificates. For 2023 a special version of the coat of arms was designed to celebrate Radboud University's 100 year anniversary.  
==History ==
The first [[University of Nijmegen (1655–80)|University of Nijmegen]] was founded in 1655 as the ''Kwartierlijke Academie van Nijmegen''. Students developed their skills in the traditional fields of theology, medicine and law. Although the university had its successes, the ''Kwartierlijke Academie'' terminated around 1680. The university was unable to recover from successive outbreaks of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and the [[Franco-Dutch War|French invasion of the Netherlands]] in 1672.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Historie|url=https://www.ru.nl/@671954/historie/|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Radboud Universiteit|language=nl}}</ref>

After several attempts to establish a new university in Nijmegen, the Radboud University Nijmegen was established in 1923 as the ''Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen'' (Catholic University of Nijmegen). It was founded by the Saint Radboud Foundation, a network of [[Bishop|bishops]] that wished to [[Emancipation|emancipate]] Catholic intellectuals in the Netherlands.<ref name=":1" /> At the time, Dutch Roman Catholics were disadvantaged and occupied almost no higher posts in governmental and scientific institutions. The establishment of a university was seen as a possible stepping stone for these individuals.  [[File:Opening RKUN 1923.jpg|thumb|The official opening of the Catholic University of Nijmegen in 1923. The [[Bedel|academic bedel]] walks with the new [[Professor|professors]] to the Saint Ignatius Church.|231x231px]]The first years after the establishment of 1923 were rather successful, but during the [[World War II|Second World War]] the young university was hit hard. Many prominent members were lost, among them professors [[Robert Regout]] and [[Titus Brandsma]] who opposed Nazi rule. They were deported to [[Dachau concentration camp]] and died there. Meanwhile, students of the Catholic University of Nijmegen were prompted to sign declarations of loyalty to the Germans occupiers. [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] [[Bernard Hermesdorf]] however, was the only [[Rector (academia)|Rector Magnificus]] in the Netherlands to refuse to have his students sign these declarations of loyalty.<ref name=":1" />

Classes resumed again in March 1945, when Nijmegen was freed. Because many university buildings had been bombed during the war, there existed a need for new facilities. In 1951, the Faculty of Medical Sciences was the first faculty to move to estate Heyendaal in the southern part of Nijmegen.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Period of growth|url=https://www.ru.nl/english/about-us/our-university/history/growth_ru/|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Radboud University|language=en}}</ref> Soon, the university acquired more land in this area to house the others faculties as well. In 1988 all faculties had been moved to the new campus at Heyendaal. Since the end of the war, student numbers rose steadily from 3,000 in 1960 to 15,000 in 1980. As of October 2019, the university is host to 22,976 students, of whom 10,6% are international students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ru.nl/english/about-us/our-university/facts-figures/|title=RU Facts and Figures}}</ref>

In 2004, the university changed its name from Catholic University of Nijmegen to Radboud University Nijmegen, honoring [[Saint]] [[Radboud of Utrecht]], a [[bishop]] who lived around 900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ru.nl/over_de_universiteit/geschiedenis/|title=History of the Radboud University }}</ref>

Per 15 November 2020, the university is no longer entitled to present itself as Roman Catholic, as the [[Bishops' Conference of the Netherlands]] revoked the designation ''Catholic'' from its supervisory body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ru.nl/english/news-agenda/news/vm/2020/october/stichting-katholieke-universiteit-lose-its/|title=Stichting Katholieke Universiteit to lose its "Catholic" designation }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/989221/2020_10_19_decreet_ondertekend.pdf|title=Decreet tot intrekking van het predicaat katholiek van de Stichting Katholieke Universiteit, statutair gevestigd te Nijmegen }}</ref>

== Faculties ==
Radboud University is organized in seven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, medical sciences, law, management, philosophy, theology and religious studies.

Featured prominently on the west side of the university's Heyendaal campus is the Heyendaal castle. It borders the [[Radboud University Medical Center]], a large teaching hospital located on the campus, which is linked to the university's medical department. Bordering the university hospital is the Huygens Building, which houses the Faculty of Natural Sciences. The Erasmus Tower, which contains the Faculty of Arts, is situated at the south end of the campus next to the Radboud Sports Centre (RSC). The Erasmus Tower and the RSC border the Elinor Ostrom building, which is home to the School of Management and also encompasses the political sciences and economics faculty staff. On the other side of the Erasmus Tower, a number of general lecture halls are located along with the campus pub and bookshop. Beyond this area, one finds the modern Maria Montessori building, home to the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Grotius building, home to the Faculty of Law.

Radboud University is noted for its green campus, often listed among the most attractive in the Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ru.nl/propertymanagement/building-on-campus/green-campus/|title=Green campus|first=Geen OWMS velden|last=ingevoerd|website=Department of Property Management}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ru.nl/newstaff/facilities/facilities_on_the/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910193706/http://www.ru.nl/newstaff/facilities/facilities_on_the/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-10 |title=Facilities on the campus - Working at Radboud University |publisher=Ru.nl |accessdate=21 July 2013 }}</ref>

The university is currently undertaking major efforts to renew and refresh its campus:
* The new law faculty was completed in 2014.  
* A refurbishment of the Faculty of Dentistry building was completed in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ru.nl/uvb/bouwen-campus/projecten-opgeleverd/renovatie-tandheelkunde/|title=Renovatie Tandheelkunde|first=Geen OWMS velden|last=ingevoerd|website=Universitair Vastgoed Bedrijf}}</ref>  
* The nearby [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Berchmanianum]] monastery was purchased by the university in 2013. In 2018, it was connected to the rest of the campus. It now houses the university's general services staff and will serve as its auditorium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ru.nl/propertymanagement/building-on-campus/completed-projects/berchmanianum/|title=Berchmanianum|first=Geen OWMS velden|last=ingevoerd|website=Department of Property Management}}</ref>
* The main Erasmus tower housing the Faculty of Arts and the university restaurant is currently being refurbished.

===Radboud Excellence Initiative===
The Radboud Excellence Initiative was created with the dual purposes of attracting talents from every academic field to Radboud University while strengthening international bonds between universities worldwide. The initiative is a joint enterprise of both Radboud University and [[Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center]]. It provides two routes by which a researcher may come to Radboud University. Promising researchers who have completed their doctorate between two and eight years earlier at the time of nomination may be nominated for a fellowship whereas those researchers who are more established in their discipline may be nominated for a professorship.<ref name="Radboud Excellence Initiative">{{cite web |url=http://www.ru.nl/excellence/why-join/what-radboud/ |title=What is the Radboud Excellence Initiative? |publisher=Radboud University Nijmegen |accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>

== Student Life ==

===Student associations (1923-now)===
[[File:Nijmegen - Embleem Carolus Magnus op de gevel van Molenstraat 110.jpg|thumb|Emblem of the traditional student association Carolus Magnus]]
In 1923, when the Catholic University of Nijmegen was founded, every student automatically became part of [[Corporation (university)|student corporation]] [[N.S.V. Carolus Magnus|Carolus Magnus]], named after the Frankish king, [[Charlemagne]], who resided in Nijmegen. This corporation was constructed to advocate for the needs of students and take care of the yearly [[Initiation|initiation ceremony]] for new students. Carolus Magnus wished to attain the same status as other corporations in the well-known Dutch student cities of [[Leiden]], [[Delft]] and [[Groningen]]. To the horror of the Catholic University’s management, it also pursued the same [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Elitism|elitist]] character as these other corporations. Still, Carolus Magnus continued developing and students eagerly participated. In the 1920s it produced its own ''sociëteiten:'' male students became part of Gentleman’s Society Roland (1928) and female students joined Lady’s Society Lumen Ducet (1929). Students of these ''sociëteiten'' that felt particularly close to each other united in smaller communities called ''disputen''. 

After the war student numbers at the Catholic University rose steadily, so did the number of ''disputen, sociëteiten'' and sport/cultural associations. In 1947, Rowing Association Phocas was founded and in 1957 Cultural Association Diogenes emerged. Umbrella organization Carolus Magnus became increasingly bloated and lost connection with the members of ''sociëteiten'' and ''disputen'' that began to operate more independently. In the 1960s Carolus Magnus received severe criticism. The student population had become more diverse, left-leaning and less elitist. The [[Hippie|hippie movement]] had reached Nijmegen and many students wanted a more [[Democracy|democratic]] student life. Carolus Magnus was not the beloved corporation it used to be and slowly became more concerned with administrative duties than organizing community activities. In 1966 Carolus Magnus ceased to exist in its traditional sense. From that moment on, students were free to choose which association they joined and which not. 

The administrative and advocacy duties of Carolus Magnus were handed over to a new student senate named AKKU. The fun and community related duties of Carolus were transferred to Gentleman's Society Roland and Lady's Society Lumen Ducet that merged in 1973 under the known name of Carolus Magnus. In the 1980s and 1990s other kinds of student associations were established in Nijmegen, such as [[Evangelicalism|evangelical-christian]] association Navigators, and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] association Ovum Novum. In 2005 Karpe Noktum emerged as the first alternative student association in Nijmegen.

===Study associations===
Lately study associations have overtaken part of the role that student associations like Carolus Magnus used to play, These study associations are related to individual degree programs and are open to [[International student|international students]] as well. Study associations don’t have [[Hazing|initiation rituals]] and regularly meet for fun-related, as well as study-related activities. Some examples of study associations are the study association for history students (Excallibur), the study association for psychology students (SPIN), and the study association for Business Administration students (Synergy). 

=== Athletics ===
At the Radboud Sports Centre (RSC) students are welcome 7 days a week. During its opening hours students can choose between at least 80 different sports. In addition to the facilities of the Radboud Sports Centre, Radboud University also boasts more than 35 student sport clubs such as the Radboud Rangers (baseball), Obelix (rugby), Apelliotes (hockey) and FC Kunde (soccer). Phocas (rowing) and De Loefbijter (sailing) are by far the biggest sport clubs in Nijmegen. Next to their sport related activities, they also host several parties.
