==History==
[[File:Time Magazine - first cover.jpg|thumb|right|The first issue of ''Time'' (March 3, 1923), featuring [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Joseph Gurney Cannon|Joseph G. Cannon]].]]
Since its debut in [[New York City]] on March 3, 1923, ''Time'' magazine was first published based in New York City by [[Briton Hadden]] and [[Henry Luce]], making it the first weekly news magazine in the United States.<ref name="History of TIME">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/collections/0,21428,c_time_history,00.shtml|title=History of TIME|work=Time}}</ref> The two had previously worked together as chairman and managing editor, respectively, of the ''[[Yale Daily News]].'' They first called the proposed magazine ''Facts''. They wanted to emphasize brevity, so that a busy man could read it in an hour. They changed the name to ''Time'' and used the slogan "Take Time&nbsp;– It's Brief".<ref>Brinkley, ''The Publisher'', pp 88–89</ref> Hadden was considered carefree and liked to tease Luce. He saw ''Time'' as important, but also fun, which accounted for its heavy coverage of celebrities and politicians, the entertainment industry and pop culture, criticizing it as too light for serious news.

It set out to tell the news through people, and for many decades through the late 1960s, the magazine's cover depicted a single person. More recently, ''Time'' has incorporated "People of the Year" issues which grew in popularity over the years. Notable mentions of them were Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, etc. The first issue of ''Time'' was published on March 3, 1923, featuring [[Joseph Gurney Cannon|Joseph G. Cannon]], the retired [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], on its cover; a facsimile reprint of Issue No. 1, including all of the articles and advertisements contained in the original, was included with copies of the February 28, 1938 issue as a commemoration of the magazine's 15th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brycezabel.com/instanthistory/2006/03/time_magazine_f.html |title=Instant History: Review of First Issue with Cover |publisher=Brycezabel.com |date=March 3, 1923 |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}</ref> The cover price was 15¢ (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.15|1923|r=2|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}). On Hadden's death in 1929, Luce became the dominant man at ''Time'' and a major figure in the history of 20th-century media. According to ''Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1972–2004'' by Robert Elson, "[[Roy Edward Larsen]] [...] was to play a role second only to Luce's in the development of Time Inc". In his book, ''[[The March of Time]], 1935–1951'', Raymond Fielding also noted that Larsen was "originally circulation manager and then general manager of ''Time'', later publisher of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', for many years president of Time Inc., and in the long history of the corporation the most influential and important figure after Luce".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Around the time they were raising $100,000 from wealthy [[Yale]] alumni such as Henry P. Davison, partner of [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]], publicity man Martin Egan and J.P. Morgan & Co. banker Dwight Morrow, Henry Luce, and Briton Hadden hired Larsen in 1922&nbsp;– although Larsen was a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate and Luce and Hadden were Yale graduates. After Hadden died in 1929, Larsen purchased 550 shares of Time Inc., using money he obtained from selling [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] stock which he had inherited from his father, who was the head of the [[Benjamin Franklin Keith]] theatre chain in [[New England]]. However, after Briton Hadden's death, the largest Time, Inc. stockholder was Henry Luce, who ruled the media conglomerate in an autocratic fashion, "at his right hand was Larsen", Time's second-largest stockholder, according to ''Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923–1941''. In 1929, Roy Larsen was also named a Time Inc. director and vice president. J. P. Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks, both over ''Time'' and ''Fortune''. Other shareholders were Brown Brothers [[W. A. Harriman]] & Co., and the New York Trust Company ([[Standard Oil]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Time Inc. stock owned by Luce at the time of his death was worth about $109&nbsp;million, and it had been yielding him a yearly dividend of more than $2.4&nbsp;million, according to Curtis Prendergast's ''The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise 1957–1983''. The Larsen family's Time stock was worth around $80&nbsp;million during the 1960s, and Roy Larsen was both a Time Inc. director and the chairman of its executive committee, later serving as Time's vice chairman of the board until the middle of 1979. According to the September 10, 1979, issue of ''The New York Times'', "Mr. Larsen was the only employee in the company's history given an exemption from its policy of mandatory retirement at age 65."

After ''Time'' magazine began publishing its weekly issues in March 1923, Roy Larsen was able to increase its circulation by using U.S. radio and movie theaters around the world. It often promoted both ''Time'' magazine and U.S. political and corporate interests. According to ''[[The March of Time]]'', as early as 1924, Larsen had brought ''Time'' into the infant radio business with the broadcast of a 15-minute sustaining quiz show entitled ''Pop Question'' which survived until 1925". Then, in 1928, Larsen "undertook the weekly broadcast of a 10-minute programme series of brief news summaries, drawn from current issues of ''Time'' magazine [...] which was originally broadcast over 33 stations throughout the United States".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Larsen next arranged for a 30-minute radio program, ''[[The March of Time]]'', to be broadcast over [[CBS]], beginning on March 6, 1931. Each week, the program presented a dramatisation of the week's news for its listeners, thus ''Time'' magazine itself was brought "to the attention of millions previously unaware of its existence", according to ''Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise 1923–1941'', leading to an increased circulation of the magazine during the 1930s. Between 1931 and 1937, Larsen's ''[[The March of Time]]'' radio program was broadcast over CBS radio and between 1937 and 1945 it was broadcast over NBC radio&nbsp;– except for the 1939 to 1941 period when it was not aired. ''[[People (American magazine)|People Magazine]]'' was based on ''<nowiki>Time'</nowiki>''s People page.

In 1987, [[Jason McManus]] succeeded [[Henry Grunwald (editor)|Henry Grunwald]] as editor-in-chief<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/01/16/201800/index.htm|date=16 January 1995|title=In the Shoes of Henry R. Luce            |work=Fortune|access-date=7 April 2020|language=en-US}}</ref> and oversaw the transition before [[Norman Pearlstine]] succeeded him in 1995.
In 1989, when Time, Inc. and Warner Communications merged, ''Time'' became part of [[Time Warner]], along with [[Warner Bros.]]In 2000,'' Time'' became part of [[Time Warner#Merger with AOL|AOL Time Warner]], which reverted to the name Time Warner in 2003.

In 2007, ''Time'' moved from a Monday subscription/newsstand delivery to a schedule where the magazine goes on sale Fridays, and is delivered to subscribers on Saturday.<!--dead link<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4123937.html|title=Chron.com|publisher=}}</ref>--> The magazine actually began in 1923 with Friday publication.

During early 2007, the year's first issue was delayed for roughly a week due to "editorial changes", including the layoff of 49 employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/229978/time-inc-layoffs-surveying-the-wreckage|title=Time Inc.

In 2009, ''Time'' announced that they were introducing a personalized print magazine, ''Mine'', mixing content from a range of Time Warner publications based on the reader's preferences. The new magazine met with a poor reception, with criticism that its focus was too broad to be truly personal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/04/times-foray-into-personalized-publishing-time-mine/|title=Time's foray into personal publishing|accessdate=December 15, 2007|date=April 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430001058/http://platform.idiomag.com/2009/04/times-foray-into-personalized-publishing-time-mine/|archivedate=April 30, 2009}}</ref>

==Style==
''Time'' initially possessed a distinctive writing style, making regular use of [[inverted sentence]]s. This was parodied in 1936 by [[Wolcott Gibbs]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': "Backward ran sentences until reeled the mind [...] Where it all will end, knows God!"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpMiAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Backward+ran+sentences+until+reeled+the+mind%22 |title=The New Yorker – Google Books |accessdate=January 26, 2014|last1=Ross |first1=Harold Wallace |last2=White |first2=Katharine Sergeant Angell |year=1936 }}</ref>

Until the mid-1970s, ''Time'' had a weekly section called "Listings", which contained capsule summaries and/or reviews of then-current significant films, plays, musicals, television programs, and literary bestsellers similar to ''[[The New Yorker]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>''s "Current Events" section.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive|work=Time|title=TIME Magazine archives}}</ref>

''Time'' is also known for its signature red border, first introduced in 1927.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/great-american-novelist/Content?oid=4940853 |title=Great American Novelist |last=Lin |first=Tao |date=September 21, 2010 |work=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|TheStranger.com]] |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> The border has only been changed six times since 1927:

*The issue released shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States featured a black border to symbolize [[mourning]]. However, this was a special "extra" edition published quickly for the breaking news of the event; the next regularly scheduled issue contained the red border. 
*The April 28, 2008, [[Earth Day]] issue, dedicated to [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], contained a green border.<ref>MSNBC-TV report by Andrea Mitchell, April 17, 2008, 1:45&nbsp;pm .</ref><!-- temporary reference; more permanent one to follow -->
*The September 19, 2011, issue, commemorating the [[Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks|10th anniversary of September 11 attacks]], had a metallic silver border.
*Another silver border was used in the December 31, 2012, issue, noting [[Barack Obama]]'s selection as Person of the Year.
*The November 28/December 5, 2016, issue, also featuring a silver border covering the Most Influential Photos of All Time.
*The June 15, 2020, issue of the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd is the first time the red border of TIME includes the names of people. The cover, by artist Titus Kaphar, depicts an African-American mother holding her child.
*The September 21 & 28, 2020, issue on the American response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] featured a black border.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5887436/time-black-border-coronavirus/|work=Time|title=The Story Behind TIME's Issue Marking Nearly 200,000 U.S. Deaths—and Why Its Border Is Black For the Second Time in History}}</ref>

Former president [[Richard Nixon]] has been among the most frequently-featured on the front page of Time, having appeared 55 times from the August 25, 1952 issue to the May 2, 1994 issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3085905/richard-nixon-resignation-anniversary-watergate-time-covers/|title=Watch: The Rise and Fall of Richard Nixon in TIME Covers|website=Time|language=en|access-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>

In 2007, ''Time'' engineered a style overhaul of the magazine<!--LATTER PART NEEDS A CITE: aimed at appealing to a younger generation-->. Among other changes, the magazine reduced the red cover border  to promote featured stories, enlarged column titles, reduced the number of featured stories, increased [[White space (visual arts)|white space]] around articles, and accompanied opinion pieces with photographs of the writers.

The November 02, 2020 issue of the U.S. edition of Time is the first time that the cover logo "Time" was not used. The issue's cover had a replacement logo "Vote" along with artwork by Shepard Fairey, of a voter wearing a pandemic face mask, and accompanied by information on how to vote. The magazine's Editor-in-Chief and CEO of TIME Edward Felsenthal explained this decision for a one-time cover logo change as a "rare moment, one that will separate history into before and after for generations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Felsenthal |first1=Edward |title=TIME Replaced Its Logo on the Cover For the First Time in Its Nearly 100-Year History.

===Person of the Year===
{{Main|Time Person of the Year}}
''Time''{{'}}s most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual "Person of the Year" (formerly "Man of the Year") cover story, in which ''Time'' recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the past 12 months. The distinction is supposed to go to the person who, "for good or ill", has most affected the course of the year; it is, therefore, not necessarily an honor or a reward. In the past, such figures as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] have been Man of the Year.

In 2006, Person of the Year was designated as [[You (Time Person of the Year)|"You"]], a move that was met with split reviews. Some thought the concept was creative; others wanted an actual person of the year. Editors Pepper and Timmer reflected that, if it had been a mistake, "we're only going to make it once".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Time of Their Lives|url= http://nymag.com/news/features/28976/|accessdate=April 22, 2007}}</ref>

In 2017, ''Time'' named The Silence Breakers, people who came forward with personal stories of sexual harassment, as Person of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/12/06/times-person-year-silence-breakers-speaking-out-against-sexual-harassment/926184001/|title=Time's Person of the Year: 'Silence Breakers' speaking out against sexual harassment|publisher=}}</ref>

===''Time'' 100===
{{Main|Time 100}}

In recent years, ''Time'' has assembled an annual list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Originally, they had made a list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. These issues usually have the front cover filled with pictures of people from the list and devote a substantial amount of space within the magazine to the 100 articles about each person on the list. In some cases, over 100 people have been included, as when two people have made the list together, sharing one spot.

The magazine also compiled "All-''TIME'' 100 best novels" and "[[Time magazine's "All-TIME" 100 best movies|All-''TIME'' 100 best movies]]" lists in 2005,<ref>{{cite news|title=All-''TIME'' 100 Movies|first=Richard|last=Corliss|authorlink=Richard Corliss|author2=[[Richard Schickel|Schickel, Richard]]|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies|date=February 12, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Best Soundtracks|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/0,23220,soundtracks,00.html|date=February 12, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1068026,00.html|title=That Old Feeling: Secrets of the All-''Time'' 100|first=Richard|last=Corliss|date=June 2, 2005|work=Time|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811185345/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1068026,00.html|archivedate=August 11, 2010}}</ref> "The 100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME''" in 2007,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1651341_1659192_1652529,00.html|title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME''|first=James|last=Poniewozik|authorlink=James Poniewozik|work=Time|date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> and "All-''TIME'' 100 Fashion Icons" in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,2110513,00.html|title=All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons|work=Time|date=April 2, 2012}}</ref>

In February 2016, ''Time'' mistakenly included the male author [[Evelyn Waugh]] on its "100 Most Read Female Writers in College Classes" list (he was 97th on the list).

===Red X covers===
[[File:Time Magazine red X covers.jpg|right|thumb|''Time'' red X covers: from left to right, Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and Osama bin Laden]]
During its history, on five nonconsecutive occasions, ''Time'' has released a special issue with a cover showing an X scrawled over the face of a man or a national symbol. The first ''Time'' magazine with a red X cover was released on May 7, 1945, showing a red X over [[Adolf Hitler]]'s face. The second X cover was released more than three months later on August 20, 1945, with a black X (to date, the magazine's only such use of a black X) covering the [[flag of Japan]], representing the recent [[surrender of Japan]] and which signaled the end of [[World War II]].

Fifty-eight years later, on April 21, 2003, ''Time'' released another issue with a red X over [[Saddam Hussein]]'s face, two weeks after the start of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Invasion of Iraq]]. On June 13, 2006, ''Time'' magazine printed a red X cover issue following the death of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] in a U.S. airstrike in [[Iraq]]. The most recent red X cover issue of ''Time'' was published on May 2, 2011, after the [[death of Osama bin Laden]].<ref name="redxcovers">{{cite web|date=May 2, 2011|title=A Brief History of Time Magazine's 'X' Covers|first=Ray|last=Gustini|url=http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2011/05/brief-history-time-magazine-red-x-covers/37269/|work=[[The Atlantic|The Wire]]}}</ref>
