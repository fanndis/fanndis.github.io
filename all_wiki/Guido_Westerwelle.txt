'''Guido Westerwelle''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡiːdo ˈvɛstɐˌvɛlə|lang}}; 27 December 1961 – 18 March 2016) was a German politician who served as [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] in the [[Cabinet Merkel II|second cabinet]] of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and as [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]] from 2009 to 2011, being the first [[coming out|openly gay]] person to hold any of these positions. He was also the chairman of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (FDP) from May 2001 until he stepped down in 2011.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-04/fdp-westerwelle-parteivorsitz-2 "Westerwelle gibt den FDP-Vorsitz ab"] ''Die Zeit''  (3 April 2011) {{in lang|de}}.</ref> A lawyer by profession, he was a member of the [[Bundestag]] from 1996 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
Guido Westerwelle was born in [[Bad Honnef]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].<ref name=welt>{{cite web|title=Guido Westerwelle|url=https://www.welt.de/themen/guido-westerwelle/|work=Die Welt|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>  His parents were lawyers.<ref name="deut"/> He graduated from [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1980 after academic struggles resulted in his departure from previous institutions where he was considered an average student at best, but substandard otherwise.<ref>[Vgl. Setzen, Sechs! – Schulgeschichten aus Deutschland (3/3). Experiment Schule. Dokumentarfilm von Susanne Bausch im Auftrag des SWR. Deutsche Erstausstrahlung am 22. Dezember 2005.</ref> He studied law at the [[University of Bonn]] from 1980 to 1987. Following the First and Second State Law Examinations in 1987 and 1991 respectively, he began practising as an attorney in [[Bonn]] in 1991. In 1994, he earned a doctoral degree in law from [[University of Hagen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Doktortitel in der Politik|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/doktortitel-in-der-politik-der-club-der-akademischen-schoenfaerber-1.1061445-4|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=18 March 2016|date=17 February 2011}}</ref>

==Career in the FDP==
[[file:Archiv Kosinsky 0671.jpg|thumb|left|Westerwelle in 1988]]
Westerwelle joined the FDP in 1980. He was a founding member of the ''[[Young Liberals (Germany)|Junge Liberale]]'' (Young Liberals), which became the party's official youth organisation in 1983, and was its chairman from 1983 to 1988. In a 1988 newspaper interview, he singled out the FDP's rejection of an [[Tax amnesty|amnesty for tax offenders]] and its diminished enthusiasm for nuclear power as fruits of the youth wing's labors.<ref name="Profile: Guido Westerwelle">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2247134.stm Profile: Guido Westerwelle] ''[[BBC Monitoring]]'', 11 September 2002.</ref>

He was a member of the executive board of the FDP from 1988,<ref>{{cite web|title=Westerwelle und die FDP – Der lange Lauf des Guido W.|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/guido-westerwelle-und-die-fdp-das-auf-und-ab-des-guido-w-1.1080757-3|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=18 March 2016|language=de|date=30 August 2011}}</ref> and in 1994, he was appointed secretary general of the party.<ref name="Profile: Guido Westerwelle"/>

In 1996, Westerwelle was first elected a member of the Bundestag, filling in for Heinz Lanfermann, who had resigned from his seat after entering the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Ministry of Justice]]. In the [[1998 German federal election|1998 national elections]], he was re-elected to parliament. As his parliamentary group's home affairs spokesman, he was instrumental in swinging the FDP behind a 1999 government bill to make German citizenship available to children born in Germany of non-German parents.<ref name="Profile: Guido Westerwelle"/>

In 2001, Westerwelle succeeded [[Wolfgang Gerhardt]] as party chairman. Gerhardt, however, remained chairman of the FDP's parliamentary group. Westerwelle, the youngest party chairman at the time, emphasized economics and education, and espoused a strategy initiated by his deputy [[Jürgen Möllemann]], who, as chairman of the [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] branch of the FDP, had led his party back into the state parliament, gaining 9.8% of the vote. This strategy, transferred to the federal level, was dubbed ''Project 18'', referring both to the envisioned percentage and the German age of majority. Leading up to the 2002 elections, he positioned his party equidistantly from the major parties and refused to commit his party to a coalition with either the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] or the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]. He was also named the FDP's candidate for the office of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Westerwelle erster Kanzlerkandidat der FDP|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/wahlkampf-westerwelle-erster-kanzlerkandidat-der-fdp-160522.html#/elections|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|accessdate=18 March 2016|language=de|date=12 May 2002}}</ref> Since the FDP had never claimed such a candidacy (and hasn't done since) and had no chance of attaining it against the two major parties, this move was widely seen as political marketing alongside other ploys, such as driving around in a campaign van dubbed the ''Guidomobile'', wearing the figure ''18'' on the soles of his shoes or appearing in the [[Big Brother (TV series)|''Big Brother'' TV show]].<ref>{{cite web|author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/488/399272/text/|title=FDP-Kanzlerkandidat – "Eher wird Pieper Päpstin als Westerwelle Kanzler" – Deutschland |work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> Eventually, the [[2002 German federal election|federal elections]] yielded a slight increase of the FDP's vote from 6.2% to 7.4%. Despite this setback, he was reelected as party chairman in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Westerwelle gibt Fehler zu – Wiederwahl zum FDP-Chef mit schlechterem Ergebnis als 2001|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/westerwelle-gibt-fehler-zu-wiederwahl-zum-fdp-chef-mit-schlechterem-ergebnis-als-2001/415218.html|work=Tagesspiegel|accessdate=18 March 2016|language=de|date=17 May 2003}}</ref>

In the [[2005 German federal election|federal elections of 2005]], Westerwelle was his party's front-runner. When neither Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s Social Democrats and Greens nor a coalition of Christian and Free Democrats, favored by [[Angela Merkel]] and Westerwelle, managed to gain a majority of seats, Westerwelle rejected overtures by Chancellor Schröder to save his chancellorship by entering his coalition, preferring to become one of the leaders of the disparate opposition of the subsequently formed "Grand Coalition" of Christian and Social Democrats, with Merkel as chancellor. Westerwelle became a vocal critic of the new government. In 2006, according to an internal agreement, Westerwelle succeeded Wolfgang Gerhardt as chairman of the parliamentary group.<ref name=welt/><ref>{{cite web|title=Gerhardt zum FDP-Fraktionsvorsitzenden auf Zeit gewählt|url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/gerhardt-zum-fdp-fraktionsvorsitzenden-auf-zeit-gewaehlt-aid-1.1593852|work=Rheinische Post|accessdate=18 March 2016|language=de|date=27 September 2005}}</ref>

Over the following years, in an effort to broaden the party's appeal, Westerwelle embraced its left wing under former justice minister [[Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger]] and focused his campaign messages on tax cuts, education and civil rights.<ref>Severin Weiland (28 September 2009), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/fdp-triumph-westerwelle-tries-to-allay-fears-of-center-right-coalition-a-651884.html FDP Triumph: Westerwelle Tries to Allay Fears of Center-Right Coalition] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

==Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor of Germany==
In the [[2009 German federal election|federal elections of 2009]], Westerwelle committed his party to a coalition with Merkel's [[CDU/CSU]], ruling out a coalition with [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and Greens, and led his party to unprecedented 14.6% share of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html |title=Übersicht |publisher=Bundeswahlleiter.de |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011002434/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html |archive-date=11 October 2009}}</ref> In accordance with earlier announcements, he formed a [[coalition government]] with CDU/CSU.<ref name="dw.de">Bettina Marx (16 August 2013), [http://www.dw.de/the-difficult-path-of-foreign-minister-guido-westerwelle/a-17012480 The difficult path of Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>

On 28 October, Westerwelle was sworn in as [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] and [[Vice Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]], becoming the head of the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Handelsblatt, Düsseldorf, Germany |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/der-schwarz-gelbe-showdown-beginnt;2469840 |title=Der schwarz-gelbe Showdown beginnt – Politik – Deutschland |publisher=Handelsblatt.com |date=16 October 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE58Q27P20090927 |title=German elections seen triggering brief stocks rally |work=Reuters |date=27 September 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6848166.ece ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901223718/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6848166.ece |date=1 September 2011 }}</ref> His deputies at the Foreign Office were his close political ally [[Cornelia Pieper]] and foreign policy expert [[Werner Hoyer]] as Ministers of State. Hoyer had previously held the same office in the [[Cabinet Kohl V]]. In a much-discussed move, Westerwelle travelled to Poland, the Netherlands and Belgium before visiting France.<ref>Silke Wettach (6 January 2010), [http://www.politico.eu/article/charismatic-outsider/ Charismatic outsider] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref>
[[File:Westerwelle hamm 2009.jpg|thumb|Westerwelle speaking at an election rally in Hamm, 2009]]
On 19 November 2009, Westerwelle joined around 800 dignitaries from around the world – including US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], French Foreign Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] and British Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] – to witness Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]]’s swearing in for a second term in office.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/westerwelle-welcomes-karzai-speech-during-afghanistan-visit/a-4907997 Westerwelle welcomes Karzai speech during Afghanistan visit] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 19 November 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-world-from-berlin-afghanistan-cannot-advance-on-words-alone-a-662458.html The World From Berlin: Afghanistan 'Cannot Advance on Words Alone'] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 20 November 2009.</ref>

===WikiLeaks controversy and election defeats===
In late November 2010, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked U.S. diplomatic cables]] revealed that [[US State Department|American diplomats]] considered Westerwelle an obstacle to deeper [[Germany–United States relations|transatlantic relations]] and were sceptical of his abilities, with one cable comparing him unfavorably to former German foreign minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,731645-2,00.html|title=How America Views the Germans|work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> On 3 December 2010, Westerwelle dismissed his personal assistant Helmut Metzner following a [[WikiLeaks]] diplomatic cables release which led to Metzner admitting that he regularly spied for the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/31416|title=Heads start rolling in WikiLeaks affair|work=[[EU Observer]] |date=3 December 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref> By May 2011, opinion polls ranked Westerwelle as one of the most unpopular and ineffective foreign ministers since the late 1940s.<ref>Judy Dempsey (9 May 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/world/europe/10iht-letter10.html A Fine Time for Germany to Speak Up] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 10 May 2011.</ref> At the time, his party had collapsed in several states, including [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Bremen]] where they failed to secure the [[Election threshold|5% threshold]] necessary for a seat in parliament.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/25/germany-liberal-collapse-free-democrats "Germany's liberal collapse parallels Clegg's fate"], Hans Kundnani.

===International crisis===
During his tenure as foreign minister, Westerwelle prevailed over lawmakers in his party who opposed bailing out [[Greece]] during the [[European debt crisis]].<ref>Rainer Buergin and Arne Delfs (18 March 2016), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-18/guido-westerwelle-former-german-foreign-minister-dies-at-54 Guido Westerwelle, Merkel's Former Deputy Chancellor, Dies] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

Amid efforts by the United States and European nations to isolate Iran's then-president, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], Westerwelle traveled to Tehran in February 2011 to bring home two journalists for the weekly newspaper ''[[Bild am Sonntag]]'' who were released after being arrested in October 2010. After weeks of negotiations, the Iranians reached out to discuss the release of the pair, the reporter [[Marcus Hellwig]] and the photographer Jens Koch. The two reporters had been arrested while interviewing the son of [[Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani]], a woman sentenced to death for adultery.<ref>Erik Kirschbaum (2 January 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/02/us-iran-ashtiani-germany-idUSTRE7010EO20110102 Germany urges release of reporters jailed in Iran] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> A condition of their release was that Westerwelle meet with Ahmadinejad, causing Iranian exile groups in Europe to condemn the visit and to argue that Germany was bowing to the Tehran government at a time when security forces were cracking down on pro-democracy demonstrators.<ref>Judy Dempsey (21 February 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/world/europe/22germany.html Germany Says Iran Meeting Necessary to Free Journalists] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

When Iran briefly refused to allow a plane carrying German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to India to cross its air space in May 2013, Westerwelle summoned Iran's ambassador to Germany, [[Alireza Sheikhattar]], complaining about "a disrespect for Germany that we will not accept."<ref>Andreas Rinke (31 May 2011), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/31/uk-india-merkel-iran-idUKTRE74U4FJ20110531 Merkel lands in India after Iran blocks plane] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> He later temporarily recalled Germany's ambassador to Iran for consultation after an [[2011 attack on the British Embassy in Iran|attack on the British Embassy in Tehran]] in November 2013.<ref>Maria Sheahan and Sylvia Westall (30 November 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/30/us-germany-iran-ambassador-idUSTRE7AT1OT20111130 Germany recalls ambassador from Iran: German media] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In April 2011, Westerwelle summoned China's ambassador to Germany, [[Wu Hongbo]],  for a meeting about detained Chinese artist-activist [[Ai Weiwei]], calling for his release and denouncing China's growing use of extrajudicial detentions against dissidents.<ref>Oliver Denzer (6 April 2011), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/uk-china-dissident-artist-germany-idUKTRE7354EP20110406 Germany summons China ambassador on detained artist] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In September 2012, Westerwelle joined his Jordanian counterpart [[Nasser Judeh]] in visiting the [[Zaatari refugee camp]] to learn more about the plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|Syrians]] fleeing the violence in the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] that erupted in 2011.<ref>[http://www.amman.diplo.de/Vertretung/amman/de/00-start/hochr_20besucher/archiv_20bis_202013/bm_20sept_202012.html Bundesaußenminister Westerwelle besucht Jordanien und sagt weitere 2 Mio.

After the offices of both the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] in [[St Petersburg]] and the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] in [[Moscow]] were investigated by prosecutors and tax inspectors in March 2013, Westerwelle summoned the [[Envoy (title)|envoy]] at the Russian embassy in Berlin to relay his "concern over the concerted action".<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21952416 Fears for NGOs in Russia as tax raids multiply] ''[[BBC News]]'', 27 March 2013.</ref>

On 4 December 2013, Westerwelle walked with opposition leaders through an encampment on Kiev's [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]], the focus of protests over the [[Viktor Yanukovych|Yanukovych government]]'s U-turn away from the European Union and toward Russia; Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] subsequently called any participation by foreign officials in the political events unfolding in Ukraine "interference in internal affairs."<ref>Steve Gutterman (6 December 2013), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/12/06/uk-ukraine-russia-medvedev-idUKBRE9B507G20131206 Russia rebukes German minister for visit to Kiev protest camp] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Arab Spring===
When the insurgency against [[Libya]]'s dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]] broke out in early 2011, Westerwelle promptly stated his support for the repressed opposition. Earlier, he had initially been cautious before making any pronouncements about Tunisia and Egypt, but in the case of Libya, he quickly called out Gaddafi as a dictator, and argued in favour of EU-level sanctions against the regime in [[Tripoli]].<ref>Brian Rohan (6 March 2011), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/06/libya-germany-sanctions-idUKLDE7250FS20110306 Germany wants tougher sanctions on Libya's Gaddafi] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Severin Weiland and Roland Nelles (18 March 2011), [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/18/libya-germany-un-security-council Germany has marginalised itself over Libya] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> Strongly motivated by a widespread aversion in Germany to the use of military force, he shared with Chancellor Merkel a deep scepticism about a no-fly zone as it was suggested by France and the United Kingdom.<ref>Henry Chu (1 April 2011), [https://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/01/world/la-fg-germany-libya-20110402 Some in Germany critical of decision to sit out Libya operation] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> At a [[UN Security Council]] meeting in March 2011, Westerwelle abstained in the vote on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] to establish a no-fly zone, along with veto powers Russia and China as well as Brazil and India.<ref name="dw.de"/> Shortly after, he expelled five Libyan diplomats for intimidating Libyan citizens living in Germany.<ref>Sabine Siebold (13 April 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/13/us-germany-libya-idUSTRE73C22420110413 Germany expels five Libyan diplomats] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> During a visit to [[Benghazi]] in June 2011, Westerwelle announced that Germany would recognize the rebel [[National Transitional Council]] as the legitimate representative of Libyans.<ref>Maria Golovnina (13 June 2011), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/06/13/us-libya-idUKTRE7270JP20110613 Germany recognizes Libya's rebel leadership] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Crisis in Sudan===
In June 2011, Westerwelle became the first German foreign minister to travel to [[Darfur]], where he visited the [[United Nations]]/[[African Union]] operation [[UNAMID]] towards which Germany had contributed military, police and civilian personnel. He was also the first to visit [[South Sudan]] shortly before its independence, where he met the country's [[List of Presidents of South Sudan|founding President]] [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]]; as the rotating chair of the [[UN Security Council]] at the time, Germany was responsible for accepting the newly independent country into the [[United Nations]].<ref>[http://www.dw.de/germanys-foreign-minister-calls-for-lasting-cooperation-in-divided-sudan/a-15184919 Germany's foreign minister calls for lasting cooperation in divided Sudan] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 23 June 2011.</ref> During his trip, however, he made no appointment to meet Sudanese [[List of heads of state of Sudan|President]] [[Omar al-Bashir]] who is wanted by the [[International Criminal Court]] on charges of [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]] allegedly committed in Darfur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chelsom-Pill|first1=Charlotte|title=Germany's foreign minister calls for lasting cooperation in divided Sudan|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-foreign-minister-calls-for-lasting-cooperation-in-divided-sudan/a-15184919|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=18 March 2016|date=23 June 2011}}</ref>

In September 2012, Westerwelle summoned the Sudanese ambassador in Berlin after violent attacks on Germany's embassy in [[Khartoum]], and called on the Sudanese government to guarantee the security of the embassy; thousands of protesters had previously vandalized the embassies of Germany and Britain, outraged by ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'', a film which has been described as denigrating to the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]].<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/protesters-angry-at-muhammad-film-store-german-embassy-in-suda-a-855890.html Muhammad Video Protests: Protesters Set Fire to German Embassy in Sudan] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 14 September 2012.</ref>

===Role in the United Nations===
During July 2011, Westerwelle was the [[President of the United Nations Security Council]] as he headed the German delegation to the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10325.doc.htm |title=Security Council Press Statement on Attacks in Mumbai, India |publisher=Un.org |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> In an attempt to continue to play an important role within the United Nations, he led the German government's successful campaign for a three-year seat on the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in late 2012.<ref>Mirjam Gehrke (11 November 2012), [http://www.dw.de/germany-eyes-seat-on-human-rights-council/a-16369512 Germany eyes seat on Human Rights Council] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref><ref>[http://www.dw.de/germany-wins-seat-on-un-human-rights-council/a-16373724 Germany wins seat on UN Human Rights Council] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 12 November 2011.</ref>

In October 2013, Israeli daily ''[[Haaretz]]'' published the text of a letter sent by Westerwelle to [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], saying that failure to appear at a [[Universal Periodic Review|periodical hearing regarding human rights]] at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] would cause severe diplomatic damage to Israel, and that its allies around the world would be hard-pressed to help it. Shortly after, Israel renewed its cooperation with the Human Rights Council after a year and a half of boycott.<ref>Barak Ravid (27 October 2013), [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.554711 Israel resuming cooperation with UN Human Rights Council] ''[[Haaretz]]''.</ref>

===Nonproliferation===
During his time in office, Westerwelle campaigned for the removal of [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s at [[United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa|US air bases in Europe]], arguing that a planned missile shield protecting Europe against ballistic rocket attack also meant that the tactical nuclear bombs are not needed. Against resistance from France, Westerwelle and German defence minister [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] demanded greater [[NATO]] commitment to nuclear disarmament at a meeting of the organization's foreign and defence ministers in October 2010.<ref name="dw.de"/> After the [[2010 United States elections|U.S. midterm elections in 2010]], Westerwelle called on newly empowered Republicans in the U.S. Congress to stand by President [[Barack Obama]]’s goals of non- proliferation and the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.<ref>Patrich Donahue (3 November 2010), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-03/westerwelle-urges-republicans-to-back-obama-s-nuclear-disarmament-policy.html Westerwelle Urges Republicans to Back Obama's Nuclear Disarmament Policy] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref>

In coordination with his foundation and [[The ATOM Project]], Westerwelle continued to advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons testing.<ref name=berlin>{{cite news|title=Berlin Conference Seeks Ways to Move Nuclear Disarmament Forward|url=http://astanatimes.com/2015/11/berlin-conference-seeks-ways-to-move-nuclear-disarmament-forward/|agency=The Astana Times}}</ref>

===Relations with Belarus===
In the belief that the European Union had to engage [[Belarus]] to prevent it from moving closer to Russia, Westerwelle – accompanied by his Polish counterpart [[Radek Sikorski]] – visited [[Minsk]] in November 2010, the first such visit in 15 years.<ref>Judy Dempsey (22 December 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/world/europe/23iht-letter23.html European Engagement With Belarus Takes a Blow] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> Shortly after, Westerwelle publicly condemned the judgements against President [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s main political opponent [[Andrei Sannikov]] and other opposition supporters.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2011/05/2011514191719445811.html Lukashenko opponent jailed for five years] ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', 14 May 2011.</ref> As a consequence, Poland, France and Germany pressed their EU partners in to impose tougher sanctions against the Belarusian leadership following the crackdown and trials of opposition leaders in the country who held peaceful protests against the fraudulent [[2010 Belarusian presidential election|presidential elections]].<ref>Judy Dempsey (20 May 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/world/europe/21iht-poland21.html France Joins Poland and Germany on Wider Unity] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

In March 2012, Lukashenko criticized EU politicians who threatened him with further sanctions over human rights abuses and in an apparent riposte to Westerwelle branding him "Europe's last dictator," said: "Better to be a dictator than gay."<ref>Lidia Kelly (4 March 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/04/us-belarus-dicator-idUSTRE8230T320120304 Belarus's Lukashenko: "Better a dictator than gay"] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> Westerwelle subsequently responded: "This statement condemns itself. I won't budge one millimeter from my commitment to human rights and democracy in Belarus after these comments."<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/better-to-be-a-dictator-than-gay-germany-slams-lukashenko-over-slur-a-819458.html "Better To Be a Dictator than Gay": Germany Slams Lukashenko Over Slur] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 5 March 2012.</ref>

===Relations with Russia===
While being foreign minister, Westerwelle maintained a fairly low profile when it came to Germany's Russia policy. He supported the policy of "change through trade" with Russia, but was widely criticized for not having a clear foreign policy doctrine. He called for more inclusion of Russia in the international community, but criticized Moscow, for example, for supporting President Assad's government in Syria.

===Views on WWII and its aftermath===
Upon taking office, Westerwelle opposed the appointment of [[Erika Steinbach]], a German politician and member of Chancellor Merkel's party, to a board overseeing the creation of the [[Centre Against Expulsions]], a place documenting the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe after [[World War II]].<ref>Patrick McGroarty (17 December 2009), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126100402980394555 German Donation Launches Fund for Auschwitz Memorial] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> In November 2010, together with his Russian counterpart [[Sergey Lavrov]], he opened the [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg Trials Memorial]] permanent exhibition in the [[Palace of Justice, Nuremberg|Palace of Justice]] building in [[Nuremberg]].<ref>{{cite news |accessdate = 19 March 2016 | url = https://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/nuremberg-trials-explored-in-museum-exhibit-1.875480 | date = 22 November 2010 | title= Nuremberg trials explored in museum exhibit | publisher = CBC }}</ref>

Under Westerwelle's leadership, the Foreign Office released a report in 2011 called "[[The Ministry and the Past]]", which alleged the ministry's collusion with the Nazis. Westerwelle said the report "shamed" the institution.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/german-fm-shamed-by-ministry-s-collaboration-with-hitler-1.321627 "German FM 'shamed' by ministry's collaboration with Hitler"], Haaretz. 28 May 2010.

Following the controversial [[Gurlitt Collection|2012 Munich artworks discovery]], he called for greater transparency in dealing with the find, which he warned could have lasting damage to Germany's international friendships.<ref>Josie Le Blond and Damien McElroy (12 November 2013), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10442987/German-task-force-to-probe-lost-Nazi-art-find.html German task force to probe lost Nazi art find] ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.</ref>

==Political positions==
[[file:Guido Westerwelle World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|thumb|Westerwelle speaking at the [[World Economic Forum]], 2013]]
===On economic policy===
Westerwelle was a staunch supporter of the [[free-market economy|free market]] and proposed reforms to curtail the German [[welfare state]] and [[deregulate]] [[German labour law]]. In an interview in February 2003, Westerwelle described labor unions as a "plague on our country" and said union officials were "the pall bearers of the welfare state and of the prosperity in our country".<ref name="brinkmann">{{cite web

}}</ref> He called for substantial [[tax cuts]] and smaller government, in line with the general direction of his party.

===On sexual equality===
Westerwelle was a staunch campaigner for sexual equality.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">Matthew Day (16 August 2012), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9480292/German-foreign-and-finance-ministers-in-gay-couple-tax-row.html German foreign and finance ministers in gay couple tax row] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.</ref> He long criticized German law's not giving complete adoption rights to gay couples. In 2012, he and finance minister [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] were at loggerheads after a high-court ruling demanded the government provide equal tax treatment to gay civil servants and armed forces members. In the German daily ''[[Bild]]'', Westerwelle said that if "[[Civil union|registered partnerships]] have the same responsibilities as married couples then they should have the same rights. It is not weakening marriage but ending discrimination. We do not live in the 1950s."<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/>

===On data protection===
In 2001, Westerwelle was one of the first politicians to push for a [[biometric passport]].<ref name="Juli Zeh Book">{{cite web

==Controversy==
Westerwelle's party chairmanship saw considerable controversy. Critics inside and outside the FDP accused him of focusing on [[public relations]], as opposed to developing and promoting sound [[policy|public policy]], especially in the [[2002 German federal election|election campaign of 2002]]. Westerwelle himself, who was made party chairman particularly because his predecessor [[Wolfgang Gerhardt]] had been viewed by many as dull and stiff, labelled his approach as ''Spaßpolitik'' (fun politics).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1918826,00.html |date=7 September 2009 |title= Guido Westerwelle, Germany's Mittelman |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}</ref><!--<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article239101/Der_Samurai_der_Spasspolitik.html?print=yes |date=3 July 2003 |title= Der Samurai der Spaßpolitik |newspaper=[[Die Welt|Welt Online]] |accessdate=9 April 2008 |language=de}}</ref>-->

In 2006, former Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] won a court order against Westerwelle who had criticized Schröder for accepting a lucrative job at [[Gazprom]], the Russian state-owned gas company, soon after losing the parliamentary election to Angela Merkel. Despite losing, Westerwelle said he would stick to his original assessment that Schröder's appointment as chairman of the [[Nord Stream|North European Gas Pipeline Company]] was "problematic".<ref>Judy Dempsey (3 April 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/world/europe/03iht-germany.html  Gag order on Schröder foe is upheld] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

On 27 September 2009, at a press conference after the election, Westerwelle refused to answer a question in English from a [[BBC]] reporter, stating that "it is normal to speak German in Germany".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20090928-22217.html |title=Future foreign minister Westerwelle refuses to answer English question |publisher=thelocal.de |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/14558508 Off to the Auswärtiges Amt] ''[[The Economist]]'' 1 October 2009.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/world/europe/guido-westerwelle-former-foreign-minister-of-germany-dies-at-54.html|title=Guido Westerwelle Dies at 54; German Foreign Minister Opposed Libya Incursion|last=Smale|first=Alison|date=18 March 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=22 March 2016}}</ref> Critics have noted that this was in part due to Westerwelle's poor command of English. He earned the epithet "Westerwave" (a literal translation of his surname into English) as a consequence of these remarks.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Falk |date=6 November 2009 |title=Westerwave ist der Schatten des Außenministers |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article5093013/Westerwave-ist-der-Schatten-des-Aussenministers.html |work=[[Die Welt]] |language=de |access-date=27 September 2017 }}</ref>

Westerwelle made public statements in 2010 about the "[[welfare state]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,678319,00.html |title=Dekadenz-Sprüche: Westerwelles explosives Oppositions-Recycling – SPIEGEL ONLINE – Nachrichten – Politik |publisher=Spiegel.de |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> saying that promising the people effortless prosperity may lead to "late Roman decadence", in reference to a verdict in the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] regarding [[Hartz IV]].

In 2010, Westerwelle announced he would not be taking his [[Civil union|civil partner]] Michael Mronz to anti-gay countries.<ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20100811-29089.html "Westerwelle won't take partner to anti-gay lands"], ''The Local''. 11 August 2010.

Westerwelle retorted that it was normal for foreign ministers to take industry representatives on their trips, calling himself a victim of "a left-wing ''zeitgeist'' that considers making business questionable".<ref>{{cite news|title=Affäre um Auslandsreisen: Westerwelle fühlt sich als Opfer des "linken Zeitgeists"|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/affaere-um-auslandsreisen-westerwelle-fuehlt-sich-als-opfer-des-linken-zeitgeists-a-683443.html|work=Spiegel Online|accessdate=18 March 2016|date=13 March 2010}}</ref>
