'''Foster care''' is a system in which a [[underage|minor]] has been placed into a [[ward (law)|ward]], [[group home]] ([[Residential Child Care Community|residential child care community]], [[Treatment centre|treatment center]], etc.), or private home of a state-[[certified]] caregiver, referred to as a "foster parent" or with a family member approved by the state. The placement of the child is normally arranged through the government or a social service agency. The institution, group home or foster parent is compensated for expenses unless with a family member. In some states, relative or "Kinship" caregivers of children who are wards of the state, are provided with a financial stipend. 

The state, via the [[family court]] and [[child protective services]] agency, stand ''[[in loco parentis]]'' to the minor, making all legal decisions while the foster parent is responsible for the day-to-day care of the minor.

Foster care is correlated with a range of negative outcomes compared to the general population.  Children in foster care suffer a high rate of ill health, particularly psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression and eating disorders.  One third of foster children in a US study reported abuse from a foster parent or other adult in the foster home.  Nearly half of foster children in the US become homeless when they reach the age of 18, and the poverty rate is three times as high among foster care alumni as in the general population.

===Australia===
{{Main|Foster care in Australia}}
In Australia foster care was known as "boarding-out". Foster care had its early stages in [[South Australia]] in 1867 and stretched to the second half of the 19th century. It is said that the system was mostly run by women until the early 20th century. Then the control was centered in many state children's departments. "Although boarding-out was also implemented by non-government[al] child rescue organizations, many large institutions remained. These institutions assumed an increasing importance from the late 1920s when the system went into decline." The system was re-energized in the postwar era, and in the 1970s. The system is still the main structure for "out-of-home care." The system took care of both local and foreign children. "The first adoption legislation was passed in [[Western Australia]] in 1896, but the remaining states did not act until the 1920s, introducing the beginnings of the closed adoption that reached it peak in the period 1940–1975. New baby adoption dropped dramatically from the mid-1970s, with the greater tolerance of and support for single mothers".<ref>Swain, Shurlee.

===Cambodia===
Foster care in Cambodia is relatively new as an official practice within the government. However, despite a later start, the practice is currently making great strides within the country. Left with a large number of official and unofficial [[orphanage]]s from the 1990s, the Cambodian government conducted several research projects in 2006 and 2008, pointing to the overuse of orphanages as a solution for caring for vulnerable children within the country. Most notably, the studies found that the percentage of children within orphanages that had parents approached 80%. At the same time, local NGOs like "Children In Families"<ref>[http://www.chlidreninfamilies.org/foster-care/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> began offering limited foster care services within the country. In the subsequent years, the Cambodian government began implementing policies that required the closure of some orphanages and the implementation of minimum standards for [[residential care]] institutions. These actions lead to an increase in the number of NGOs providing foster care placements and helped to set the course for care reform around the country. As of 2015, the Cambodian government is working with UNICEF, USAID, several governments, and many local NGOs in continuing to build the capacity for child protection and foster care within the Kingdom.

===Canada===
{{Main|Foster care in Canada}}

Foster children in Canada are known as '''permanent wards''', ('''crown wards''' in Ontario).<ref name="anne">Anne Tweddle, [http://www.voices.mb.ca/assets/Anne%20Tweddle%20Youth%20Leaving%20Care%20Report.pdf "Youth Leaving Care Report"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021093334/http://www.voices.mb.ca/assets/anne%20tweddle%20youth%20leaving%20care%20report.pdf |date=2014-10-21 }}, September 2005</ref> A [[Ward (law)|ward]] is someone, in this case a child, placed under protection of a [[legal guardian]] and are the legal responsibility of the [[Canadian government|government]]. Census data from 2011 counted children in foster care for the first time, counting 47,885 children in care. The majority of foster children – 29,590, or about 62 per cent – were aged 14 and under.<ref name="nationalpost">National Post,[http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/19/census-2011-canadas-foster-children-counted-for-first-time/ "Census 2011: Canada's foster children counted for first time"], September 19, 2012</ref> The wards remain under the care of the government until they "age out of care." All ties are severed from the government and there is no longer any legal responsibility toward the youth. This age is different depending on the province.

===Israel===

In December 2013, the Israeli [[Knesset]] approved a bill co-drafted by the [[Israel National Council for the Child]] to regulate the rights and obligations of participants in the foster care system in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Knesset-passes-bill-regulating-foster-care-system-in-Israel-334292 |author=Danielle Ziri|title=Knesset passes bill regulating foster care system in Israel|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 8, 2013|access-date=July 31, 2015}}</ref>

===Japan===
In Japan, foster care started around 1948, leading to the passing of the Child Welfare Law.<ref>Kumasaka, Y, and H Aiba. "Foster Care in Japan: Past and Present." The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. 46.2 (1968): 253. Print.</ref> The idea of foster care or taking in abandoned children actually came about around 1392-1490s in Japan. The foster care system in Japan is similar to the Orphan Trains because Brace thought the children would be better off on farms. The people in Japan thought the children would do better on farms rather than living in the "dusty city." The families would often send their children to a farm family outside the village and only keep their oldest son. The farm families served as the foster parents and they were financially rewarded for taking in the younger siblings. "It was considered an honor to be chosen as foster parents, and selection greatly depended on the family's reputation and status within the village".<ref>Kumasaka, Y, and H Aiba. "Foster Care in Japan: Past and Present." The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. 46.2 (1968): 255. Print.</ref> Around 1895 the foster care program became more like the system used in the United States because the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police]] sent children to a hospital where they would be "settled".<ref>Kumasaka, Y, and H Aiba. "Foster Care in Japan: Past and Present." The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. 46.2 (1968): 258. Print.</ref> Problems emerged in this system, such as [[child abuse]], so the government started phasing it out and "began increasing institutional facilities". In 1948 the Child Welfare Law was passed, increasing official oversight, and creating better conditions for the children to grow up in.<ref>Kumasaka, Y, and H Aiba. "Foster Care in Japan: Past and Present." The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. 46.2 (1968): 259.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Foster care in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom, foster care and adoption has always been an option, "in the sense of taking other people's children into their homes and looking after them on a permanent or temporary basis." Although, nothing about it had a legal foundation, until the 20th century. The UK had "wardship," the family taking in the child had custody by the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery Court]]. Wardship was not used very often because it did not give the guardian "parental rights." In the 19th century came a "series of baby farming scandals." At the end of the 19th century they started calling it "boarding-out" like they did in Australia. They started placing the children in [[orphanage]]s and [[workhouse]]s as well. "The First World War saw an increase in organized adoption through adoption societies and child rescue organizations, and pressure grew for adoption to be given legal status." The first laws based on adoption and foster care were passed in 1926. "The peak number of adoptions was in 1968, since when there has been an enormous decline in adoption in the United Kingdom. The main reasons for children being adopted in the United Kingdom had been unmarried mothers giving up their children for adoption and stepparents adopting their new partner's children".<ref>Keating, Jenny.

===United States===
{{Main|Foster care in the United States}}
In the United States, foster care started as a result of the efforts of [[Charles Loring Brace]]. "In the mid 19th Century, some 30,000 homeless or neglected children lived in the New York City streets and slums."<ref name="Foster Care History 2013">"Foster Care History & Accomplishments." The Children's Aid Society. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Oct. 2013.</ref> Brace took these children off the streets and placed them with families in most states in the country. Brace believed the children would do best with a Christian farm family. He did this to save them from "a lifetime of suffering"<ref name="Nordmark, Oliver 2010">Nordmark, Oliver. "Orphan Train History." : REVEREND CHARLES LORING BRACE. N.p., 09 Feb. 2010. Web. 19 Oct. 2013.</ref> He sent these children to families by train, which gave the name The [[Orphan Train]] Movement. "This lasted from 1853 to the early 1890s 1929? and transported more than 120,000 250,000? children to new lives."<ref>"Foster Care History & Accomplishments." The Children's Aid Society. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Oct. 2013</ref> When Brace died in 1890, his sons took over his work of the Children's Aid Society until they retired.<ref name="Nordmark, Oliver 2010"/> The Children's Aid Society created "a foster care approach that became the basis for the federal [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] of 1997" called Concurrent Planning. This greatly impacted the foster care system.

From August 1999 - August 2019, '''9,073,607''' American children have been removed from their families and placed in foster homes according to the federal government Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Adoption & Foster Care Statistics|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/research-data-technology/statistics-research/afcars|access-date=2020-11-16|website=Children's Bureau {{!}} ACF|language=en}}</ref>

As last reported in August 2019, 437,238 children nationally were removed from their families and placed in foster homes according to the federal government Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System.<ref name=":2" />

===France===
In France, foster care is called "Famille d'Accueil". Foster homes must obtain an official approval<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dossierfamilial.com/famille/enfant/devenir-famille-daccueil-342881}}</ref> from the government in order to welcome a minor or an elderly person. In order to receive this approval they must follow a training and their home is inspected to be sure it is safe and healthy. In 2017, 76000 minors<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1260}}</ref> and 15000 elderly persons<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.famillys.fr/faq}}</ref> were welcomed in foster homes.  

== Placement ==

Family-based foster care is generally preferred to other forms of out of home care.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=James G.|first2=Paul H.|last2=Delfabbro|title=Children in Foster Care|url=https://www.questia.com/read/104246712/children-in-foster-care|publisher=[[Routledge]]{{subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|year=2003|location=New York|pages=3–4}}</ref> Foster care is intended to be a short-term solution until a permanent placement can be made.<ref name="dorsey">Dorsey et Al. ''Current status and evidence base of training for foster and treatment foster parents''</ref> In most states, the primary objective is to reconcile children with the biological parents. However, if the parents are unable or unwilling to care for the child, then the first choice of adoptive parents is a relative such as an [[aunt]], [[uncle]] or [[grandparent]], known as [[kinship care]]. Most [[kinship care]] is done informally, without the involvement of a court or public organization. However, in the United States, formal kinship care is increasingly common. In 2012, a quarter of all children in formal foster care were placed with relatives instead of being placed into the system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aecf.org/~/media/Pubs/Initiatives/KIDS%20COUNT/S/SteppingUpforKids2012PolicyReport/SteppingUpForKidsPolicyReport2012.pdf |title= Stepping Up for Kids, Annie E. Casey Foundation |year=2012 |access-date=November 9, 2013}}</ref>

If no related family member is willing or able to adopt, the next preference is for the child to be adopted by the foster parents or by someone else involved in the child's life (such as a [[teacher]] or [[Coach (sport)|coach]]). This is to maintain continuity in the child's life. If neither above option are available, the child may be adopted by someone who is a stranger to the child.

If none of these options are viable, the plan for the minor may be to enter OPPLA (Other Planned Permanent Living Arrangement). This option allows the child to stay in custody of the state and the child can stay placed in a foster home, with a relative or a long-term care facility, such as a [[Residential Child Care Community|residential child care community]] or, for children with development disabilities, physical disabilities or mental disabilities, a [[Residential treatment center|treatment center]].

Children may enter foster care voluntarily or involuntarily. Voluntary placement may occur when a biological parent or lawful guardian is unable to care for a child. Involuntary placement occurs when a child is removed from their biological parent or lawful guardian due to the risk or actual occurrence of physical or psychological harm. In the US, most children enter foster care due to neglect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pewfostercare.org/ |title=Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care |publisher=Pewfostercare.org |access-date=2011-11-01}}</ref> If a biological parent or [[legal guardian]] is unwilling to care for a child, the child is deemed to be dependent and is placed under the care of the child protection agency. The policies regarding foster care as well as the criteria to be met in order to become a foster parent vary according to legal jurisdiction.

Especially egregious failures of child protective services often serve as a catalyst for increased removal of children from the homes of biological parents. An example is the brutal torture and murder of 17-month-old [[Death of Baby P|Peter Connelly]], a British toddler who died in [[London Borough of Haringey]], North London after suffering more than 50 severe injuries over an eight-month period, including eight broken ribs and a broken back. Throughout the period of time in which he was being tortured, he was repeatedly seen by Haringey Children's services and [[National Health Service|NHS]] health professionals.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7708398.stm ''BBC'': A short life of misery and pain]</ref> Haringey Children's services already failed ten years earlier in the case of [[murder of Victoria Climbié|Victoria Climbié]].<ref name="White">{{cite news |title=Squabble over Baby P was not the Commons at its best |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/12/pmqs-baby-p |work=The Guardian |date=2008-11-12 |first=Michael |last=White |access-date=2008-11-12 | location=London}}</ref> In the time since his death, in 2007, cases have reached a record rate in England surpassing 10,000 in the reporting year ending in March 2012.

== Development ==
As of 2019, the majority of children in the foster care system were under 8 years of age.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=The AFCARS Report|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/afcarsreport27.pdf}}</ref> These early years are quite important for the physical and mental development of children.

== Medical and psychiatric disorders ==
A higher prevalence of physical, psychological, cognitive and epigenetic disorders for children in foster care has been established in studies in various countries. The Casey Family Programs Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study was a fairly extensive study of various aspects of children who had been in foster care.
Individuals who were in foster care experience higher rates of physical and psychiatric morbidity than the general population and suffer from not being able to trust and that can lead to placements breaking down.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCann | first1 = JB | last2 = James | first2 = A | last3 = Wilson | first3 = S | last4 = Dunn | first4 = G | title = Prevalence of psychiatric disorders in young people in the care system | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 313 | issue = 7071 | pages = 1529–30 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8978231 | pmc = 2353045 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.313.7071.1529 }}</ref>

PTSD was also found in 18% of the children who were not abused. These children may have developed PTSD due to witnessing violence in the home. (Marsenich, 2002).

In a study conducted in Oregon and Washington state, the rate of PTSD in adults who were in foster care for one year between the ages of 14–18 was found to be higher than that of combat veterans, with 25 percent of those in the study meeting the diagnostic criteria as compared to 12–13 percent of Iraq war veterans and 15 percent of Vietnam war veterans, and a rate of 4% in the general population. The recovery rate for foster home alumni was 28.2% as opposed to 47% in the general population.

=== Higher Education ===
Approximately 10% of foster youth make it to college and of those 10%, only about 3% actually graduate and obtain a 4-year degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfyi.org/issues/education/|title=National Foster Youth Institute {{!}} Education|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref> Although the number of foster youth who are starting at a 4-year university after high school has increased over the years, the number of youth who graduate from college continues to remain stable.

Simultaneously, there are also many barriers that make getting to a college or university difficult.

Borton describes some of the barriers youth face in her article, ''Barriers to Post-Secondary Enrollment for Former Foster Youth''. A few of those barriers include financial hurdles, navigating through the application process with little to no support, and lack of housing.<ref>https://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1024&context=soe_faculty</ref>

Many studies have shown that there are a few factors that have seemingly played a role in the success of foster youth making it to and graduating from a college or university. While having financial resources for foster youth is a huge help, there are other components to look at. Beginning with having support for these youth at the high school level. In order for foster youth to obtain a college degree, they must enroll at a university first.

Out of the different factors that play in increasing college enrollment such as youth participating in extended foster care, reading ability, etc., youth who received assistance or had supportive relationships from adults, were more likely than youth who did not have supportive relationships, to enroll at a university.<ref name=":0" />

At colleges across the nation, there are programs that are specifically put in place to help youth who have aged out of the foster care system and continued into higher education. These programs often help youth financially by giving them supplemental funds and providing support through peer mentor programs or academic counseling services. While funding is an important key in helping get through college, it hasn't been found as the only crucial component in aiding a youth's success. &nbsp;

A study done by Jay and colleagues provides insight on what youth view as important in helping them thrive on a college campus. The study, which had a sample of 51 foster youth, used Conceptual Mapping to break down the different components of support that may be important for youth to receive on a college campus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jay Miller|first1=J.|last2=Benner|first2=Kalea|last3=Kheibari|first3=Athena|last4=Washington|first4=Earl|date=2017|title=Conceptualizing on-campus support programs for collegiate foster youth and alumni: A plan for action|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/cysrev/v83y2017icp57-67.html|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|language=en|volume=83|issue=C|pages=57–67|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.10.028}}</ref> It is important to take in the different factors that can be helpful for youth at a university and to look beyond providing financial support.

=== Psychotropic medication use ===

Studies have revealed that youth in foster care covered by [[Medicaid]] insurance receive [[psychotropic medication]] at a rate that was 3 times higher than that of Medicaid-insured youth who qualify by low family income. In a review (September 2003 to August 2004) of the medical records of 32,135 Texas foster care 0–19 years old, 12,189 were prescribed psychotropic medication, resulting in an annual prevalence of 37.9% of these children being prescribed medication. 41.3% received 3 different classes of these drugs during July 2004, and 15.9% received 4 different classes. The most frequently used medications were [[antidepressants]] (56.8%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs (55.9%), and antipsychotic agents (53.2%). The study also showed that youth in foster care are frequently treated with [[Concomitant drugs|concomitant]] [[psychotropic]] medication, for which sufficient evidence regarding safety and effectiveness is not available.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zito | first1 = JM | last2 = Safer| first2 = DJ | last3 = Sai | first3 = D | last4 = Gardner | first4 = JF | last5 = Thomas | first5 = D | last6 = Coombes | first6 = P |last7 = Dubowski | first7 = M | last8 = Mendez-Lewis| first8 = M | title = Psychotropic medication patterns among youth in foster care |journal = Pediatrics | volume = 121 |issue = 1 |pages = e157–63 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18166534 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-0212| s2cid = 1779836 }}</ref>

The use of expensive, brand name, patent protected medication was prevalent. In the case of [[SSRI]]s the use of the most expensive medications was noted to be 74%; in the general market only 28% are for brand name SSRI's vs generics.  The average out-of-pocket expense per prescription was $34.75 for generics and $90.17 for branded products, a $55.42, difference.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=19727306|pmc=2719553|year=2008|last1=Cascade|first1=EF|last2=Kalali|first2=AH|title=Generic Penetration of the SSRI Market|volume=5|issue=4|pages=25–6|journal=Psychiatry (Edgmont (Pa. : Township))}}</ref>

== Therapeutic intervention ==

Children in the child welfare system have often experienced significant and repeated traumas and having a background in foster homes—especially in instances of sexual abuse—can be the precipitating factor in a wide variety of psychological and cognitive deficits<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Racusin | first1 = R | last2 = Maerlender | first2 = AC Jr | last3 = Sengupta | first3 = A | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Psychosocial treatment of children in foster care: a review | url = https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1719&context=psychfacpub| journal = Community Ment Health J. | volume = 41 | issue = 2| pages = 199–221 | pmid = 15974499 | doi=10.1007/s10597-005-2656-7| s2cid = 17728425 }}</ref> it may also serve to obfuscate the true cause of underlying issues.

=== Cross-cultural adoption policies ===
George Shanti, Nico Van Oudenhoven, and Ekha Wazir, co-authors of ''Foster Care Beyond the Crossroads: Lessons from an International Comparative Analysis'', say that there are four types of Government foster care systems. The first one is that of developing countries. These countries do not have policies implemented to take care of the basic needs of these children and these children mostly receive assistance from relatives. The second system is that of former socialist governments. The historical context of these states has not allowed for the evolution of their foster care system. NGO's have urged them to evolve; however the traditional system of institutionalizing these children is still in place. Thirdly, liberal democracies do not have the support from its political system in order to take care of these children, even though they have the resources. Finally, social democracies are the most advanced governments in regards to their foster care system. These governments have a massive infrastructure, funding, and support system in order to help foster care children.<ref>George, S, N van Oudenhoven, and R Wazir.

In a study conducted by Gypen et al. (2017),<ref name=":1" /> involving a cross-database analysis of research articles relevant to the outcomes of former foster youth, they found that the educational, mental health, employment, income, stable housing, criminal involvement and substance abuse issues outcomes for youth who have aged out of the foster care system are substantially poorer than their peers. For example, Gypen et al. (2017),<ref name=":1" /> indicated that only 45% of former foster youth received a high school diploma, which is 23% lower than the general population. There are also significantly poorer outcomes for children who were formerly in foster care than children from low-income households.<ref name=":1" /> Children who are eventually adopted by their placement family show greater outcomes, in terms of finding stable housing, employment, finances and education opportunities, than those who aged out of the foster care system without a permanent placement.<ref name=":1" />
