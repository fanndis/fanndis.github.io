==History==

The nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership grew out of the U.S. government's Vital Voices Democracy Initiative. The Vital Voices Democracy Initiative was established in 1997 by [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] and [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]], following the [[United Nations]] [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]] to promote the advancement of women as a [[U.S. foreign policy]] goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vitalvoices.org/about-us/our-history |title=History of Vital Voices |publisher=Vital Voices |accessdate=2010-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124120629/http://vitalvoices.org/about-us/our-history |archivedate=January 24, 2010 }}</ref> The first Vital Voices Democracy Initiative conference was held in 1997 in Vienna, and hosted by U.S. Ambassador to Austria [[Swanee Hunt]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-02/16/028r-021600-idx.html | title=First Lady Listens to Vital Voices | work=Washington Post | accessdate=2013-01-15 | date=2000-02-16}}</ref>
