'''Mira Nair''' (born 15 October 1957) is an [[Indian Americans|Indian-American]] filmmaker based in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Spelling|first=Ian|title=Director likes to do her own thing|newspaper=Waterloo Region Record|date=1 September 2004|pages=C4}}</ref> Her production company, [[Mirabai Films]], specializes in films for international audiences on Indian society, whether in the economic, social or cultural spheres. Among her best known films are ''[[Mississippi Masala]]'', ''[[Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love]]'', ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]'', the [[Golden Lion]] winning ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'', and ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'', which received nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]].

==Early life and education==
Mira Nair was born on 15 October 1957 in [[Rourkela]], [[Odisha|Orissa]], and grew up with her two older brothers and parents in [[Bhubaneswar]].<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books">{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=Mercy In Her Eyes: The Films of Mira Nair|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Applause Theater & Cinema Books|isbn=1557836493}}</ref> Her father, Amrit Lal Nair, was an officer of the [[Indian Administrative Service]] and her mother, Parveen Nayyar, is a social worker who often focused on children.<ref name="Mira Nair">{{cite web|title=Mira Nair|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Li-Pr/Nair-Mira.html|website=Encyclopedia of World Biography|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> At age 11, Mira Nair moved with her family to [[Delhi]] as her father transferred posts. 

By age 13, she had left home to attend [[Loreto Convent, Tara Hall, Shimla]],<ref>{{cite news |title=I'd eat onions before kissing Shashi Tharoor: Mira Nair - Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Id-eat-onions-before-kissing-Shashi-Tharoor-Mira-Nair/articleshow/16235108.cms |work=The Times of India |language=en}}</ref> an Irish-Catholic missionary school, where she developed an infatuation with English literature. Following Tara Hall, Nair went on to study at [[Miranda House]] at [[Delhi University]], where she majored in [[sociology]]. In order to gain the best education available, Nair applied for transfer to Western schools and, at 19, she was offered a full scholarship to [[Cambridge University]], but ultimately turned it down and instead accepted a full scholarship to [[Harvard University]].<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu">{{cite web|last1=Blenski|first1=Simon|last2=Debreyne|first2=Adrien Maurice|last3=Hegewisch|first3=Martha Eugina|last4=Trivedi|first4=Avani Anant|title=Mira Nair|url=http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/nairMira.php|website=University of Minnesota|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=30 April 2015}}{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Before she became a filmmaker, Nair was originally interested in acting, and at one point she performed plays written by [[Badal Sarkar]], a [[Bengali theatre|Bengali performer]]. While she studied at Harvard University, Nair became involved in the theater program and won a Boylston Prize for her performance of [[Jocasta]]’s speech from [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s ''[[Oedipus (Seneca)|Oedipus]]''.<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books"/>

Nair commented on film-making in a 2004 interview with FF2 Media's Jan Huttner:<blockquote>It’s all in how I do it. Keeping the buns on the seats is very important to me. It requires that ineffable thing called rhythm and balance in movie-making. Foils have to be created, counter-weights. From the intimacy, let’s say, of a love scene to the visceral, jugular quality of war. That shift is something in the editing, how one cuts from the intimate to the epic that keeps you there waiting. The energy propels you.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jan Chats with Internationally-Acclaimed Director Mira Nair About Her New Film 'Vanity Fair'|url=http://www.films42.com/chats/mira_nair.asp|last=Huttner|first=Jan|date=August 15, 2004|website=FF2 Media|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 18, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>Nair said to ''Image Journal'' in 2017 that she chose directing over any other art form because it was collaborative. "That’s why I am neither a photographer nor writer," she said. "I like to work with people, and my strength, if any, is that. Working with life."<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Conversation with Mira Nair|url=https://imagejournal.org/article/conversation-mira-nair/|website=Image Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

===Documentaries===

At the start of her film-making career, Nair primarily made documentaries in which she explored Indian cultural tradition. For her film thesis at Harvard between 1978 and 1979, Nair produced a black-and-white film titled ''Jama Masjid Street Journal''. In the eighteen-minute film, Nair explored the streets of [[Old Delhi]] and had casual conversations with Indian locals.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/>

In 1982, she made her second documentary titled ''So Far from India'', which is a fifty-two-minute film that followed an Indian newspaper dealer living in the subways of New York, while his pregnant wife waited for him to return home.<ref name="Mira Nair"/> This film was recognized as a Best Documentary winner at the [[American Film Festival]] and New York's Global Village Film Festival.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/>

Her third documentary, ''India Cabaret'', released in 1984, revealed the exploitation of female strippers in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], and followed a customer who regularly visited a local strip club while his wife stayed at home.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/> Nair raised roughly $130,000 for the project. The 59-minute film was shot over a span of two months. It was criticized by Nair's family.<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books"/><ref name="Mira Nair"/> Her fourth and last documentary, made for [[Canadian television]], explored how [[amniocentesis]] was being used to determine the sex of fetuses. Released in 1987, ''Children of a Desired Sex'' exposed the aborting of female fetuses due to society's favoring male offspring.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 2001, with The Laughing Club of India, she explored [[Laughter yoga|laughter based on yoga]]. Founder Dr. Madan Kararia spoke of the club's history and the growth of laughing clubs across the country, and subsequently the world. The documentary included testimonials from members of the laughter clubs who described how the practice had improved or changed their lives. Its featured segments included a group of workers in an electrical products factory in Bombay who took time off to laugh during their coffee break.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HEte5ilhCTcC&q=mira+nair+++documentary&pg=PR9|title=Mercy in Her Eyes: The Films of Mira Nair|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|date=2006|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781557836496|location=|pages=156–158|language=en}}</ref>

===Feature films===
In 1983 with her friend, [[Sooni Taraporevala]], Nair co-wrote ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]''. Using her documentary film-making and acting experience, Nair sought out for real "street children" to more authentically portray the lives of children who survived in the streets and were deprived of a real childhood.<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books"/> Though the film did not do well at the box office, it won 23 international awards, including the Camera D’or and Prix du Public at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1988. ''Salaam Bombay!'' was nominated at the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crossette |first=Barabara |date=23 December 1990 |title=Homeless and Hungry Youths of India |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DA1531F930A15751C1A966958260 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=13 October 2008 }}</ref>

Nair and Taraporevala continued to challenge audiences with the 1991 film ''[[Mississippi Masala]],'' which told the story of Ugandan-born Indians displaced in [[Mississippi]].<ref name="Mira Nair"/> The film, featuring [[Denzel Washington]], [[Roshan Seth]], and [[Sarita Choudhury]], centers on a carpet-cleaner business owner (Washington) who falls in love with the daughter (Choudhury) of one of his Indian clients. The film revealed the evident prejudice in African-American and Indian communities. Like ''Salaam Bombay!'', the film was well received by critics, earned a standing ovation at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1992, and won three awards at the [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/>

Nair went on to direct four more films before she produced one of her most notable films, ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]''. Released in 2001, the film told the story of a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] Indian wedding, written by [[Sabrina Dhawan]]. Employing  a small crew and casting some of Nair's acquaintances and relatives, the film grossed over $30 million worldwide. The film was awarded the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]], making Nair the first female recipient of the award.<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitney |first=Anna |date=10 September 2001 |title=Indian director is first woman to win Golden Lion |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/indian-director-is-first-woman-to-win-golden-lion-9225222.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref>

Nair then directed the Golden Globe winning ''Hysterical Blindness'' (2002), followed by making [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]’s epic ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' (2004).{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 2007, Nair was asked to direct ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', but turned it down to work on ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]''.<ref name="Mira Nair"/> Based on the book by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winner [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], Sooni Taraporevala’s screenplay follows the son of Indian immigrants who wants to fit in with [[New York City|New York]] society, but struggles to get away from his family’s traditional ways. The film was presented with the Dartmouth Film Award and was also honored with the Pride of India award at the [[Bollywood Movie Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |date=23 April 2007 |title=Bollywood to honour Mira Nair with 'Pride of India' award |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=a8b47023-270e-47f0-a6c2-399a750ab572& |newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] |agency=Press Trust of India (PTI) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930055840/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=a8b47023-270e-47f0-a6c2-399a750ab572& |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=28 May 2007 |title=Mira Nair, Asha Parekh honoured at Bollywood awards in New York |url=http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/f825b92e19df636a/id/252152/cs/1/ |newspaper=Malaysia Sun |agency=Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207004720/http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/f825b92e19df636a/id/252152/cs/1/ |archivedate=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> This was followed by the [[Amelia Earhart]] biopic ''[[Amelia (2009 film)|Amelia]]'' (2009), starring [[Hilary Swank]] and [[Richard Gere]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In 2012, Nair directed ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist (film)|The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]'', a thriller based on the best-selling novel by Mohsin Hamid. It opened the 2012 Venice Film Festival to critical acclaim and was released worldwide in early 2013. For the academic reception of Nair's adaptation of ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]'', ''The Journal of Commonwealth Literature'' questions "how the ambivalence and provocativeness of the 'source' text translates into the film adaptation, and the extent to which the film format makes the narrative more palatable and appealing to wider audiences as compared to the novel’s target readership."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Lisa|last2=Mendes|first2=Ana Cristina|date=2018|title=Post-9/11 re-orientalism: Confrontation and conciliation in Mohsin Hamid's and Mira Nair's The Reluctant Fundamentalist|journal=The Journal of Commonwealth Literature|language=en|volume=53|issue=1|pages=80|doi=10.1177/0021989416631791|s2cid=148197670|issn=0021-9894|url=http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/1559/8/lau_jcl_2016.pdf}}</ref>

Nair's 2016 film ''[[Queen of Katwe]]'', a [[Walt Disney Pictures]] production, starred [[Lupita Nyong'o]] and [[David Oyelowo]] and was based on the story of Ugandan chess prodigy [[Phiona Mutesi]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Nair's short films include ''A Fork, a Spoon and a Knight,'' inspired by the [[Nelson Mandela]] quote, ″Difficulties break some men but make others.″ She contributed to ''[[11'09"01 September 11]]'' (2002) in which 11  filmmakers reacted to the events of 11 September 2001. Other titles include ''How Can It Be?'' (2008), ''Migration'' (2008), ''New York, I Love You'' (2009) and her collaboration with, among others, [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Guillermo Arriaga]] on the compilation feature ''[[Words with Gods]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

==Political views==
In July 2013, Nair declined an invitation to the [[Haifa International Film Festival]] as a "guest of honor" to protest [[Israel]]'s policies toward [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. In postings on her Twitter account, Nair stated "I will go to Israel when the walls come down. I will go to Israel when occupation is gone...I will go to Israel when the state does not privilege one religion over another. I will go to Israel when Apartheid is over. I will go to Israel, soon. I stand w/ [[Academic boycotts of Israel#The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel|Palestine for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel]] (PACBI) & the larger [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions]] (BDS) Mov’t."
