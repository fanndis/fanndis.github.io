'''Gale''' is an educational [[Publishing#Types of publishers|publishing]] company based in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]],<ref>"[http://www.gale.cengage.com/policy.htm#terms Privacy Statement and Terms of Use]." Gale. Retrieved on July 8, 2010.</ref> west of [[Detroit]]. It has been a division of [[Cengage]] since 2007.

The company, formerly known as '''Gale Research''' and the '''Gale Group''', is active in research and educational publishing for [[Public libraries|public]], [[Academic libraries|academic]], and [[school libraries]], and businesses. The company is known for its full-text magazine and newspaper databases, Gale OneFile (formerly known as Infotrac), and other online databases subscribed by libraries, as well as multi-volume reference works, especially in the areas of [[religion]], [[history]], and [[social science]].

Founded in [[Detroit, Michigan]] in 1954 by [[Frederick Gale Ruffner Jr.]], the company was acquired by the [[International Thomson Organization]] (later the [[Thomson Corporation]]) in 1985 before its 2007 sale to Cengage.

==History==

In 1999, Thomson Gale acquired Macmillan Library Reference (including [[Scribner's]] Reference, Thorndike Press, Schirmer, Twayne Publishers, and [[G. K. Hall]]) from Pearson (which had acquired it from [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1998; [[Macmillan USA]] was purchased by Simon & Schuster in 1994).<ref>{{Cite web| last = Hane| first = Paula J.| title = Thomson’s Gale Group Acquires MacMillan Library Reference USA| accessdate = 2018-05-13| date = 1999-06-21| url = http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/Thomsons-Gale-Group-Acquires-MacMillan-Library-Reference-USA-17944.asp}}</ref> In 2000 it acquired the [[Munich]]-based [[K. G. Saur Verlag]], but then sold it to [[Walter de Gruyter]] in 2006.

On October 25, 2006 Thomson Corporation announced that it intended to wholly [[Divestment|divest]] the Thomson Learning division, because, in the words of Thomson CEO Richard Harrington, "it does not fit with our long-term strategic vision".  Thomson has said that it expected this sale to generate approximately $5 billion. Thomson Learning was bought by a private equity consortium consisting of [[Apax Partners]] and [[OMERS Capital Partners]] for $7.75 billion and the name was changed from Thomson Learning to Cengage Learning on July 24, 2007.<ref>[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6446345.html "Thomson Gale Part of Larger Sale"] by Norman Oder, ''[[Library Journal]]'', June 1, 2007</ref>
