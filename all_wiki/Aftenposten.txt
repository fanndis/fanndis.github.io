==History and profile==
''Aftenposten'' was founded by Christian Schibsted on 14 May 1860<ref name="Cook2001">{{cite book|author=Bernard A. Cook|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hafLHZgZtt4C&pg=PA935|accessdate=25 November 2014|year=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-4058-4|page=935}}</ref> under the name ''Christiania Adresseblad''. The following year, it was renamed ''Aftenposten''. Since 1885, the paper has printed two daily editions. A Sunday edition was published until 1919, and was reintroduced in 1990. The Friday-morning edition carries the ''A-magasinet'' supplement, featuring articles on science, politics, and the arts. In 1886, ''Aftenposten'' bought a [[rotary press]], being the first Norwegian newspaper in this regard.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Svennik Hoyer |authorlink = Svennik Høyer|title = The Political Economy of the Norwegian Press |journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] |publisher=[[Danish Royal Library]]|url = http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/spso/spso_0003-PDF/spso_0003_95928.pdf |accessdate = 30 December 2014 |pages=85–141}}</ref>

Historically, ''Aftenposten'' labelled itself as "independent, [[Conservatism|conservative]]",<ref name=Cook2001/> most closely aligning their editorial platform with the Norwegian [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]. This manifested itself in blunt anticommunism during the interwar era. During World War II, ''Aftenposten'', due to its large circulation, was put under the directives of the German occupational authorities, and a Nazi editorial management was imposed.

''Aftenposten'' is based in Oslo.<ref name=Cook2001/><ref>{{cite web|title=Annual report 2012|url=http://www.schibsted.com/global/annualreport/annual_report_2012_low%20ok.pdf|work=Schibsted Media Group|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095114/http://www.schibsted.com/global/annualreport/annual_report_2012_low%20ok.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> In the late 1980s, Egil Sundar served as the editor-in-chief and attempted to transform the paper into a nationally distributed newspaper.<ref name=sigurda>{{cite journal|author=Sigurd Allern|title=Journalistic and Commercial News Values.

==Editions==
In addition to the morning edition, ''Aftenposten'' published a separate evening edition called ''Aften'' (previously ''Aftenposten Aften''). This edition was published on weekdays and Saturdays until the Sunday morning edition was reintroduced in 1990. The evening edition was only circulated in the central eastern part of Norway, i.e. Oslo and [[Akershus]] counties. Thus, it focused on news related to this area, in contrast with the morning edition, which focuses on national and international news. The evening edition was converted to tabloid format in 1997. From April 2006, the Thursday edition of ''Aften'' also included a special edition with news specific to a part of Oslo or Akershus, called ''Lokal Aften'' ("Local Evening"). This edition had eight versions, with each subscriber receiving the version which is most relevant to the area in which he or she lives. In areas not covered by any of the eight versions (for example [[Romerike]] and [[Follo]]), the version for central Oslo was distributed. From May 2009, ''Aften'' was only printed and distributed Tuesday through Thursday. The publication of ''Aften'' ended on 20 December 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Historien sett gjennom Aften-øyne|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/osloby/i/Opjx1/historien-sett-gjennom-aften-oeyne|accessdate=14 October 2019|work=Aftenposten|date=20 December 2012}}</ref>

''Aftenposten'' started its [[Online journalism|online edition]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Online Journalism Atlas: Norway|url=http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/01/25/online-journalism-atlas-norway/|accessdate=13 January 2015|work=Online Journalism|date=25 January 2008}}</ref>

==Controversies==
''Aftenposten'' opposed the award of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]] in 1935.

In 1945, ''Aftenposten'' published an [[Knut Hamsun's obituary of Adolf Hitler|obituary of Adolf Hitler]] in which the 86-year-old Nobel-laureate novelist [[Knut Hamsun]] referred to Hitler as “a warrior for humankind and a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations”.<ref name="Gibbs2009">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/books/28hams.html|title=Norwegian Nobel Laureate, Once Shunned, Is Now Celebrated|work=The New York Times|date=27 February 2009|page=C1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208004621/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/books/28hams.html|archive-date=8 December 2014|url-status=live|first=Walter|last=Gibbs|issn=0362-4331|quote={{bracket|I}}n Oslo last week .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at the National Library was the 7 May 1945, edition of a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. newspaper whose lead article on Hitler’s death was by Knut&nbsp;Hamsun. As most collaborators lay low, preparing alibis, Hamsun wrote, ‘He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations’.}}</ref> However, ''Aftenposten'' was at the time under the censorship of the German occupying forces.

Historically, ''Aftenposten'' has not received the same number of lawsuits or as much attention from the [[Norwegian Press Complaints Commission]] as some of the larger tabloids.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, there are exceptions. In 2007, ''Aftenposten'' alleged that [[Julia Svetlichnaya]], the last person to interview the murdered Russian national [[Alexander Litvinenko]], was a Kremlin agent. London correspondent [[Hilde Harbo]] admitted having allowed herself to be fed disinformation emanating from the Russian emigrant community without investigating the matter properly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1972241.ece |title=Svetlichnaja and Litvinenko: Clarifications |work=Aftenposten |date=9 December 2006 |accessdate=1 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214203801/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1972241.ece |archivedate=14 February 2008 }}</ref> ''Aftenposten'' eventually had to apologize and pay Svetlichnaya's legal costs.

==Editorial line==
''Aftenposten'' had a conservative stance and supported the political party [[Høyre]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rolf Werenskjold|title=The Dailies in Revolt|journal=Scandinavian Journal of History|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=417–440|doi=10.1080/03468750802423094}}</ref> until the breakdown of party press system in the country.<ref name=stiga/> Following this, the paper positioned itself as an independent [[centre-right]] newspaper.<ref name=stiga/>

==Language==
From its establishment in 1860 until 1923, ''Aftenposten'' was published in the common Dano-Norwegian written language used in both Norway and Denmark, which was generally known as Danish in Denmark and as Norwegian in Norway, and which only occasionally included minor differences from each other in vocabulary or idiom. In 1923 ''Aftenposten'' adopted the Norwegian spelling standard of 1907, which mainly replaced the "soft" consonants (e.g. d, b) characteristic of Danish pronunciation (but also used in some Norwegian dialects) with "hard" consonants (e.g. t, p) characteristic of Eastern Central Norwegian pronunciation, but which was otherwise mostly identical with Danish.  In 1928 ''Aftenposten'' adopted the most conservative variant of the spelling standard of 1917, which is largely similar to the "moderate Bokmål" or "Riksmål" standard used today.

During the [[Norwegian language struggle]] from the early 1950s, ''Aftenposten'' was the main newspaper of the [[Riksmål]] variety of Norwegian, and maintained close ties to the Riksmål movement's institutions, recognising the [[Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature]] as the sole authoritative body for regulating the Norwegian language as used by the newspaper. Due to its status as the country's largest and most influential newspaper, ''Aftenposten'' therefore had a significant influence on the developments that took place during the Norwegian language struggle. The "moderate" or "conservative" Riksmål language used by ''Aftenposten'' was mainly associated with a conservative stance in Norwegian politics, and was contrasted with the "radical" [[Samnorsk]] language, an attempt to merge [[Bokmål]] with [[Nynorsk]] which was promoted by socialist governments in the 1950s. By 1960 it had become apparent that the Samnorsk attempt had failed, and as a result, Aftenposten's Riksmål standard and the government-promoted Bokmål standard have in the following decades become almost identical as the Bokmål standard has incorporated nearly all of Riksmål. As a consequence, ''Aftenposten'' decided to describe its language as "Moderate Bokmål" from 2006, and published its own dictionary, based on Riksmål and Moderate Bokmål, but excluding "radical" (i.e. similar to Nynorsk) variants of Bokmål.

The online version of the paper for some years during the early 2000s had an [[English language|English]] section. To cut costs, ''Aftenposten'' stopped publishing English-language articles in early November 2008. Archives of past material are still available online.<ref>{{cite news|title=So long, farewell ... |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2741143.ece |work=Aftenposten |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208103416/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2741143.ece |archivedate=8 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
