Ukraine relies to a large extent on nuclear power. 
The largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the [[Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant]], is located in Ukraine. 
In 2006, the government planned to build 11 new [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] by the year 2030, which would almost double the current amount of nuclear power capacity.<ref name="Nuclear UA">{{cite web|url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf46.html|title=Nuclear Power in Ukraine|accessdate=2007-12-22|publisher=World Nuclear Association}}</ref> 
Ukraine's power sector is the twelfth-largest in the world in terms of installed capacity, with 54&nbsp;gigawatts (GW).<ref name=eia>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|title=Ukraine|accessdate=2007-12-22|work=[[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA)|publisher=US government|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015222346/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|archivedate=2009-10-15}}</ref> 
[[Renewable energy]] still plays a very modest role in electrical output; in 2005 energy production was met by the following sources: nuclear (47&nbsp;percent), thermal (45&nbsp;percent), [[hydroelectric]] and other (8&nbsp;percent).<ref name="Nuclear UA"/>

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] was a [[nuclear accident]] that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in Ukraine. 
An explosion and fire released large quantities of [[radioactive contamination]] into the atmosphere, which spread over much of Western USSR and Europe. 
It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (the other being the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]).<ref name="BBCWorse">{{cite web|last=Black |first=Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13048916 |title='&#39;Fukushima: As Bad as Chernobyl?'&#39; |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-04-12 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18&nbsp;billion [[ruble]]s, crippling the Soviet economy.<ref>From interviews with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Hans Blix]] and [[Vassili Nesterenko]]. {{cite video |title=The Battle of Chernobyl |publisher=Discovery Channel}} Relevant video locations: 31:00, 1:10:00.</ref>

Ukraine used to receive its [[nuclear fuel]] exclusively from [[Russia]] by the Russian company [[TVEL]].

In 2011 [[Energoatom]] began a project to bring safety into line with international standards at an estimated cost of $1.8 billion, with a target completion date of 2017. In 2015 the completion date was put back to 2020, due to financing delays.<ref name=wnn-20150807>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Ukraine-aims-to-complete-safety-upgrade-program-in-2020-07081501.html |title=Ukraine aims to complete safety upgrade program in 2020 |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=7 August 2015 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> In 2015 some government agencies made [[Corruption in Ukraine|corruption]] allegations against Energoatom, with concerns raised by Prime Minister [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]].<ref name=wnn-20150812>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Energoatom-chief-recalls-highs-and-lows-of-first-half-year-12081501.html |title=Energoatom chief recalls highs and lows of first half-year |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=12 August 2015 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}</ref> In March 2016, Energoatom's assets and bank accounts were frozen by Ukrainian courts over allegedly unpaid debts; Energoatom appealed the decision, but the frozen finances led to contractual breaches.<ref name=nei-20160607>{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newscontinued-ukraine-russia-tensions-over-fuel-4915829 |title=Continued Ukraine-Russia tensions over fuel |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=7 June 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}</ref> In June 2016 its bank accounts were unfrozen.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/353272.html |title=Energoatom's accounts unblocked |newspaper=Interfax-Ukraine |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref>

{{main|List of nuclear reactors#Ukraine}}
{{see also|List of power stations in Ukraine}}
All of Ukraine's RBMK reactors (the type involved in the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]) were located at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. All of the reactors there have been shut down, leaving only the much safer VVER reactors operating in the country.<ref name="UuneU22816">[http://www.unian.info/economics/1481749-nuclear-fuel-imports-from-sweden-account-for-416-in-h1-balance-from-russia.html Nuclear fuel imports from Sweden account for 41.6% in H1, balance from Russia], [[UNIAN]] (22 August 2016)</ref> Three of the reactors listed were built in post-independence Ukraine, with the first one of these being constructed in 1995; the other sixteen reactors the country inherited from the Soviet Union.
