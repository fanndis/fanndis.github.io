'''''Views''''' is the fourth studio album by Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]. It was released on April 29, 2016, by [[Cash Money Records]], [[Republic Records]], and [[Young Money Entertainment]]. Recording sessions took place from 2015 to 2016, with both Drake and his longtime collaborator and record producer [[40 (record producer)|40]] serving as the record's executive producers. 40 also primarily handled the production on the album alongside other record producers such as [[Nineteen85]], Maneesh Bidaye, [[Kanye West]], and [[Majid Jordan|Jordan Ullman]], among others. Featured guest appearances include [[PartyNextDoor]], [[Pimp C]], [[Dvsn]], [[Wizkid]], [[Kyla (British singer)|Kyla]], and [[Rihanna]]. 

''Views'' takes influence from West Indian and [[Music of West Africa|West African]] music. The album marks Drake's first full foray into Jamaican [[dancehall]] music, while also featuring other genres such as [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Trap music|trap]], [[Afrobeat]], [[UK funky]], and [[Pop music|pop]]. Similar to his previous records, the album sees Drake discussing his relationship woes, experiences with betrayal, and celebrations of loyalty and friendship. The album was supported by five singles: "[[Hotline Bling]]", "[[One Dance]]", "[[Pop Style]]", "[[Controlla]]", and "[[Too Good]]".

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with over one million [[album-equivalent unit]]s earned in its first week of release, including 852,000 copies, and achieving a then record over 245 million streams. It spent a total 13 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, and also became Drake's first number-one album on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. All 20 songs from the album charted on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

The album received lukewarm reviews from critics, many of whom found it to be an overlong retread of Drake's previous work. Despite this, it became Drake's most commercially successful album having sold over seven million certified units worldwide. The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|six times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|2017 Grammy Awards]]. The album also won [[Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album|Top ''Billboard'' 200 Album]] at the [[2017 Billboard Music Awards|2017 ''Billboard'' Music Awards]], among other awards.
