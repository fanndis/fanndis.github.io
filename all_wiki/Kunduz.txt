'''Kunduz''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ʊ|n|d|uː|z}}; {{lang-ps|کندز}}; {{lang-prs|قندوز}} original name: {{lang|fa|کُهَندِژ}}) is a city in northern [[Afghanistan]], which serves as the capital of [[Kunduz Province]]. The city has a population of about 268,893,<ref name=UN-Habitat>{{cite web |url=http://www.unhabitat.org/books/soac2015 |title=The State of Afghan Cities 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-11}}</ref> making it about the [[List of cities in Afghanistan|6th-largest city]] of Afghanistan, and the largest city in the northeastern section of the country. Kunduz is located in the historical [[Tokharistan]] region of [[Bactria]], near the confluence of the [[Kunduz River]] with the [[Khanabad River]]. Kunduz is linked by highways with [[Kabul]] to the south, [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] to the west, and [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]] to the east. Kunduz is also linked with [[Dushanbe]] in [[Tajikistan]] to the north, via the Afghan dry port of [[Sherkhan Bandar]].

The land use of the city (within the municipal boundary) is largely agricultural (65.8% of total area). Residential land comprises nearly half of the 'built-up' land area (48.3%) with 29,877 dwellings.<ref name=UN-Habitat/> Institutional land comprises 17.9% of built-up land use, given that the airport is located within the municipal boundary.<ref name=UN-Habitat/>

== Etymology ==
Kunduz is also sometimes spelled ([[romanized]]) as '''Kundûz''', '''Qonduz''', '''Qondûz''', '''Konduz''', '''Kondûz''', '''Kondoz''', or '''Qhunduz'''. The name of the city is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] compound, ''kuhan diz'', "old/ancient fort".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Branch|first=India Army General Staff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPVtAAAAMAAJ|title=Historical and Political Gazetteer of Afghanistan|date=1972|publisher=Akadem.

== History ==
{{History of Afghanistan}}
{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}
Kunduz is the site of the ancient city of '''Drapsaka'''. It was a great centre of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] learning and very prosperous during the 3rd century AD.

The city used to be called '''Walwalij'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/voror/Personal/Islamic_Numismatics.html|title=Asien-Afrika-Institut|work=uni-hamburg.de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204821/http://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/voror/Personal/Islamic_Numismatics.html|archive-date=2012-05-09}}</ref> (or ''Varvarliz'') and the name ''Kuhandiz'' began to be used from the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] time.

In the 18th and 19th centuries it was the capital of a rather large eponymous, sometimes independent, sometimes autonomous [[Uzbeg Khan|Uzbek]]-[[Tajik people|Tajik]] [[khanate]] that in the 1820s encompassed land from [[Balkh]] to the [[Pamir Mountains]]. It was part of [[The Great Game]] between the British and Russians. This khanate was finally destroyed by Afghanistan in 1859. Between one-hundred and two-hundred thousand Tajiks and Uzbeks fled the conquest of their homeland by Russian Red Army and settled in northern Afghanistan.<ref name="Afghanistan Analysts Network">{{cite web |url=http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/fachpublikationen/wrm_2012_the_networks_of_Kunduz.pdf |title=The Networks of Kunduz: A History of Conflict and Their Actors, from 1992 to 2001 |last1=Wörmer |first1=Nils |date=2012 |website=Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik |publisher=[[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] |page=8 |accessdate=2014-01-12 }}</ref>

In the early 20th century, under the governance of [[Sher Khan Nasher]], Kunduz became one of the wealthiest Afghan provinces. This was mainly due to Nasher's founding of the [[Spinzar Cotton Company]], which continues to exist in post-war Afghanistan.

Kunduz is the most important agricultural province which produces [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[millet]], and other products and obtained the nickname of "the hive of the country."

Kunduz is the centre for the northeast provinces and was captured by the [[Taliban]] in 1997. It was the last major city held by the Taliban before its fall to US-backed [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] forces on 26 November 2001.

During the summer of 2015, the Taliban advanced and attacked the city, which resulted in a [[Battle of Kunduz (2015)|battle for control of the city]] against Afghan forces. Tens of thousands of inhabitants were displaced internally by the fighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33215948|title=Afghans counter Taliban offensive in northern Kunduz province|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/world/asia/taliban-and-afghan-government-dispute-status-of-kunduz.html?_r=0|title=Taliban and Afghan Government Dispute Status of Kunduz|work=New York Times|date=21 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/afghanistan-taliban-advance-on-key-northern-city-20150621-ghtu5f.html|title=Afghanistan: Taliban advance on key northern city|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> On 28 September 2015 the Taliban flag was again raised in the city center and the Taliban managed to capture the city prison and free many prisoners.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34377565 |title=Taliban 'seize half' of Afghanistan's Kunduz city |date=28 September 2015 |website=www.bbc.com |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Afghan Taliban seize northern city center in major attack|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/28/us-afghanistan-attack-idUSKCN0RS0A820150928|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-09-28|access-date = 2015-09-28}}</ref> The [[Afghan Armed Forces]] counter-attacked and managed to re-capture the city in 15 days. The Taliban announced that, after achieving their objectives, they have withdrawn from the city's center. [[Zabiullah Mujahid]], a Taliban spokesperson, said that their main object in leaving the city is to avoid civilian casualties from air raids.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34520318|title=Taliban admit Kunduz withdrawal|date=13 October 2015|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In April 2018 the Afghan Air Force conducted an [[Kunduz Madrassah Attack|airstrike]] that killed and injured dozens of civilians at a [[madrasa|religious school]] in Kunduz.<ref>{{Cite web| date=3 April 2018 | author = cbs/AFP | title = Carnage as airstrike hits boy's school in Taliban territory| accessdate = 2018-04-13| url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-airstrike-kunduz-dashte-archi-district-kabul-says-taliban-hit/}}</ref> On 31 August 2019, the Taliban forces launched another attack on the city, setting off a major battle with local security forces.

On [[May 2020 Afghanistan attacks|19 May 2020]], the Taliban killed one policeman and one civilian and injured 18 others in a motorbike bomb blast in Kunduz. On the same day, the Taliban attempted again to capture Kunduz, attacking several government posts but were repelled by the Afghan security forces. The Taliban were forced to flee the city, leaving ten dead bodies behind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/19/c_139070122.htm|title=Motorbike bomb, fighting claim 12 lives in Afghanistan's Kunduz province|date=May 19, 2020|via=http://www.xinhuanet.com/}}</ref> Eight Afghan soldiers and three civilians were killed and 55 others were wounded during the Taliban attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/afghan-forces-repel-taliban-attack-key-city-113732943--spt.html|title=Eight Afghan soldiers die fighting off Taliban attack on key city|date=May 19, 2020|via=au.news.yahoo.com/}}</ref>

[[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Kunduz Arabs]] speak Persian and Pashto, Afghanistan's two official languages, rather than [[Arabic]]. However, they claim a strong Arab identity, based on their tribal origins in [[Arabia]].
