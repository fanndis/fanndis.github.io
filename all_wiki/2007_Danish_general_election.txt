===Coalitions===
According to the [[Constitution of Denmark]], Denmark is governed according to the principle of negative [[parliamentarism]], meaning that while a government doesn't need the majority of seats in parliament, it must never have a majority of seats against it in a [[vote of no confidence]]. Before the ongoing elections, this was relevant since the government, consisting of the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] and the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] did not have a majority of seats, but depended on the support of the [[Danish People's Party]]. Early opinion polls showed that neither a right-wing or a left-wing government could gather enough seats to be in government without the support of the newly established [[New Alliance (Denmark)|New Alliance]].<ref name="tv2oct25">{{cite web

===Early election===
Danish [[Prime minister of Denmark|prime minister]] [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] announced this election date on 24 October 2007. The election was held ahead of time in the sense that by law, the election needed to be held before 8 February 2009, four years after the previous election.

Anders Fogh Rasmussen explained that the elections were called early in order to allow the parliament to work on important upcoming topics without being distracted by a future election. Referring specifically to welfare reform, he said rival parties would then try to outdo each other with expensive reforms which would damage the Danish economy.<ref name=election/>

===Parties that had previously declared their intention to run===
The [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]] lacked about 2,000 - 3,000 of the required 20,000 signatures in order to run in the 2007 election when Anders Fogh Rasmussen called it on 24 October, meaning that they won't be able to run.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article403507.ece|title=CD ude af valgkampen på forhånd|publisher=[[Politiken]]|language=Danish|date=2007-10-24|accessdate=2007-10-24}}</ref> The [[Liberalisterne|Liberalists]] had reached 5,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/politik/article.php/id-9092840.html |title=Liberalister når ikke at opstille |publisher=[[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] |language=Danish |date=2007-10-24 |accessdate=2007-10-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025061003/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/politik/article.php/id-9092840.html |archivedate=2007-10-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Danish [[Ministry of Welfare (Denmark)|Ministry of Welfare]] has registered more than 70 parties that had not handed in the required number of signatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.im.dk/im/site.aspx?p=262&t=visartikel&Articleid=4012|title=Lists of other registered parties|publisher=[[Ministry of the Interior and Health (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health]]|language=Danish|date=2007-10-04|accessdate=2007-10-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012181951/http://www.im.dk/im/site.aspx?p=262&t=visartikel&Articleid=4012|archivedate=2007-10-12}}</ref><!--page links to two versions of the same list, one sorted alphabetically, the other chronologically.-->

==Results==
{{For|full results by constituency|Results of the 2007 Danish general election}}
The [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] had the election's largest gain, securing 23 seats in the new parliament compared to 11 in the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|2005 elections]]. The [[Danish People's Party]] gained one additional seat, leaving it at 25. The [[New Alliance (Denmark)|New Alliance]] secured five seats in its first election, a result lower than projected in earlier opinion polls.

The biggest setback was suffered by the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] which was reduced from 17 seats to 9. The [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] lost six seats leaving it at 46, and the party remains the biggest party for the third consecutive election. The Social Democrats lost two seats, leaving it at 45. The Red-Green Alliance lost two seats leaving it at four seats, just above the 2% [[election threshold|threshold]].

The [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] ensured marginal gains, but no additional seats, leaving it at 18 seats. The Christian Democrats did not ensure representation.

Greenland's vote resulted in one seat for [[Siumut]] and one for [[Inuit Ataqatigiit]]. The Faroe Islands returned [[Høgni Hoydal]] representing the [[Republic (Faroe Islands)|Republican Party]], its second seat went to the [[Union Party (Faroe Islands)|Union Party]], a seat gained from the [[People's Party (Faroe Islands)|People's Party]] which did not achieve representation.

==Aftermath==
The ruling [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal]]-[[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative]] coalition secured 64 seats. The support of the [[Danish People's Party]] (DPP), with 25 seats, left the coalition needing one more seat. Finally, the coalition-friendly [[Union Party (Faroe Islands)|Union Party]] of former Faroese prime minister [[Edmund Joensen]] won the needed seat in the Faroese elections.

Parties backing [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], in opposition, won 84 seats. (This includes remaining three seats of the overseas territories.)

The [[New Alliance (Denmark)|New Alliance]] won the remaining five (5) seats.

Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] announced that the party composition of cabinet would remain as before, but that parties not in cabinet that support his premiership will have influence over policy. This statement apparently was aimed at the New Alliance. Rasmussen's capacity to accommodate both the New Alliance and the Danish People's Party going forward is not assured – the New Alliance was established, in part, to limit the Danish Peoples's Party's influence. With the DPP in coalition, Rasmussen is able to govern: a New Alliance-supported opposition would be short of a majority by one vote. Edmund Joensen's pledge to abstain on matters related to internal affairs of Denmark and would alter this, giving the New Alliance the balance of power and risking conflict with the DPP,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article428941.ece|title=Færing stemmer ikke indenrigspolitisk|language=Danish|publisher=[[Politiken]]|date=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-11-14|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116124334/http://politiken.dk/politik/article428941.ece|archivedate=2007-11-16}}</ref> but Joensen has also pledged that if doing so would risk giving the opposition a majority, he would not abstain, but instead vote with the government.

As after the last election, where Rasmussen also secured continuing power, there were some shuffling of minister posts in the cabinet. The resulting [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen III]] was presented a few days after the election.
