==History==
Stance was founded in 2009 by Jeff Kearl, John Wilson, Aaron Hennings, Ryan Kingman and Taylor Shupe. The original founders saw an opportunity to address a category of fashion they felt had been overlooked by many brands and the majority of the industry.<ref>http://www.sanclementetimes.com/business-beat-stance-locks-original-contract-with-nba/</ref>

The company first began shipping product in August 2010, and now ships over 15 million pairs of socks each year. Stance has raised a significant amount of venture capital and is sold in over 40 countries worldwide.<ref>https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2015/03/05/luxury-socks-startup-stance-raises-50m-to-expand-into-underwear/</ref><ref>https://www.stance.com/about</ref>

In March 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported the company had raised $50 million from Silicon Valley venture capital firms and that the brand would be expanding into men’s underwear. In April 2015, the NBA announced that Stance had been named the official on-court sock of the NBA starting in the 2015-2016 season. As part of the deal, Stance would be allowed to display its logo on all socks worn on-court by players, a first in NBA history for apparel companies.<ref>http://www.mensjournal.com/style/collection/stance-socks-adds-its-logo-to-the-nba-uniform-20150427</ref> Stance opened its first store in the [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood of New York City in November 2015.<ref name=":0" />

In 2015, Stance posted a 356% employee increase from the previous year, reaching 114 employees, at its San Clemente headquarters. Stance was listed No. 24 on the Orange County Business Journal’s list of the 51 Biggest Based in Orange County Apparel Businesses.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 

Between 2017 and 2020, the company has undergone several rounds of layoffs.<ref>https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Stance-Reviews-E1100877.htm</ref>

The brand won Best Socks of the Year in 2017 with their tribute to rapper, [[Gucci Mane]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BEST SOCKS OF 2017: STANCE |url=https://www.sneakscore.com/stance-socks |website=Sneakscore |publisher=Sneakscore |accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>
