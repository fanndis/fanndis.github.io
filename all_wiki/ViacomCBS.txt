'''ViacomCBS Inc.''' is an American diversified multinational [[media conglomerate|mass media conglomerate]] and formed through the [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|merger]] of [[CBS Corporation]] and the [[Viacom (2005–2019)|second incarnation of Viacom]] on December 4, 2019,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thewrap.com/cbs-viacom-merger-close-date-dec-4/ |title = CBS and Viacom Reveal December Merger Date – Mark Your Calendars|date = November 25, 2019}}</ref> which were split from the [[Viacom (1952–2006)|first incarnation of Viacom]] in 2006.

The company's main assets include the [[Paramount Pictures]] film and [[Paramount Television Studios|television]] studio, [[CBS Entertainment Group]] (consisting of the [[CBS]] television network, [[CBS Television Stations|television stations]], and other CBS-branded assets), [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks|domestic networks]] (consisting of U.S.-based basic and premium-tier cable television networks including [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[BET]], [[Comedy Central]], and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]), [[ViacomCBS Networks International|international networks]] (consisting of international versions of domestic ViacomCBS networks as well as region-specific networks), the [[Pluto TV]] ad-supported television streaming service, and the [[Simon & Schuster]] book publisher.

Headquartered at [[One Astor Plaza]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], New York City, the company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately 700 million subscribers in approximately 160 countries, as of 2020.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

== Background ==
{{main|Viacom (1952–2006)|CBS Corporation|Viacom (2005–2019)}}
In 1952, [[CBS]] formed '''CBS Films''', a division which handled syndication rights for CBS's library of television series. This division was renamed '''CBS Enterprises Inc.''' in January 1968, and again renamed '''[[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]]''' in 1970. In 1971, this syndication division was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] amid new [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules forbidding [[television network]]s from [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules|owning syndication companies]]. (The rules were abolished completely in 1993.)<ref>{{cite book|title=The Business of Media: Corporate Media and the Public Interest|author=D. Croteau|author2=W. Hoynes|publisher=Pine Forge Press|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=100–101|year=2006}}</ref> In 1986, Viacom was acquired by its present owner, theater operator company [[National Amusements]]. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Viacom made several acquisitions, including [[MTV Networks]] (former [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]]) and [[Paramount Communications]]. In 1999, Viacom made its biggest acquisition to date by announcing plans to merge with its former parent CBS Corporation (the renamed [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], which had merged with CBS in 1995). The merger was completed in 2000, resulting in CBS reuniting with its former syndication division. On January 3, 2006, Viacom was split into two companies: [[CBS Corporation]], the former's corporate successor and the [[Viacom (2005–2019)|spun-off Viacom]] company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Formation ===
On September 29, 2016, [[National Amusements]], the parent company of CBS Corporation and Viacom, wrote to Viacom and CBS encouraging the two companies to merge back into one company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/national-amusements-calls-viacom-cbs-933705|title=National Amusements Proposes Viacom, CBS Reunion, Cites "Substantial Synergies"|last=Szalai|first=George|date=September 29, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}</ref> On December 12, the deal was called off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/12/12/shari-redstone-withdraws-cbs-viacom-merger-proposal.html|title=Shari Redstone withdraws CBS-Viacom merger proposal|date=December 12, 2016|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref> The merger would early be named ''CBSViacom''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

On January 12, 2018, [[CNBC]] reported that Viacom had re-entered talks to merge back into CBS Corporation, after the merger of [[AT&T]]-[[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|proposed acquisition]] of most of the [[21st Century Fox]]'s assets were announced. Viacom and CBS also faced heavy competition from companies such as [[Netflix]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/12/viacom-shares-jump-9-percent-percent-on-wrap-report-that-its-looking-to-merge-with-cbs.html|title=Viacom, CBS shares surge after report Shari Redstone pursuing merge of companies|last=Wang|first=Christine|date=January 12, 2018|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> Shortly afterward, it was reported that the combined company could be a suitor for acquiring the film studio [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/lionsgate-talks-amazon-verizon-cbs-viacom-1202244991/|title=Lionsgate Ripe For Takeover As Amazon, Verizon and CBS-Viacom Emerge As Potential Suitors|last=Busch|first=Anita|last2=Chmielewski|first2=Anita|date=January 17, 2019|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}</ref> Viacom and Lionsgate were both interested in acquiring [[The Weinstein Company]].<ref name="thewrap.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/weinstein-co-talking-22-buyers-300-million-expected-price-bob-weinstein-must-exit|title=Weinstein Co Talking to 22 Buyers, $300 Million Expected Price, Bob Weinstein Must Exit|date=October 26, 2017|work=The Wrap|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}</ref> Following the [[Weinstein effect]], Viacom was listed as one of 22 potential buyers that were interested in acquiring TWC.<ref name="thewrap.com" /> They lost the bid, and on March 1, 2018, it was announced that [[Maria Contreras-Sweet]] would acquire all of TWC's assets for $500&nbsp;million.<ref name="latimes20180301">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-weinstein-company-sale-20180301-story.html|title=Former Obama administration official has reached a deal to buy Weinstein Co. assets|author=Ryan Faughnder|date=March 1, 2018|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name="deadline1202307564">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/03/weinstein-company-deal-board-of-directors-maria-contreras-sweet-harvey-weinstein-1202307564/|title=TWC Board, New York AG Confirm Maria Contreras-Sweet Group Has Acquired Weinstein Company Assets|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|date=March 2, 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref> Lantern Capital would later acquire the Studio.

On March 30, 2018, CBS made an all-stock offer slightly below Viacom's market value, insisting that its existing leadership, including long-time chairman and CEO [[Les Moonves]], oversee the re-combined company. Viacom rejected the offer as too low, requesting a $2.8&nbsp;billion increase and that [[Robert Bakish|Bob Bakish]] be maintained as president and COO under Moonves. These conflicts had resulted from [[Shari Redstone]] seeking more control over CBS and its leadership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/moonves-redstone-inside-poisonous-war-control-cbs-viacom-1101570|title=Moonves vs. Redstone: Inside the Poisonous War for Control of CBS and Viacom|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/cbs-viacom-leslie-moonves-2-1202749787/|title=Could CBS-Viacom Strife Cause Leslie Moonves to Walk Away?|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=April 11, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref>

Eventually, on May 14, 2018, CBS Corporation sued its and Viacom's parent company National Amusements and accused Redstone of abusing her voting power in the company and [[Hostile takeover|forcing a merger that was not supported by it or Viacom]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-14/cbs-sues-redstone-s-nai-to-let-board-meeting-on-dividend-happen|title=CBS Sues Redstones' Firm in Escalation of Longstanding Fight|date=May 14, 2018|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|access-date=May 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/05/shari-redstones-national-amusements-outraged-cbs-suit-1202390493/|title=National Amusements Fires Back at CBS Suit, Says It's "Outraged" By Allegations|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|date=May 14, 2018|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=May 14, 2018}}</ref> CBS also accused Redstone of discouraging [[Verizon Communications]] from acquiring it, which could have been beneficial to its shareholders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2018/05/verizon-expressed-interest-acquiring-cbs-before-viacom-talks-heated-up-1202390751/amp/|title=Verizon Expressed Interest in Acquiring CBS Before Viacom Talks Heated Up|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|date=May 14, 2018|publisher=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=May 26, 2018}}</ref>

On May 23, 2018, Les Moonves explained that he considered the Viacom channels to be an "[[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]]," and while he favored more content for [[CBS All Access]], he believed that there were better deals for CBS than the Viacom deal, such as [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], Lionsgate, or [[Sony Pictures]]. Moonves also considered Bakish a threat because he did not want an ally of Shari Redstone as a board member of the combined company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/behind-leslie-moonves-crusade-save-cbs-viacom-1114203|title=Behind Leslie Moonves' Crusade to Save CBS From Viacom|last=Bond|first=Paul|date=May 23, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=May 26, 2018}}</ref>

On September 9, 2018, Les Moonves exited CBS following multiple accusations of sexual assault. National Amusements agreed to make no proposal of a CBS-Viacom merger for at least two years after the date of the settlement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-moonves-accused-sex-crimes-violence-by-more-women-1141436|title=Leslie Moonves Exits CBS After Being Accused of Sex Crimes, Violence by More Women|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=September 9, 2018|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

On May 30, 2019, CNBC reported that CBS Corporation and Viacom would explore merger discussions in mid-June 2019. CBS's board of directors was revamped with people who were open to merging; the re-merger was made possible with the resignation of Moonves, who had opposed all merger attempts. The talks had started following rumors of CBS acquiring [[Starz Inc.|Starz]] from Lionsgate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-cbs-viacom-merger-talks-20190530-story.html|title=CBS and Viacom merger negotiations expected to resume|last=James|first=Meg|date=May 30, 2019|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> Reports said that CBS and Viacom reportedly set August 8 as an informal deadline for reaching an agreement to recombine the two media companies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/cbs-viacom-want-remerger-deal-set-by-early-august-report|title=CBS, Viacom set early August deadline for remerger agreement – report|last=Munson|first=Ben|date=July 16, 2019|work=FierceVideo|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/cbs-viacom-boards-wrestle-with-post-merger-management-decisions-ending-coo-role-exclusive-1203273848/|title=CBS, Viacom Boards Wrestle With Post-Merger Management Decisions, Ending COO Role (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Littleton|first=Synthia|date=July 19, 2019|work=Variety|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref> CBS announced to acquire Viacom as part of the re-merger deal for up to $15.4&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-a-merged-cbs-viacom-could-try-compete-hollywood-giants-1225453|title=How a Merged CBS-Viacom Could Try to Compete with Hollywood Giants|quote=CBS' plan to acquire Viacom for up to $15.4 billion could be announced Aug. 8, giving its controlling shareholder the ability to leverage IP like 'Star Trek' across film and TV to better compete with Disney, Netflix and the rest.|date=July 19, 2019|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>

On August 2, 2019, it was reported that CBS and Viacom agreed to merge back into one entity.

On December 10, 2019, Bakish announced that ViacomCBS would look to divest [[CBS Building|Black Rock]], the building that held CBS's headquarters since 1964.

ViacomCBS International was founded in 1976 as Viacom International Inc. It is a subsidiary responsible for copyrights and trademarks associated with its corporate websites and its cable networks, specifically the Domestic Media Networks division, and the division which [[brand licensing|licenses]] the product rights for their various properties. Prior to 1986, Viacom International was the parent company of [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom Enterprises]], and CBS's in-house output pre-1972. Before the first 1999 CBS merger, it also acted as the [[Viacom (1952–2006)|first Viacom]]'s licensee company for Viacom's owned [[television stations]]; for instance [[New Britain, Connecticut]] station [[WVIT]], currently an [[NBC]] [[owned-and-operated]] station for the [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] market owned by Viacom from 1978 until 1997, took their call letters from Viacom International.
Since the second merger between Viacom and CBS in 2019, this subsidiary has been renamed as ViacomCBS International in 2020.
