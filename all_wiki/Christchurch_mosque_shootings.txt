Tarrant fired indiscriminately at worshippers in the prayer hall from close range, shooting many of his victims multiple times. He then left the mosque and fired on more people outside, killing a man. Returning to his vehicle, he retrieved another weapon before heading to the mosque's car park and shot several people fleeing or hiding there. He then reentered the mosque and opened fire again on people who were already wounded in the prayer hall and unable to escape.

Canterbury Police District Commander Superintendent John Price told Newshub that police have found evidence from CCTV footage that Tarrant's vehicle had been parked across the street from the mosque before 15 March.

==== Operation Whakahaumanu ====
Shortly after the attack, New Zealand Police launched Operation Whakahaumanu. The operation was designed to reassure New Zealanders after the attack and to also investigate possible threats who shared a similar ideology to the gunman. Police increased visibility in streets and visited many schools, businesses, and religious places as part of the operation. In Canterbury alone, there were almost 600 people of interest to police, where hundreds of properties were searched. On 14 July 2020, the [[Independent Police Conduct Authority]] (IPCA) deemed three of these searches to be unlawful.<ref>{{Cite web|date=14 July 2020|title=Inside police investigation that sparked hundreds of raids after March 15 attack|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/122130895/inside-police-investigation-that-sparked-hundreds-of-raids-after-march-15-attack|access-date=15 July 2020|website=Stuff}}</ref>
