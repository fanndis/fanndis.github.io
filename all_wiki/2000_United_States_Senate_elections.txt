The '''2000 United States Senate elections''' were held on November 7, 2000. The elections coincided with other federal and state elections, including the [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential election]] which was won by Republican [[George W. Bush]]. It featured a number of fiercely contested elections that resulted in a victory for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], which gained a net total of four seats from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  This election marked the first election year since 1990 where Democrats made net gains in the Senate.

This election took place six years after Republicans had won a net gain of eight seats in [[Classes of United States senators|Senate Class 1]] during the [[1994 United States Senate elections|elections of 1994]]. Democrats defeated incumbent Republican senators [[William Roth]] in [[#Delaware|Delaware]], [[Spencer Abraham]] in [[#Michigan|Michigan]], [[Rod Grams]] in [[#Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[John Ashcroft]] in [[#Missouri|Missouri]], and [[Slade Gorton]] in [[#Washington|Washington]], and won an open seat in [[#Florida|Florida]]. In [[#Missouri|Missouri]], the winner was elected posthumously. The Republicans defeated Democratic incumbent [[Chuck Robb]] in [[#Virginia|Virginia]], and won an open seat in [[#Nevada|Nevada]].

The election resulted in an equal 50–50 split between Republicans and Democrats, meaning the Vice President would cast the tie-breaking votes in organizing the Senate.  This resulted in the Democrats winning control of the Senate for only 17 days, since [[Al Gore]] was still [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and President of the Senate at the beginning of the new term, on January 3, 2001. But the Republicans regained control of the chamber when the new Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was inaugurated January 20. The Republican majority would last until June 6, 2001, when Republican senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont became an [[independent (politics)|independent]] and caucused with the Democrats.

This was the last time until 2016 in which Democrats lost the presidency but gained seats in the Senate. Democrats won the popular vote in both elections. As of 2020, this is the last time the Senate changed hands during a presidential year.

This is the last election with only Republicans and Democrats in the Senate. Following Jeffords' party switch, there has always been at least one Independent or third-party senator. 2000 was the last year in which Republicans won U.S. Senate seats in [[2000 United States Senate election in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] and [[2000 United States Senate election in Vermont|Vermont]] and in which Democrats won a seat in [[2000 United States Senate election in Georgia|Georgia]].

The heavily financed and popular senator Dianne Feinstein (D) easily won re-election to her second full term defeating the underfunded and underdog candidate Representative Tom Campbell (R) by over 19 points. Campbell even lost his own congressional district by almost 15 points.

Despite touting his service as a moderate Republican representing a strongly Democratic district, Campbell was underfunded and a decided underdog against the popular, heavily financed Feinstein.

Incumbent Democrat [[Joe Lieberman]] won re-election to a third term over Republican [[Philip Giordano]], Mayor of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and former [[Connecticut House of Representatives|State Representative]]. While running for re-election, he was also [[Al Gore]]'s running mate in the [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]]. With Gore losing the presidency to [[George W. Bush]], Lieberman returned to the Senate and remained there for another [[2012 United States Senate election in Connecticut|13 years]], when he retired. Had the Gore–Lieberman ticket won, Lieberman would have become [[United States Vice President|U.S. Vice President]] and forced to resign his Senate seat, which would have led to a 2002 special election. It would also have led Republican Governor [[John G. Rowland]] to temporarily appoint an interim replacement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/57664553.html?dids=57664553:57664553&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+08%2C+2000&author=MATTHEW+KAUFFMAN+And+CARRIE+BUDOFF%3B+Courant+Staff+Writers%3B+Courant+Staff+Writer+Lyn+Bixby+contributed+to+this+story%2C+which+also+includes+a+wire+service+report.&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=SENATOR+TO+CONTINUE+RE-ELECTION+EFFORTS%2C+TOO+LAW+PERMITS+STATEWIDE+AND+NATIONWIDE+RUNS%3B+JOSEPH+LIEBERMAN%3A+THE+HISTORIC+CHOICE+Series%3A+VOTE+2000&pqatl=google |title=The Hartford Courant Article Archive - Senator To Continue Re-Election Efforts, Too Law Permits Statewide And Nationwide Runs |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2000-08-08 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}</ref>

Incumbent Republican [[William Roth]] ran for re-election to a sixth term, but was defeated by Governor [[Tom Carper]].

For 16 years the same four people had held the four major statewide positions. Because of term limits on the Governor's position [[Thomas Carper]] could not run again. Both he and U.S. Representative [[Michael Castle]] wanted to be [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]]. Roth would not retire, and fellow Republican Castle decided against a primary.

Roth, 79, was in the U.S. Senate for 30 years. He was the Chairman of the Finance Committee. Carper, 53, was a popular Governor and former U.S. Congressman of [[Delaware's At-large congressional district]], who announced his major candidacy against Roth back in September 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-09-21/politics/senate.2000_delaware.senate_1_delaware-governor-sixth-senate-term-delaware-residents?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003081751/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-09-21/politics/senate.2000_delaware.senate_1_delaware-governor-sixth-senate-term-delaware-residents?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS |archive-date=2012-10-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Both candidates were moderates. Roth was one of the few Republicans to vote for the [[Brady Bill]]. Although Roth started the campaign with a 2-to-1 spending advantage, Carper went into the final month with more than $1 million on hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/62928651.html?dids=62928651:62928651&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+26%2C+2000&author=Curtis+Wilkie%2C+Globe+Correspondent&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=IN+TIGHT+RACE%2C+HEALTH+ISSUES+DOG+DELAWARE%27S+ROTH&pqatl=google |title=In Tight Race, Health Issues Dog Delaware'S Roth |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2000-10-26 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}</ref> In a contest between two popular and respected politicians, the issue seemed to be Roth's age versus Carper's relative youth.

Carper defeated Roth by over ten points. However, Roth received more votes than Presidential candidate George W. Bush, suggesting the strength of the Democratic turnout was a boon to Carper's candidacy and a key element of his victory. Many consider Roth's defeat due to his age and health, as he collapsed twice during the campaign, once in the middle of a television interview and once during a campaign event.<ref name="newsbank1">{{Cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB7368E419B47F9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Philadelphia Inquirer: Search Results|website=nl.newsbank.com|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sussexcountyonline.com/campaign2000/results/ussenate.html |title=Delaware U.S. Race, 2000 - Sussex County Online, Delaware |publisher=Sussexcountyonline.com |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cache.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/In_tight_race_health_issues_dog_Delaware_s_Roth+.shtml |title=Boston.com / Politics / Campaign 2000 / News |publisher=Cache.boston.com |date=2000-10-26 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}</ref>

This election was in conjunction to the [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|presidential election]], where Bush narrowly defeated Gore after an intense [[Florida recount|recount]]. The senate election was evenly matched with two U.S. Congressmen named Bill in their mid-50s. Both parties heavily targeted this senate seat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o0EgAAAAIBAJ&pg=6654,152782&dq=bill+mccollum+nelson&hl=en|title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> The election became very nasty as Nelson called his opponent "an extremist who would sacrifice the elderly, the poor, and the working class to coddle the rich." McCollum called the Democrat "a liberal who would tax everything that moves, and some things that don't." The election advertisements were very negative, as both candidates talked more about each other than themselves.<ref>{{Cite web |author=RICK BRAGG|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0712FA3C5A0C7B8DDDA90994D8404482 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714153120/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0712FA3C5A0C7B8DDDA90994D8404482 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-14 |title=THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: A FLORIDA RACE; 2 Senate Candidates Eagerly Woo Moderates - The New York Times |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=2000-10-18 |accessdate=2017-12-20 }}</ref>

Incumbent Democrat [[Zell Miller]], who was appointed by Governor [[Roy Barnes]] to replace the late [[Paul Coverdell]], won re-election to serve the remainder of the term, beating Republican [[Mack Mattingly]],  former Ambassador to [[Seychelles]] and former U.S. senator. As of 2016, this is the last Senate election in Georgia won by a Democrat and also this is the last time the Democrats have won the Class 3 Senate Seat from Georgia.

One of the biggest campaign issues was [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. Miller attacked Mattingly for supporting a raise in the retirement age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MT&s_site=macon&p_multi=MT&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB76C8DCA04101C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Macon Telegraph: Search Results|website=nl.newsbank.com|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> The Republican fought back by connecting him to liberal Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts, and on his vote to block legislation aimed at protecting Social Security. Mattingly said he would vote for [[Texas Governor]] [[George W. Bush]] for president, who was very popular in the state and led Vice President [[Al Gore]] in many Georgia polls. Mattingly then asked Miller who he was supporting in the presidential election. Miller conceded he would vote for Gore because he helped him when he was governor including [[drought]] relief, [[welfare reform]], and the [[Atlanta Olympics]]. "That does not mean I agree with all of his policies," he concluded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2000/10/16/met_300291.shtml |title=Mattingly, Miller spar on records |publisher=chronicle.augusta.com |date=2000-10-16 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}</ref> In early October, a poll showed Miller leading with 59% of the vote, despite the fact that Bush was leading Gore by a double-digit margin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CL&s_site=ledgerenquirer&p_multi=CL&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB722D10F9BD7F7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Ledger Enquirer: Search Results|website=nl.newsbank.com|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>

Incumbent Republican [[Richard Lugar]] was re-elected to his fifth six-year term over Democrat David Johnson.

Lugar easily won re-election taking 66.5% one of the largest margins in a statewide race in Indiana history. Johnson only took one county, [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake County]], which borders Illinois, is a Democratic Stronghold county. Johnson did trounce Lugar in Lake County, but with Lugar doing well elsewhere in the state, it made no real dent in Lugar's lead.

Incumbent Republican [[Spencer Abraham]] ran for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by Democrat [[Debbie Stabenow]].

Abraham, who was first elected in the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]] despite never running for public office before, was considered vulnerable by the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]]. Major issues in the campaign included prescription drugs for the elderly.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,57698,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=October 14, 2000}}</ref> By September 4, Abraham still had failed to reach 50% in polls despite having spent over $6 million on television ads.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/59403477.html?dids=59403477:59403477&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+04%2C+2000&author=Elaine+S.+Povich.+WASHINGTON+BUREAU&pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&desc=Congress+Races+Test+Coattails&pqatl=google | work=Newsday | title=Congress Races Test Coattails | date=September 4, 2000}}</ref> In mid-October, he came back and reached 50% and 49% in two polls respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dz8iAAAAIBAJ&pg=3886,3871152&dq=debbie+stabenow&hl=en|title=The Argus-Press - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>

The election was very close with Stabenow prevailing by just over 67,000 votes. Stabenow was also likely helped by the fact that [[Al Gore]] won Michigan on the presidential level. Ultimately, Stabenow pulled out huge numbers out of the Democratic stronghold of [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], which covers the [[Detroit Metropolitan Area]]. Stabenow also performed well in other heavily populated areas such as [[Ingham County]] home to the state's capital of [[Lansing]], and the college town of [[Ann Arbor]]. Abraham did not concede right after major news networks declared Stabenow the winner; He held out hope that the few outstanding precincts could push him over the edge. At 4:00AM, Abraham conceded defeat. Senator Abraham called Stabenow and congratulated her on her victory. A historic election, Stabenow became the first woman to represent [[Michigan]] in the [[United States Senate]].

Incumbent Republican [[John Ashcroft]] lost the election to Governor [[Mel Carnahan]], despite Carnahan's death three weeks before election day.

In 1998, Ashcroft briefly considered running for [[U.S. president|president]]. On January 5, 1999, he announced that he would not seek the presidency and would instead defend his Senate seat in the 2000 election.<ref>"[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/01/05/president.2000/ashcroft/ Ashcroft decides not to jump into 2000 race]", CNN, January 5, 1999.</ref> [[Missouri Governor]] [[Mel Carnahan]] announced he would contest the Senate election as a Democrat.

In the general election for the state's seat in the U.S. Senate, Ashcroft was facing then-Governor [[Mel Carnahan]] in a "tight" race, despite the senator having a larger budget than Carnahan, a [[War chest#In politics|war chest]] that included significant contributions from corporations such as [[Monsanto Company]],<ref>Schanbacher, William D. ''The Politics of Food: The Global Conflict between Food Security and Food Sovereignty'',  Praeger Security International; February 26, 2010; {{ISBN|978-0313363283}}; p. 47.</ref> headquartered in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], which gave five times more to Ashcroft's campaign fund than to the fund of any other congressional hopeful at the time.<ref>Harrison, Beth B. ''Shedding Light on Genetically Engineered Food: What You Don't Know About the Food You're Eating and What You Can Do to Protect Yourself'',  iUniverse, Inc., November 13, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0595451807}}</ref>

Carnahan was killed in a plane crash three weeks before the November election date. Nonetheless, Carnahan's name remained on the ballot due to Missouri's election laws. Lieutenant Governor [[Roger B. Wilson]] became Governor upon Carnahan's death, to serve the remaining term of Carnahan's [[Governor (United States)|governorship]]. Ashcroft suspended all campaigning on the day of the plane crash in light of the tragedy and resumed it eight days before the election date.<ref name=nyt>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/09/us/the-2000-elections-missouri-senator-refuses-to-challenge-loss.html The 2000 elections: Missouri; Senator Refuses To Challenge Loss]" by John W. Fountain, ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 9, 2000.</ref>

The voters of Missouri, by a margin of approximately fifty thousand votes,<ref name=results/> chose for the U.S. Senate Mel Carnahan, their Governor who had died two weeks before the election. No one had ever posthumously won election to the Senate, though voters on at least three other occasions had until then chosen deceased candidates for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]: [[Clement Woodnutt Miller]] (D) in [[California]] in 1962; [[Nick Begich]] (D) in [[Alaska]], 1972; and [[Hale Boggs]] (D) in [[Louisiana]], 1972. Hence, John Ashcroft became the first U.S. Senate candidate to be defeated by a dead opponent.<ref name=post>"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/10/01/five-people-have-won-election-to-congress-despite-being-dead/ Five people have won election to Congress, despite being dead]" by Philip Bump, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 1, 2014.</ref>

Governor Roger B. Wilson appointed Carnahan's 66-year-old widow, [[Jean Carnahan]], to fill her husband's [[List of United States senators from Missouri|vacant seat]] until the [[2002 United States Senate elections|next cycle]] of Senate elections when a successor could be [[2002 United States Senate special election in Missouri|elected]] to serve out the remaining four years of the deceased Carnahan's would-be term.<ref>Wayne, Stephen J. & Clyde Wilcox.

Conrad, in a poll released September 21, was leading Schweitzer 48% to 39%{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}} that went down from 49% in November 1999{{Citation needed | date=February 2010}}. Schweitzer had his polls go up by 11 points.

Burns faced a surprisingly difficult re-election campaign in 2000. In February 1999, he announced that he would break his 1988 promise to only hold office for two terms, claiming "Circumstances have changed, and I have rethought my position."<ref>[[George Will]], "…Terms Unlimited", ''The Washington Post'', June 24, 1999.</ref> Later that same month, while giving a speech about [[North American energy independence|U.S. dependence on foreign oil]] to the Montana Equipment Dealers Association, he referred to [[Arab]]s as "ragheads". Burns soon apologized, saying he "became too emotionally involved" during the speech.<ref>[[Al Kamen]], "Burns's A List: African Americans, Arabs", ''The Washington Post'', March 12, 1999.</ref>

Burns faced [[Brian Schweitzer]], a rancher from [[Whitefish, Montana|Whitefish]], Montana. While Burns attempted to link Schweitzer with presidential candidate [[Al Gore]], whom Schweitzer never met, Schweitzer "effectively portrayed himself as nonpolitical".<ref name="AAP2004">Michael Barone, ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' 2004, [[National Journal]] Group.</ref> Schweitzer primarily challenged Burns on the issue of [[prescription drug]]s, organizing busloads of senior citizens to take trips to [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] for cheaper medicine.<ref name="WP103100">William Booth, "Mont. Rancher Mounts Brawny Challenge; Crusty GOP Incumbent Finds Race Tightening Against an Equally Rough-Hewn Opponent", ''The Washington Post'', October 31, 2000.</ref> Burns charged that Schweitzer favored "Canadian-style government controls"<ref name="AAP2004"/> and claimed that senior citizens went to doctors to have "somebody to visit with. There's nothing wrong with them."<ref name="WP103100"/> Burns also faced trouble regarding deaths from [[asbestos]] in [[Libby, Montana|Libby]], Montana. While he initially supported a bill to limit compensation in such cases, he withdrew his support for the bill, under public criticism, and added [[United States dollar|$]]11.5 million for the town to an appropriations bill.<ref name="AAP2004"/><ref>Al Kamen, "Town Getting $ 11 Million in Salve From Burns", ''The Washington Post'', May 12, 2000.</ref>

Burns spent twice as much money as Schweitzer on the election<ref name="AAP2004"/> and only defeated him by a slim margin, 51-47 percent, while the state voted 58-33 percent for Republican presidential nominee [[George W. Bush]]. Schweitzer went on to become [[Governor of Montana|governor]] in 2004.

Incumbent Democrat [[Frank Lautenberg]] decided to retire, rather than seeking a fourth term. The Democratic nominee, former CEO of [[Goldman Sachs]] [[Jon Corzine]], defeated the Republican nominee, U.S. Representative [[Bob Franks]], in a close election.

Senator Lautenberg, first elected to the Senate in 1982 in an upset victory over Rep. Millicent Fenwick (R-Bergen), had always been an underdog in all three bids for Senate. He beat Pete Dawkins in 1988 by a 54%-46% margin and held back a challenge from Chuck Haytaian by a smaller margin of 50%-47%. However, popular Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to challenge Lautenberg, and opinion polls showed Lautenberg losing by a large margin. He retired but later regretted his decision because Gov. Whitman and Former Governor Tom Kean both declined to run for the Senate. Lautenberg would be elected to the state's other Senate Seat in 2002.

Corzine spent $35 million of his own money into the Democratic primary election alone<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/13/nyregion/franks-accuses-corzine-of-trying-to-buy-his-way-into-senate-seat.html | work=The New York Times | first=David M. | last=Halbfinger | title=Franks Accuses Corzine of Trying To Buy His Way Into Senate Seat | date=October 13, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/13/nyregion/franks-and-corzine-debate-race-education-and-disclosure.html | work=The New York Times | title=Franks and Corzine Debate Race, Education and Disclosure | date=October 13, 2000}}</ref> when running against Jim Florio, who served as the 49th Governor of New Jersey from 1990 to 1994. Governor Florio was unpopular during his tenure in office. Most notably, he signed a $2.8 Billion tax increase in 1990. It caused his party to lose control of the state government for a decade, and cost the Governor his re-election bid in 1993.

Corzine, running as an outsider, was endorsed by State senator Raymond Zane (D-Gloucester), State senator Wayne Bryant (D-Camden), State senator John Adler (D-Camden), U.S Representative Bob Menendez (D-Hudson) and U.S senator Bob Torricelli (D-NJ).  Florio was endorsed by the State Party, Assemblyman Joe Doria (D-Hudson) and senator John Lynch (D-Middlesex).

Corzine defeated Florio in the primary and then defeated Bob Franks in the general election.

Corzine accused Franks of wanting to ''dismantle'' the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security system]] because he supported Governor [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Social Security debate (United States)#George W. Bush's privatization proposal|partial privatization plan]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/13/nyregion/franks-accuses-corzine-of-trying-to-buy-his-way-into-senate-seat.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=Franks Accuses Corzine of Trying To Buy His Way Into Senate Seat | date=October 13, 2000}}</ref>

During the campaign, Corzine refused to release his [[Tax return (United States)|income tax return]] records. He claimed an interest in doing so, but he cited a [[confidentiality agreement]] with Goldman Sachs. Skeptics argued that he should have followed the example of his predecessor [[Robert Rubin]], who converted his [[stock|equity]] stake into debt upon leaving Goldman.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/85856 | title=The High Price Of Chutzpah: Cheney And Corzine May Be Pushing The Ethical Envelope On Conflict-Of-Interest Rules.

During Corzine's campaign for the [[United States Senate]], he made some controversial [[off-color]] statements.  When introduced to a man with an Italian name who said he was in the construction business, Corzine quipped: "Oh, you make [[cement shoes]]!" according to Emanuel Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee. Alfano also reported that when introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine said: "He's not Italian, is he?

Also in 2000, Corzine denied having paid off African-American ministers, when in fact the foundation controlled by him and his wife had paid one influential black church $25,000.<ref>Ingle pp. 62–63.</ref> Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council, had campaigned against a form of [[racial profiling]] whereby police officers stop minority drivers and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent, Carl A.

Corzine had donated to Jackson prior to getting what appears to be a reciprocal endorsement.<ref>{{Cite news | author=Jacob, Andrew | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E0D7153BF933A1575AC0A9669C8B63 | title=Black Minister Criticized for Taking Corzine's Money | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | work=The New York Times | accessdate=August 27, 2008 | date=September 20, 2000 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716031705/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E0D7153BF933A1575AC0A9669C8B63 | archivedate=July 16, 2012 }}</ref>

Franks generally trailed Corzine in the polls until the very last week, when he pulled even in a few polls. Corzine spent $63 million, while Franks spent only $6 million.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/nyregion/11franks.html?adxnnl=1&ref=bobfranks&adxnnlx=1308790854-1RxP4ccR3G8T3bZ6s8UEAQ | work=The New York Times | first=Diane | last=Cardwell | title=Robert Franks, Former New Jersey Congressman, Dies | date=April 10, 2010}}</ref> Despite being heavily outspent, Franks lost by only three percentage points, doing better that year than Republican Governor [[George W.

{{See also|List of United States senators from New York}}
[[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], then [[First Lady of the United States]] and the first First Lady to run for political office, defeated [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Rick Lazio]]. The general election coincided with the [[2000 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]].

The race began in November 1998 when four-term incumbent [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] (D) announced his retirement. Both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] sought high-profile candidates to compete for the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Rudolph Giuliani]] were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]], purchased a house in [[Chappaqua, New York]], in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of [[carpetbagging]] since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.

The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman [[Rick Lazio]] to replace him. The election included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women.

While Clinton had a solid base of support in New York City, candidates and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state's voters live. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits with the purpose of rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.<ref name="cnn110700">{{Cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ | title=Hillary Rodham Clinton scores historic win in New York | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=November 8, 2000 | accessdate=December 17, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212204213/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ | archivedate=February 12, 2007 }}</ref>
Lazio faced a unique tactical problem campaigning upstate. The major issue there was the persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks on the state of the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor [[George Pataki]], however, limiting the effect of this line of attack.

Opponents continued to make the carpetbagging issue a focal point throughout the race and during debates.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D9103CF93AA35753C1A9669C8B63 | title=Excerpts From Second Debate Between Mrs. Clinton and Lazio | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 9, 2000 | accessdate=February 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Talk radio]] hammered on this, with New York-based [[Sean Hannity]] issuing a daily mantra, "Name me three things Hillary Clinton has ever done for the people of New York!"

Kennedy]] who was [[1964 United States Senate election in New York|elected to the Senate in 1964]] despite similar accusations. In the end, according to exit polls conducted in the race, a majority of the voters dismissed the carpetbagging issue as unimportant.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/08/senate.wrap/index.html | title=Ashcroft concedes as GOP clings to Senate lead | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=November 8, 2000 | accessdate=February 17, 2008 }}{{Dead link | date=May 2016 | bot=medic}}{{Cbignore | bot=medic}}</ref>

A September 13, 2000 debate between Lazio and Clinton proved important.  Lazio was on the warpath against [[soft money]] and the amounts of it coming from the [[Democratic National Committee]] into Clinton's campaign, and challenged Clinton to agree to ban soft money from both campaigns.  He left his podium and waved his proposed paper agreement in Clinton's face;<ref name="gvn-212">Gerth, Van Natta Jr., ''Her Way'', pp. 212–213.</ref> many debate viewers thought he had invaded her [[personal space]]<ref name="salon112707">{{Cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/11/27/rudy_hillary/ | title=When Rudy Met Hillary | author=Rob Polner | magazine=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] | date=November 27, 2007 | accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref> and as a result Clinton's support among women voters solidified.<ref name="gvn-212"/>

Late in the campaign Lazio criticised Clinton for accepting campaign donations from various Arab groups in the wake of the {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}} attack. This issue caused former New York Mayor [[Ed Koch]] to take out ads telling Lazio to "stop with the sleaze already,"<ref name="gvn-212"/> and did not change the dynamic of the race.

Incumbent Republican [[Rick Santorum]] won re-election to a second term over Democratic Congressman [[Ron Klink]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&ElectionID=2&OfficeID=2 | title=Commonwealth of PA - Elections Information |access-date=2008-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515031139/http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&ElectionID=2&OfficeID=2 | archive-date=2008-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Santorum had gained a reputation as a polarizing figure during his first term in the Senate, but he entered the race with a large fundraising advantage and high levels of support from the political right. The contest began for Democrats with a brutal primary challenge; U.S. Congressman Klink narrowly bested State senator [[Allyson Schwartz]] and former Lieutenant Governor nominee [[Tom Foley (Pennsylvania)|Tom Foley]] by running on the message that he was the only candidate capable of defeating the Republican. Klink was viewed as a viable choice because he was a traditional Democrat on most issues and had strong union ties but also was pro-life, which Democrats hoped would return votes to their party in the heavily [[Catholic]] but economically liberal coal regions of the state. However, enthusiasm around Klink's campaign quickly waned. Liberal Democrats, particularly in the Philadelphia area, balked at donating to a socially conservative candidate who was almost unknown in their area. He was also badly outspent, leaving him unable to expand his presence in the state; he didn't run a single ad on Philadelphia television.  Santorum, in contrast, successfully balanced his national recognition on social issues with local concerns en route to a surprisingly large victory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J_9q-lIWRkC&q=santorum&pg=PA112 |title=Pennsylvania Elections: Statewide Contests from 1950-2004 |accessdate=2017-12-20|isbn=9780761832799 |last1=Kennedy |first1=John J. |year=2006 }}</ref>

Incumbent Republican [[Slade Gorton]] ran for a third consecutive term (fourth overall), but was unseated for a second time (the first being [[1986 United States Senate election in Washington|1986]]) by Democratic candidate, former Congresswoman [[Maria Cantwell]].

Since [[Maria Cantwell]] had only won by 2,229 votes, an automatic recount was triggered. Cantwell won the recount, but it was still one of the closest elections in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] history.{{Citation needed | date=June 2014}} On November 17, 2000, [[Washington Secretary of State]] [[Sam Reed]] declared Cantwell the senator-elect.
