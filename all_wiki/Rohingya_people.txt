The modern term Rohingya emerged from colonial and pre-colonial terms ''Rooinga'' and ''Rwangya''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs21/FCO-1952-12-31-The_Mujahid_Revolt_in_Arakan-en-red.pdf |title=The Mujahid revolt in Arakan|website=www.burmalibrary.org |access-date=8 January 2020|date=31 December 1952}}</ref> The Rohingya refer to themselves as ''Ruáingga'' {{IPA|/ɾuájŋɡa/}}. In Burmese they are known as ''rui hang gya'' (following the [[MLC Transcription System]]) ({{lang-my|ရိုဟင်ဂျာ}} {{IPA|/ɹòhɪ̀ɴd͡ʑà/}}) while in Bengali they are called ''Rohingga'' ({{lang-bn|রোহিঙ্গা}} {{IPA|/ɹohiŋɡa/}}). The term "Rohingya" may come from ''Rakhanga'' or ''Roshanga'', the words for the state of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]].

==History==
{{Further|Arakan}}
{{Islam by country}}

===Early history===
The Rohingya population is concentrated in the historical region of [[Arakan]], an old coastal country in [[Southeast Asia]].
It is not clear who the original settlers of Arakan were. Arkanese chronicles claim that the [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] have inhabited Arakan since 3000&nbsp;BCE. By the 4th century, Arakan became one of the earliest [[Indianized kingdom]]s in Southeast Asia. The first Arakanese state flourished in [[Dhanyawadi]]. Power then shifted to the city of [[Waithali]]. [[Sanskrit]] inscriptions in the region indicate that the founders of the first Arakanese states were Indian. Arakan was ruled by the [[Chandra dynasty]].<ref name="TopichLeitich2013">{{cite book|author1=William J. Topich|author2=Keith A. Leitich|title=The History of Myanmar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIuaa5yKv-sC&pg=PA17|date=9 January 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35725-1|pages=17–22}}</ref> The British historian [[D. G. E. Hall|Daniel George Edward Hall]] stated that "The Burmese do not seem to have settled in Arakan until possibly as late as the tenth century CE. Hence earlier dynasties are thought to have been Indian, ruling over a population similar to that of Bengal.  All the capitals known to history have been in the north near modern [[Sittwe|Akyab]]".<ref>D. G. E Hall, ''A History of South East Asia'', New York, 1968, P. 389.</ref>

===Arrival of Islam===
Due to its coastline on the [[Bay of Bengal]], Arakan was a key centre of maritime trade and cultural exchange between Burma and the outside world, since the time of the Indian [[Mauryan Empire]].<ref name="Academy2003">{{cite book |author=British Academy |title=Proceedings of the British Academy, Volume 121, 2002 Lectures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Q0nkz1w8z0C&pg=PA76 |date=4 December 2003 |publisher=OUP/British Academy |isbn=978-0-19-726303-7 |page=76}}</ref> According to Syed Islam, a political science scholar, [[Arab people|Arab]] merchants had been in contact with Arakan since the third century, using the Bay of Bengal to reach Arakan.<ref name=ArakanArabs>{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Terrorism and Insurgency in Southeast Asia | author = Syed Islam|editor=Andrew T.

According to Syed Islam, the earliest Muslim settlements in the Arakan region began in the 7th-century. The Arab traders were also missionaries and they began converting the local Buddhist population to Islam by about 788 CE, states Syed Islam. Besides these locals converting to Islam, Arab merchants married local women and later settled in Arakan. As a result of intermarriage and conversion, the Muslim population in Arakan grew.<ref name=ArakanArabs />

The alternate view contests that Islam arrived in the Arakan region in the 1st-millennium. According to this view, this Rohingya history is not based on any evidence, rather is based on "fictitious stories, myths and legends".{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|pp=396–398}} According to Southeast Asian Buddhism history scholar and an ordained Buddhist monk Ashon Nyanuttara, there is scant historical data and archaeological evidence about the early political and religious history of the Arakan people and the Rakhaing region.

The Rakhines were one of the tribes of the Burmese [[Pyu city-states]]. The Rakhines began migrating to Arakan through the [[Arakan Mountains]] in the 9th century. The Rakhines established numerous cities in the valley of the [[Lemro River]]. These included Sambawak I, Pyinsa, Parein, Hkrit, Sambawak II, Myohaung, Toungoo and Launggret. Burmese forces invaded the Rakhine cities in 1406.<ref name="TopichLeitich2013" /> The Burmese invasion forced Rakhine rulers to seek help and refuge from neighbouring Bengal in the north.<ref name="TopichLeitich2013" />

Early evidence of Bengali Muslim settlements in Arakan date back to the time of [[Min Saw Mon]] (1430–34) of the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]]. After 24 years of exile in Bengal, he regained control of the Arakanese throne in 1430 with military assistance from the [[Bengal Sultanate]]. The [[Bengalis]] who came with him formed their own settlements in the region.{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|p=398}}{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|p=23}} The Santikan Mosque built in the 1430s,{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|p=398}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150625-myanmar-burma-rohingya-refugees-archaeology-world/ |title=Lost Myanmar Empire Is Stage for Modern Violence |website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=26 June 2015}}</ref> features a court which "measures {{nowrap|65 ft}} from north to south and {{nowrap|82 ft}} from east to west; the shrine is a rectangular structure measuring {{nowrap|33 ft by 47 ft}}."<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Mrauk-U, an Ancient City of Rakhine, Myanmar |author= Tun Shwe Khine |date=1993 |publisher=U Tun Shwe, Pagan Book House |edition=1st |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/41893876/Guide-to-Mrauk-U-An-Ancient-City-of-Rakhaing-Myanmar}}</ref>

King Min Saw Mon ceded some territory to the Sultan of Bengal and recognised his sovereignty over the areas. In recognition of his kingdom's [[vassal state|vassal]] status, the Buddhist kings of Arakan received Islamic titles and used the Bengali [[gold dinar]] within the kingdom. Min Saw Mon minted his own coins with the [[Burmese alphabet]] on one side and the [[Persian alphabet]] on the other.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|p=23}}

Arakan's vassalage to Bengal was brief. After Sultan [[Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah]]'s death in 1433, Narameikhla's successors invaded Bengal and occupied [[Ramu Upazila|Ramu]] in 1437 and Chittagong in 1459. Arakan would hold Chittagong until 1666.<ref name="app-78">Phayre 1883: 78</ref><ref name="geh-140-141">Harvey 1925: 140–141</ref>

Even after independence from the Sultans of Bengal, the Arakanese kings continued the custom of maintaining Muslim titles.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|pp=23–24}} The Buddhist kings compared themselves to [[Sultan]]s and fashioned themselves after [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers. They also continued to employ Muslims in prestigious positions within the royal administration.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|p=24}} Some of them worked as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[scribe]]s in the Arakanese courts, which, despite remaining Buddhist, adopted Islamic fashions from the neighbouring Bengal Sultanate.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|p=24}}{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|p=398}}

===Burmese conquest===
Following the [[Konbaung Dynasty]]'s conquest of Arakan in 1785, as many as 35,000 people of the Rakhine State fled to the neighbouring [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong region]] of British Bengal in 1799 to escape persecution by the [[Bamar people|Bamar]] and to seek protection under the [[British Raj]].{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|pp=398–9}} The Bamar executed thousands of men and deported a considerable portion of people from Rakhine population to central Burma, leaving Arakan a scarcely populated area by the time the British occupied it.{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|p=399}}

According to an article on the "''Burma'' Empire" published by the British [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] in 1799, "the ''[[Mohammedan]]s'', who have long settled in ''Arakan''", "call themselves ''Rooinga'', or natives of ''Arakan''".<ref name="buchanan_burma" /> However, according to Derek Tokin, Hamilton no longer used the term to refer to the Muslims in Arakan in his later publications.<ref name=Derek /> [[Sir Henry Yule]] saw many Muslims serving as [[eunuch]]s in [[Konbaung]] while on a diplomatic mission to the Burmese capital, Ava.<ref>Thant Myint-U (2007), p. 126 {{Google books|tsTOKi8l1ywC|The River of Lost Footsteps: Histories of Burma|page=126}}</ref>{{Sfn|Yegar|1972|p=10}}

British policy encouraged Bengali inhabitants from adjacent regions to migrate into the then lightly populated and fertile valleys of Arakan as farm labourers. The [[East India Company]] extended the [[Bengal Presidency]] to Arakan. There was no international boundary between Bengal and Arakan and no restrictions on migration between the regions. In the early 19th century, thousands of Bengalis from the Chittagong region settled in Arakan seeking work.{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|p=403}}  It is hard to know whether these new Bengal migrants were the same population that was deported by force to Bengal's Chittagong during the Burmese conquest in the 18th century and later returned to Arakan as a result of British policy or they were a new migrant population with no ancestral roots to Arakan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmandala.org/the-rohingya-and-national-identities-in-burma/ |title=Rohingya and national identities in Burma |website=New Mandala |date=22 September 2014 |access-date=22 December 2017}}</ref>

The British census of 1872 reported 58,255 Muslims in Akyab District. By 1911, the Muslim population had increased to 178,647.{{Sfn|Aye Chan|2005|p=401}} The waves of migration were primarily due to the requirement of cheap labour from British India to work in the paddy fields. Immigrants from Bengal, mainly from the Chittagong region, "moved en masse into western townships of Arakan". Albeit Indian immigration to Burma was a nationwide phenomenon, not just restricted to Arakan.<ref name=tmu-2006-185-187>Myint-U 2006: 185–187</ref> For these reasons historians believed that most Rohingyas arrived with the British colonialists in the 19th and 20th centuries with some tracing their ancestry much further.{{Sfn|Leider|2013|pp=210-211}}

According to [[Thant Myint-U]], historian and adviser to President [[Thein Sein]], "At the beginning of the 20th century, Indians were arriving in Burma at the rate of no less than a quarter million per year. The numbers rose steadily until the peak year of 1927, immigration reached 480,000 people, with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world. This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year." By then, in most of the largest cities in Burma, [[Rangoon]], [[Akyab]], [[Pathein|Bassein]] and [[Moulmein]], the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. All of Burma was officially a [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|Province]] within the [[British Raj|British Indian Empire]] ('the Raj') from November 1885 until 1937, when Burma became a separate [[Crown colony]] within the [[British Empire]]. The Burmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a "racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear".<ref name="tmu-2006-185-187" /> Professor Andrew Selth of [[Griffith University]] writes that although a few Rohingya trace their ancestry to Muslims who lived in Arakan in the 15th and 16h centuries, most Rohingyas arrived with the British colonialists in the 19th and 20th centuries.{{Sfn|Leider|2013|p=7}}<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Burma's Muslims: Terrorists or Terrorised?|last=Selth|first=Andrew |publisher=Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, Australian National University|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7315-5437-9|location=Australia|page=7}}</ref> Most have argued that Rohingya existed from the four waves of Muslim migrations from the ancient times to medieval, to the British colony.

Christie, "The issue became a focus for grass-roots Burmese nationalism, and in the years 1930–31 there were serious anti-Indian disturbances in Lower Burma, while 1938 saw riots specifically directed against the Indian Muslim community. As Burmese nationalism increasingly asserted itself before the Second World War, the 'alien' Indian presence inevitably came under attack, along with the religion that the Indian Muslims imported. The Muslims of northern Arakan were to be caught in the crossfire of this conflict."<ref>{{cite book|first=Clive J. |last=Christie|title=A Modern History of Southeast Asia: Decolonization, Nationalism and Separatism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehCWYZ13SPsC&pg=PA164|date=15 February 1998|publisher=I.B.

In the 1931 census, the Muslim population of Burma was 584,839, 4% of the total population of 14,647,470 at the time. 396,504 were Indian Muslims and 1,474 Chinese Muslims, while 186,861 were Burmese Muslims. The census found a growth in the number of Indian Muslims born in Burma, primarily due to their permanent settlement in Akyab. 41% of Muslims of Burma lived in Arakan at that time.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|p=385}}

During World War II, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) invaded [[British rule in Burma|British-controlled Burma]]. The British forces retreated and in the power vacuum left behind, considerable inter-communal violence erupted between Arakanese and Muslim villagers. The British armed Muslims in northern Arakan in order to create a buffer zone that would protect the region from a Japanese invasion when they retreated<ref name="Field-Marshal Viscount William Slim 2009">{{cite book|title=Defeat Into Victory: Battling Japan in Burma and India, 1942–1945|first=Field-Marshal Viscount William |last=Slim|year=2009|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn=978-0-330-50997-8}}</ref> and to counteract the largely pro-Japanese [[Rakhine people|ethnic Rakhines]].<ref name="auto" /> The period also witnessed violence between groups loyal to the British and the Burmese nationalists.<ref name="Field-Marshal Viscount William Slim 2009" /> The [[Arakan massacres in 1942]] involved [[communal violence]] between British-armed [[V Force]] Rohingya recruits and {{no-wrap|pro-Japanese Rakhines}}, polarising the region along ethnic lines.<ref name=":2" />

Tensions boiling in Arakan before the war erupted during the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia]] and Arakan became the frontline in the conflict. The war resulted in a complete breakdown of civil administration and consequent development of habits of lawlessness exacerbated by the availability of modern [[firearms]]. The Japanese advance triggered an inter-communal conflict between Muslims and Buddhists. The Muslims fled towards British-controlled Muslim-dominated northern Arakan from Japanese-controlled Buddhist-majority areas. This stimulated a "reverse ethnic cleansing" in British-controlled areas, particularly around Maungdaw. Failure of a British counter-offensive, attempted from December 1942 to April 1943, resulted in the abandonment of even more of the Muslim population as well as an increase in inter-communal violence.<ref name=CliveJ>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehCWYZ13SPsC&pg=PA165|title=A Modern History of Southeast Asia: Decolonization, Nationalism and Separatism|publisher=I.B.

Moshe Yegar, a [[research fellow]] at Truman Institute, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], noted that hostility had developed between the Muslims and the Buddhists who had brought about a similar hostility in other parts of Burma. This tension was let loose with the retreat of the British. With the approach of the Japanese into Arakan, the Buddhists instigated cruel measures against the Muslims. Thousands, though the exact number is unknown, fled from Buddhist-majority regions to eastern Bengal and northern Arakan with many being killed or dying of starvation. The Muslims in response conducted retaliatory raids from British-controlled areas, causing Buddhists to flee to southern Arakan.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|pp=33–35}}

Aye Chan, a historian at [[Kanda University of International Studies|Kanda University]] in Japan, has written that as a consequence of acquiring arms from the British during World War II, Rohingyas{{refn|The term was not used during this period.|group = note|name = term}} tried to destroy the Arakanese villages instead of resisting the Japanese. Chan agrees that hundreds of Muslims fled to northern Arakan, though states that the accounts of atrocities on them were exaggerated. In March 1942, Rohingyas from northern Arakan killed around 20,000 Arakanese. In return, around 5,000 Muslims in the [[Minbya Township|Minbya]] and [[Mrauk-U Township]]s were killed by Rakhines and [[Red Karen]]s.<ref name=kzt>{{cite web |title=Background of Rohingya Problem |author=Kyaw Zan Tha, MA |date=July 2008 |page=1 |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/12964670/Background-of-Rohingya-Problem |via=Scribd}}</ref><ref name="aye-chan">{{cite journal|last=Chan ([[Kanda University of International Studies]])|first=Aye|date=Autumn 2005|title=The Development of a Muslim Enclave in Arakan (Rakhine) State of Burma (Myanmar)|journal=[[SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research]]|volume=3|issue=2|pages=396–420|issn=1479-8484 |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64388.pdf|access-date=3 July 2013}}</ref>

====Pakistan Movement====
During the [[Pakistan Movement]] in the 1940s, Rohingya Muslims in western Burma organised a separatist movement to merge the region into [[East Pakistan]].{{Sfn|Yegar|1972|p=10}} The commitments of the British regarding the status of Muslims after the [[World War II|war]] are not clear. V Force officers like Andrew Irwin felt that Muslims along with other minorities must be rewarded for their loyalty. Muslim leaders believed that the British had promised them a "Muslim National Area" in Maungdaw region. They were also apprehensive of a future Buddhist-dominated government. In 1946, calls were made for annexation of the territory by Pakistan as well as of an independent state.<ref name=CliveJ />{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|pp=33–35}} Before the [[Burma Campaign|independence]] of Burma in January 1948, Muslim leaders from Arakan addressed themselves to [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of Pakistan, and asked his assistance in incorporating the Mayu region to [[Pakistan]] considering their religious affinity and geographical proximity with East Pakistan.{{Sfn|Yegar|1972|p=10}} The North Arakan Muslim League was founded in Akyab (modern Sittwe) two months later.{{Sfn|Yegar|1972|p=10}} The proposal never materialised since it was reportedly turned down by Jinnah, saying that he was not in a position to interfere in Burmese matters.{{Sfn|Yegar|1972|p=10}}

====Post-WWII migration====
The numbers and the extent of post-independence immigration from [[Bangladesh]] are subject to controversy and debate. In a 1955 study published by [[Stanford University]], the authors Virginia Thompson and Richard Adloff write, "The post-war (World War II) illegal immigration of Chittagonians into that area was on a vast scale, and in the Maungdaw and Buthidaung areas they replaced the Arakanese."<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Minority Problems in Southeast Asia|last1=Adloff|first1=Richard|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1955|location=United States|page=154|last2=Thompson|first2=Virginia}}</ref> The authors further argue that the term ''Rohingya, ''in the form of ''Rwangya, ''first appeared to distinguish settled population from newcomers: "The newcomers were called Mujahids (crusaders), in contrast to the Rwangya or settled Chittagonian population."<ref name=":6" /> According to the [[International Crisis Group]] (ICG), these immigrants were actually the Rohingyas who were displaced by World War II and began to return to Arakan after the independence of Burma but were rendered as illegal immigrants, while many were not allowed to return.{{Sfn|Crisis Group|2014|p=i}} ICG adds that there were "some 17,000" refugees from the Bangladesh liberation war who "subsequently returned home".{{Sfn|Crisis Group|2014|p=i}}

===Burmese independence===
[[File:M. A. Gaffar Rohingya.jpg|thumb|200px|[[M. A. Gaffar]], a member of Burma's constituent assembly, called for recognising Rohingyas in 1948]]
On 25 September 1954, the then Prime Minister U Nu in his radio address to the nation talked about Rohingya Muslims’ political loyalty to predominantly Buddhist Burma. This usage of the term ‘Rohingya’ is important in the sense that today Myanmar denies to accept this category altogether and calls them ’Bengali’. During the same time a separate administrative zone May Yu was established comprising most of the present North Rakhine State, which had Rohingya as its majority ethnic group. One of the objectives of this Muslim majority zone was to ‘strive for peace with Pakistan’. Brigadier Aung Gyi,  one of the deputies of General Ne Win, in 1961 explained Rohingya as; “On the west, May Yu district borders with Pakistan. As is the case with all borderlands communities, there are Muslims on both sides of the borders. Those who are on Pakistan’s side are known as Pakistani while the Muslims on our Burmese side of the borders are referred to as ‘Rohingya’.<ref name="Salim"/> But since [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|Burma's military junta]] took control of the country in 1962, the Rohingya have been systematically deprived of their political rights.<ref name="rfa.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/multimedia/rohingyaPage-04122010151733.html/RohingyaFactSheet-04132010102750.html|title=Who are the Rohingya?|publisher=Radio Free Asia}}</ref> In 1962 military dictator General Ne Win, took over the government and started implementing a Nationalist agenda, which had its roots in racial discrimination. In 1978 military government launched operation Nagamin to separate nationals from non-nationals. This was the first concerted large scale violent attack on Rohingya. National Registration Cards (NRC) were taken away by state actors never to be replaced. Violence that followed forced 200,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. Bangladesh denied Rohingya admission into her territory and blocked food rations leading to death of 12,000 of them. After bilateral negotiations Rohingya were repatriated.<ref name="Salim"/>

====Rohingya political participation in Burma====
In the prelude to independence, two Rohingyas were elected to the [[Legislature of Burma|Constituent Assembly of Burma]] in 1947, [[M. A. Gaffar]] and [[Sultan Ahmed (Parliamentary Secretary)|Sultan Ahmed]]. After Burma became independent in 1948, M. A. Gaffar presented a [[memorandum]] of appeal to the Government of the [[Union of Burma]] calling for the recognition of the term "Rohingya", based on local Indian names of Arakan (Rohan and Rohang), as the official name of the ethnicity. Sultan Ahmed, who served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Minorities, was a member of the Justice [[Ba U|Sir Ba U]] Commission charged with exploring whether Arakan Division should be granted statehood. During the [[1951 Burmese general election]], five Rohingyas were elected to the [[Parliament of Burma]], including one of the country's first two female MPs, [[Zura Begum]]. Six MPs were elected during the [[1956 Burmese general election]] and subsequent [[by-election]]s. [[Sultan Mahmud (minister)|Sultan Mahmud]], a former politician in British India, became Minister of Health in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Burma]] [[U Nu]]. In 1960, Mahmud suggested that either Rohingya-majority northern Arakan remain under the central government or be made a separate province. However, during the [[1960 Burmese general election]], Prime Minister U Nu's pledges included making all of Arakan into one province. The [[1962 Burmese coup d'état]]  ended the country's [[Westminster]]-style political system. The 1982 Burmese citizenship law stripped most of the Rohingyas of their stake in citizenship.

Rohingya community leaders were supportive of the [[8888 uprising]] for democracy. During the [[1990 Burmese general election]], the Rohingya-led [[Democracy and Human Rights Party|National Democratic Party for Human Rights]] won four seats in the Burmese parliament. The four Rohingya MPs included [[Shamsul Anwarul Huq]], [[Chit Lwin Ebrahim]], [[Fazal Ahmed]] and [[Nur Ahmed]]. The election was won by the [[National League for Democracy]] led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who was placed under house arrest and not permitted to become prime minister. The [[State Law and Order Restoration Council|Burmese military junta]] banned the National Democratic Party for Human Rights in 1992. Its leaders were arrested, jailed and tortured.

Rohingya politicians have been jailed to disbar them from contesting elections. In 2005, Shamsul Anwarul Huq was charged under Section 18 of the controversial 1982 Burmese citizenship law and sentenced to 47 years in prison. In 2015, a ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party MP [[Shwe Maung (politician)|Shwe Maung]] was disbarred from the [[2015 Burmese general election]], on grounds that his parents were not Burmese citizens under the 1982 citizenship law.<ref>{{cite news |date=24 August 2015 |title=Sitting Rohingya MP in Myanmar plans to appeal election ban |first=Timothy |last=Mclaughlin |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics/sitting-rohingya-mp-in-myanmar-plans-to-appeal-election-ban-idUSKCN0QT1A920150824}}</ref>

As of 2017, Burma does not have a single Rohingya MP and the Rohingya population have no [[voting right]]s.<ref>{{cite news |first=Poppy |last=McPherson |date=2 November 2015 |title=No vote, no candidates: Myanmar's Muslims barred from their own election |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/03/no-vote-no-candidates-myanmars-muslims-barred-from-their-own-election}}</ref>

===Mayu Frontier District===
{{Main|Mayu Frontier District}}
A separate administrative zone for the Rohingya-majority northern areas of Arakan existed between 1961 and 1964. Known as the [[Mayu Frontier District]], the zone was set up by Prime Minister U Nu after the 1960 Burmese general election, on the advice of his health minister Sultan Mahmud. The zone was administered directly from [[Rangoon]] by the national government. After the Burmese military coup in 1962, the zone was administered by the Burmese army. It was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1964 by the [[Union Revolutionary Council]]. The socialist military government inducted the zone into Arakan State in 1974.

===Expulsion of Burmese Indians===
[[Racism]] towards people with links to the Indian subcontinent increased after the 1962 Burmese coup. The [[Burmese Way to Socialism|socialist military government]] nationalised all property, including many enterprises of the white collar Burmese Indian community. Between 1962 and 1964, 320,000 Burmese Indians were forced to leave the country.<ref name="EmberEmber2004">{{cite book|author1=Melvin Ember|author2=Carol R.

===Refugee crisis of 1978===
As a result of [[Operation King Dragon]] by the Burmese junta, the first wave of Rohingya refugees entered Bangladesh in 1978. An estimated 200,000 Rohingyas took shelter in Cox's Bazaar. Diplomatic initiatives over 16 months resulted in a repatriation agreement, which allowed the return of most refugees under a process facilitated by [[UNHCR]].<ref name="burmalibrary.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs/Abrar-repatriation.htm|title=Repatriation of Rohingya Refugees|website=burmalibrary.org |access-date=8 January 2020}}</ref> The return of refugees to Burma has been the second largest repatriation process in Asia after the return of Cambodian refugees from Thailand.<ref name="burmalibrary.org" />

===1982 Citizenship Law===
In 1982, the [[Myanmar nationality law|citizenship law]] enacted by the [[Military of Burma|Burmese military junta]] did not list the Rohingya as one of the 135 "[[Ethnic groups in Myanmar|national races]]"  of Burma. This made much of the Rohingya population in Burma [[Statelessness|stateless]] in their historical homeland of [[Arakan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/bangladesh-plight-rohingya |title=Bangladesh: The Plight of the Rohingya |date=18 September 2012}}</ref> General Ne Win drafted Citizenship Act in 1982, which denied citizenship rights to any community/group that was not listed in a survey conducted by British in 1824. All other ethnic groups were considered aliens to the land or invaders. Eight major ethnicities Arakan, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Kayah, Mon, Shan, and Burmese were broken into 135 small ethnic groups. Groups like Rohingya who do not belong to any of these 135 ethnicities were denied citizenship rights. Taking into account just one survey for defining the history of a group of people is highly problematic. It overlooks the fact that Rohingya were mentioned in records earlier to this survey.

Scholars like Maung Zarni have argued that Burmese military ‘encoded its anti-Indian and anti-Muslim racism in its laws and policies’. He further argues;

“The 1982 Citizenship Act serves as the state’s legal and ideological foundation on which all forms of violence, execution, restrictions, and human rights crimes are justified and committed with state impunity if carried out horizontally by the local ultra-nationalist Rakhine Buddhists.

In light of the on-the-ground link between the legalised removal of citizenship from the Rohingya and the implementation of a permanent set of draconian laws and policies—as opposed to periodic “anti-immigration” operations—amount to the infliction on the Rohingya of conditions of life designed to bring about serious bodily and mental harm and to destroy the group in whole or in part. As such, the illegalisation of the Rohingya in Myanmar is an indication of the intent of the State to both remove the Rohingya permanently from their homeland and to destroy the Rohingya as a group.”<ref name="Salim"/>

===Refugee crisis of 1991–1992===
After Burmese military junta began persecuting the political opposition following [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s victory in the [[1990 Myanmar general election|1990 election]] and the earlier [[1988 Uprising]], military operations targeting Muslims (who strongly favoured the pro-democracy movement) began in Arakan State. The Rohingya-led [[Democracy and Human Rights Party|NDPHR]] political party was banned and its leaders were jailed. Suu Kyi herself was placed under house arrest by the junta led by General [[Than Shwe]].

As the Burmese military increased its operations across the country, the Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung townships in northern Arakan became centers of persecution. The 23rd and 24th&nbsp;regiments of the [[Tatmadaw]] (Myanmar Army) were responsible for promoting [[forced labour]], [[rape]], the confiscation of houses, land and farm animals, the destruction of mosques, a ban on religious activities and the harassment of the religious priests.<ref name="burmalibrary.org" /> An estimated 250,000&nbsp;refugees crossed over into Bangladesh.<ref name="burmalibrary.org" /> In Bangladesh, the refugee influx was a challenge for the newly elected government of the country's first female prime minister [[Khaleda Zia]] (who headed the first parliamentary government since 1975). Both Bangladesh and Burma mobilised thousands of troops along the border during the crisis. The government of Bangladesh emphasised a peaceful resolution of the crisis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/12/26/Bangladesh-plays-down-border-tension-with-Burma/2847693723600/ |title=Bangladesh plays down border tension with Burma |publisher=[[United Press International]]|access-date=8 January 2020 |date=26 December 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/12/24/Bangladesh-builds-up-troops-on-Burmese-border/1382693550800/ |title=Bangladesh builds up troops on Burmese border |publisher=United Press International |access-date=8 January 2020 |date=24 December 1991}}</ref>

===Name change from Arakan to Rakhine State===
In 1989, the junta officially changed the name of Burma to [[Myanmar]]. In the 1990s, the junta changed the name of the province of Arakan to [[Rakhine State]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arakanese |series=Arakanese |title=Definition, Location, & Ancient Kingdom |access-date=8 January 2020}}</ref> which showed a bias towards the [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] community, even though the Rohingya formed a substantial part of the population. The name of the region was historically known as [[Arakan]] for centuries.

====Denial of the "Rohingya" term====
The colloquial term ''Rohingya'' can be traced back to the pre-colonial period. The Rohingya community have also been known as Arakanese Indians and Arakanese Muslims.<ref>{{cite book |first=Clive J. |last=Christie |title=A Modern History of Southeast Asia: Decolonization, Nationalism and Separatism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehCWYZ13SPsC&pg=PA165|date=15 February 1998 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-354-5 |page=165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Colin Clarke |author2=Ceri Peach |author3=Steven Vertovec |date=26 October 1990 |title=South Asians Overseas: Migration and Ethnicity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=46 |isbn=978-0-521-37543-6}}</ref> Since the 1982 [[Myanmar nationality law|citizenship law]], Burmese juntas and governments have strongly objected to the usage of the term of Rohingya, preferring to label the community as "bengali illegal immigrants".

===Conflict in Arakan===
The Rakhine for their part felt discriminated against by the governments in Rangoon dominated by the ethnic Burmese with one Rakhine politician saying, "we are therefore the victims of Muslimisation and Burmese chauvinism."<ref name="Economist1" /> ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in 2015 that from the 1940s on and right to this day, the Burmens have seen and see themselves as victims of the [[British Empire]] while the Rakhine see themselves as victims of the British and the Burmens; both groups were and are so intent upon seeing themselves as victims that neither has much sympathy for the Rohingyas.<ref name="Economist1" />

After Jinnah's refusal to accept northern Arakan into the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], some Rohingya elders who supported a ''[[jihad]]'' movement, founded the ''Mujahid'' party in northern Arakan in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Talibanization of Southeast Asia: Losing the War on Terror to Islamist Extremists |first=Bilveer |last=Singh |year=2007 |page=42 |isbn=978-0-275-99995-7}}</ref> The aim of the Mujahid party was to create an autonomous [[Islamic state]] in Arakan. By the 1950s, they began to use the term "Rohingya" which may be a continuation of the term Rooinga to establish a distinct identity and identify themselves as indigenous. They were much more active before the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état]] by [[Ne Win|General Ne Win]], a Burmese general who began his military career fighting for the Japanese in World War II. Ne Win carried out military operations against them over a period of two decades. The prominent one was [[King Dragon operation in Arakan|Operation King Dragon]], which took place in 1978; as a result, many Muslims in the region fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as refugees.<ref>"Burma/Bangladesh: Burmese Refugees In Bangladesh - Historical Background".

From 1971 to 1978, a number of Rakhine monks and Buddhists staged hunger strikes in Sittwe to force the government to tackle immigration issues which they believed to be causing a demographic shift in the region.<ref>{{cite book |title=Civil Insurgency in Burma|last=Aung |first=Thit |publisher=Ministry of Information |year=1988 |location=Yangon |page=30}}</ref> Ne Win's government requested UN to repatriate the war refugees and launched military operations which drove off around 200,000&nbsp;people to Bangladesh. In 1978, the Bangladesh government protested against the Burmese government concerning "the expulsion by force of thousands of Burmese Muslim citizens to Bangladesh". The Burmese government responded that those expelled were Bangladesh citizens who had resided illegally in Burma. In July 1978, after intensive negotiations mediated by UN, Ne Win's government agreed to take back 200,000 refugees who settled in Arakan.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|p=56}} In the same year as well as in 1992, a joint statement by governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh "acknowledged that the Rohingya were lawful Burmese residents".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://intpolicydigest.org/2017/02/06/burma-hypocrisy-clashes-morality/ |title=Burma: Where Hypocrisy Clashes with Morality |first=Cynthia |last=Lardner |date=6 February 2017 |website=International Policy Digest}}</ref> In 1982, the Burmese government enacted the citizenship law and declared the "Bengalis" are foreigners.{{Sfn|Yegar|2002|p=59}}

There are widespread beliefs among Rakhine people that significant number of immigrants arrived even after the 1980s when the border was relatively unguarded. However, there is no documentation proof for these claims as the last census was conducted in 1983.<ref name=":5" /> Successive Burmese governments have fortified the border and built up border guard forces.

===After 1988 Burmese pro-democracy uprising===
Since the 1990s, a new 'Rohingya' movement which is distinct from the 1950s armed rebellion has emerged. The new movement is characterised by lobbying internationally by overseas diaspora, establishing indigenous claims by Rohingya scholars, publicising the term "Rohingya" and denying Bengali origins by Rohingya politicians.<ref name=":7" />

Rohingya scholars{{who|date=March 2018}} have claimed that Rakhine was previously an Islamic state for a millennium, or that Muslims were king-makers of Rakhine kings for 350 years. They often traced the origin of Rohingyas to Arab seafarers. These claims have been rejected as "newly invented myths" in academic circles.<ref name=":4" /> Some Rohingya politicians have labelled Burmese and international historians as "Rakhine sympathizers" for rejecting the purported historical origins.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17724-un-under-fire-over-resident-coordinator-s-advisor-on-rakhine/17724-un-under-fire-over-resident-coordinator-s-advisor-on-rakhine |title=UN under fire over resident coordinator's advisor on Rakhine |last=McLaughlin |first=Tim |date=13 February 2015 |work=Mizzima.com |access-date=20 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219214055/http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/17724-un-under-fire-over-resident-coordinator-s-advisor-on-rakhine/17724-un-under-fire-over-resident-coordinator-s-advisor-on-rakhine |archive-date=19 February 2015 }}</ref>

The movement has garnered sharp criticisms from ethnic Rakhines and Kamans, the latter of whom are a recognised Muslim ethnic group in Rakhine. Kaman leaders support citizenship for Muslims in northern Rakhine but believe that the new movement is aimed at achieving a self-administered area or Rohang State as a separate [[Islamic state]] carved out of Rakhine, and condemn the movement.{{Sfn|Crisis Group|2014|p=23}}

Rakhines' views are more critical. Citing Bangladesh's overpopulation and density, Rakhines perceive the Rohingyas as "the vanguard of an unstoppable wave of people that will inevitably engulf Rakhine".{{Sfn|Crisis Group|2014|p=14}} However, for moderate Rohingyas, the aim may have been no more than to gain citizenship status. Moderate Rohingya politicians agree to compromise on the term Rohingya if citizenship is provided under an alternative identity that is neither "Bengali" nor "Rohingya". Various alternatives including "Rakhine Muslims", "Myanmar Muslims" or simply "Myanmar" have been proposed.<ref name="Derek" />{{Sfn|Crisis Group|2014|p=32}}

===Burmese juntas (1990–2011)===
The military junta that ruled Myanmar for half a century relied heavily on mixing Burmese nationalism and [[Theravada]] Buddhism to bolster its rule, and, in the view of the US government, heavily discriminated against minorities like the Rohingyas. Some pro-democracy dissidents from Myanmar's ethnic Bamar majority do not consider the Rohingyas compatriots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/east-asia-beat/rohingya-06122012225150.html |title=Violence Throws Spotlight on Rohingya |publisher=Radio Free Asia |access-date=18 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=nyt-20120712>{{cite news |first=Moshahida Sultana |last=Ritu |date=12 July 2012 |title=Ethnic Cleansing in Myanmar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/opinion/ethnic-cleansing-of-myanmars-rohingyas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=13 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Hanna |last=Hindström |date=25 July 2012 |title=Burma's monks call for Muslim community to be shunned |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burmas-monks-call-for-muslim-community-to-be-shunned-7973317.html |newspaper=The Independent }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=Hanna |last=Hindström |date=14 June 2012 |title=The Freedom to Hate |magazine=Foreign Policy |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/06/14/the_freedom_to_hate}}</ref>

The [[2012 Rakhine State riots]] were a series of conflicts between Rohingya Muslims who form the majority in the northern Rakhine and ethnic Rakhines who form the majority in the south.

====Autumn 2017 crisis====
{{main|Northern Rakhine State clashes}}

Starting in early August 2017, the Myanmar security forces began "clearance operations" against the Rohingya in northern Rakhine state.<ref name="ohchr_mission_report_2017_10_11_un" /><ref name="un_report_details_2017_10_11_reuters_guardian" /> Following an attack by Rohingya militants of [[Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army]] (ARSA) against several security forces' outposts, 25 August, the operations escalated radically—killing thousands of Rohingya, brutalising thousands more, and driving hundreds of thousands out of the country into neighbouring Bangladesh while their villages burned—with the Myanmar military claiming that their actions were solely attacks on rebels in response to the ARSA attack. However, subsequent reports from various international organisations have indicated that the military operations were widespread indiscriminate attacks on the Rohingya population, already underway before the ARSA attacks, to purge northern Rakhine state of Rohingya, through "[[ethnic cleansing]]" and/or "[[genocide]]."<ref name="could_suu_kyi_face_charges_2017_12_18_bbc">Rowlatt, Justin [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42335018 "Could Aung San Suu Kyi face Rohingya genocide charges?"], 18 December 2017, ''[[BBC Panorama]]'', [[BBC]].

=====Precipitating events=====
According to [[BBC]] reporters, during the summer of 2017, the Myanmar military began arming and training Rakhine Buddhist natives in northern Rakhine state, and in late summer advised that any ethnic Rakhines "wishing to protect their state" would be given the opportunity to join "the local armed police." Matthew Smith, chief executive of human rights organisation [[Fortify Rights]] says that arming the Rakhines "was a decision made to effectively perpetrate atrocity crimes against the civilian population."  At the same time, northern Rakhine state faced food shortages, and, starting in mid-August, the government cut off all food supply to the area. On 10 August, the military flew in a battalion of reinforcements to the area, triggering a public warning from the resident United Nations human rights representative to Myanmar, who urged Myanmar authorities to restrain themselves.<ref name="could_suu_kyi_face_charges_2017_12_18_bbc" />

A few weeks later, on 24 August 2017, the Rakhine Commission (chaired by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan)—established by the new civilian Myanmar government to recommend solutions to the ethnic conflict and related issues in Rakhine state—released its recommendations for alleviating the suffering of minorities (especially the Rohingya), calling for measures that would improve security in Myanmar for the Rohingya, but not calling for all measures sought by various Rohingya factions.<ref name="un_sc_condemns_2017_09_13_abc">[https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-myanmar-forms-committee-rohingya-49812947  "The Latest: UN Security Council condemns Rohingya violence,"] 13 September 2017, [[ABC News]].

=====Conflict escalation=====

Almost immediately the Myanmar military—apparently teaming with local authorities with mobs of Rakhine Buddhist civilians—launched massive reprisals that it described as its anti-terrorist "clearance operations" (which, UN investigators and BBC reporters later determined, had actually begun earlier<ref name="ohchr_mission_report_2017_10_11_un" /><ref name="un_report_details_2017_10_11_reuters_guardian" /><ref name="could_suu_kyi_face_charges_2017_12_18_bbc" />)—attacking Rohingya villages throughout northern Rakhine state.<ref name="un_sc_condemns_2017_09_13_abc" /><ref name="indian_pm_blames_terrorists_2017_09_17_cnn" /><ref name="un_chief_sc_call_2017_09_17_reuters" /><ref name="perilous_path_2017_09_05_ap_fox_news" />

Within the first three weeks, the military reported over 400 dead (whom it described as mostly "militants" and "terrorists")—the U.N. estimated over 1,000 dead (mostly civilians), and other sources initially suggested as many as 3,000—in the first four weeks of the reprisals.<ref name="un_sc_condemns_2017_09_13_abc" /><ref name="indian_pm_blames_terrorists_2017_09_17_cnn" /><ref name="un_chief_sc_call_2017_09_17_reuters" /><ref name="perilous_path_2017_09_05_ap_fox_news" />

However, in December 2017, following a detailed survey of Rohingya refugees, a humanitarian organisation serving refugees, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] calculated that at least 6,700 Rohingya men, women and children were killed in the first month of the major attacks, including at least 750 children (that number later revised to "over 1,000"). MSF estimated that 69% were killed by gunshots, 9% were burnt to death (including 15% of children killed), and 5% beaten to death. However, MSF cautioned "The numbers of deaths are likely to be an underestimation, as we have not surveyed all refugee settlements in Bangladesh and because the surveys don't account for the families who never made it out of Myanmar."<ref name="msf_estimates_6700_killed_2017_12_14_bbc">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42348214 "MSF estimates more than 6,700 Rohingya killed in Myanmar,"] 14 December 2017, ''[[BBC News]]''.

Refugees reported numerous civilians—including women and children—being indiscriminately beaten, raped, tortured, shot, hacked to death or burned alive. and whole villages being burnt down by authorities and Buddhist mobs. Human Rights Watch released satellite photos showing the villages burning, but the Myanmar government insisted the fires were lit by Rohingya, themselves, or specifically Rohingya militants—though the authorities offered no proof of the allegation, and refused or tightly controlled all media and foreign access to the area.<ref name="un_sc_condemns_2017_09_13_abc" /><ref name="rohingya_in_myanmar_2017_09_13_ny_times" /><ref name="un_chief_sc_call_2017_09_17_reuters" /><ref name="perilous_path_2017_09_05_ap_fox_news" /><ref name="bleak_future_2017_09_17_us_news" />

Myanmar's presidential spokesman reported that 176 ethnic Rohingya villages—out of the original a total of 471 Rohingya villages in three townships—had become empty.  In addition to the 176 "abandoned" villages, some residents reportedly fled from at least 34 other villages.<ref name="un_sc_condemns_2017_09_13_abc" />

In the first four weeks of the conflict, over 400,000 Rohingya refugees (approximately 40% of the remaining Rohingya in Myanmar) fled the country on foot or by boat (chiefly to Bangladesh—the only other country bordering the Rakhine state area under attack) creating a major [[humanitarian crisis]]. In addition, 12,000 Rakhine Buddhists, and other non-Muslim Rakhine state residents were displaced within the country.<ref name="rohingya_in_myanmar_2017_09_13_ny_times" /><ref name="un_chief_sc_call_2017_09_17_reuters" />

On 10 September 2017, ARSA declared a temporary unilateral [[ceasefire]] to allow aid groups to work in the region. Its statement read that "ARSA strongly encourages all concerned humanitarian actors resume their humanitarian assistance to all victims of the humanitarian crisis, irrespective of ethnic or religious background during the ceasefire period."

The [[U.N. Secretary General]] issued a statement, 13 September 2017, implying that the situation facing the Rohingya in Rakhine state was "[[ethnic cleansing]]." He urged Myanmar authorities to suspend military action and stop the violence—insisting that Myanmar's government uphold the rule of law, and (noting that "380,000" Rohingya had recently fled to Bangladesh) recognise the refugees' right to return to their homes.<ref name="un_chief_sc_call_2017_09_17_reuters" /><ref name="un_condemns_20170913_abc_news" />

But Suu Kyi largely defended her prior position supporting the Myanmar military and its actions, and deflected international criticism by saying most Rohingya villages remained intact, and conflict had not broken out everywhere. Expressing no criticism of the Myanmar military, and denying that it had engaged in any "armed clashes or clearance operations" since 5 September, she added, "We are committed to the restoration of peace and stability and rule of law throughout the state," and that the country was "committed to a sustainable solution… for all communities in this state", but was vague as to how that would be achieved.<ref name="assk_breaks_silence_2017_09_18_cnn" /><ref name="suu_kyi_does_not_fear_2017_09_19_bbc">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41315924 "Rohingya crisis: Suu Kyi does not fear global 'scrutiny',"] 19 September 2017, ''[[BBC News]]''.

By the end of September, conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and outnumbered Hindus, became apparent—including the [[Kha Maung Seik massacre|killing of around 100 Hindu villagers in Rakhine state]], around late August—according to the Myanmar military who claimed to have found the bodies of 20 women and eight boys in mass graves, 24 September, after a search near Ye Baw Kya village, in northern Rakhine state. The search was reportedly in response to a refugee in Bangladesh who contacted a local Hindu leader in Myanmar. Authorities quoted the refugee as saying about 300 ARSA militants, on 25 August, marched about 100 people out of the Hindu village and killed them. ARSA denied involvement, saying it was committed to not killing civilians.

On 24 August 2018, the day before the anniversary of the eruption of extreme violence that came to be known as the "Rohingya Crisis," the office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a report (which was not made public until 27 August) which summarised its findings after an investigation was completed into the events of August–September 2017. It declared that the events constituted cause for the Myanmar government—particularly the Myanmar military (the "Tatmadaw") and its commanding officers—to be brought before the [[International Criminal Court]] and charged with "crimes against humanity", including "ethnic cleansing" and "genocide."

The following table shows the statistics of Muslim population in Arakan. The data is for all Muslims in Arakan (Rakhine), regardless of ethnicity. The data for Burmese 1802 census is taken from a book by [[John Sydenham Furnivall|J. S. Furnivall]]. The British censuses classified immigrants from Chittagong as Bengalis. There were a small number of immigrants from other parts of India. The 1941 census was lost during the war. The 1983 census conducted under the Ne Win's government omitted people in volatile regions. It is unclear how many were missed. British era censuses can be found at [[Digital Library of India]].

==Culture==
Rohingya culture shares many similarities to that of other ethnic groups in the region. The clothing worn by most Rohingyas is indistinguishable from those worn by other groups in Myanmar.<ref name="RohingyaCulture">{{cite web |title=Rohingyas: Their Culture |url=https://www.rohingya.ca/rohingyas-have-distinct-culture/ |publisher=Canadian Rohingya Development Initiative |access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref> Men wear ''bazu'' (long sleeved shirts) and ''longgi'' or ''doothi'' (loincloths) covering down to the ankles. Religious scholars prefer wearing ''kurutha'', ''jubba'' or ''panjabi'' (long tops). In special occasions, Rohingya men sometimes wear ''taikpon'' (collarless jackets) on top of their shirts.<ref name="RohingyaCulture"/>

''Lucifica'' is a type of flat bread regularly eaten by Rohingyas,<ref name="RohingyaCulture"/> while ''bola fica'' is a popular traditional snack made of [[rice noodles]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bolá Fiçá (Rohingya rice noodle snack) |url=https://www.rohingyalanguage.com/2016/03/bola-fica-rohingya-rice-noodle-snack.html |publisher=Rohingya Language Foundation |access-date=29 August 2019}}</ref> [[Betel]] leaves, colloquially known as ''faan'', are also popular amongst Rohingyas.<ref name="RohingyaCulture"/>

==Language==
{{Main|Rohingya language}}

The [[Rohingya language]] is part of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] sub-branch of the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]] and is related to the [[Chittagonian language]] spoken in the southernmost part of Bangladesh bordering Myanmar.<ref name="lan" /> While both Rohingya and Chittagonian are related to Bengali, they are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with the latter. Rohingyas do not speak Burmese, the ''lingua franca'' of Myanmar, and face problems in integration. Rohingya scholars have written the Rohingya language in various scripts including the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hanifi alphabet|Hanifi]], [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]], Roman, and [[Burmese alphabet]]s, where Hanifi is a newly developed alphabet derived from Arabic with the addition of four characters from Latin and Burmese.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who are the Rohingya?|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/multimedia/rohingyaPage-04122010151733.html/RohingyaFactSheet-04132010102750.html |publisher=Radio Free Asia|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref>

More recently, a Latin alphabet has been developed using all 26 English letters A to Z and two additional Latin letters Ç (for retroflex R) and Ñ (for nasal sound). To accurately represent Rohingya phonology, this alphabet also uses five accented vowels (áéíóú). It has been recognised by ISO with ISO 639-3 "rhg" code.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp?order=639_3&letter=r |title=ISO 639 code tables |publisher=Sil.org |access-date=18 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618154156/http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp?order=639_3&letter=r |archive-date=18 June 2011 }}</ref>

Muslims have often faced obstacles and struggled to practice their religion in the same way as other individuals in Burma. These struggles have manifested themselves in the form of difficulty in receiving approval for the construction of places of worship, whether they be informal or formal. In the past, they have also been arrested for teaching and practising their religious beliefs.<ref name=":8" />
