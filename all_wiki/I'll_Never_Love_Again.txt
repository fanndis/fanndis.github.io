==Background and composition==
[[File:Al Malaikah Temple - Shrine Auditorium, 655 W. Jefferson Blvd. University Park.jpg|thumb|"I'll Never Love Again" was filmed at Los Angeles' [[Shrine Auditorium]]]]
When Gaga was getting ready to film the final scene of ''A Star Is Born'', where she sings "I'll Never Love Again", the singer got a telephone call that her childhood friend Sonja Durham was in her last moments of [[Cancer staging|Stage IV cancer]]. Gaga left the set and drove to meet Durham, but she arrived ten minutes after her friend died. She asked Durham's husband if she should return to filming; he replied, "You've gotta do what Sonja would want you to do", so she returned to the set. Co-star and director Bradley Cooper was supportive of Gaga's loss but Gaga was adamant about finishing the scene, so she stepped on the set and sang "I'll Never Love Again". The singer said, "[Sonja] gave me a tragic gift that day and I took it with me to [the] set, and I sang that song for Jackson and for her on that very same day within an hour."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/lady-gaga-shares-story-behind-a-star-is-born-last-scene|title=The True Story Behind A Star Is Born's Final Scene Will Make You Cry All Over Again|last=Weiner|first=Zoe|date=October 10, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018|magazine=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]}}</ref>
