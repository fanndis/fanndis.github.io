'''Sidley Austin LLP''', formerly known as '''Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP''', is a general practice [[law firm]] based in the [[United States]], with a focus on expertise in transactional and [[litigation]] matters. The current firm was formed as the result of the 2001 merger of two predecessors: the Chicago-based '''Sidley & Austin''', founded in 1866, and the New York–based [[Brown & Wood]], founded in 1914.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sidley & Austin Plans To Merge With Wall Street Power |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-02-22/business/0102220061_1_sidley-austin-brown-wood-client-base |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=February 22, 2001}}</ref> The firm's headquarters is at [[One South Dearborn]] in [[Chicago]]'s [[Chicago Loop|Loop]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sidley.com/chicago/ |title=Chicago |publisher=Sidley Austin |accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

==History==

===Origins in Chicago===
The firm that was to become Sidley Austin was formed in Chicago in 1866 by Norman Williams and John Leverett Thompson as the partnership of Williams & Thompson.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Among the firm's first clients were the [[Pullman Company]], the manufacturer of specialty sleeping railway cars, and former first lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], then the widow of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Other early clients included [[Western Union]] Telegraph Company, which moved its Midwest headquarters from Cleveland to Chicago in 1869. After the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, the firm represented numerous insurance companies including [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]]. In 1892, William Pratt Sidley joined the firm after having earned an [[LLB]] from Union College of Law and a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Harvard Law School]]. By 1913, the firm's name was changed to Holt, Cutting & Sidley, although Sidley would be the guiding personality for the Chicago firm through the 20th century. Three years later—the firm then fifty years old—had four partners, four clerks (associates), and ten staff employees with gross income of around $100,000 (roughly $1.9 million in 2008 dollars).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Buffeted by the [[Great Depression]], the firm experienced a dramatic fall in revenues until the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s reinvigorated the capital markets. The firm represented [[Halsey, Stuart & Co.]], a Chicago-based [[underwriter]] in one of the first transactions under the [[Securities Act of 1933]]. In 1944, the name was changed to Sidley, Austin, Burgess & Harper and shortened to Sidley & Austin in 1967.

===Towards a national firm===
After the [[Second World War]], Sidley & Austin began expanding beyond its Chicago roots as many of its clients entered new markets. In 1963, its [[Washington, D.C.]] branch was established which would soon become an important player in that city's legal market through its representation of the [[American Medical Association]], [[American Bar Association]] and the International Minerals & Chemical Corporation. The firm developed strengths in antitrust and the representation of clients in front of the [[Federal Trade Commission]].

Sidley & Austin was among several law firms caught up in the [[Savings & Loan Crisis]] and paid $7.5 million to settle [[legal malpractice]] claims stemming from its representation of the [[Lincoln Savings and Loan Association]]. Such legal work was profiled in the book by [[Ralph Nader]] and Wesley J. Smith, ''No Contest: Corporate Lawyers and the Perversion of Justice in America''.

===Expansion and consolidation===
Sidley & Austin expanded significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1972, the firm merged with the 50 lawyers of Chicago firm Leibman, Williams, Bennett, Baird & Minow. Additional offices were then established in London, Los Angeles, Singapore and New York.

In 2001, the firm merged with [[Brown & Wood]], a New York-based law firm established in 1914 with 400 attorneys and additional domestic offices in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles and overseas branches in London, Beijing and Hong Kong (where it practiced English law in addition to U.S. law). Brown & Wood was known for its [[securities]], [[structured finance]] and [[securitization]] practices. The firm's well-regarded publication, ''Accessing the U.S. Capital Markets: An Introduction to United States Securities Law'', continues to be updated annually today. Brown & Wood had offices in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. The firm was known as Sidley Austin Brown & Wood until the name was rebranded as Sidley Austin in 2006.

===Appellate Practice Group===
In 1985, [[U.S. Solicitor General]] [[Rex E. Lee]] founded Sidley Austin's Appellate Practice Group to represent clients in all appellate courts, including the United States Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeals, and state appellate and supreme courts. Following Lee's death, the group was led by Carter Phillips, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any lawyer in private practice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sidley.com/services/appellate|title=Supreme Court and Appellate Practice|work=Sidley Austin}}</ref> and who now chairs the firm's executive committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/ca/PubArticleCA.jsp?id=1202598933636&Carter_Phillips_Named_Sole_Chair_of_Sidleys_Executive_Committee|title=Carter Phillips Named Sole Chair of Sidley's Executive Committee|author=Matthew Huisman|work=The Recorder}}</ref> The current co-chairs of the practice group are former Acting Attorney General [[Peter Keisler]] and former Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Joseph Guerra.

The Appellate Group has argued several landmark cases before the Supreme Court including ''[[U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton]]'' (constitutionality of state-imposed term limits on members of Congress), ''[[Missouri v. Jenkins]]'' (proper role of federal courts in imposing desegregation remedies), and ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (Commerce Clause challenge to a federal statute prohibiting the possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/benefactors/sidley_austin|title=Sidley Austin|publisher=oyez.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sidley.com/appellate/|title=Supreme Court and Appellate|publisher=sidley.com}}</ref> Directly or indirectly, Sidley Austin plays a role in 40 percent of the cases the Supreme Court hears every term. Over the last 30 years, its lawyers have argued 115 high court cases.<ref>[http://www.sidley.com/en/services/appellate Supreme Court and Appellate | Practice Areas | Services | Sidley Austin LLP<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On March 19, 2015 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] ruled that a client of Sidley Austin, [[AT&T Inc.]], filed its appeal too late in a patent infringement case, which cost AT&T its right to appeal a $40 million adverse judgment. The Federal Circuit held that a team of lawyers from the firm failed to file a notice of appeal within the requisite thirty days after a federal district court denied several post-trial motions. The court affirmed the district court's ruling that it was "troublesome" that none of the eighteen lawyers and assistants who received the electronic notices "bothered to read the orders issued by the court."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-court-rules-ts-lawyers-211348620.html| title=U.S. court rules AT&T's lawyers too late to appeal patent loss|date=March 19, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/14-1302.Opinion.3-17-2015.1.PDF|title=Two Way Media LLC v.

==Sidley Austin during the September 11 attacks==
The [[terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]] personally affected the employees of Sidley Austin. Prior to the merger creating Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, which took place just four months before the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the head office of Brown & Wood was in the World Trade Center, while Sidley & Austin New York office was located in offices on Third Avenue. Out of 600 employees who worked in the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks, one perished, a [[telephone switchboard|switchboard]] operator, Rosemary Smith.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://archive.today/20130130082917/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2061EFE3B550C768CDDAE0894DA404482 In Re 9/11: Law Firm Moves On, Still Recovering]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silive.com/september-11/index.ssf/2010/09/rosemary_smith_61_planned_to_o.html |title=Special Reports - SILive.com.com|work=silive.com}}</ref>

Sidley Austin reopened its New York office on Monday, September 17, 2001 in the old Sidley & Austin office on Third Avenue which it had planned on closing on September 16. Instead, it leased four additional floors in that location, in a deal completed less than three hours after the collapse of the World Trade Center. Sidley Austin later opened its permanent new office in the [[Equitable Center]] building on Seventh Avenue in July 2002.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Name changes==
In the 1920s, the firm was named Cutting, Moore & Sidley. Following a number of changes, it was known as Sidley & Austin for many years until it merged with the New York capital markets firm [[Brown & Wood]] in the 1990s. Its name was changed to Sidley Austin LLP on January 1, 2006.
