It was Spielberg's eighth film as a [[Film director|director]], and marked a change from the summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] for which he had become known.

The film was a box office success, grossing $142 million against a budget of $15 million. The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, musical score, and production values; but it was also criticized by some critics for being "over-sentimental" and "stereotypical." The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], without winning any; it also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, with [[Whoopi Goldberg]] winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]]. Steven Spielberg did not receive an Academy Award nomination for his directing, but did receive a [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and a Golden Globe nomination. The film was later included in [[Roger Ebert]]'s book series ''[[The Great Movies]]''.

==Plot==
Celie is an [[African Americans|African-American]] teenager in early 20th century rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who has lost two children by her abusive father. He gives her away as a wife to Mister who also abuses her and his children treat her badly. Celie's loving younger sister, Nettie, runs away from the abusive father and seeks shelter with Celie. The sisters promise to write if they are separated. Mister sexually assaults Nettie and he kicks her out after she fights him off.

Years later, Celie is meek from abuse. Mister's son Harpo marries Sofia, and Celie is shocked to find her running a matriarchal household. Harpo attempts to overpower and strike Sofia but he fails. Celie advises Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia retaliates and confronts Celie, revealing her long history of abuse. She threatens to kill Harpo if he beats her again and tells Celie to do likewise to Mister. Harpo doesn't change, so Sofia leaves and takes their children.

Mister and Harpo bring home the ailing Shug Avery, a [[showgirl]] and Mister's long-time [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. Celie, who has slowly developed a fondness for Shug through a photograph sent to Mister, is in awe of Shug's strong will. She nurses Shug back to health, and Shug in turn takes a liking to her, writing and performing a song about her at Harpo's newly opened bar. Shug tells Celie she's moving to Memphis, and Celie confesses to Shug that Mister beats her. Shug tells Celie she's beautiful and that she loves her, and they kiss. Celie packs her things to follow Shug to Memphis, but gets caught by Mister.

Meanwhile, Sofia has been imprisoned for striking the town's mayor after he insults her. Years pass, and she, now a shell of her former self, is released from prison{{snd}}only to be immediately ordered by the judge to become a maid to the mayor's wife, Ms. Millie. Having not seen her children in eight years, Sofia is allotted Christmas to be with her family, and Ms. Millie tries to drive her but panics and turns around after encountering a group of Sofia's friends, who were only trying to help her.

Shug returns to Celie and Mister's home with her new husband, Grady, expecting to receive a [[recording contract]]. Shug gives Celie a letter from Nettie, who tells her that she's working for a couple that has adopted Celie's children. Celie and Shug realize that Mister has been hiding Nettie's letters from Celie; while he and Grady are out drinking, the two search the house and find a hidden compartment under the floor boards filled with dozens and dozens of Nettie's letters. Engrossed in reading, Celie does not hear Mister's calls to shave him and he beats her. Celie attempts to kill Mister with a straight razor, but Shug intervenes and stops her. At a family gathering, Celie finally speaks up against Mister to the delight of Shug and Sofia, who finds her old fighting spirit, which prompts Harpo's new wife, Squeak, to stand up for herself as well. Shug and Grady drive away, taking Celie and Squeak with them.

Years later, Celie owns and operates a [[Tailor|tailor shop]]. Mister is old, a drunk, and alone, and Harpo has made amends with Sofia; the two now run the bar together, and Shug still performs there. Celie's father passes away, and she finally learns from Nettie's letters that he wasn't their biological father and that when their mother passed, "his" property was legally inherited by Celie and Nettie. Mister receives a letter from Nettie addressed to Celie, takes money from his secret stash, and arranges for Nettie, her husband, and Celie's children to return to the U.S., where they finally reunite while Mister watches from a distance.

The film received positive reviews from critics, receiving praise for its acting, direction, screenplay, score, and production merits, but was criticized by some for being "over-sentimental" and "stereotypical". [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 81% based on reviews from 31 critics, with an average score of 6.86/10. The website's critical consensus states: "It might have been better served by a filmmaker with a deeper connection to the source material, but ''The Color Purple'' remains a worthy, well-acted adaptation of Alice Walker's classic novel."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/color_purple/| title=The Color Purple (1985)| website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| accessdate= 2020-10-18}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on seven critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web| title=The Color Purple Reviews| journal=[[Metacritic]]| url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-color-purple| accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film four stars, calling it "the year's best film." He also praised [[Whoopi Goldberg]], calling her role "one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history" and predicting she would win the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. (She was nominated but did not win.) Ebert wrote of ''The Color Purple'':
{{blockquote|The world of Celie and the others is created so forcibly in this movie that their corner of the South becomes one of those movie places{{snd}}like [[Land of Oz|Oz]], like [[Tara (plantation)|Tara]], like [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]{{snd}}that lay claim to their own geography in our imaginations. The affirmation at the end of the film is so joyous that this is one of the few movies in a long time that inspires tears of happiness, and earns them.<ref>{{cite news| last=Ebert| first=Roger| title=The Color Purple| date=December 20, 1985| newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851220/REVIEWS/512200302| accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>}}

Ebert's long-time television collaborator, [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', praised the film as "triumphantly emotional and brave", calling it Spielberg's "successful attempt to enlarge his reputation as a director of youthful entertainments." Siskel wrote that ''The Color Purple'' was "a plea for respect for black women." Although acknowledging that the film was a period drama, he praised its "...{{nbsp}}incredibly strong stand against the way black men treat black women. Cruel is too kind a word to describe their behavior. The principal black men in ''The Color Purple'' use their women{{snd}}both wives and daughters{{snd}}as sexual chattel."<ref>{{cite news| author=Siskel, Gene| title=''Color Purple'': Powerful, Daring, Sweetly Uplifting| date=December 20, 1985| newspaper=Chicago Tribune| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-20/entertainment/8503280315_1_color-purple-black-men-film| accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Janet Maslin]] noted the film's divergence from Walker's book, but made the case that this shift works:
{{blockquote|Mr. Spielberg has looked on the sunny side of Miss Walker's novel, fashioning a grand, multi-hanky entertainment that is as pretty and lavish as the book is plain. If the book is set in the harsh, impoverished atmosphere of rural Georgia, the movie unfolds in a cozy, comfortable, flower-filled wonderland.{{nbsp}}... Some parts of it are rapturous and stirring, others hugely improbable, and the film moves unpredictably from one mode to another. From another director, this might be fatally confusing, but Mr. Spielberg's showmanship is still with him. Although the combination of his sensibilities and Miss Walker's amounts to a colossal mismatch, Mr. Spielberg's ''Color Purple'' manages to have momentum, warmth and staying power all the same.<ref>{{cite news| author=Maslin, Janet| title=Film: 'The Color Purple,' from Steven Spielberg| date=December 18, 1985| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/spielberg-color.html| accessdate=2010-10-29}}</ref>}}

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found the film over-sentimental, writing, "there are some great scenes and great performances in ''The Color Purple'', but it is not a great film. Steven Spielberg's turn at 'serious' film-making is marred in more than one place by overblown production that threatens to drown in its own emotions."<ref>{{cite news| title=The Color Purple| date=December 31, 1984| work= Variety| url=https://variety.com/1984/film/reviews/the-color-purple-1200426436/ |accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>

In addition, some critics alleged that the movie stereotyped black people in general<ref>{{cite news| author=Clegg II, Legrand H.(Chairman, Coalition Against Black Exploitation, Compton)| title=Bad Black Roles In 'Purple'| date=February 16, 1986| work=Los Angeles Times| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-16/entertainment/ca-8496_1_black-family-black-youths-black-man| accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref> and black men in particular,<ref name="Friendly" /> pointing to the fact that Spielberg, who is white, had directed a predominantly African American story.<ref name=Matthews2>{{cite news| author=Matthews, Jack| title=3 'Color Purple' Actresses Talk About Its Impact| date=January 31, 1986| work=Los Angeles Times| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-31/entertainment/ca-2876_1_color-purple| accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>

About some criticism the movie received, Steven Spielberg: "Most of the criticism came from directors [who] felt that we had overlooked them, and that it should have been a black director telling a black story. That was the main criticism. The other criticism was that I had softened the book. I have always copped to that. I made the movie I wanted to make from Alice Walker's book. There were certain things in the [lesbian] relationship between Shug Avery and Celie that were finely detailed in Alice's book, that I didn't feel could get a [PG-13] rating. And I was shy about it. In that sense, perhaps I was the wrong director to acquit some of the more sexually honest encounters between Shug and Celie, because I did soften those. I basically took something that was extremely erotic and very intentional, and I reduced it to a simple kiss. I got a lot of criticism for that."<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Steven Spielberg: The EW interview| url=https://ew.com/article/2011/12/02/steven-spielberg-ew-interview/| first=Anthony| last=Breznican| date=December 2, 2011| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| accessdate=2020-02-10}}</ref>

Filmmaker [[Oliver Stone]] defended ''The Color Purple'' as "an excellent movie, and it was an attempt to deal with an issue that had been overlooked, and it wouldn't have been done if it hadn't been Spielberg. And it's not like everyone says, that he ruined the book. That's horseshit. Nobody was going to ''do'' the book. He made the book live again."<ref>Cooper, Marc.

In 2004, Ebert included ''The Color Purple'' in his list of "Great Movies". He stated that "I can see its flaws more easily than when I named it the best film of 1985, but I can also understand why it moved me so deeply, and why the greatness of some films depends not on their perfection or logic, but on their heart."<ref>{{cite web| last1=Ebert| first1=Roger| title=The Color Purple Movie Review (1985)| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-color-purple-1985| website=rogerebert.com| accessdate=4 June 2015| date=March 28, 2004}}</ref>
