The '''National Fascist Party''' ({{lang-it|Partito Nazionale Fascista}}, '''PNF''') was an Italian [[political party]], created by [[Benito Mussolini]] as the political expression of [[Italian Fascism]] and as a reorganization of the previous [[Italian Fasces of Combat]]. The party [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|ruled]] the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from 1922 when Fascists took power with the [[March on Rome]] until the [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|fall of the Fascist regime]] in 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the [[Grand Council of Fascism]]. It was succeeded, in the territories under the control of the [[Italian Social Republic]], by the [[Republican Fascist Party]], ultimately dissolved at the end of [[World War II]].

The National Fascist Party was rooted in [[Italian nationalism]] and the desire to restore and expand [[Italian irredentism|Italian territories]], which Italian Fascists deemed necessary for a nation to assert its superiority and strength and to avoid succumbing to decay.<ref>[[Aristotle Kallis|Aristotle A.

Fascists promoted a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economic system whereby employer and employee [[syndicate]]s are linked together in associations to collectively represent the nation's economic producers and work alongside the state to set national economic policy.<ref name="massaschussetts1">Andrew Vincent.

Italian Fascism opposed [[liberalism]], but did not seek a [[reactionary]] restoration of the pre-[[French Revolution]]ary world, which it considered to have been flawed, and not in line with a forward-looking direction on policy.<ref name="Eugen Weber 1972.

The National Fascist Party along with its successor, the [[Republican Fascist Party]], are the only parties whose re-formation is banned by the [[Constitution of Italy]]: "It shall be forbidden to reorganize, under any form whatsoever, the dissolved fascist party".

==History==
===Historical background===
[[File:Benito Mussolini crop.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Mussolini during the 1920s]]
After [[World War I]] (1914–1918), despite the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861–1946) being a full-partner [[Allies of World War I|Allied Power]] against the [[Central Powers]], [[Italian nationalism]] claimed Italy was cheated in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (1919), thus the Allies had impeded Italy's progress to becoming a "Great Power".<ref name="fsmith">{{cite news|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch12.htm|publisher=FSmitha.com|title=Mussolini and Fascism in Italy|date=8 January 2008}}</ref> Thenceforth, the PNF successfully exploited that perceived slight to Italian nationalism in presenting Fascism as best suited for governing the country by successfully claiming that democracy, socialism and liberalism were failed systems.

In 1919 at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the Allies compelled the Kingdom of Italy to yield to Yugoslavia the Croatian seaport of Fiume ([[Rijeka]]), a mostly Italian city of little nationalist significance, until early 1919. Moreover, elsewhere Italy was then excluded from the wartime secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] (1915) it had concorded with the [[Triple Entente]],<ref>The Fascist Experience by Edward R. Tannenbaum, p. 22</ref> wherein Italy was to leave the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and join the enemy by [[declaration of war|declaring war]] against the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] in exchange for territories at war's end, upon which the Kingdom of Italy held claims (see ''[[Italia irredenta]]'').

In September 1919, the nationalist response of outraged war hero [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] was declaring the establishment of the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]].<ref name="macdonal">{{cite book |last=Macdonald |first=Hamish |title=Mussolini and Italian Fascism|publisher=Nelson Thornes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=221W9vKkWrcC&q=Gabriele+d%27Annunzio+paris+peace&pg=PT16 |isbn=0-7487-3386-8 |year=1999}}</ref> To his independent Italian state, he installed himself as the Regent ''Duce'' (Leader) and promulgated the ''Carta del Carnaro'' (''[[Charter of Carnaro]]'', 8 September 1920), a politically [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] constitutional amalgamation of right-wing and left-wing [[Anarchism|anarchist]], proto-fascist and [[Republican democracy|democratic republican]] politics, which much influenced the politico-philosophic development of early Italian Fascism. Consequent to the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] (1920), the metropolitan Italian military deposed the Regency of ''Duce'' D'Annunzio on Christmas 1920. In the development of the fascist model of government, D’Annunzio was a nationalist and not a fascist, whose legacy of political–[[Praxis (process)|praxis]] ("Politics as Theatre") was stylistic (ceremony, uniform, harangue and chanting) and not substantive, which Italian Fascism artfully developed as a government model.<ref name="macdonal" /><ref>Roger Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'' (1995)p. 49</ref>

Founded in Rome during the Third Fascist Congress on 7–10 November 1921,<ref name="Charles F. Delzell 1971, p. 26">Charles F. Delzell, edit., ''Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945'', New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26</ref> the National Fascist Party marked the transformation of the [[paramilitary]] ''[[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]]'' into a more coherent political group (the ''Fasci di Combattimento'' had been founded by Mussolini in [[Milan]]'s Piazza San Sepolcro on 23 March 1919).

The Fascist Party was instrumental in directing and popularizing support for Mussolini's ideology. In the early years, groups within the PNF called [[Blackshirts]] (''squadristi'') built a base of [[Power (sociology)|power]] by violently attacking [[socialism|socialists]] and their institutions in the rural [[Po River|Po Valley]], thereby gaining the support of landowners. Compared to its predecessor, the PNF abandoned [[republicanism]] to turn decisively towards the [[right-wing]] of the political spectrum.

===March on Rome===
{{main|March on Rome}}

On 28 October 1922, Mussolini attempted a ''[[coup d'état]]'', titled the [[March on Rome]] by Fascist propaganda, in which almost 30,000 fascists took part. The ''[[quadrumvirs]]'' leading the Fascist Party, General [[Emilio De Bono]], [[Italo Balbo]] (one of the most famous ''ras''), [[Michele Bianchi]] and [[Cesare Maria de Vecchi]], organized the March while the ''[[Duce]]'' stayed behind for most of the march, though he allowed pictures to be taken of him marching along with the Fascist marchers. Generals Gustavo Fara and Sante Ceccherini assisted to the preparations of the March of 18 October. Other organizers of the march included the Marquis [[Dino Perrone Compagni]] and Ulisse Igliori.

[[File:Mussd.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Benito Mussolini]] with Fascist [[Blackshirts]] during the [[March on Rome]]]]
On 24 October 1922, Mussolini declared before 60,000 people at the Fascist Congress in [[Naples]]: "Our program is simple: we want to rule Italy".<ref>Carsten (1982), p.62</ref> Meanwhile, the Blackshirts, who had occupied the Po plain, took all strategic points of the country. On 26 October, former prime minister [[Antonio Salandra]] warned current [[Prime Minister]] [[Luigi Facta]] that Mussolini was demanding his resignation and that he was preparing to march on Rome. However, Facta did not believe Salandra and thought that Mussolini would govern quietly at his side. To meet the threat posed by the bands of fascist troops now gathering outside Rome, Facta (who had resigned but continued to hold power) ordered a [[state of siege]] for Rome. Having had previous conversations with the king about the repression of fascist violence, he was sure the king would agree.<ref>Chiapello (2012), p.123</ref> However, [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to sign the military order.<ref>Carsten (1982), p.64</ref> On 28 October, the King handed power to Mussolini, who was supported by the military, the business class, the right-wing part of population.

The march itself was composed of fewer than 30,000 men, but the King in part feared a civil war since the ''squadristi'' had already taken control of the Po plain and most of the country, while Fascism was no longer seen as a threat to the establishment. Mussolini was asked to form his cabinet on 29 October 1922, while some 25,000 Blackshirts were parading in Rome. Mussolini thus legally reached power in accordance with the [[Statuto Albertino]], the Italian Constitution. The March on Rome was not the conquest of power which [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]] later celebrated, but rather the precipitating force behind a transfer of power within the framework of the constitution. This transition was made possible by the surrender of public authorities in the face of fascist intimidation. Many business and financial leaders believed it would be possible to manipulate Mussolini, whose early speeches and policies emphasized [[free market]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.<ref>Carsten (1982), p.76</ref> This proved overly optimistic, as Mussolini's corporatist view stressed total state power over businesses as much as over individuals, via governing industry bodies ("corporations") controlled by the Fascist party, a model in which businesses retained the responsibilities of property, but few if any of the freedoms.

Even though the coup failed in giving power directly to the Fascist Party, it nonetheless resulted in a parallel agreement between Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III that made Mussolini the head of the Italian government. On 15 December, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] was founded and it was the supreme organ of the PNF.

===Fascist government===
{{main|Fascist Italy (1922–1943)}}

After a drastic modification of electoral legislation (the [[Acerbo Law]]), the Fascist Party clearly won the [[1924 Italian general election|highly controversial elections of April 1924]]. In early 1925, Mussolini dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a total dictatorship. From that point onward, the PNF was effectively the only legally permitted party in the country.{{cn|date=September 2020}} This status was formalized by a law passed in 1928 and Italy remained a [[one-party state]] until the end of the Fascist regime in 1943. The new laws were strongly criticized by the leader of the [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] [[Giacomo Matteotti]] during his speech in Parliament and a few days later Matteotti was kidnapped and killed by fascist blackshirts.

[[File:Mussolini mezzobusto.jpg|thumb|right|180px|alt=official portrait of Mussolini in uniform with crossed arms|Mussolini in an official portrait]]
After taking sole power, the Fascist regime began to impose the Fascist ideology and its symbolism throughout the country. Party membership in the PNF became necessary to seek employment or gain government assistance. The [[fasces]] adorned public buildings, Fascist mottos and symbols were displayed in art and a [[personality cult]] was created around Mussolini as the nation's saviour called "''Il Duce''", "The Leader". The Italian parliament was replaced in duties by the [[Chamber of Fasces and Corporations]], solely filled with Fascist Party members. The PNF promoted Italian imperialism in [[Africa]] and staunchly promoted racial segregation and white supremacy of Italian settlers in the colonies.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

In 1930 came the Youth Fasces of Combat. The 1930s were characterized by the secretary [[Achille Starace]], "faithful" to Mussolini and one of the few fascist secretaries from [[Southern Italy]], who launched a campaign of Fascism in the country made up of a wave of ceremonies and rallies and the creation of organizations which aimed to frame the country and the citizen in all its manifestations (both public and private). In order to regiment youth movements, Starace brought the [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] (ONB) under the direct control of the PNF and the Youth Fasces that were dissolved and merged into the new [[Gioventù Italiana del Littorio]] (GIL).{{cn|date=September 2020}}

On 27 May 1933, party membership was declared a basic requirement for public office. On 9 March 1937, it became mandatory if one wanted access to any [[public office]] and from 3 June 1938 those who did not join the party could not work.{{cn|date=September 2020}} In 1939, [[Ettore Muti]] replaced Starace at the helm of the party, a fact that testifies to the increasing influence of [[Galeazzo Ciano]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and son-in-law of Mussolini.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

On 10 June 1940, from the balcony of [[Palazzo Venezia]] Mussolini announced the entry of Italy into [[World War II]] on the side of [[Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].

===The Fall of Mussolini===
{{main|Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy}}

On 25 July 1943, following a request from [[Dino Grandi]] due to the failure of the war the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] overthrew Mussolini by asking the King to resume his full authority in officially removing Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]], which he did. Mussolini was imprisoned, but the Fascists immediately collapsed and the party was officially banned by [[Pietro Badoglio]]'s government on 27 July.

After the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-engineered [[Gran Sasso raid]] liberated Mussolini in September, the PNF was revived as the [[Republican Fascist Party]] (''Partito Fascista Repubblicano'' – PFR; September 13), as the single party of the Northern and Nazi-protected [[Italian Social Republic]] (the [[Salò]] Republic). Its secretary was [[Alessandro Pavolini]]. The PRF did not outlast [[Death of Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's execution]] and the disappearance of the Salò state in April 1945.

==Ideology==
Italian Fascism was rooted in [[Italian nationalism]] and [[Georges Sorel]]’s [[Sorelianism|revolutionary syndicalism]] that eventually evolved into [[national syndicalism]] in Italy. Most Italian revolutionary syndicalist leaders were not only “founders of the Fascist movement”, but later held key positions in Mussolini's administration.<ref>Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri,'' The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'', Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33</ref> They sought to restore and expand [[Italian irredentism|Italian territories]], which Italian Fascists deemed necessary for a nation to assert its superiority and strength and to avoid succumbing to decay.<ref name="autogenerated1922">Aristotle A.

Pp. 160"/>

Italian Fascism opposed [[liberalism]], but rather than seeking a [[reactionary]] restoration of the pre-[[French Revolution]]ary world, which it considered to have been flawed as it had a forward-looking direction.<ref name="Eugen Weber 1972. Pp. 791"/> It was opposed to [[Socialist mode of production|Marxist socialism]] because of its typical opposition to nationalism,<ref name="Stanislao G.

Pp. 214"/> It believed the success of Italian nationalism required respect for [[tradition]] and a clear sense of a shared past among the [[Italian people]], alongside a commitment to a modernized Italy.<ref name="lazzaro2005"/>

===Nationalism===
Italian Fascism is based upon Italian nationalism and in particular seeks to complete what it considers as the incomplete project of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' by incorporating ''Italia Irredenta'' ("unredeemed Italy") into the state of Italy.<ref name="autogenerated3">Terence Ball, Richard Bellamy. The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought. Pp. 133</ref> The National Fascist Party founded in 1921 declared that the party was to serve as "a revolutionary militia placed at the service of the nation. It follows a policy based on three principles: order, discipline, hierarchy".<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

It identifies modern Italy as the heir to the [[Roman Empire]] and Italy during the [[Renaissance]] and promotes the cultural identity of ''[[Romanitas]]'' ("Roman-ness").<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Italian Fascism historically sought to forge a strong [[Italian Empire]] as a "[[Third Rome]]", identifying ancient Rome as the "First Rome" and Renaissance-era Italy as the "Second Rome".<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Italian Fascism has emulated ancient Rome and Mussolini in particular emulated ancient Roman leaders, such as [[Julius Cæsar]] as a model for the Fascists' rise to power and [[Augustus]] as a model for empire-building.<ref>Claudia Lazzaro, Roger J. Crum. "Augustus, Mussolini, and the Parallel Imagery of Empire" by Ann Thomas Wilkins, ''Donatello Among The Blackshirts: History And Modernity In The Visual Culture Of Fascist Italy''. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University Press, 2005. Pp. 53.</ref> Italian Fascism has directly promoted [[imperialism]], such as within the ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' (1932) [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by Giovanni Gentile on behalf of Mussolini, declared:
{{quote|The Fascist state is a will to power and empire. The Roman tradition is here a powerful force. According to the Doctrine of Fascism, empire is not only territorial or military or mercantile concept, but a spiritual and moral one. One can think of an empire, that is, a nation, which directly or indirectly guides other nations, without the need to conquer a single square kilometre of territory.|Benito Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile, ''Doctrine of Fascism'' (1932)|source=}}

Fascism emphasized the need for the restoration of the [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] ''Risorgimento'' tradition that pursued the unification of Italy, that the Fascists claimed had been left incomplete and abandoned in the [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolittian]]-era Italy.<ref>Roger Griffin.

To the north of Italy, the Fascist regime in the 1930s had designs on the largely Italian-populated region of [[Ticino]] and the [[Romansh people|Romansch]]-populated region of [[Graubünden]] in Switzerland (the Romansch are a people with a Latin-based language).<ref name="John F.

To the south, the regime claimed the archipelago of [[Malta]], which had been held by the British since 1800.<ref name="rix">Juliet Rix. ''Malta''.

Italian irredentists had claimed that territories on the coast of [[North Africa]] were Italy's [[Fourth Shore]] and used the historical Roman rule in North Africa as a precedent to justify the incorporation of such territories to Italian jurisdiction as being a "return" of Italy to North Africa.<ref>Tony Pollard, Iain Banks. Scorched Earth: Studies in the Archæology of Conflict. p4.</ref> In January 1939, Italy annexed territories in [[Libya]] that it considered within Italy's Fourth Shore, with Libya's four coastal provinces of Tripoli, Misurata, Benghazi and Derna becoming an integral part of metropolitan Italy.<ref name="Jon Wright P. 165">Jon Wright.

[[Tunisia]], a French protectorate since 1881, had the highest concentration of Italians in North Africa and its seizure by France had been viewed as an injury to national honour in Italy at what they perceived as a "loss" of Tunisia from Italian plans to incorporate it.<ref>Susan Slyomovics.

To the south, the Fascist regime held interest in expanding Italy's African colonial possessions. In the 1920s, Italy regarded Portugal as a weak country that was unbecoming of a colonial power due to its weak hold on its colonies and mismanagement of them and as such Italy desired to annex Portugal's colonies.<ref name="Lucas F.

===Totalitarianism===
[[File:Benito Mussolini Roman Salute.jpg|thumb|250px|From 1925, Mussolini styled himself ''[[Il Duce]]'' ("the leader")]]

In 1925, the PNF declared that Italy's Fascist state was to be [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]].<ref name="autogenerated3"/> The term "totalitarian" had initially been used as a pejorative accusation by Italy's liberal opposition that denounced the Fascist movement for seeking to create a total dictatorship.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> However, the Fascists responded by accepting that they were totalitarian, but presented totalitarianism from a positive viewpoint.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Mussolini described totalitarianism as seeking to forge an authoritarian national state that would be capable of completing ''Risorgimento'' of the ''Italia Irredenta'', forge a powerful modern Italy and create a new kind of citizen – politically active Fascist Italians.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

The ''Doctrine of Fascism'' (1932) described the nature of Italian Fascism's totalitarianism, stating the following:
{{quote|Fascism is for the only liberty which can be a serious thing, the liberty of the state and of the individual in the state. Therefore for the fascist, everything is in the state, and no human or spiritual thing exists, or has any sort of value, outside the state. In this sense fascism is totalitarian, and the fascist state which is the synthesis and unity of every value, interprets, develops and strengthens the entire life of the people.|Benito Mussolini, Giovanni Gentile, ''Doctrine of Fascism'' (1932)|source=}}

American journalist [[H. R. Knickerbocker]] wrote in 1941: "Mussolini's Fascist state is the least terroristic of the three totalitarian states. The terror is so mild in comparison with the Soviet or Nazi varieties, that it almost fails to qualify as terroristic at all." As example he described an Italian journalist friend who refused to become a Fascist. He was fired from his newspaper and put under 24-hour surveillance, but otherwise not harassed; his employment contract was settled for a lump sum and he was allowed to work for the foreign press. Knickerbocker contrasted his treatment with the inevitable torture and execution under Stalin or Hitler, and stated "you have a fair idea of the comparative mildness of the Italian kind of totalitarianism".<ref name="knickerbocker1941">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&pg=PA72 | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=72–73 | isbn=9781417992775}}</ref>

However, since World War II historians have noted that in Italy's colonies Italian Fascism displayed extreme levels of violence. One-tenth of the population of the Italian colony of Libya died during the Fascist era, including from the use of gassings, [[concentration camp]]s, starvation and disease; in Ethiopia during and after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], a quarter of a million Ethiopians died.<ref>[[Ruth Ben-Ghiat]]. Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945. p126.</ref>

===Corporatist economics===
Italian Fascism promotes a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economic system. The economy involves employer and employee [[syndicate]]s being linked together in corporative associations to collectively represent the nation's economic producers and work alongside the state to set national economic policy.<ref name="massaschussetts1"/> It supports criminalization of strikes by employees and [[Lockout (industry)|lockouts]] by employers, as it deems these acts prejudicial to the national community as a whole.<ref>George Sylvester Counts. Bolshevism, fascism, and capitalism: an account of the three economic systems. 3rd edition. Yale University Press, 1970. Pp. 96.</ref>

===Age and gender roles===
The Italian Fascists' political anthem was called ''[[Giovinezza]]'' ("The Youth").<ref name="Mark Antliff 2007. Pp. 171">Mark Antliff.

Italian Fascism pursued what it called "moral hygiene" of youth, particularly regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].<ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47">Maria Sop Quine. ''Population Politics in Twentieth Century Europe: Fascist Dictatorships and Liberal Democracies''. Routledge, 1995.

Pp. 46-47"/> Fascist Italy pursued an aggressive campaign to reduce prostitution of young women.<ref name="Maria Sop Quine 1995. Pp. 46-47"/>

Mussolini perceived women's primary role to be childbearers while men were warriors, once saying that "war is to man what maternity is to the woman".<ref name="psychoanalysis">Bollas, Christopher, ''Being a Character: Psychoanalysis and Self-Experience'' (Routledge, 1993) {{ISBN|978-0-415-08815-2}}, p. 205.</ref> In an effort to increase birthrates, the Italian Fascist government gave financial incentives to women who raised large families and initiated policies designed to reduce the number of women employed.<ref name="mussolini73">McDonald, Harmish, ''Mussolini and Italian Fascism'' (Nelson Thornes, 1999) p. 27.</ref> Italian Fascism called for women to be honoured as "reproducers of the nation" and the Italian Fascist government held ritual ceremonies to honour women's role within the Italian nation.<ref name="university74">Mann, Michæl. ''Fascists'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004) p. 101.</ref> In 1934, Mussolini declared that employment of women was a "major aspect of the thorny problem of unemployment" and that for women working was "incompatible with childbearing". Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the "exodus of women from the work force".<ref name="routledge75">Durham, Martin, ''Women and Fascism'' (Routledge, 1998) p. 15.</ref>

===Tradition===
Italian Fascism believed that the success of Italian nationalism required a clear sense of a shared past amongst the Italian people, along with a commitment to a modernized Italy. In a famous speech in 1926, Mussolini called for Fascist art that was "traditionalist and at the same time modern, that looks to the past and at the same time to the future".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9gcBQAAQBAJ&q=%22traditionalist+and+at+the+same+time+modern,+that+looks+to+the+past+and+at+the+same+time+to+the+future%22&pg=PA140|title=Italian Fascism, 1915-1945|last=Morgan|first=Philip|date=2003-11-10|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=9780230802674|language=en}}</ref>

''Italy and its Monarchy''. Yale University Press, 1989. Pp. 265.</ref> In that year, the Fascist government attempted to have the Italian national flag redesigned to incorporate the fasces on it.<ref name="autogenerated1989"/> However, this attempt to incorporate the fasces on the flag was stopped by strong opposition to the proposal by Italian monarchists.<ref name="autogenerated1989"/> Afterwards, the Fascist government in public ceremonies rose the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag.<ref>Emilio Gentile. The sacralization of politics in fascist Italy. Harvard University Press, 1996. Pp. 119.</ref> However, years later and after Mussolini was forced from power by the King in 1943 only to be rescued by German forces, the [[Italian Social Republic]] founded by Mussolini and the Fascists did incorporate the fasces on the state's war flag, which was a variant of the Italian tricolour national flag.

The issue of the rule of monarchy or republic in Italy was an issue that changed several times through the development of Italian Fascism. Initially Italian Fascism was [[Republicanism|republican]] and denounced the Savoy monarchy.<ref name="autogenerated11">John Francis Pollard. The Fascist Experience in Italy. P. 72.</ref> However, Mussolini tactically abandoned republicanism in 1922 and recognized that the acceptance of the monarchy was a necessary compromise to gain the support of the establishment to challenge the liberal constitutional order that also supported the monarchy.<ref name="autogenerated11"/> King Victor Emmanuel III had become a popular ruler in the aftermath of Italy's gains after World War I and the army held close loyalty to the King, thus any idea of overthrowing the monarchy was discarded as foolhardy by the Fascists at this point.<ref name="autogenerated11"/> Importantly, Fascism's recognition of monarchy provided Fascism with a sense of historical continuity and legitimacy.<ref name="autogenerated11"/> The Fascists publicly identified King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] – the first [[King of Italy|King]] of a reunited Italy who had initiated the ''Risorgimento'' – along with other historic Italian figures, such as [[Gaius Marius]], Julius Cæsar, Giuseppe Mazzini, [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], Giuseppe Garibaldi and others, for being within a tradition of dictatorship in Italy that the Fascists declared that they emulated.<ref>Christopher Duggan. Fascist Voices: An Intimate History of Mussolini's Italy. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press, P. 76.</ref> However, this compromise with the monarchy did not yield a cordial relationship between the King and Mussolini.<ref name="autogenerated11"/> Although Mussolini had formally accepted the monarchy, he pursued and largely achieved reducing the power of the King to that of a [[figurehead]].<ref>Beasley Sr., Jimmy Lee. ''I Was There When It Happened''. Xlibris Corporation, 2010. Pp. 39.</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} The King initially held complete nominal legal authority over the military through the ''[[Statuto Albertino]]'', but this was ended during the Fascist regime when Mussolini created the position of [[First Marshal of the Empire]] in 1938, a two-person position of control over the military held by both the King and the head of government, that had the effect of eliminating the King's previously exclusive legal authority over the military by giving Mussolini equal legal authority to the King over the military.<ref>Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation during the Second World War. P. 113.</ref> In the 1930s, Mussolini became aggravated by the monarchy's continued existence due to envy of the fact that his counterpart in Germany [[Adolf Hitler]] was both head of state and head of government of a republic; and Mussolini in private denounced the monarchy and indicated that he had plans to dismantle the monarchy and create a republic with himself as head of state of Italy upon an Italian success in the then-anticipated major war about to erupt in Europe.<ref name="autogenerated11"/>

[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Mussolini with [[Adolf Hitler]]]]
After being removed from office and placed under arrest by the King in 1943 and the Kingdom of Italy's new non-fascist government switching sides from the Axis to the Allies, Italian Fascism returned to republicanism and condemnation of the monarchy.<ref name="lastdays, pp 16-17">{{Cite book| last = Moseley | first = Ray |title =Mussolini: The Last 600 Days of Il Duce| publisher=Taylor Trade| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=UmxaWvOL_IgC&q=Campo+Imperatore+abruzzo+mussolini&pg=PA7 | isbn = 1-58979-095-2 | year = 2004}}</ref> On 18 September 1943, Mussolini made his first public address to the Italian people since his rescue from arrest by allied German forces, in which he commended the loyalty of Hitler as an ally while condemning King Victor Emmanuel III of the Kingdom of Italy for betraying Italian Fascism.<ref name="lastdays, pp 16-17"/> On the topic of the monarchy removing him from power and dismantling the Fascist regime, Mussolini stated that "[i]t is not the regime that has betrayed the monarchy, it is the monarchy that has betrayed the regime" and that "[w]hen a monarchy fails in its duties, it loses every reason for being...The state we want to establish will be national and social in the highest sense of the word; that is, it will be Fascist, thus returning to our origins".<ref name="lastdays, pp 16-17"/> The Fascists at this point did not denounce the [[House of Savoy]] in the entirety of its history and credited Victor Emmanuel II for his rejection of "scornfully dishonourable pacts" and denounced Victor Emmanuel III for betraying Victor Emmanuel II by entering a dishonourable pact with the Allies.<ref>Luisa Quartermaine.

The relationship between Italian Fascism and the Catholic Church was mixed, as originally it was highly anti-clerical and hostile to Catholicism, but from the mid to late 1920s anti-clericalism lost ground in the movement as Mussolini in power sought to seek accord with the Church as the Church held major influence in Italian society with most Italians being Catholic.<ref>John F. Pollard. The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929-32: A Study in Conflict. Cambridge University Press, 1985, 2005. p10.</ref> In 1929, the Italian government signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the [[Holy See]], a [[concordat]] between Italy and the Catholic Church that allowed for the creation of a small enclave known as [[Vatican City]] as a sovereign state representing the [[papacy]]. This ended years of perceived alienation between the Church and the Italian government after Italy annexed the [[Papal States]] in 1870. Italian Fascism justified its adoption of antisemitic laws in 1938 by claiming that Italy was fulfilling the Christian religious mandate of the Catholic Church that had been initiated by [[Pope Innocent III]] in the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215, whereby the Pope issued strict regulation of the life of Jews in Christian lands which reduced their status to essentially perpetual slaves, Jews were prohibited from holding any public office that would give them power over Christians and Jews were required to wear distinctive clothing to distinguish them from Christians.<ref>Wiley Feinstein.

The National Fascist Party model was very influential beyond Italy. In the twenty-one-year [[interbellum]] period, many [[Political Science|political scientists]] and philosophers sought [[Ideology|ideological]] inspiration from Italy. Mussolini's establishment of law and order to Italy and its society was praised by [[Winston Churchill]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ronterpening.com/extras/league_ex.htm|publisher=RonterPening.com|title=Top Ten Facts About Mussolini|date=27 January 2008}}</ref> [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Falasca-Zamponi|first=Simonetta  |title=Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy|publisher=University of California Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vcFQTOsRXgC&q=%22the+Hero+of+Culture%22+Sigmund+Freud&pg=PA53|isbn=0-520-22677-1 |year=2000}}</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Matthews Gibbs|first=Anthony  |title=A Bernard Shaw Chronology |publisher=Palgrave |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3x8_4LyMyT4C&q=George+Bernard+Shaw+mussolini|isbn=0-312-23163-6 |date=2001-05-04}}</ref> and [[Thomas Edison]],<ref name="pound">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=My2rlb0bnx0C&q=%22I+am+no+superman+like+Mussolini%22&pg=PA71|publisher=Leon Surette|title=Pound in Purgatory|date=27 January 2008}}</ref> as the Fascist Government combated [[Organized crime|organised crime]] and [[Sicilian Mafia|the Mafia]] with violence and [[Feud#Blood feuds|vendetta]] (honour).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_267.html|publisher=AmericanMafia.com|title=Mussolini Takes on the Mafia|date=8 January 2008}}</ref>

Italian Fascism was copied by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party]], the [[Russian Fascist Organization]] and the Romanian [[National Fascist Movement]] (the [[National Romanian Fascia]] and [[National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement]]), whereas the Dutch fascists were based upon the ''Verbond van Actualisten'' journal of [[H. A. Sinclair de Rochemont]] and [[Alfred Haighton]]. The [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]] established a government in [[San Marino]] with a politico-philosophic basis that was essentially Italian Fascism. In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], [[Milan Stojadinović]] established his [[Yugoslav Radical Union]], which was based on Fascism. Party members wore green shirts, [[Šajkača]] caps and used the Roman salute. Stojadinović also took to calling himself ''Vodja''. In Switzerland, pro-Nazi Colonel [[Arthur Fonjallaz]] of the [[National Front (Switzerland)|National Front]] became an ardent Mussolini admirer after visiting Italy in 1932 and advocated the Italian annexation of Switzerland, whilst receiving Fascist foreign aid.<ref>Alan Morris Schom, [http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&b=243125 A Survey of Nazi and Pro-Nazi Groups in Switzerland: 1930–1945] for the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]</ref> The country was host for two Italian politico-cultural activities: the International Centre for Fascist Studies (CINEF — ''Centre International d’ Études Fascistes''), and the 1934 congress of the Action Committee for the Universality of Rome (CAUR — ''Comitato d’ Azione della Università de Roma'').<ref>R. Griffin, ''The Nature of Fascism'', London: Routledge, 1993, p. 129</ref> In Spain, the writer [[Ernesto Giménez Caballero]], in ''Genio de España'' (''The Genius of Spain'', 1932) called for the Italian annexation of Spain, led by Mussolini presiding an international Latin Roman Catholic empire. He then progressed to be closely associated with [[Falangism]], leading to discarding the Spanish annexation to Italy.<ref>[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', p. 148</ref>

==Legacy==
Although the National Fascist Party was outlawed by the postwar [[Constitution of Italy]], a number of successor neo-fascist parties emerged to carry on its legacy. Historically, the largest neo-fascist party was the [[Italian Social Movement]] (''Movimento Sociale Italiano''), whose best result was 8.7% of votes gained in the [[1972 Italian general election|1972 general election]]. The MSI was disbanded in 1995 and was replaced by [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], a conservative party that distanced itself from Fascism (its founder, former foreign minister [[Gianfranco Fini]], declared during an official visit to [[State of Israel]] that Fascism was "an absolute evil").<ref>{{cite news|title=Former fascists seek respectability|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2269141|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=4 December 2003}}</ref> National Alliance and a number of neo-fascist parties were merged in 2009 to create the short-lived [[The People of Freedom|People of Freedom]] party led by then Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], which eventually disbanded after the defeat in the [[2013 Italian general election|2013 general election]]. By now, many former members of MSI and AN joined [[Brothers of Italy]] party led by [[Giorgia Meloni]].
