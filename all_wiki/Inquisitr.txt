'''Inquisitr''' is a news and media website, relaunched in May 2011. It describes itself as a "multi-[[news aggregator]]". Its contributors post trending news and original articles.

==History==
The web domain for Inquisitr was registered on August 6, 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Inquisitr.com Whois Lookup - Who.is - Who.is|url = https://who.is/whois/inquisitr.com|website = who.is|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref> The company was founded by former [[TechCrunch]] journalist Duncan Riley, whose history of launching web businesses includes ''the Blog Herald'', launched in 2002. In 2004, he launched the blog network ''Weblog Empire'', which in 2005, served as the base site for ''b5media LLC'', of which Riley was a co-founder. The company went on to earn $15 million in profits before eventually being sold at a loss. Riley left the company with an undisclosed settlement after protesting the poor pay of its employees.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Inquisitr was eventually put up for sale in 2011, with Riley citing personal reasons for the sale.<ref name="washpost">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/06/AR2008050601675.html |title=We Lost A Blogging Giant Today: Duncan Riley Leaves TechCrunch | work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate= 2008-05-06 }}</ref><ref name="nextweb">{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2011/05/13/duncan-rileys-inquisitr-com-up-for-sale/ |title=Duncan Riley's Inquisitr.com up for sale | publisher= TheNextWeb |accessdate= 2011-05-13 }}</ref><ref name="news">{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/387577/duncan-riley-quits-techcrunch |title=Duncan Riley quits TechCrunch |publisher=[[Gawker]] |accessdate=2008-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731125903/http://gawker.com/387577/duncan-riley-quits-techcrunch |archivedate=2009-07-31 }}</ref><ref name="smart">{{cite web|url=http://www.startupsmart.com.au/growth/buy-a-business/tech-writer-entrepreneur-duncan-riley-sells-inquisitr-for-330000/201105202664.html |title=Tech writer, entrepreneur Duncan Riley sells Inquisitr for $330,000 | publisher= Startup Smart |accessdate= 2011-05-20 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Founded by former TechCrunch writer, The Inquisitr sells for $330,000 on Flippa|url = http://fusible.com/2011/05/founded-by-former-techcrunch-writer-the-inquisitr-sells-for-330000-on-flippa/|website = Fusible|accessdate = 2015-11-23|language = en-US}}</ref>

The current website owner, Daniel Treisman, purchased the website via Flippa.com and invested into growing the company.

==Growth==
In an interview with AdExchanger the owner of Inquisitr says they have been working with ad network company Komoona since 2013.

"[We] find it challenging to devote the time needed to find the right monetization partners and strategies," Treisman said. "There are a lot of moving parts and it feels like we are leaving money on the table due to the lack of time and know-how."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Komoona Helps Publishers Sell Non-Direct Inventory|url = http://adexchanger.com/publishers/komoona-aims-to-help-publishers-get-the-most-out-of-their-non-direct-sold-inventory/|website = AdExchanger|accessdate = 2015-11-21|language = en-US}}</ref>
