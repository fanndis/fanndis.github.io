The '''Pacific Islands Forum''' ('''PIF''') is an [[Intergovernmentalism|inter-governmental]] [[organization]] that aims to enhance cooperation between countries and territories of the [[Pacific Ocean]], including formation of a trade bloc and regional peacekeeping operations. It was founded in 1971 as the '''South Pacific Forum''' ('''SPF'''), and changed its name in 1999 to "Pacific Islands Forum", so as to be more inclusive of the Forum's [[Oceania]]-spanning membership of both north and south Pacific [[island country|island countries]], including [[Australia]]. It is a [[United Nations General Assembly observer]].<ref>https://www.un.org/en/sections/member-states/intergovernmental-organizations/index.html</ref>

The mission of the Pacific Islands Forum is "to work in support of Forum member governments, to enhance the economic and social well-being of the people of the South Pacific by fostering cooperation between governments and between international agencies, and by representing the interests of Forum members in ways agreed by the Forum". Its decisions are implemented by the ''Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat'' (PIFS), which grew out of the ''South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation'' (SPEC). As well as its role in harmonising regional positions on various political and policy issues, the Forum Secretariat has technical programmes in economic development, transport and trade. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General is the permanent Chairman of the [[Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific]] (CROP).<ref>{{cite web

Australia and [[New Zealand]] are generally larger and wealthier than the other countries that make up the rest of the Forum, with Australia's population being around twice that of the other 17 members combined and its economy is more than five times larger. They are significant aid donors and big markets for exports from the other island countries. Military and police forces as well as civilian personnel of Forum states, chiefly Australia and New Zealand, have recently been part of regional peacekeeping and stabilization operations in other states, notably in Solomon Islands (2003–) and Nauru (2004–2009), under Forum auspices. Such regional efforts are mandated by the [[Biketawa Declaration]], which was adopted at the 31st Summit of Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, held at Kiribati in October 2000. The 50th meeting of the Forum took place in Tuvalu in August 2019.

The larger [[Pacific Community]] functions mainly to promote [[international development]] by providing technical and scientific advice and funding development projects, and does not consider security issues or function as a trade bloc.

== History ==
[[File:South Pacific Forum, August 5, 1971, Wellington (19969820699).jpg|left|thumb|280x280px|South Pacific Forum, August 5, 1971, Wellington]]
From 5–7 August 1971, the first meeting of the South Pacific Forum was initiated by New Zealand and held in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, with attendants of the following seven countries: the [[President of Nauru]], the Prime Ministers of Western Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, the Premier of the Cook Islands, the Australian Minister for External Territories, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand. It was a private and informal discussion of a wide range of issues of common concern, concentrating on matters directly affecting the daily lives of the people of the islands of the South Pacific, devoting particular attention to trade, shipping, tourism, and education. Afterwards this meeting was held annually in member countries and areas in turn. In 1999, the 30th South Pacific Forum decided to be renamed the organization to the Pacific Islands Forum, to better account for areas outside the south Pacific. Immediately after the forum's annual meeting at head of government level, the Post Forum Dialogue (PFD) is conducted at ministerial level with PFD development partners around the world.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LoGoqUIQOeIC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false The Pacific Islands Forum (Former South Pacific Forum)]- ''Pacific Regional Order'', pp 58-80, by Dave Peebles- Retrieved 2017-01-08</ref>

=== Suspension of Fiji ===
In August 2008, the Forum threatened to suspend [[Fiji]] if the latter did not commit to holding a general election by March 2009.<ref name="RNZI_41625">{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=41625 |title=Solomon’s Prime Minister says all Forum members backed suspension threat |date=24 August 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref> Subsequently, at a special leaders' meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum held in Papua New Guinea in January 2009, Forum leaders set a deadline of 1 May, by which date Fiji must set a date for elections before the end of the year. Fiji rejected the deadline.<!--<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal:Oceania&oldid=234356903 Portal:Oceania - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]. En.wikipedia.org (2008-08-26).

== Institutions and legal framework ==
[[Image:Pif secretariat.jpg|thumb|Library and archives building at the Secretariat complex in Suva, Fiji.]]
The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat was established initially as a trade bureau in 1972 and later became the ''South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation'' (SPEC). The name ''South Pacific Forum Secretariat'' was approved by member governments in 1988 and changed to ''Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat'' in 2000.

There are four divisions in the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and each of these divisions has direct responsibility for a range of programs designed to improve the capacity of the Forum member countries and to co-ordinate action on matters of common interest:
# Development and Economic Policy
# Trade and Investment
# Political, International and Legal Affairs
# Corporate Services

The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM) established in 1995, plays a key role in assessing regional economic developments.<ref>Dave Peebles -Pacific Regional Order 2005 1920942467- Page 141 "As discussed in Chapter Four, in 1995 the Forum instituted a new annual meeting, the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM).

As of 2013, it had been signed by 12 states:<ref name="pictastatus" />

It has not been signed by either Palau or the Marshall Islands. All of the signing states have ratified the treaty, with the exception of Micronesia. As of March 2008, six countries had announced that domestic arrangements had been made enabling them to trade under the agreement:<ref name="pictastatus">{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsec.org/_resources/article/files/PICTA%20Status%20Report.pdf |title=PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES TRADE AGREEMENT (PICTA): STATUS REPORT |access-date=14 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318082749/http://www.forumsec.org/_resources/article/files/PICTA%20Status%20Report.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009 }}</ref> [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Niue]], [[Samoa]], [[Solomon Islands]],<ref>[http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/newsroom/press-statements/2007/solomon-islands-ready-trade-under-picta.html ''"Solomon Islands Ready to Trade Under PICTA"''], Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat</ref> [[Vanuatu]].<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6365013.html ''"Vanuatu ready to trade under PICTA"''], People's Daily Online</ref>

After the trade agreement goes into force, countries commit to removing tariffs on most goods by 2021. As of April 2008, The Forum Island Countries are also negotiating an [[Economic Partnership Agreement]] (EPA) with the [[European Union]]. It is important to note that the PICTA discussed here covers only the trade of goods. At the Forum Island Leaders Meeting held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands on 28 August 2012, nine members signed the [[Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement Trade in Services]] ([[PICTA TIS]]).<ref>[http://www.forumsec.org/resources/uploads/attachments/documents/PICTA_TIS_Protocol_2012.pdf ] ''Protocol''</ref>  As of April 2008, there is an ongoing negotiation to design and agree on a protocol to include trade in services and the temporary movement of natural persons (a broader concept than the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services|GATS]]'s [[General Agreement on Trade in Services#Four Modes of Supply|Mode 4]]).<ref name="pictaservices">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120808043135/http://www.forumsec.org.fj/pages.cfm/newsroom/press-statements/2008/senior-officials-end-first-round-of-picta-trade-services-negotiations.html Pacific Trade in Services Negotiations - First Round], Pacific Island Forum Secretariat</ref>

The [[Office of the Chief Trade Adviser]] was established on 29 March 2010 to provide independent advice and support to the Pacific Forum Island Countries (FICs) in the PACER Plus trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.

An “open skies” policy has been under work by a number of nations. The Pacific Islands Air Services Agreement or PIASA would allow member nations to have more access for their airlines to other member countries. To date there have been ten signatories, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, while only six have ratified the agreement. These six are Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu.

At the 19–20 August 2008 Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Niue, the leaders discussed [[Pacific Plan]] priorities including, “fisheries, energy, trade and economic integration, [[climate change]] and transport, in addition to information and communication technology, health, education, and good governance.” Leaders also discussed the [[effects of global warming|impacts of climate change]] and adopted the ''Niue Declaration on Climate Change''.

In the [[Nadi Bay declaration]] of 30 July 2019, the Pacific Islands Forum warned that coral atoll nations could be uninhabitable as early as 2030, expressed their deeply concern about a lack of "comprehension, ambition or commitment" from developed nations and called for an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Adam Morton|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/31/pacific-leaders-plead-with-australia-to-drop-plans-to-carry-over-emissions-credits|title=Pacific leaders plead with Australia to drop plans to carry over emissions credits|publisher=The Guardian|date=2019-08-01|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbSloYVSuY4mIZnUUC5ISpZUaV3NTb2y/view|title=Nadi Bay Declaration on the Climate Change Crisis in the Pacific|date=2019-07-30|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref>

== Prospects ==
There has been a call from within both the Australian and New Zealand business communities to extend the CER ([[Closer Economic Relations]]) to other Pacific island nations, moving towards a single market and allowing the free movement of people and goods. A [[Pacific Union]] has been theorized as the next step of the forum.

In September 2016, the Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organisations (PIANGO) regional network, encouraged member states’ leaders to include in the organisation's agenda the issue of human rights violations in West Papua.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.piango.org/2016/09/13/geo-politics-at-play-over-leaders-lack-of-expressed-commitment-on-west-papua/|website=PIANGO|title=Geo Politics At Play Over Leader’s Lack of Expressed Commitment on West Papua|access-date=30 September 2016}}</ref>
