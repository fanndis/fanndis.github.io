In [[politics]], a '''mandate''' is the [[authority]] granted by a [[Electoral district|constituency]] to act as its [[Representative democracy|representative]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandate |work=Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |title=Mandate |publisher=Merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref>

The concept of a government having a [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] mandate to govern via the fair winning of a [[democracy|democratic]] [[election]] is a central idea of [[representative democracy]]. New governments who attempt to introduce policies that they did not make public during an election campaign are said not to have a legitimate ''mandate'' to implement such policies.

Elections, especially ones with a large margin of victory, and are often said to give the newly [[Election|elected]] [[Government in exile|government]] or elected official an implicit mandate to put into effect certain [[policies]].<ref>Glossary | Elections ACT. Jul 2012. http://www.elections.act.gov.au/glossary (cf., ''The Government's claim that once elected they have the right and responsibility to implement their policies''.)</ref> When a government seeks re-election they may introduce new policies as part of the campaign and are hoping for approval from the voters, and say they are seeking a "new mandate".

In some languages, a "mandate" can mean a parliamentary seat won in an election rather than the electoral victory itself. In case such a mandate is bound to the wishes of the electorate, it is an [[imperative mandate]], otherwise it is called "free".
