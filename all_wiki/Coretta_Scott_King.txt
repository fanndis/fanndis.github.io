'''Coretta Scott King''' ({{née}} '''Scott'''; April 27, 1927 – January 30, 2006) was an American author, activist, [[civil rights]] leader, and the wife of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] An advocate for [[Racial equality|African-American equality]], she was a leader for the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s. King was also a singer who often incorporated [[music]] into her civil rights work. King met her husband while attending graduate school in [[Boston]]. They both became increasingly active in the American civil rights movement.

King played a prominent role in the years after [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|her husband's assassination]] in 1968 when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the [[Second-wave feminism|Women's Movement]]. King founded the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change|King Center]] and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. She finally succeeded when [[Ronald Reagan]] signed legislation which established [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] on November 2, 1983. She later broadened her scope to include both [[LGBT rights in the United States|advocacy for LGBT rights]] and opposition to [[apartheid]]. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin Luther King's death, including [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Her telephone conversation with John F. Kennedy during the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] has been credited by historians for mobilizing African-American voters.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In August 2005, King suffered a stroke which paralyzed her right side and left her unable to speak; five months later she died of respiratory failure due to complications from ovarian cancer. Her funeral was attended by some 10,000 people, including four of five living U.S. presidents. She was temporarily buried on the grounds of the King Center until being interred next to her husband. She was inducted into the [[Alabama Women's Hall of Fame]], the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]], and was the first African American to [[Lying in state |lie in state]] at the [[Georgia State Capitol]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=20060206&id=sa5AAAAAIBAJ&pg=6935,3565433|title=Coretta Scott King honored at church where husband preached|last=|first=|date=February 6, 2006|work=Lodi News-Sentinel|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515205801/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=20060206&id=sa5AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JSEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=6935,3565433|archive-date=May 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> King has been referred to as "First Lady of the Civil Rights Movement".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VEuRMqFWpnsC&q=coretta+scott+king+first+lady+of+the+civil+rights+movement&pg=PA50|title=Coretta Scott King|isbn=9780761340003|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043605/https://books.google.com/books?id=VEuRMqFWpnsC&pg=PA50&dq=coretta+scott+king+first+lady+of+the+civil+rights+movement&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d5DQUpeWOsH3oATPqoL4BA&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=coretta%20scott%20king%20first%20lady%20of%20the%20civil%20rights%20movement&f=false|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live|last1=Waxman|first1=Laura Hamilton|date=January 2008}}</ref>

== Childhood and education ==
Coretta Scott was born in [[Heiberger, Alabama]], the third of four children of Obadiah Scott (1899–1998) and Bernice McMurry Scott (1904–1996). She was born in her parents' home with her paternal great-grandmother Delia Scott, a former slave, presiding as midwife. Coretta's mother became known for her musical talent and singing voice. As a child, Bernice attended the local Crossroads School and only had a fourth-grade education. Bernice's older siblings, however, attended boarding school at the [[Booker T. Washington]]-founded [[Tuskegee Institute]]. The senior Mrs. Scott worked as a school bus driver, a church pianist, and for her husband in his business ventures. She served as Worthy Matron for her [[Order of the Eastern Star|Eastern Star]] chapter and was a member of the local Literacy Federated Club.<ref name="Schraff">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez47z1Dy-wUC&q=mollie | title=Coretta Scott King: striving for civil rights | publisher=Enslow Publishers | author=Schraff, Anne E. | year=1997 | page=14 | isbn=0894908111 | access-date=June 16, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043605/https://books.google.com/books?ei=9BXlUua2EeGqyAGs3IG4DA&id=ez47z1Dy-wUC&dq=%2B%22coretta+scott+king%22+%2B%22part+native+american%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=mollie | archive-date=October 19, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Bruns">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000brun | url-access=registration | quote=Bernice McMurray Scott indian. | title=Martin Luther King, Jr: A Biography | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Bruns, Roger | year=2006 | page=[https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000brun/page/25 25] | isbn=0313336865 | access-date=March 3, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802065621/https://archive.org/details/martinlutherking0000brun | archive-date=August 2, 2020 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Bagley">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/desertroselifele0000bagl | url-access=registration | title=Desert Rose: The Life and Legacy of Coretta Scott King | publisher=The University of Alabama Press | author=Bagley, Edyth Scott | year=2012 | location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama | pages=[https://archive.org/details/desertroselifele0000bagl/page/17 17]–19 | isbn=978-0-8173-1765-2 | access-date=March 3, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802070639/https://archive.org/details/desertroselifele0000bagl | archive-date=August 2, 2020 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Obie, Coretta's father, was one of the first black people in their town to own a vehicle. Before starting his own businesses, he worked as a policeman. Along with his wife, he ran a clothing shop far from their home and later opened a general store. He also owned a [[sawmill|lumber mill]], which was burned down by white neighbors after Scott refused to sell his mill to a white male logger.<ref>{{cite book |title=My Life, My Love, My Legacy | publisher=Henry Holt and Company | author=King, Coretta Scott and Rev.

Coretta's maternal grandfather, Martin, was born to a slave of [[Black Indians|Black Native American]] ancestry, and her white master who never acknowledged Martin as his son. He eventually owned a 280-acre farm. Because of his diverse origins, Martin appeared to be [[White people|white]]. However, he displayed contempt for the notion of [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]]. As a self-taught reader with little formal education, he is noted for having inspired Coretta's passion for education. Coretta's paternal grandparents were Cora (née McLaughlin; 1876 – 1920) and Jefferson F. Scott (1873–1941). Cora died before Coretta's birth. Jeff Scott was a farmer and a prominent figure in the rural black religious community; he was born to former slaves Willis and Delia Scott.<ref name="Bagley"/>

At age 10, Coretta worked to increase the family's income.<ref>Gelfand, p. 17.</ref> She had an older sister named [[Edythe Scott Bagley]] (1924–2011), an older sister named Eunice who did not survive childhood, and a younger brother named Obadiah Leonard (1930–2012).<ref name="Gale"/> The Scott family had owned a farm since the [[American Civil War]], but were not particularly wealthy.<ref name="Vivian2006">{{cite book|author=Octavia B.

Coretta described herself as a tomboy during her childhood, primarily because she could climb trees and recalled wrestling boys. She also mentioned having been stronger than a male cousin and threatening before accidentally cutting that same cousin with an axe. His mother threatened her, and along with the words of her siblings, stirred her to becoming more ladylike once she got older. She saw irony in the fact that despite these early physical activities, she still was involved in nonviolent movements.<ref>{{cite news| title= Coretta Scott King: My Childhood as a Tomboy / Growing into a Lady| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FlFKG5p31k| publisher= Visionaryproject| accessdate= October 5, 2013| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131206221522/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FlFKG5p31k| archive-date= December 6, 2013| url-status= live}}</ref> Her brother Obadiah thought she always "tried to excel in everything she did."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndsDAAAAMBAJ&q=ebony+coretta&pg=PA160|title=Coretta King|date=September 1968|work=Ebony|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729163535/https://books.google.com/books?id=ndsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA160&dq=ebony+coretta|archive-date=July 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Her sister Edythe believed her personality was like that of their grandmother Cora McLaughlin Scott, after whom she was named.<ref>Bagley, p. 7.</ref>

The Scott children attended a [[One-room school|one-room]] [[elementary school]] {{convert|5|mi|0}} from their home and were later bused to [[Lincoln Normal School]], which despite being {{convert|9|mi|0|abbr=on}} from their home, was the closest black [[high school]] in [[Marion, Alabama]], due to [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in schools. The bus was driven by Coretta's mother Bernice, who bused all the local black teenagers.<ref name=Gale/> By the time Scott had entered the school, Lincoln had suspended tuition and charged only four dollars and fifty cents per year.<ref>Bagley, p. 62.</ref> In her last two years there, Scott became the leading soprano for the school's senior chorus.

Coretta said of her first college:

<blockquote>Antioch had envisioned itself as a laboratory in democracy but had no black students. (Edythe) became the first African American to attend Antioch on a completely integrated basis, and was joined by two other black female students in the fall of 1943. Pioneering is never easy, and all of us who followed my sister at Antioch owe her a great debt of gratitude.<ref name=King2004/></blockquote>

Coretta studied music with Walter Anderson, the first non-white chair of an academic department in a historically white college. She also became politically active, due largely to her experience of [[racial discrimination]] by the local [[board of education|school board]]. She became active in the nascent civil rights movement; she joined the Antioch chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and the college's Race Relations and Civil Liberties Committees. The board denied her request to perform her second year of required practice teaching at Yellow Springs public schools, for her teaching certificate Coretta Scott appealed to the Antioch College administration, which was unwilling or unable to change the situation in the local school system and instead employed her at the college's associated laboratory school for a second year. Additionally, around this time, Coretta worked as a babysitter for the Lithgow family, babysitting the later prominent actor [[John Lithgow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/celebrities/info-2017/john-lithgow-news-celebrity-interview.html|title=Upfront / What I Know Now: John Lithgow|last=Lithgow|first=John|date=August 24, 2017|website=AARP Magazine|access-date=August 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825101935/http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/celebrities/info-2017/john-lithgow-news-celebrity-interview.html|archive-date=August 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

== New England Conservatory of Music and Martin Luther King Jr. ==
Coretta transferred out of Antioch when she won a scholarship to the [[New England Conservatory|New England Conservatory of Music]] in [[Boston]]. It was while studying singing at that school with [[Marie Sundelius]] that she met Martin Luther King Jr.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coretta Scott King Dies at 78 |work=ABC News |date=January 31, 2006 |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/US/print?id=1560208 |accessdate=September 10, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612163216/https://abcnews.go.com/US/print?id=1560208 |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> after mutual friend Mary Powell gave King her phone number after he asked about girls on the campus. Coretta was the only one remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King would tell her that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met.<ref>Fleming, p. 16.</ref> She told him "I don't see how you can say that. You don't even know me." But King was assured and asked to see her again. She readily accepted his invitation to a weekend party.<ref>Dyson, p. 212.</ref>

She continued to see him regularly in the early months of 1952. Two weeks after meeting Scott, King wrote to his mother that he had met his wife.<ref>Bagley, pp.  96–98.</ref> Their dates usually consisted of political and racial discussions, and in August of that year Coretta met King's parents [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and [[Alberta Williams King]].<ref>Garrow, pp. 45–46.</ref> Before meeting Martin, Coretta had been in relationships her entire time in school but never had any she cared to develop.<ref>Bagley, p. 96.</ref> Once meeting with her sister Edythe face-to-face, Coretta detailed her feelings for the young aspiring minister and discussed the relationship as well. Edythe was able to tell her sister had legitimate feelings for him, and she also became impressed with his overall demeanor.<ref name=Bagley99>Bagley, p. 99.</ref>

Despite envisioning a career for herself in the music industry, Coretta knew that it would not be possible if she were to marry Martin Luther King. However, since King possessed many of the qualities she liked in a man, she found herself "becoming more involved with every passing moment." When asked by her sister what made King so "appealing" to her she responded, "I suppose it's because Martin reminds me so much of our father." At that moment, Scott's sister knew King was "the one."<ref name=Bagley99 />

King's parents visited him in the fall and had suspicions about Coretta Scott after seeing how clean his apartment was. While the Kings had tea and meals with their son and Scott, Martin Sr. turned his attention to her and insinuated that her plans of a career in music were not fitting for a Baptist minister's wife. After Coretta did not respond to his questioning of their romance being serious, Martin Sr. asked if she took his son "seriously".<ref name=Branch98>Branch, p. 98.</ref> King's father also told her that there were many other women his son was interested in and had "a lot to offer." After telling him that she had "a lot to offer" as well, Martin Luther King Sr. and his wife went on to try and meet with members of Coretta's family. Once the two obtained Edythe's number from Coretta, they sat down with her and had lunch with her. During their time together, Martin Luther King Sr. tried to ask Edythe about the relationship between her sister and his son. Edythe insisted that her sister was an excellent choice for Martin Luther King Jr., but also felt that Coretta did not need to bargain for a husband.<ref name=Bagley100>Bagley, p. 100.</ref>

On [[Valentine's Day]] 1953, the couple announced their plans to marry in the ''Atlanta Daily World''. With a wedding set in June, only four months away at that time, Coretta still did not have a commitment to marrying King and consulted with her sister in a letter sent just before Easter Vacation.<ref name=Bagley100 /> King's father had expressed resentment in his choice of Coretta over someone from Alabama and accused his son of spending too much time with her and neglecting his studies.<ref name=Fleming17/> Martin took his mother into another room and told her of his plans to marry Coretta and told her the same thing when he drove her home later while also berating her for not having made a good impression on his father.<ref name=Branch98/> When Martin declared his intentions to get a doctorate and marry Coretta after, Martin Sr. finally gave his blessing.<ref name=Fleming17>Fleming, p. 17.</ref> In 1964, the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' profile of Martin Luther King Jr., when he was chosen as ''Time'''s "[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]", referred to her as "a talented young soprano."<ref>{{cite news |title=Never Again Where He Was |work=Time Magazine |date=January 3, 1964 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940759-1,00.html |accessdate=September 10, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106233100/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940759-1,00.html |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> She was a member of [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] sorority.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mallard |first=Aida |url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20110126/GUARDIAN/110129586?p=2&tc=pg |title=King Commission, AKA sorority pay tribute to Coretta Scott King |website=Gainesville.com |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610194421/http://www.gainesville.com/article/20110126/GUARDIAN/110129586?p=2&tc=pg |archive-date=June 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Coretta Scott and Martin Luther King Jr. were married on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her mother's house; the ceremony was performed by Martin Jr.'s father, [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] Coretta had the vow to obey her husband removed from the ceremony, which was unusual for the time. After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: "After we married, we moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where my husband had accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before long, we found ourselves in the middle of the Montgomery bus boycott, and Martin was elected leader of the protest movement. As the boycott continued, I had a growing sense that I was involved in something so much greater than myself, something of profound historic importance. I came to the realization that we had been thrust into the forefront of a movement to liberate oppressed people, not only in Montgomery but also throughout our country, and this movement had worldwide implications. I felt blessed to have been called to be a part of such a noble and historic cause."<ref>{{cite web|title=Coretta Scott King Biography and Interview|website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/coretta-scott-king/#interview|access-date=April 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818001204/https://www.achievement.org/achiever/coretta-scott-king/#interview|archive-date=August 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Martin Luther, Coretta Scott and Yolanda Denise King, 1956.png|thumb|right|King with her husband and daughter [[Yolanda King|Yolanda]] in 1956]]
On September 1, 1954, Martin Luther King Jr. became the full-time pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. It was a sacrifice for Coretta, who had to give up her dreams of becoming a classical singer. Martin Luther King Jr. expected her to stay home and take care of their future children. Her devotion to the cause while giving up on her own ambitions would become symbolic of the actions of African-American women during the movement.<ref>Nazel, p. 69.</ref> The couple moved into the church's parsonage on South Jackson Street shortly after this. Coretta became a member of the choir and taught Sunday school, as well as participating in the Baptist Training Union and Missionary Society. She made her first appearance at the First Baptist Church on March 6, 1955, where according to E. P. Wallace, she "captivated her concert audience."<ref>Bagley, p. 108.</ref>

The Kings welcomed their first child [[Yolanda King|Yolanda]] on November 17, 1955, who was named at Coretta's insistence and became the church's attention.<ref>Bagley, p. 111.</ref> After her husband became involved in the [[Montgomery bus boycott]], King often received threats directed towards him. In January 1956, King answered numerous phone calls threatening her husband's life, as rumors intended to make African Americans dissatisfied with King's husband spread that Martin had purchased a Buick station wagon for her.<ref>Bagley, p. 125.</ref> Martin Luther King Jr. would give her the nickname "Yoki," and thereby, allow himself to refer to her out of her name. By the end of the boycott, Mrs. King and her husband had come to believe in [[nonviolent]] protests as a way of expression consistent with biblical teachings.<ref>Bagley, p. 144.</ref> Two days after the integration of Montgomery's bus service, on December 23, a gunshot rang through the front door of the King home while King, her husband and Yolanda were asleep. The three were not harmed.<ref>Garrow, p. 83.</ref> On Christmas Eve of 1955, King took her daughter to her parents' house and met with her siblings as well. Yolanda was their first grandchild. King's husband joined them the next day, at dinner time.<ref>Bagley, p. 124.</ref>

On February 21, 1956, King's husband announced he would return to Montgomery after picking up Coretta and their daughter from Atlanta, who were staying with his parents. During Martin Luther King Sr.'s opposition to his son's choice to return to Montgomery, Mrs. King picked up her daughter and went upstairs, which he would express dismay in later and tell her that she "had run out on him." Two days later, Coretta and her husband drove back to Montgomery.<ref>Garrow, p. 65.</ref> Coretta took an active role in advocating for civil rights legislation.  On April 25, 1958, King made her first appearance at a concert that year at Peter High School Auditorium in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. With a performance sponsored by the Omicron Lambda chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity, King changed a few songs in the first part of the show but still continued with the basic format used two years earlier at the New York gala as she told the story of the Montgomery bus boycott. The concert was important for Coretta as a way to continue her professional career and participate in the movement. The concert gave the audience "an emotional connection to the messages of social, economic, and spiritual transformation."<ref>Bagley, p. 150.</ref>

On September 3, 1958, King accompanied her husband and [[Ralph Abernathy]] to a courtroom. Her husband was arrested outside the courtroom for "loitering" and "failing to obey an officer."<ref>Darby, p. 47.</ref> A few weeks later, King visited Martin's parents in Atlanta. At that time, she learned that he had been stabbed while signing copies of his book ''[[Stride Toward Freedom]]'' on September 20, 1958. King rushed to see her husband, and stayed with him for the remainder of his time in the hospital recovering.<ref>McPherson, p. 46.</ref> On February 3, 1959, King, her husband and [[Lawrence Reddick]] started a five-week tour of India. The three were invited to hundreds of engagements.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/india-trip|title=India Trip (1959)|access-date=December 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211144903/https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/india-trip|archive-date=December 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> During their trip, Coretta used her singing ability to enthuse crowds during their month-long stay. The two returned to the United States on March 10, 1959.<ref>Darby, p. 51.</ref>

===House bombing===
On January 30, 1956, Coretta and Dexter congregation member Roscoe Williams's wife Mary Lucy heard the "sound of a brick striking the concrete floor of the front porch." Coretta suggested that the two women get out of the front room and went into the guest room, as the house was disturbed by an explosion which caused the house to rock and fill the front room with smoke and shattered glass. The two went to the rear of the home, where Yolanda was sleeping and Coretta called the First Baptist Church and reported the bombing to the woman who answered the phone.<ref>Garrow, pp. 59–60.</ref> Martin returned to their home, and upon finding Coretta and his daughter unharmed, went outside. He was confronted by an angry crowd of his supporters, who had brought guns. He was able to turn them away with an [[impromptu]] speech.<ref>Burns, p. 134.</ref>

A white man was reported by a lone witness to have walked halfway up to King's door and thrown something against the door before running back to his car and speeding off. Ernest Walters, the lone witness, did not manage to get the license plate number because of how quickly the events transpired.<ref>Gibson Robinson, p. 131.</ref> Both of the couple's fathers contacted them over the bombing. The two arrived nearly at the same time, along with her husband's mother and brother. Coretta's father Obie said he would take her and her daughter back to Marion if his son-in-law did not take them to Atlanta. Coretta refused the proclamation and insisted on staying with her husband.<ref>Garrow, p. 61.</ref> Despite Martin Luther King Sr. also advocating that she leave with her father, King persisted in leaving with him. Author Octavia B. Vivian wrote "That night Coretta lost her fear of dying. She committed herself more deeply to the freedom struggle, as Martin had done four days previously when jailed for the first time in his life." Coretta would later call it the first time she realized "how much I meant to Martin in terms of supporting him in what he was doing".<ref>Vivian, p. 20.</ref>

===John F. Kennedy phone call===
Martin Luther King was jailed on October 19, 1960, for picketing in a department store. After being released three days later, Coretta's husband was sent back to jail on October 22 for driving with an Alabama license while being a resident of Georgia and was sent to jail for four months of hard labor. After her husband's arrest, King believed he would not make it out alive and telephoned her friend [[Harris Wofford]] and cried while saying "They're going to kill him. I know they are going to kill him." Directly after speaking with her, Wofford contacted [[Sargent Shriver]] in Chicago, where presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] was campaigning at the time and told Shriver of King's fears for her husband. After Shriver waited to be with Kennedy alone, he suggested that he telephone King and express sympathy.<ref>O'Brien, p. 485.</ref> Kennedy called King, after agreeing to the proposal.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Sometime afterward, [[Robert F. Kennedy]] obtained King's release from prison. Martin Luther King Sr. was so grateful for the release that he voted for Kennedy and said: "I'll take a Catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes."<ref>Goduti, p. 39.</ref> According to Coretta, Kennedy said "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I just want you to know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me." Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it "made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt."<ref>Matthews, p. 171.</ref>

===Kennedy presidency===
During Kennedy's presidency, she and her husband had come to respect him and understood his reluctance at times to get involved openly with civil rights.<ref>Bagley, p. 192.</ref> In April 1962, Coretta served as a delegate for the [[Women Strike for Peace|Women Strike for Peace Conference]] in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>McCarty, p. xiii.</ref> Martin drove her to the hospital on March 28, 1963, where King gave birth to their fourth child [[Bernice King|Bernice.]] After King and her daughter were due to come home, Martin rushed back to drive them himself.<ref>McPherson, p. 56.</ref>
After her husband's arrest on April 12, 1963, King tried to make direct contact with President Kennedy at the advisement of [[Wyatt Tee Walker]] and succeeded in speaking with Robert F. Kennedy. President Kennedy was with his father [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr]], who was not feeling well.<ref>Mahoney, p. 247</ref> In what has been noted as making Kennedy seem less sympathetic towards the Kings, the president redirected Mrs. King's call to the White House switchboard.<ref name=Branch736>Branch, p. 736.</ref>

The next day, President Kennedy reported to King that the FBI had been sent into Birmingham the previous night and confirmed that her husband was fine. He was allowed to speak with her on the phone and told her to inform Walker of Kennedy's involvement.<ref>Fairclough, p. 77.</ref> She told her husband of her assistance from the Kennedys, which her husband took as the reason "why everybody is suddenly being so polite."<ref>Schlesinger, p. 328.</ref> Regarding the [[March on Washington]], Coretta said, "It was as though heaven had come down."<ref>Willis, p. 166.</ref> Coretta had been home all day with their children, since the birth of their daughter Bernice had not allowed her to attend Easter Sunday church services.<ref>McPherson, p. 57.</ref> Since Mrs. King had issued her own statement regarding the aid of the president instead of doing as her husband had told her and report to [[Wyatt Walker]], this according to author [[Taylor Branch]], made her portrayed by reports as "an anxious new mother who may have confused her White House fantasies with reality."<ref name=Branch736 />

Coretta went to a Women Strike for Peace rally in New York, in the early days of November 1963. After speaking at the meeting held in the National Baptist Church, King joined the march from Central Park to the United Nations Headquarters. The march was timed to celebrate the group's second anniversary and celebrated the successful completion of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Coretta and Martin learned of [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy's assassination]] when reports initially indicated he had only been seriously wounded. King joined her husband upstairs and watched [[Walter Cronkite]] announce the president's death. King sat with her visibly shaken husband following the confirmation.<ref>Bagley, p. 181.</ref>

===FBI tapes===
{{Main|FBI–King suicide letter}}

[[File:HHH-CKS-MLK-1964.jpg|thumb|right|Coretta Scott with [[Martin Luther King Jr.|her husband]] and Vice President-elect [[Hubert Humphrey]] on December 17, 1964]]
The FBI planned to [[FBI–King suicide letter|mail tapes]] of her husband's alleged affairs to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference office since surveillance revealed that Coretta opened her husband's mail when he was traveling. The FBI learned that King would be out of office by the time the tapes were mailed and that his wife would be the one to open it.<ref>(Gentry, pg. 572–573.)</ref> [[J. Edgar Hoover]] even advised to mail "it from a southern state."<ref>Gentry, p. 572.</ref> Coretta sorted the tapes with the rest of the mail, listened to them, and immediately called her husband, "giving the Bureau a great deal of pleasure with the tone and tenor of her reactions."<ref>Gentry, p. 575.</ref> King played the tape in her presence, along with [[Andrew Young]], [[Ralph Abernathy]] and [[Joseph Lowery]]. Publicly, Mrs. King would say "I couldn't make much out of it, it was just a lot of mumbo-jumbo."<ref>Dyson, p. 217.</ref> The tapes were part of a larger attempt by J. Edgar Hoover to denounce King by revelations in his personal life.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Johnson presidency ===
Most prominently, perhaps, she worked hard to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. King spoke with [[Malcolm X]] days before his assassination. Malcolm X told her that he was not in Alabama to make trouble for her husband, but instead to make white people have more appreciation for King's protests, seeing his alternative.<ref>{{cite book |title=Malcolm X: Rights Activist and Nation of Islam Leader |url=https://archive.org/details/malcolmxrightsac0000robi |url-access=registration |first=Tom |last=Robinson |page=[https://archive.org/details/malcolmxrightsac0000robi/page/54 54] |publisher=Abdo |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-61783-893-4 |access-date=November 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802073131/https://archive.org/details/malcolmxrightsac0000robi |archive-date=August 2, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> On March 26, 1965, King's father joined her and her husband for a [[Selma to Montgomery marches|march that would later end in Montgomery]]. Her father "caught a glimpse of America's true potential" and for the called it "the greatest day in the whole history of America" after seeing chanting for his daughter's husband by both Caucasians and African Americans.<ref>Bagley, p. 30.</ref>

Coretta Scott King criticized the sexism of the Civil Rights Movement in January 1966 in ''New Lady'' magazine, saying in part, "Not enough attention has been focused on the roles played by women in the struggle. By and large, men have formed the leadership in the civil rights struggle but...women have been the backbone of the whole civil rights movement."<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwVbfvfYEZkC&q=rosa+parks+%22You've+said+enough%22&pg=PA408 |title=Civil Rights History from the Ground Up: Local Struggles, a National Movement |isbn=9780820338651 |accessdate=May 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315091240/http://books.google.com/books?id=gwVbfvfYEZkC&pg=PA408&lpg=PA408&dq=rosa+parks+%22You've+said+enough%22&source=bl&ots=rOsSH_BAPw&sig=boOoZWgenR2iHSw50Ots6duyqcc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aK2kUojKF6_gsATI5IH4Aw&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=rosa%20parks%20%22You've%20said%20enough%22&f=false |archive-date=March 15, 2015 |url-status=live |last1=Crosby |first1=Emilye |year=2011 }}</ref> Martin Luther King Jr. himself limited Coretta's role in the movement, and expected her to be a housewife.<ref name="books.google.com"/> King participated in a Women Strike for Peace protest in January 1968, at the capital of Washington, D.C. with over five thousand women.

== Assassination of her husband ==

Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968.

In an effort to prepare her daughter Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she tried to explain to her that the next time she saw her father he would be in a casket and would not be speaking.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/25/us/bernice-king-profile/| title=Moving out of the dreamer's shadow: A King daughter's long journey| date=August 25, 2013| first=John| last=Blake| work=CNN| access-date=November 30, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054202/http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/25/us/bernice-king-profile/| archive-date=December 3, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref> When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and told him that his father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert F. Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis.<ref name=Gelfand7/> Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination and asked if he could persuade [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] to attend her husband's funeral with him.<ref>Heymann, p. 149.</ref>

Robert F. Kennedy promised her that he would help "any way" he could. King was told to not go ahead and agree to Kennedy's offer by Southern Christian Leadership Conference members, who told her about his presidential ambitions. She ignored the warnings and went along with his request.<ref>Schlesinger, p. 876.</ref>
On April 5, 1968, King arrived in Memphis to retrieve her husband's body and decided that the casket should be kept open during the funeral with the hope that her children would realize upon seeing his body that he would not be coming home.<ref name=Gelfand7>Gelfand, p. 7.</ref> King called photographer Bob Fitch and asked for documentation to be done, having known him for years.<ref>Burns, p. 75.</ref> On April 7, 1968, former Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] visited King and recalled his first meeting with her husband in 1955. Nixon also went to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s funeral on April 9, 1968, but did not walk in the procession. Nixon believed participating in the procession would be "grandstanding."<ref>Black, p. 523.</ref>

On April 8, 1968, King and her children headed a march with sanitation workers that her husband had planned to carry out before his death. After the marchers reached the staging area at the Civic Center Plaza in front of Memphis City Hall, onlookers proceeded to take pictures of King and her children but stopped when she addressed everyone at a microphone. She said that despite the Martin Luther King Jr. being away from his children at times, "his children knew that Daddy loved them, and the time that he spent with them was well spent."<ref>Burns, pp. 119–120.</ref> Prior to Martin's funeral, Jacqueline Kennedy met with her. The two spent five minutes together and despite the short visit, Coretta called it comforting. King's parents arrived from Alabama.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19680418&id=DdJNAAAAIBAJ&pg=7408,5180714|title=Coretta King Expected to Take Active Role in Crusade|date=April 18, 1968|work=The Free Lance-Star|first=Jules|last=Loh|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043605/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19680418&id=DdJNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WYoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7408,5180714|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Robert and [[Ethel Kennedy]] came, the latter being embraced by King.<ref>Oppenheimer, p. 417.</ref> King and her sister-in-law [[Christine King Farris]] tried to prepare the children for seeing Martin's body.<ref>Burns, p. 129.</ref> With the end of the funeral service, King led her children and mourners in a march from the church to [[Morehouse College]], her late husband's alma mater.<ref>Gelfand, p. 12.</ref>

=== Early widowhood ===
Two days after her husband's death, King spoke at Ebenezer Baptist Church and made her first statement on his views since he had died. She said her husband told their children, "If a man had nothing that was worth dying for, then he was not fit to live." She brought up his ideals and the fact that he may be dead, but concluded that "his spirit will never die."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTgDAAAAMBAJ&q=coretta&pg=PA30|title=Widow Hopes For Fulfillment of King's Dream|date=April 18, 1968|work=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043605/https://books.google.com/books?id=VTgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=martin+luther+king+jet&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FDjTUqWYCsXuoASayoKQBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=coretta&f=false|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Not very long after the assassination, Coretta took his place at a peace rally in [[New York City]].

New York: Harper & Row Publishers, 1977.</ref> Shortly after that King decided to take the helm of the movement herself.

Coretta Scott King eventually broadened her focus to include [[women's rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], economic issues, world peace, and various other causes. As early as December 1968, she called for women to "unite and form a solid block of women power to fight the three great evils of [[racism]], [[poverty]] and [[war]]", during a Solidarity Day speech.<ref name="NAPF">{{cite web|last=Pappas |first=Heather |title=Coretta Scott King |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/programs/youth-outreach/peace-heroes/king-coretta.htm |accessdate=September 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012021241/http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/programs/youth-outreach/peace-heroes/king-coretta.htm |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> On April 27, 1968, King spoke at an anti-war demonstration in Central Park in place of her husband.

Not long after this, the King household was visited by [[Mike Wallace]], who wanted to visit her and the rest of her family and see how they were fairing that coming Christmas. She introduced her family to Wallace and also expressed her belief that there would not be another Martin Luther King Jr. because he comes around "once in a century" or "maybe once in a thousand years".

As a leader of the movement, King founded the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change]] in Atlanta.

On April 1, 1998, at the [[Palmer House]] [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] in [[Chicago]], King called on the civil rights community to join in the struggle against [[homophobia]] and anti-gay bias. "Homophobia is like racism and [[anti-Semitism]] and other forms of [[bigotry]] in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood", she stated.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQpKJRlgnrAC&q=Homophobia+is+like+racism+and+anti-Semitism+and+other+forms+of+bigotry+in+that+it+seeks+to+dehumanize+a+large+group+of+people,+to+deny+their+humanity,&pg=PA117 |title=Coretta Scott King: Civil Rights Activist – Dale Evva Gelfand, Lisa Renee Rhodes – Google Books |isbn=9781438100777 |accessdate=May 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043605/https://books.google.com/books?id=VQpKJRlgnrAC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=Homophobia+is+like+racism+and+anti-Semitism+and+other+forms+of+bigotry+in+that+it+seeks+to+dehumanize+a+large+group+of+people,+to+deny+their+humanity,&source=bl&ots=3sxG1tZe87&sig=V8YzDekRnWSy5i0au5D7DgVWus8&hl=en&ei=yZHZTp6sDena0QGA-53TDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Homophobia%20is%20like%20racism%20and%20anti-Semitism%20and%20other%20forms%20of%20bigotry%20in%20that%20it%20seeks%20to%20dehumanize%20a%20large%20group%20of%20people%2C%20to%20deny%20their%20humanity%2C&f=false |archive-date=October 19, 2015 |url-status=live |last1=Gelfand |first1=Dale Evva |last2=Rhodes |first2=Lisa Renee |year=2009 }}</ref> "This sets the stage for further repression and violence that spread all too easily to victimize the next [[minority group]]."

In 1984, she came under criticism by [[Hosea Williams]], one of her husband's earliest followers, for having used the King Center to promote "authentic material" on her husband's dreams and ideals, and disqualified the merchandise as an attempt to exploit her husband. She sanctioned the kit, which contained a wall poster, five photographs of King and his family, a cassette of the [[I Have a Dream]] speech, a booklet of tips on how to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day and five postcards with quotations from King himself. She believed it to be the authentic way to celebrate the holiday honoring her husband, and denied Hosea's claims.<ref>{{cite web|title=Merchandising of Martin Luther King|publisher=Mike Gardner|year=1984|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBgmkQt1m9w|accessdate=October 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206204927/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBgmkQt1m9w|archive-date=December 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

King sued her husband's alma mater of [[Boston University]] over who would keep over 83,000 documents in December 1987 and said the documents belonged with the King archives. However, her husband was held to his word by the university; he had stated after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 that his papers would be kept at the college. Coretta's lawyers argued that the statement was not binding and mentioned that King had not left a will at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsIDAAAAMBAJ&q=coretta+scott+king+jet|title=Coretta King, Boston Univ.

On May 6, 1993, a court rejected her claims to the papers after finding that a July 16, 1964 letter King's husband wrote to the institute had constituted a binding charitable pledge to the university and outright stating that Martin Luther King retained ownership of his papers until giving them to the university as gifts or his death.

The Center opened in 2007 on the Antioch College campus.

The Center lists its mission as "The Coretta Scott King Center facilitates learning, dialogue, and action to advance social justice," and its vision as "To transform lives, the nation and the world by cultivating change agents, collaborating with communities, and fostering networks to advance human rights and social justice."<ref>{{cite web|title=Coretta Scott King Center for Cultural and Intellectual Freedom|url=https://www.antiochcollege.edu/coretta-scott-king-center|access-date=January 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112042558/https://www.antiochcollege.edu/coretta-scott-king-center|archive-date=January 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Martin often called Coretta "Corrie," even when the two were still only dating.<ref name=Garrow49>Garrow, p. 49.</ref>
The FBI captured a dispute between the couple in the middle of 1964, where the two both blamed each other for making the [[Civil Rights Movement]] even more difficult. Martin confessed in a 1965 sermon of his secretary having to remind him of his wife's birthday and the couple's wedding anniversary.<ref>Dyson, p. 215.</ref> For a time, many accompanying her husband would usually hear Coretta argue with him in telephone conversations. King resented her husband whenever he failed to call her about the children while he was away, and learned of his plans to not include her in formal visits, such as the [[White House]]. However, when King failed to meet to his own standards by missing a plane and fell into a level of despair, Coretta told her husband over the phone that "I believe in you, if that means anything."<ref>Frady, pp. 66–67.</ref> Author Ron Ramdin wrote "King faced many new and trying moments, his refuge was home and closeness to Coretta, whose calm and soothing voice whenever she sang, gave him renewed strength. She was the rock upon which his marriage and civil rights leadership, especially at this time of crisis, was founded."<ref>Ramdin, p. 35.</ref>

After she succeeded in getting Martin Luther King Jr. Day made a federal holiday, King said her husband's dream was "for people of all religions, all socio-economic levels and all cultures to create a world community free from violence, poverty, racism and war so that they could live together in what he called the beloved community or his world house concept."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7QDAAAAMBAJ&q=jet+coretta+scott+king|title=Martin Luther King, Jr.: His Widow Keeps His Dream Alive|date=January 20, 1986|work=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043605/https://books.google.com/books?id=o7QDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=jet+coretta+scott+king&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hJvUUvC9OdLuoATI2IHoBw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=jet%20coretta%20scott%20king&f=false|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

King considered raising children in a society that discriminated against them seriously, and spoke against her husband whenever the two disagreed on financial needs of their family.<ref>Jackson, p. 47.</ref> The Kings had four children; [[Yolanda King|Yolanda]], [[Martin Luther King III|Martin III]], [[Dexter Scott King|Dexter]] and [[Bernice King|Bernice]].

The King family has mostly been criticized for their handling of Martin Luther King Jr.'s estate, both while Coretta was alive and after her death. The King family sued a California auction in 1992, the family's attorneys filing claims of stolen property against Superior Galleries in Los Angeles Superior Court for the document's return.

== Legacy ==
Coretta was viewed during her lifetime and posthumously as having strived to preserve her husband's legacy. The King Center, which she created the year of his assassination, allowed her husband's tomb to be memorialized. King was buried with her husband after her death, on February 7, 2006.  King "fought to preserve his legacy" and her construction of the King Center is said to have aided in her efforts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=20070113&id=HW8iAAAAIBAJ&pg=1459,797314|title=King holiday tributes to honor legacy, wife Coretta who died last year|first=Errin|last=Haines|work=The Argus-Press|date=January 13, 2007|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043605/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=20070113&id=HW8iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Hq0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1459,797314|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

King has been linked and associated with [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] and [[Ethel Kennedy]], as the three all lost their husbands to assassinations. The three were together when Coretta flew to Los Angeles after the [[assassination of Robert F.

She is seen as being primarily responsible for the creation of the federal [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]]. The holiday is now observed in all fifty states and has been since 2000. The first observance of the holiday after her death was commemorated with speeches, visits to the couple's tomb and the opening of a collection of Martin Luther King Jr.'s papers. Her sister-in-law [[Christine King Farris]] said, "It is in her memory and her honor that we must carry this program on. This is as she would have it."<ref name=Observance />

On February 7, 2017, Republicans in the Senate voted that Sen. [[Elizabeth Warren]] had violated [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XIX|Senate rule 19]] during the debate on attorney general nominee Sen. [[Jeff Sessions]], claiming that she impugned his character when she quoted statements made about Sessions by Coretta and Sen. [[Ted Kennedy]]. "Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen," Coretta wrote in a 1986 letter to Sen. [[Strom Thurmond]], which Warren attempted to read on the Senate floor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-coretta-scott-king-letter-jeff-sessions/index.html|title=The Coretta Scott King Letter Elizabeth Warren was Trying to Read|last=|first=|date=February 8, 2017|website=CNN|access-date=February 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209200053/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/politics/elizabeth-warren-coretta-scott-king-letter-jeff-sessions/index.html|archive-date=February 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This action prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions' nomination for [[United States Attorney General]].

In 2006, the [[Jewish National Fund]], the organization that works to plant trees in Israel, announced the creation of the Coretta Scott King forest in the Galilee region of Northern Israel, with the purpose of "perpetuating her memory of equality and peace", as well as the work of her husband.<ref name="JNF">{{cite web |url=http://support.jnf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=king |title=Jewish National Fund – Coretta Scott King Forest |publisher=Support.jnf.org |date=April 8, 1968 |accessdate=May 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220163319/http://support.jnf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=king |archive-date=February 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> When she learned about this plan, King wrote to Israel's parliament:

<blockquote>On April 3, 1968, the day before he was killed, Martin delivered his last public address. In it he spoke of the visit he and I made to Israel. Moreover, he spoke to us about his vision of the Promised Land, a land of justice and equality, brotherhood and peace. Martin dedicated his life to the goals of peace and unity among all peoples, and perhaps nowhere in the world is there a greater appreciation of the desirability and necessity of peace than in Israel.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}</blockquote>

In 2007, The [[Coretta Scott King Young Women's Leadership Academy]] (CSKYWLA) was opened in Atlanta, Georgia. At its inception, the school served girls in grade 6 with plans for expansion to grade 12 by 2014. CSKYWLA is a public school in the [[Atlanta Public Schools]] system. Among the staff and students, the acronym for the school's name, CSKYWLA (pronounced "see-skee-WAH-lah"), has been coined as a protologism to which this definition has given – "to be empowered by scholarship, non-violence, and social change." That year was also the first observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day following her death, and she was also honored.<ref name=Observance>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/16/nation/na-briefs16.1|title=Coretta King also honored on MLK Day|date=January 16, 2007|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304042219/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/16/nation/na-briefs16.1|archive-date=March 4, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
 
[[Super Bowl XL]] was dedicated to King and [[Rosa Parks]]. Both were memorialized with a moment of silence during the pregame ceremonies. The children of both Parks and King then helped [[Tom Brady]] with the ceremonial [[coin toss]]. In addition two choirs representing the states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (King's home state) and [[Alabama]] (Park's home state) accompanied [[Dr. John]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Aaron Neville]] in the singing of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Congressional resolutions ===
Upon the news of her death, moments of reflection, remembrance, and mourning began around the world. In the [[United States Senate]], [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist]] presented Senate Resolution 362 on behalf of all U.S. Senators, with the afternoon hours filled with respectful tributes throughout the U.S. Capitol.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On August 31, 2006, following a moment of silence in memoriam of the death of Coretta Scott King, the [[United States House of Representatives]] presented House Resolution 655 in honor of her legacy. In an unusual action, the resolution included a grace period of five days in which further comments could be added to it.<ref>Katz, Jonathan G.
