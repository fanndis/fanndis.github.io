Since 2015, Rusbridger has been Principal of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]] in the [[University of Oxford]]. He was appointed chair of the University's [[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/alan-rusbridger-chair-reuters-institute-study-journalism |title=Alan Rusbridger to Chair Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism |publisher=[[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]] |date=25 April 2016 }}</ref> In 2020, Rusbridger was announced as one of the first members of the [[Oversight Board]] created by [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52558559 |title=Facebook's 'supreme court' members announced |first=Jane |last=Wakefield |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=6 May 2020 }}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early career===
Rusbridger was born in [[Lusaka]],<ref name="Auletta">Ken Auletta [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/10/07/131007fa_fact_auletta?currentPage=all&mobify=0 "Annals of Communications: Freedom of Information"], ''The New Yorker'', 7 October 2013</ref> [[Northern Rhodesia]], a [[protectorate]] (now [[Zambia]]), the son of B. E. (née Wickham) and G. H. Rusbridger, the Director of Education of Northern Rhodesia. When Rusbridger was five, the family returned to Britain<ref name="Auletta"/> and he was educated at [[Lanesborough School|Lanesborough Prep School]], Guildford, where he was also a chorister at Christ Church, and [[Cranleigh School]], a boys' independent school in Surrey. At [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], he read English Literature. During the vacations of his first two years at university, he worked for the ''[[Cambridge News|Cambridge Evening News]]'' as an intern, and accepted a job offer from the newspaper after graduation. He stayed with the ''Evening News'' until 1979.<ref name="Auletta"/>

He then joined ''The Guardian'' as a reporter, and subsequently wrote the paper's diary column and later became a feature writer.  In November 1985, Rusbridger had a brief stint as a Royal reporter following the Prince and Princess of Wales around Melbourne, Australia. Fascinated by gadgets, at this stage he was already using a Tandy word processor and an early (slow) modem to file stories back to London.<ref>Alan Rusbridger [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/32626 "Alan Rusbridger – Editor, The Guardian"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108131555/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/32626 |date=8 January 2014 }}, ''Press Gazette'', 23 November 2005.</ref> He left in 1986 to become TV critic of ''[[The Observer]]'', then an entirely separate newspaper, before moving to America to be the Washington editor of the short-lived  ''[[London Daily News]]'' in 1987.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/qb54z7/a-morons-guide-to-alan-rusbridger-guardian|title=A Moron's Guide to Alan Rusbridger|date=22 August 2013|work=Vice|access-date=4 September 2018|language=en-uk}}</ref>

After returning to ''The Guardian'', he launched the "Weekend" supplement in 1988, followed by the paper's "G2" section. He became features editor in 1994.<ref name="PRW96">Stephen Armstrong [http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/94964/MEDIA-PROFILE-Guardian-journalistic-integrity-Alan-Rusbridger-Editor-Guardian/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH "MEDIA: PROFILE; Guardian of journalistic integrity: Alan Rusbridger, Editor, the Guardian"], ''PR Week'', 11 October 1996.</ref>

===Editor of ''The Guardian''===
====Appointment and early years====
Rusbridger was appointed as the editor of ''The Guardian'' by the [[Scott Trust]] in late January 1995 after a decisive vote of the [[National Union of Journalists]] chapel, management and trustees in an electoral college.<ref>Maggie Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/guardian-names-its-new-editor-1569476.html "''Guardian'' names its new editor"]. ''The Independent'', 25 January 1995</ref>

As editor he defended the paper against a number of high-profile defamation suits, including those from the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]] and the Conservative MPs, [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Jonathan Aitken]]. In the case involving Hamilton, and the lobbyist [[Cash-for-questions affair|Ian Greer]], he said: "They weren’t going to fight us in the court so they tried to do it through the TV studio." Rusbridger countered them by being available for TV interviews over three days to ensure that their version of events did not gain precedence.<ref name="PRW96"/> Hamilton's case collapsed shortly before a court hearing, while Aitken was demonstrated to have perjured himself, and served a prison sentence as a result.<ref>Alan Rusbridger [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/may/10/alan-rusbridger-libel-reform-speech "The long, slow road to libel reform"]. The Guardian, 10 May 2011.</ref>

Seen early in his editorship as a modernising new broom, he commented in June 1997 shortly after the election of [[Tony Blair]]'s first [[New Labour]] government that the "old" ''Guardian'': "opposed lots of things the Tories did which we'd now think weren't terribly bad in retrospect&nbsp;... I mean, a lot of the trade union stuff doesn't seem as horrendous now as it seemed at the time."<ref name="Brown">Rob Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/new-government-new-guardian-alan-rusbridger-is-shaking-up-his-staff-with-blairite-conviction-1253795.html "New Government! New Guardian! Alan Rusbridger is shaking up his staff with Blairite conviction"]. ''The Independent'', 2 June 1997.</ref> From around 1997, he oversaw the launch and development of the newspaper's website,<ref name="Wilby12"/> initially known as ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/31/alan-rusbridger-who-broke-the-news|title=Alan Rusbridger: who broke the news?|last=Rusbridger|first=Alan|date=31 August 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 September 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

====Berliner, digital and corporate====
In September 2005 ''The Guardian'' responded to the tabloid re-launches of ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' by moving from a [[broadsheet]] format to the [[Berliner (format)|"Berliner" format]], which is common in the rest of Europe. The print edition of the newspaper still accounted for about 75% of the company's revenue around 2012. In a profile of Rusbridger though, published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' at the end of May 2012, former newspaper editor [[Peter Wilby]] cast doubt on whether Rusbridger's enthusiasm for online journalism, freely available without a paywall, and the large amount of money invested by the group, would ever gain a return or ensure the long-term survival of the newspaper.<ref name="Wilby12">Peter Wilby [http://www.newstatesman.com/media/media/2012/05/guardian-editor-alan-rusbridger-peter-wilby "Alan Rusbridger: the quiet evangelist"], ''New Statesman'', 30 May 2012.</ref>

Until May 2016,<ref name="BBC130516">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36287551|title=Former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger leaves Scott Trust|work=BBC News|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref> he was a member of the board of Guardian News and Media, of the main board of the [[Guardian Media Group]] and of the [[Scott Trust]], which owns ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', of which he was executive editor. Rusbridger received £471,000 in pay and benefits in 2008–9,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/31/guardian-alan-rusbridger ''Guardian'' profile.]</ref> but then volunteered to a series of pay cuts, bringing his revenue to £395,000 in fiscal year 2012.<ref name="Auletta"/>

====Publication of Wikileaks and Edward Snowden material====
As editor-in-chief, in August 2013 Rusbridger took the decision to destroy hard drives containing information leaked to ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Edward Snowden]], rather than comply with a government demand to hand over the data. An alternative action was agreed and in the presence of the authorities the drives were destroyed, Rusbridger described performing the task as "slightly pointless". "Given that there were other copies, I saw no reason not to destroy this material ourselves."<ref>{{cite news
|title=Rusbridger: destroying hard drives allowed us to continue NSA coverage
|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/20/guardian-editor-alan-rusbridger-nsa}}</ref>

On 3 December 2013 Rusbridger gave evidence before a Home Affairs Select Committee hearing on counterterrorism at the [[UK Parliament]] with regard to the publication of information leaked by Snowden.<ref>Anthony Faiola, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/guardian-editor-defends-publication-of-snowden-files/2013/12/03/8204608e-5c49-11e3-8d24-31c016b976b2_story.html "Guardian editor defends publication of Snowden files"], ''The Washington Post'', 3 December 2012.</ref>

In the film ''[[The Fifth Estate (film)|The Fifth Estate]]'' (2013), about ''The Guardian''{{'}}s former association with the [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]], Rusbridger was portrayed by [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref>{{IMDb title|1837703|The Fifth Estate}}</ref>

====Resignation====

In December 2014, Rusbridger announced he would step down as editor of ''The Guardian'' in the summer of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30420374|title=Alan Rusbridger to step down as Guardian editor-in-chief|work=BBC News|date=10 December 2014}}</ref> On 20 March 2015, ''The Guardian'' announced [[Katharine Viner]] as Rusbridger's successor.<ref name="Guardian2015" />

Rusbridger was to have succeeded [[Liz Forgan|Dame Liz Forgan]] as chair of the [[Scott Trust]] in September 2016,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11285693/Guardian-editor-Alan-Rusbridger-to-step-down-next-summer.html "Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger to step down next summer"], telegraph.co.uk, 10 December 2014</ref><ref>Media Mole [http://www.newstatesman.com/media-mole/2014/12/alan-rusbridger-stepping-down-guardian-editor-chief "Alan Rusbridger stepping down as Guardian editor-in-chief"], ''New Statesman'' website, 10 December 2014</ref> but announced on 13 May 2016 that he would not take up the post.<ref name="BBC130516"/> The expansion in the later years of Rusbridger's editorship led to unsustainable losses and several hundred job cuts were planned. According to a report in ''The Times'' in April 2016, staff were opposed to Rusbridger returning.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rigby|first=Elizabeth|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/guardian-staff-fury-at-rusbridger-return-rg7rmbs5r|title=Guardian staff furious as Rusbridger set to return|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref> Viner and chief executive David Pemsel were also opposed to Rusbridger becoming Chair of the Scott Trust.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ponsford|first=Dominic|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/alan-rusbridger-drops-plan-return-scott-trust-chair-face-opposite-guardian-editor-viner-and-chief|title=Alan Rusbridger falls on his sword rather than chair Scott Trust opposed by editor and chief executive|work=Press Gazette|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref>
