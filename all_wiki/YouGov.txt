'''Galaxy Research''' was an Australian market researching company that provided opinion polling for state and federal politics. Its polls were published in [[News Limited]] tabloid newspapers, including the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', ''[[Courier-Mail]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' (in contrast to [[Newspoll]] data which is presented in the News Limited broadsheet newspaper ''[[The Australian]]'').<ref>{{cite news | first=Peter| last=Brent| title=Forget the election contest, look at the pollsters | date=10 April 2007| publisher=[[Crikey]] | url =https://www.crikey.com.au/2007/04/10/forget-the-election-contest-look-at-the-pollsters/ | access-date =15 June 2017 }}</ref>

In December 2017, YouGov purchased Galaxy Research to establish presence in Australia.<ref>{{cite news | title=YouGov acquires Galaxy Research | date=17 December 2017 | publisher=[[Mumbrella]] | url =https://mumbrella.com.au/yougov-acquires-galaxy-research-489774 | access-date = 27 November 2018 | language = en }}</ref>

==Methodology==
YouGov specialises in market research and opinion polling through online methods. The company's methodology involves obtaining responses from an invited group of [[Internet user]]s, and then [[Multilevel regression with poststratification|weighting these responses]] in line with [[demographic]] information. It draws these demographically-representative samples from a panel of over 8 million people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.yougov.co.uk/practices/yougov-panel/|title=YouGov Panel|access-date=2015-05-31}}</ref> As YouGov's online methods use no field-force, its costs are lower than some face-to-face or telephone methods.

==Expansions==
In 2006 YouGov began expanding outside the UK through acquisitions and acquired Dubai-based research firm Siraj for $1.2 million plus an eventual earn out of $600,000. In 2007 they added [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto, CA]] based US research firm Polimetrix for approximately $17 million, Scandinavian firm Zapera for $8 million and German firm [[Psychonomics]] for $20 million. In 2009 and 2010, YouGov expanded its US operations with two acquisitions; first buying [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton, NJ]] research firm Clear Horizons for $600,000 plus an earn out of $2.7 million, then [[Connecticut]]-based research firm Harrison Group for $6 million with a $7 million earnout. In 2011, YouGov acquired [[Portland, Oregon|Portland, OR]]-based firm Definitive Insights for $1 million with a potential $2 million earn out. In 2011, YouGov made its first organic expansion by opening an office in [[Paris|Paris, France]]. In January 2014, YouGov entered the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific region]] with the acquisition of Decision Fuel for an estimated consideration of approximately £5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/yougov-plc/rns/acquisition-of-decision-fuel/201401090700142369X/ |title=Acquisition of Decision Fuel |publisher=Investegate|date=2014-01-09|access-date=2014-01-20}}</ref>

In 2010 YouGov bought a 20% stake of sports media data company SMG Insight. In 2018 the company acquired the remaining 80% of SMG Insight's stock.<ref name="smg">{{cite web | url=https://www.research-live.com/article/news/yougov-fully-acquires-smg-insight/id/5038882| title=YouGov fully acquires SMG Insight | author=Katie McQuater | website=Research Live| date=25 May 2018}}</ref> The new business was rebranded YouGov Sport.
