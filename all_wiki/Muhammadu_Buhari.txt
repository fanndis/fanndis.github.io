==Early life==
Buhari was born to a [[Fula people|Fulani]] family<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/muhammadu-buhari-military-dictator-nigeria-new-democratic-president The Guardian: "Muhammadu Buhari: reformed dictator returns to power in democratic Nigeria" by David Smith] 31 March 2015</ref> on 17 December 1942, in [[Daura]], [[Katsina State]], to his father [[wikt:Mallam|Mallam]] Hardo Adamu, a Fulani chieftain, and his mother Zulaihat.<ref name="mbuhari.ng">{{cite web|url=http://thisisbuhari.com/all-project-list/muhammadu-buhari-presidential-candidate/|title=Muhammadu Buhari Presidential Candidate|work=thisisbuhari.com|access-date=8 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Muhammad Buhari">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Muhammad Buhari|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammadu-Buhari|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=8 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218031931/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammadu-Buhari|archive-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref> He is the twenty-third child of his father. Buhari was raised by his mother, after his father died when he was about four years old. He attended primary school in Daura and [[Mai'Adua|Mai'adua]], in 1953, Katsina Middle School, and attended Katsina Provincial Secondary School from 1956 to 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/asiwaju-bola-ahmed-tinubu/exclusive-interview-with-gmb-buhari-speaks-to-the-sun-newspaper/409638299105506/|title=Exclusive Interview With GMB – Buhari speaks to The Sun Newspaper }}</ref>

==Military career==
Buhari enrolled at age 19 in the [[Nigerian Military Training College]] (NMTC) in 1962.<ref>{{cite book |last=  Obotetukudo| first=Solomon|title=The Inaugural Addresses and Ascension Speeches of Nigerian Elected and Non elected presidents and prime minister from 1960 -2010|publisher=University Press of America|year=2011|page=90}}</ref> In February 1964, the college was upgraded to an officer commissioning unit of the [[Nigerian Army]] and renamed the [[Nigerian Defence Academy]] (NDA) (prior to 1964, the Nigerian government sent cadets who had completed their NMTC preliminary training to mostly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] military academies<ref name=Ogbebor>{{cite web|last1=Ogbebor|first1=Paul Osakpamwan|title=The Nigerian Defence Academy – A Pioneer Cadet's Memoir|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/11/the-nigerian-defence-academy-a-pioneer-cadets-memoir/#sthash.Oo9A0qMO.dpuf|website=Vanguard (Nigeria)|access-date=11 August 2015|date=26 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=Agbese>{{cite book|last1=Agbese|first1=Dan|title=Ibrahim Babangida: The Military, Power and Politics|publisher=Adonis & Abbey Publishers, 2012|isbn=978-1-906704-96-4|pages=48–49|year=2012}}</ref><ref name=Luckham>{{cite book|last1=Luckham|first1=Robin|title=The Nigerian Military a Sociological Analysis of Authority & Revolt 1960–1967|publisher=CUP Archive, 1971|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qA44AAAAIAAJ&q=teshie+military+nmtc+luckham&pg=PA235|access-date=10 August 2015|year=1971}}</ref> for officer cadet training). 

From 1962 to 1963, Buhari underwent officer cadet training at [[Mons Officer Cadet School]] in [[Aldershot]] in [[England]].<ref>The Times, "US overtakes Britain at educating leaders" (September 5, 2019), pg. 19</ref> In January 1963, at age 20, Buhari was commissioned a second lieutenant and appointed [[Platoon leader|Platoon Commander]] of the Second Infantry Battalion in [[Abeokuta]], [[Nigeria]]. From November 1963 to January 1964, Buhari attended the Platoon Commanders' Course at the Nigerian Military Training College, [[Kaduna]]. In 1964, he facilitated his military training by attending the Mechanical Transport Officer's Course at the Army Mechanical Transport School in Borden, [[United Kingdom]]. 

From 1965 to 1967, Buhari served as commander of the Second Infantry Battalion and appointed [[brigade major]], Second Sector, First Infantry Division, April 1967 to July 1967. Following the bloody [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état]], which resulted in the death of [[Premier of Northern Nigeria|Premier]] [[Ahmadu Bello]]. Lieutenant Buhari alongside several young officers from [[Northern Nigeria]], took part in the July counter-coup which ousted General [[Aguiyi Ironsi]] replacing him with General [[Yakubu Gowon]].

=== Civil war ===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}
Buhari was assigned to the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1st Division]] under the command of Lt. Col [[Mohammed Shuwa]],{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=65}} the division had temporarily moved from Kaduna to [[Makurdi]] at the onset of the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. The 1st division was divided into sectors and then battalions {{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=343}} with Shuwa assisted by sector commanders Martin Adamu and Sule Apollo who was later replaced by [[Theophilus Danjuma]]. Buhari's initial assignment was as [[Adjutant]] and [[Company Commander]] 2 battalion unit, Second Sector Infantry of the 1st Division. The 2 battalion was one of the units that participated in the first actions of the war, they started from Gakem near [[Afikpo]] and moved towards [[Ogoja]] with support from [[Gado Nasko]]'s artillery squad.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=69}} They reached and captured Ogoja within a week with the intention of advancing through the flanks to [[Enugu]], the rebel capital.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=339}} Buhari was briefly the 2 battalion's Commander and led the battalion to Afikpo to link with the 3rd Marine Commando and advance towards Enugu through Nkalagu and [[Abakaliki]]. However, before the move to Enugu, he was posted to Nsukka as Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Joshua Gin who would later become battle fatigued and replaced by Isa Bukar.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} Buhari stayed with the infantry for a few months as the Nigerian army began to adjust tactics learnt from early battle experiences. Instead of swift advances, the new tactics involved securing and holding on to the lines of communications and using captured towns as training ground to train new recruits brought in from the army depots in [[Abeokuta]] and Zaria.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} In 1968, he was posted to the 4 Sector also called the Awka sector which was charged to take over the capture of Onitsha from Division 2. The sector's operations was within the [[Awka]]-[[Abagana]]-Onitsha region which was important to Biafran forces because it was a major source of food supply. It was in the sector that Buhari's group suffered a lot of casualties trying to protect food supplies route of the rebels along [[Oji River]] and [[Abagana]].{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=78}}

=== After the war ===
From 1970 to 1971, Buhari was Brigade Major/Commandant, Thirty-first Infantry Brigade. He then served as the Assistant Adjutant-General, First Infantry Division Headquarters, from 1971 to 1972. He also attended the [[Defence Services Staff College]], Wellington, India, in 1973.<ref name="Quartz">{{cite news|author=Siddhartha Mitter|date=28 October 2015|title=India can rival China in Nigeria, by being exactly what China is not: Open and free|work=Quartz|url=http://qz.com/534257/india-can-rival-china-in-nigeria-by-being-exactly-what-china-is-not-open-and-free/}}</ref> From 1974 to 1975 Buhari was Acting Director of Transport and Supply at the Nigerian Army Corps of Supply and Transport Headquarters.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solomon Williams Obotetukudo|title=The Inaugural Addresses and Ascension Speeches of Nigerian Elected and Non-Elected Presidents and Prime Minister, 1960–2010|publisher=University Press of America|year=2010|pages=91–92}}</ref>

'''Military–political appointments'''

In the [[1975 Nigerian coup d'état|1975 military coup d'état]], Lieutenant Colonel Buhari was among a group of officers that brought General [[Murtala Mohammed]] to power. He was later appointed Governor of the [[North-Eastern State]]<ref>https://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/nigeria/constitution-politics</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mouau.edu.ng/index.php/node/134|title=PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI (GCFR) &#124; Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/nigeria/muhammadu-buhari.htm|title=Muhammadu Buhari - Biography}}</ref> from 1 August 1975 to 3 February 1976, to oversee social, economic and political improvements in the state. On 3 February 1976, the North Eastern State was divided into three states [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]], [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Gongola State|Gongola]].<ref>http://www.nigeriaroute.com/state-structure.php</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e|title=This is how the 36 states were created|date=23 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alapiki|first1=Henry|last2=E|date=2005|title=State Creation in Nigeria: Failed Approaches to National Integration and Local Autonomy|journal=African Studies Review|volume=48|issue=3|pages=49–65|doi=10.1353/arw.2006.0003|jstor=20065139|s2cid=146571948}}</ref> Buhari then became the first Governor of Borno State from 3 February 1976 to 15 March 1976.

In March 1976, following the botched [[1976 Nigerian coup d'état attempt|1976 military coup d'état attempt]] which led to the assassination of General Murtala Mohammed, his deputy General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] became the military head of state and appointed Colonel Buhari as the [[Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources (Nigeria)|Federal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources]] (now minister). In 1977, when the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]] was created, Buhari was appointed as its Chairman, a position he held until 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nnpcgroup.com/NNPCBusiness/Businessinformation/OilGasinNigeria/IndustryHistory.aspx|title=History of the Nigerian Petroleum Industry|publisher=Nigerian National Petroleum Company|access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> 

During his tenure as the Federal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources, the government invested in pipelines and petroleum storage infrastructures. The government built about 21 petroleum storage depots all over the country from Lagos to Maiduguri and from Calabar to Gusau; the administration constructed a pipeline network that connected Bonny terminal and the Port Harcourt refinery to the depots. Also, the administration signed the contract for the construction of a refinery in Kaduna and an oil pipeline that will connect the Escravos oil terminal to Warri Refinery and the proposed Kaduna refinery.<ref>"Nigeria's Oil Production on Increase." ''Afro-American'' (1893–1988): 16. 16 December 1978.</ref>

From 1978 to 1979, he was Military Secretary at the Army Headquarters and was a member of the [[Supreme Military Council of Nigeria (1966–1979)|Supreme Military Council]] from 1978 to 1979. From 1979 to 1980, at the rank of colonel, Buhari (class of 1980) attended the [[US Army War College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]], and gained a [[Masters Degree]] in [[Strategic Studies]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Muhammed Kabir Hassan|date=31 December 2014|title=Nigeria: The Mess 'Full Literates' Have Put Us All In!|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201501020034.html|work=AllAfrica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=22 December 2014|title=A Rejoinder To 'Semi-Illiterate' PDP Secretary Prof. Wale Oladipo By Dr. M.K.

==Head of State (1983–85)==

=== 1983 military coup d'état ===
{{Main|1983 Nigerian coup d'état}}
Major-General Buhari was one of the leaders of the [[Nigerian military coup of December 31, 1983|military coup of December 1983]] that overthrew the democratically elected government of President [[Shehu Shagari]]. At the time of the coup plot, Buhari was the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Third Armoured Division of [[Jos]].<ref>Matthews, Martin P. ''Nigeria: current issues and historical background.'' p. 121.</ref> With the successful execution of the coup by General Buhari, [[Tunde Idiagbon]] was appointed Chief of General Staff (the de facto No. 2 in the administration). The coup ended Nigeria's short-lived [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]], a period of multi-party [[democracy]] started in 1979.

According to ''The New York Times'', the officers who took power argued that "a flawed democracy was worse than no democracy at all". Buhari justified the military's seizure of power by castigating the civilian government as hopelessly corrupt and promptly suspended the [[Constitution of Nigeria|constitution]]. Another rationale for the coup was to correct economic decline in Nigeria. Sani Abacha in the military's first broadcast after the coup linked ' an inept and corrupt leadership'{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}} with general economic decline. In Buhari's New Year day speech, he too mentioned the corrupt class of the [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]] but also as the cause of a general decline in morality in the society.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}}

=== Consolidation of power ===
The structure of the new military leadership which was also the fifth in Nigeria since independence resembled the last military regime, the Obasanjo/Yaradua administration. The new regime established a Supreme Military Council, a Federal Executive Council and a Council of States.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=150}} The number of ministries was trimmed to 18 while the administration carried out a retrenchment exercise among the senior ranks of the civil service and police. It retired 17 permanent secretaries and some senior police and naval officers. In addition, the new military administration promulgated new laws to achieve its aim. These laws included the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Decree for the prosecution of armed robbery cases, the State Security (Detention of Person) Decree which gave powers to the military to detain individuals suspected of jeopardizing state security or causing economic adversity.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}} Other decrees included the Civil Service Commission and Public Offenders Decree which constituted the legal and administrative basis to conduct a purge in the civil service.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}}

According to Decree Number 2 of 1984, the state security and the chief of staff were given the power to detain, without charges, individuals deemed to be a security risk to the state for up to three months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ab5d3c.html|title=Nigeria: Repeal of Decree 2|date=1 October 1998|website=refworld.org}}</ref> Strikes and popular demonstrations were banned and Nigeria's security agency, the [[National Security Organization]] (NSO) was entrusted with unprecedented powers. The NSO played a wide role in the cracking down of public dissent by intimidating, harassing and jailing individuals who broke the interdiction on strikes. By October 1984, about 200,000 civil servants were retrenched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naijapolitica.com/2014/12/04/the-untold-tales-of-gen-buhari-a-must-read/|title=THE UNTOLD TALES OF GEN.

In 1984, Buhari passed Decree Number 4, the Protection Against False Accusations Decree,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ogbondah|first=Chris|date=1991|title=Origins and Interpretation of Nigerian Press Laws|url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/africa%20media%20review/vol5no2/jamr005002006.pdf|journal=Africa Media Review}}</ref> considered by scholars as the most repressive press law ever enacted in Nigeria.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Section 1 of the law provided that "Any person who publishes in any form, whether written or otherwise, any message, rumour, report or statement [...] which is false in any material particular or which brings or is calculated to bring the Federal Military Government or the Government of a state or public officer to ridicule or disrepute, shall be guilty of an offense under this Decree".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalnetworkonline.com/vol10n40/nondisclosure.html|title=My Stance On 'Non Disclosure' Remains Unshakable – Tunde Thompson|date=9 October 2013|website=nationalnetworkonline.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120114257/http://www.nationalnetworkonline.com/vol10n40/nondisclosure.html|archive-date=20 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The law further stated that offending journalists and publishers will be tried by an open military tribunal, whose ruling would be final and unappealable in any court and those found guilty would be eligible for a fine not less than 10,000 [[naira]] and a jail sentence of up to two years.

===Economy===
In order to reform the economy, as Head of State, Buhari started to rebuild the nation's social-political and economic systems, along the realities of Nigeria's austere economic conditions.<ref name="upa" /> The rebuilding included removing or cutting back the excesses in national expenditure, obliterating or removing completely, corruption from the nation's social ethics, shifting from mainly public sector employment to self-employment. Buhari also encouraged import substitution industrialisation based to a great extent on the use of local materials.<ref name="upa">{{cite book|author1=Nwachuku, Levi Akalazu |author2=G. N. Uzoigwe |title=Troubled Journey: Nigeria Since the Civil War |publisher=University Press of America|year=2004 |page=192}}</ref> However, tightening of imports led to reduction in raw materials for industries causing many industries to operate below capacity,{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=162}}  reduction of workers and in some cases business closure.<ref name="autogenerated422"/>

Buhari broke ties with the International Monetary Fund, when the fund asked the government to devalue the naira by 60%. However, the reforms that Buhari instigated on his own were as or more rigorous as those required by the IMF.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vreeland|first1=James Raymond|title=The International Monetary Fund: Politics of Conditional Lending|date=19 December 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-37463-7|page=60|quote=Buhari proved his independence by pushing through economic austerity so severe it went beyond what many advised – all the while he refused IMF assistance.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mathews|first1=Martin P.|title=Nigeria: Current Issues and Historical Background|date=1 May 2002|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|isbn=978-1-59033-316-7|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTs6GpM4zDMC&q=buhari+imf&pg=PA122|access-date=19 January 2015}}</ref>

On 7 May 1984, Buhari announced the country's 1984 National Budget. The budget came with a series of complementary measures:

*A temporary ban on recruiting federal public sector workers
*Raising of Interest rates
*Halting Capital Projects
*Prohibition of borrowing by State governments
*15 percent cut from Shagari's 1983 Budget
*Realignment of import duties
*Reducing the balance of payment deficit by cutting imports
*It also gave priority to the importation of raw materials and spare parts that were needed for agriculture and industry.

Other economic measures by Buhari took the form of counter trade, currency change, price reduction of goods and services. His economic policies did not earn him the legitimacy of the masses due to the rise in inflation and the use of military might to continue to push many policies blamed for the rise in food prices.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=164}}

===War Against Indiscipline===
{{main|War Against Indiscipline}}
One of the most enduring legacies of the Buhari government has been the War Against Indiscipline (WAI). Launched on 20 March 1984, the policy tried to address the perceived lack of public morality and civic responsibility of Nigerian society. Unruly Nigerians were ordered to form neat queues at bus stops, under the eyes of whip-wielding soldiers. Civil servants<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12890807|title = Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari in profile|date = 11 December 2014|website = bbc.co.uk}}</ref> who failed to show up on time at work were humiliated and forced to do "frog jumps". Minor offences carried long sentences. Any student over the age of 17 caught cheating on an exam would get 21 years in prison. Counterfeiting and arson could lead to the death penalty.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/10/world/nigeria-s-discipline-campaign-not-sparing-the-rod.html|title = Nigeria's discipline campaign: Not sparing the rod|date = 10 August 1984|work =The New York Times|author = Clifford D. May}}</ref>

Buhari's administration enacted three decrees to investigate corruption and control foreign exchange. The Banking (Freezing of Accounts) Decree of 1984, allotted to the Federal Military Government the power to freeze bank accounts of persons suspected to have committed fraud. The Recovery of Public Property (Special Military Tribunals) Decree permitted the government to investigate the assets of public officials linked with corruption and constitute a military tribunal to try such persons. The Exchange Control (Anti-Sabotage) Decree stated penalties for violators of foreign exchange laws.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=154}}

Decree 20 on illegal ship bunkering and drug trafficking was another example of Buhari's tough approach to crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-9485.html|title=Security and Anticrime Measures|date=June 1991|website=country-data.com}}</ref> Section 3 (2) (K) provided that "any person who, without lawful authority deals in, sells, smokes or inhales the drug known as cocaine or other similar drugs, shall be guilty under section 6 (3) (K) of an offence and liable on conviction to suffer death sentence by firing squad."

In 1985, prompted by economic uncertainties and a rising crime rate, the government of Buhari opened the borders (closed since April 1984) with [[Benin]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]] and [[Cameroon]] to speed up the expulsion of 700,000 illegal foreigners and illegal migrant workers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/05/world/expelled-foreigners-pouring-ved=0CHwQ6AEwDw#v=onepageout-of-nigeria-by-the-associated-press.html|title=Expelled foreigners pouring out of Nigeria By The Associated Press|date=5 May 1985|website=nytimes.com}}</ref> Buhari is today known for this crisis; there even is a famine in the east of Niger that have been named "El Buhari".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20141211173541/|title=Présidentielle nigériane : Muhammadu Buhari affrontera Goodluck Jonathan|date=11 December 2014|website=jeuneafrique.com}}</ref> His regime drew criticism from many, including Nigeria's first Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka, who, in 2007, wrote a piece called "The Crimes of Buhari"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2007/01/14/crimes-buhari-wole-soyinka|title=The crimes of Buhari-Wole Soyinka|date=14 January 2007|website=saharareporters.com}}</ref> which outlined many of the abuses conducted under his military rule.

Ahead of the 2015 general election, Buhari responded to his human rights criticism by saying that if elected, he would follow the rule of law, and that there would be access to justice for all Nigerians and respect for fundamental human rights of Nigerians.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195948/http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/my-contract-with-nigeria-buhari/ My contract with Nigeria – Buhari]. vanguardngr.com (17 March 2015)</ref>

==Overthrow, detention and civilian life==

=== 1985 Nigerian coup d'etat ===
{{main|1985 Nigerian coup d'état}}

In August 1985, Major General Buhari was overthrown in a coup led by General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] and other members of the ruling Supreme Military Council (SMC).<ref name="Muhammad Buhari2">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammadu-Buhari|title=Muhammad Buhari|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218031931/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammadu-Buhari|archive-date=February 18, 2019|access-date=8 February 2015|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref> Babangida brought many of Buhari's most vocal critics into his administration, including [[Fela Kuti]]'s brother [[Olikoye Ransome-Kuti]], a doctor who had led a strike against Buhari to protest declining health care services. Buhari was then detained in [[Benin City]] until 1988.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Toyin Falola|title=A History of Nigeria|author2=Matthew M.

Buhari's admirers believe that he was overthrown by corrupt elements in his government who were afraid of being brought to justice as his policies were beginning to yield tangible dividends in terms of public discipline, curbing corruption, lowering inflation, enhancing workforce and improving productivity.<ref name="Siollun2">{{cite news|author=Max Siollun|url=http://www.dawodu.com/siollun3.htm|title=Buhari and Idiagbon: A Missed Opportunity for Nigeria|date=October 2003|access-date=12 September 2013|publisher=Dawodu.com|author-link=Max Siollun}}</ref> Ibrahim Babangida justified his ''[[coup d'état]]'' by saying that Buhari failed to deal with the country's economic problems and promised "to rejuvenate the economy ravaged by decades of government mismanagement and corruption".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cyr|first=Ruth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlhwTte8pbkC&q=%E2%80%9Cto+rejuvenate+the+economy+ravaged+by+decades+of+government+mismanagement+and+corruption&pg=PA401|title=Twentieth Century Africa|publisher=iUniverse|year=2001|isbn=9780595189823|page=401}}</ref>

===Detention and release===
Buhari spent three years of detention in a small guarded bungalow in [[Benin City|Benin]]. He had access to television that showed two channels and members of his family were allowed to visit him on the authorization of Babangida.

In December 1988, after his mother's death he was released and retired to his residence in [[Daura]]. While in detention, his farm was managed by his relatives. He divorced his first wife in 1988 and married Aisha Halilu.<ref name="Paden" /> In Katsina, he became the pioneer chairman of Katsina Foundation that was founded to encourage social and economic development in [[Katsina State]].

===Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund===
Buhari served as the Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), a body created by the government of General [[Sani Abacha]], and funded from the revenue generated by the increase in price of petroleum products, to pursue developmental projects around the country. A 1998 report in ''[[New African]]'' praised the PTF under Buhari for its transparency, calling it a rare "success story".<ref name="PTF">{{cite web |title=Development: PTF – shining in the gloom |url=http://www.africasia.com/archive/na/98_06/abcr0604.htm |date=June 1998 |access-date=4 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120225841/http://www.africasia.com/archive/na/98_06/abcr0604.htm |archive-date=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== 2003 presidential election ===
In 2003, Buhari ran for office in the [[2003 Nigerian presidential election|presidential election]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6508055.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nigeria: Facts and figures | date=17 April 2007}}</ref> as the candidate of the [[All Nigeria People's Party]] (ANPP). He was defeated by the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] incumbent, President [[Olusẹgun Ọbasanjọ]], by more than 11 million votes.

=== 2007 presidential election ===
On 18 December 2006, Buhari was nominated as the consensus candidate of the All Nigeria People's Party. His main challenger in the April 2007 polls was the ruling PDP candidate, [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], who hailed from the same home state of [[Katsina State|Katsina]]. Buhari officially took 18% of the vote to Yar'Adua's 70%, but Buhari rejected these results.<ref name=Huge>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6584393.stm "Huge win for Nigeria's Yar'Adua"], BBC News, 23 April 2007.</ref> After Yar'Adua took office, he called for a government of national unity to bring on board aggrieved opposition members. The ANPP joined the government with appointment of its national chairman as a member of Yar'Adua's cabinet, but Buhari denounced this agreement.<ref>Felix Onuah and Camillus Eboh, [https://archive.today/20070517203204/http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20070704220154487C404988 "Nigerian president picks ministers"], Reuters (''IOL''), 4 July 2007.</ref>

=== 2011 presidential election ===
In March 2010, Buhari left the ANPP for the [[Congress for Progressive Change]] (CPC), a party he had helped to found. He said that he had supported foundation of the CPC "as a solution to the debilitating, ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party the ANPP".<ref name=Mamah20100318>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201003180375.html |title=Buhari Joins Congress for Progressive Change |work=Vanguard |author=Emeka Mamah |date=18 March 2010 |access-date=22 April 2011}}</ref>

Buhari was the CPC Presidential candidate in the 2011 election, running against incumbent President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP), [[Mallam Nuhu Ribadu]] of [[Action Congress of Nigeria]] (ACN), and [[Ibrahim Shekarau]] of ANPP.

Buhari ran in the 2015 presidential election as a candidate of the [[All Progressives Congress]] party. His platform was built around his image as a staunch anti-corruption fighter and his incorruptible and honest reputation, but he said he would not probe past corrupt leaders and would give officials who stole in the past amnesty if they repented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/173941-buhari-will-not-probe-past-corrupt-nigerian-leaders-repent-apc.html|title=Buhari will not probe past corrupt Nigerian leaders if they repent – APC|date=29 December 2014|website=premiumtimesng.com}}</ref>

In the runup to the 2015 election, Jonathan's campaign asked that Buhari be disqualified from the election, claiming that he was in breach of the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/174654-nigeria2015-jonathan-wants-buhari-disqualified.html|title = #Nigeria2015: Jonathan wants Buhari disqualified|date = 11 January 2015|website = premiumtimesng.com}}</ref> According to the fundamental document, in order to qualify for election to the office of the president, a person must be "educated up to at least School certificate level or its equivalent". Buhari failed to submit any such evidence, claiming that he lost the original copies of his diplomas when his house was raided following his overthrow from power in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/buhari-certificate-nuisance/|title = Buhari: Certificate nuisance!|date = 6 January 2015|website = vanguardngr.com}}</ref>

=== 2019 presidential election ===
{{Main|2019 Nigerian general election}}
On 24 January 2018, former president Obasanjo wrote Buhari a letter accusing his government of [[nepotism]], while commending his war against corruption and lauding his achievements on [[Boko Haram]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://punchng.com/full-letter-obasanjo-writes-buhari-asks-president-to-halt-2019-ambition/|title=Full text: Obasanjo's letter to Buhari|date=28 January 2018|work=Punch Newspapers|access-date=2 February 2018|publisher=Punch Newspaper}}</ref> Obasanjo's letter also included an appeal to Buhari not to run for reelection in 2019 but to "join the stock of Nigerian leaders whose experience, influence, wisdom, and outreach can be deployed on the sideline for the good of the country".

During a national executive council meeting on April 9, 2018, Buhari declared his intention seek a second term in office. This came after much speculation by political players and members of the public about whether he would run, especially considering his rather late timing. Reactions to his announcement were mixed, as many thought this put his integrity in question. Buhari said during the 2011 presidential campaign under the CPC banner that he would not seek reelection should he ever become president.

===Cabinet===
Buhari's key advisers include: his nephew [[Mamman Daura]], businessman [[Ismaila Isa Funtua]], political operator [[Baba Gana Kingibe]], [[Abba Kyari (politician)|Abba Kyari]] the [[Chief of Staff to the President (Nigeria)|Chief of Staff to the President]]; and from the late stages of his first term, [[Boss Mustapha]] the [[Secretary to the Government of the Federation]].<ref name="vol60" /> Empowering his [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|kitchen cabinet]] after his second inauguration, Buhari has stated his preference for cabinet members seeking meetings or consultation to direct such requests through the chief of staff or through the government secretary.<ref name="vol60" />

Since the [[Fourth Nigerian Republic|Fourth Republic]], ministerial positions are legally required to be composed of a federal ethno-demographic character with a minister representing each state of the federation. A result of this has created the outcome of political considerations as an important factor in nominating ministers as local party officials lacking in merit jostle for cabinet positions.<ref name="vol60" /> Nomination into Buhari's cabinet has been influenced by those political considerations and also closeness to the president and his inner cabinet.<ref name="vol60" />

In August 2019, the president named his cabinet of predominantly male members with an average years of 60 and dominated by political actors or those close to the president.<ref name="gang" /> The cabinet include two wealthy former governors from the Niger Delta, [[Timipre Sylva]] and [[Godswill Akpabio]] who were originally members of the opposition party PDP and fourteen retained ministers some of whom critics alleged had performed poorly or having a close relationship with a corrupt past Head of State.<ref name="gang">{{Cite journal |date=July 26, 2019 |title=The Gang of 43 breaks cover |url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article/id/12703/The_Gang_of_43_breaks_cover |journal=African Confidential |language=en |volume=60}}</ref>

===Economy===
An attractive choice to many Nigerians because of a perceived incorruptible character.<ref name=":0" /> Once in power, Buhari who had earlier mobilized supporters in three previous elections was slow to manifest his intention to solve problems he mentioned during his campaign. Determination to initiate his domestic policy agenda like naming of cabinet officials took six months,<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Obadare|first1=Ebenezer|title=Current History|website=www.currenthistory.com|date=May 2017|volume=116|issue=790|url=http://www.currenthistory.com/Article.php?ID=1414}}</ref> while the passage of the 2016 and 2017 budgets were delayed by infighting.

In Buhari's first year in office, Nigeria suffered a decline in commodity prices which triggered an economic recession. To source funds to close shortfall in revenue and fund an expansionary capital budget, Buhari traveled to 20 countries seeking loans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 2016 |title=Economy Thwarts Buhari |journal=Afr Res Bull Econ |volume=53 |issue=4 }}</ref> Thereby, expansionary budget allocation to finance infrastructure was pushed back to a further date.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=November 18, 2016|title=Political schisms hit recovery and reform |url=http://www.africa-confidential.com/article/id/11829/Political_schisms_hit_recovery_and_reform |journal=African Confidential |volume=57 |issue=23 |access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref>

In the first year of the administration, [[Naira]], the currency of Nigeria depreciated in the black market leading to a gulf between the official exchange rate and the black-market rate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Verbatim: Why I attempted absconding from office after becoming President — Buhari - OAK TV|url=https://oak.tv/attempted-absconding-officeri/|access-date=2 January 2017|work=oak.tv|agency=Oak TV|publisher=Oak TV}}</ref> A resulting shortage in foreign exchange hit various businesses including petroleum marketers. However, the gulf between the official rates and the black market rates opened up the opportunity for well connected individuals to engage in arbitrage, making a mockery of the president's anti-corruption image.<ref name="pill"/> In May, 2016, the government announced a rise in the official pump price of petroleum to curtail shortfall in the commodity as a result of foreign exchange shortages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=July 1, 2016 |title=NIGERIA: A Turbulent Year |journal=Afr Res Bull Econ |volume=53 |issue=5 }}</ref>

In 2016, the country's economy declined by 1.6% and in 2017 per capital economic growth is projected to be negligible. Buhari's first tenure as head of state coincided with a decline in oil prices similar to his second stint but his administration has not shown dedicated effort to diversify sources of government spending.<ref name="pill">{{cite web |title=Nigeria has let a crisis go to waste |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f7d3a24-66eb-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614 |website=Financial Times}}</ref> The 2018 budget signaled an expansionary fiscal policy with funds dedicated to infrastructural projects such as strategic roads, bridges and power plants.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Buhari opens the war chest|journal=Africa Confidential|date=November 17, 2017|volume=58|issue=23|url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/12169/Buhari_opens_the_war_chest|language=en}}</ref>

Since an upturn in economic growth from the decline of 2016, a slow pace of recovery has the country behind many of its continental neighbors in GDP growth. Unemployment levels remain high and any effort to increase non-oil revenues has not improved while government deficit spending include a significant portion of its yearly budget dedicated to service debts.<ref name="vol6013">{{Cite journal|date=June 28, 2019|title=The rise of Godwin Emefiele|url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/12678/The_rise_of_Godwin_Emefiele|journal=Africa Confidential|language=en}}</ref>

Buhari with the support of the Central Bank chief initiated policies to improve agriculture production through lobbying private banks to lend to the  sector and restriction of foreign exchange at official rates for importation of food product that are grown locally. In his second tern, the budget minister, Udo Udoma and trade minister, Enemalah both of whom favored liberalisation were not returned.<ref name="vol60">{{Cite journal |date=August 30, 2019 |title=Executive exerts its privilege |url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/12727/Executive_exerts_its_privilege |journal=Africa Confidential |language=en |volume=60 |issue=17}}{{Cite journal |date=August 30, 2019 |title=Executive exerts its privilege |url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/article-preview/id/12727/Executive_exerts_its_privilege |journal=Africa Confidential |language=en |volume=60 |issue=17}}</ref>

The government continued to operate flexible exchange rates into the second term of the administration despite critics alluding to the exchange rate regime of being susceptible to arbitrage abuses and [[Round-tripping (finance)|round tripping]] by cronies of the government.<ref name="vol6013" />

=== Social welfare ===
In 2016, Buhari launched the [[National Social Investment Program]], a national [[social welfare]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-11-22|title=Is the N-Power programme key to delivering a campaign promise?|url=http://venturesafrica.com/n-power-key-to-delivering-campaign-promise/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=Ventures Africa|language=en-US}}</ref>The Program was created to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources to vulnerable populations, including children, youth, and women. There are four programs which address poverty, unemployment and help increase economic development:<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Social Investments Programme|url=https://n-sip.gov.ng/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=N-SIP|language=en-US}}</ref>

* The [[N-Power (Nigeria)|N-Power]] program provides young Nigerians with job training and education, as well as a monthly stipend of 30,000 [[Nigerian naira]] ([[USD]] $83.33). 

* The Conditional Cash Transfer Program (CCTP) directly supports the most vulnerable by providing cash to those in the lowest income group, helping reduce poverty, improve nutrition and self-sustainability, and supporting development through increased consumption. 

* The Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program (GEEP) is a micro-lending entrepreneurship program targeting farmers, petty traders and market women with a focus. This program provides no-cost loans to its beneficiaries, helping reduce the start-up costs of business ventures in Nigeria. The programs include: TraderMoni, [[MarketMoni]] and FarmerMoni.

* The National Home Grown School Feeding Program (NHGSF) is attempting to increase school enrollment by providing free meals to schoolchildren, particularly those in poor and food-insecure regions. The program works with local farmers and empowers women as cooks, building the community and sustaining economic growth from farm to table.

The program was previously co-ordinated from the office of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, until 2019, when the program was moved to the new Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development under [[Sadiya Umar Farouq]]. In his 2019 Independence Day Speech, the President attributed the movement to the need to have the programmes institutionalized. <ref>https://guardian.ng/news/buhari-says-n-power-others-will-be-institutionalised/)</ref>

===Anti-corruption===
{{main|Buhari's anti-corruption war}}

The [[$2 billion arms deal]] was exposed following the interim report of Buhari's investigations committee on arms procurement under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. The committee report showed extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and additional spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan's watch. Preliminary investigation suggested that about $2 billion may have been disbursed for the procurement of arms to fight against Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria. The investigative report indicated that a total sum of $2.2 billion was inexplicably disbursed into the office of the National Security Adviser in procurement of arms to fight against insurgency, but was not spent for the purpose for which the money was disbursed. Investigations on this illegal deal led to the arrest of [[Sambo Dasuki]], the former National Security Adviser who later mentioned prominent Nigerians involved in the deal. Those who were mentioned and arrested includes [[Raymond Dokpesi]], the Chair Emeritus of [[DAAR Communications Plc]], [[Attahiru Bafarawa]], the former Governor of Sokoto State, and [[Bashir Yuguda]], the former Minister of State for Finance, [[Azubuike Ihejirika]], the [[Chief of Army Staff (Nigeria)|Chief of Army Staff]], [[Adesola Nunayon Amosu]], the former [[Chief of the Air Staff (Nigeria)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Alex Badeh]] and several other politicians were mentioned.

On 21 December 2016, the government's Federal Ministry of Finance announced a whistle-blowing policy with a 2.5%-5% reward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/White-Collar-Crime/Nigeria/Sofunde-Osakwe-Ogundipe-Belgore/Federal-Ministry-of-Finance-introduces-new-whistleblowing-initiative/|title=Federal Ministry of Finance introduces new whistleblowing initiative|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206165902/http://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/White-Collar-Crime/Nigeria/Sofunde-Osakwe-Ogundipe-Belgore/Federal-Ministry-of-Finance-introduces-new-whistleblowing-initiative|archive-date=6 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aim is to obtain relevant data or information regarding:

Previously, Buhari gave his support for the total implementation of [[Sharia]] in the country.<ref>Akhaine, Saxone (27 August 2001) [http://m.allafrica.com/stories/200108270355.html Nigeria: Buhari Calls for Sharia in All States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123212623/http://m.allafrica.com/stories/200108270355.html/|date=23 January 2015}}. allafrica.com</ref> He was quoted in 2001 as saying, "I will continue to show openly and inside me the total commitment to the Sharia movement that is sweeping all over Nigeria", he then added: "God willing, we will not stop the agitation for the total implementation of the Sharia in the country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/12/insurgency-buharis-call-full-sharia/|title=Insurgency and Buhari's call for full Sharia|date=24 December 2014|website=vanguardngr.com|publisher=Viewpoint}}</ref> Buhari has denied all allegations that he has a radical Islamist agenda.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12890807 Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari in profile – BBC News].

=== Mediation with Boko Haram ===
In 2012, Buhari's name was included on a list published by [[Boko Haram]] of individuals it would trust to mediate between the group and the Federal Government.<ref>[http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/11/boko-haram-names-buhari-5-others-as-mediators/ Boko Haram names Buhari, 5 others as mediators – Vanguard News].

=== Abolishing the office of the first lady ===

In December 2014, Muhammadu Buhari went on the record to say he would abolish the office of the [[First Lady of Nigeria|First Lady]] if he was elected as President, claiming it was unconstitutional.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141231220655/http://www.that1960chick.com/2014/12/27/buhari-says-no-first-lady-if-elected-patience-jonathan-kinda-responds-what-do-you-think/#sthash.oOW9HuRs.mRUxlv1H.dpbs/ Buhari Says "No First Lady" If Elected&nbsp;...

The [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] (MEND), a Nigerian militant group that endorsed Buhari during the 2015 general elections, commended Buhari for his plans and went on to say that the office of the First Lady was "obviously an irrelevant, fraudulent and unconstitutional office, whose only purpose is to further plunder the resources of the country."<ref>[http://www.peoplesdailyng.com/mend-endorses-buhari-for-president/ MEND endorses Buhari for president | Peoples Daily Newspaper].
