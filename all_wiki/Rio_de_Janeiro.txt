Founded in 1565 by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the city was initially the seat of the [[Captaincies of the Portuguese Empire|Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro]], a domain of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the [[State of Brazil]], a [[List of states of the Portuguese Empire|state of the Portuguese Empire]]. In 1808, when the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil]], Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the [[prince regent]], and future King [[John VI of Portugal|João VI of Portugal]], raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves]]. Rio stayed the capital of the [[pluricontinentalism|pluricontinental]] Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the [[War of Independence of Brazil|War of Brazilian Independence]] began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the [[Empire of Brazil]], until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to [[Brasília]].

{{Main|History of Rio de Janeiro|Timeline of Rio de Janeiro}}

=== Colonial period ===
Europeans first encountered [[Guanabara Bay]] on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, "January River"), by a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] expedition under explorer [[Gaspar de Lemos]], captain of a ship in [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]'s fleet, or under [[Gonçalo Coelho]].<ref>Jorge Couto, 1995, ''A Construção do Brasil'', Lisbon: Cosmos.</ref> Allegedly the Florentine explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] participated as observer at the invitation of [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]] in the same
expedition. The region of Rio was inhabited by the [[Tupi people|Tupi]], Puri, [[Botocudo people|Botocudo]] and [[Maxakalí language|Maxakalí]] peoples.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zimring |first=Carl A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VifrCgAAQBAJ&q=Tupi%2C+Puri%2C+Botocudo+and+Maxakal%C3%AD&pg=PT750 |title=Encyclopedia of Consumption and Waste: The Social Science of Garbage |date=27 February 2012 |isbn=9781506338279 |access-date=23 September 2016}}</ref>

In 1555, one of the islands of [[Guanabara Bay]], now called [[Villegagnon Island]], was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French [[admiral]] [[Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon]]. Consequently, Villegagnon built [[Fort Coligny]] on the island when attempting to establish the [[France Antarctique]] colony.

The city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded by the Portuguese on 1 March 1565 and was named ''São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro'', in honour of St. Sebastian, the [[Saint's name|saint who was the namesake and patron]] of the Portuguese then-monarch [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastião]]. ''Rio de Janeiro'' was the name of [[Guanabara Bay]]. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and buccaneers, such as [[Jean-François Duclerc]] and [[René Duguay-Trouin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Rio |url=http://www.paralumun.com/citrio.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227075155/http://www.paralumun.com/citrio.htm |archive-date=27 December 2008 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Paralumun.com}}</ref>

In the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the [[Bandeirantes]] discovered gold and diamonds in the neighbouring [[captaincy]] of [[Minas Gerais]], thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than [[Salvador, Bahia]], much farther northeast. On 27 January 1763,<ref name="RobinsonRobinson2014">{{Cite book |last=Alex Robinson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=joc_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28 |title=Rio de Janeiro Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Maracana Stadium, Copacabana, Paraty, Ilha Grande, Ipanema |last2=Gardenia Robinson |publisher=Footprint Travel Guides |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-909268-88-3 |page=28}}</ref> the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated [[Lisbon]] nobles, fleeing from [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s invasion of Portugal, [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|moved]] to Rio de Janeiro.

===Portuguese court and imperial capital===
The kingdom's capital was transferred to the city, which, thus, became the only European capital outside of [[Europe]]. As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sobrinho |first=Wanderley Preite |date=3 March 2008 |title=Chegada da família real portuguesa muda a arquitetura do Rio |trans-title=Arrival of the real Portuguese family changes Rio's architecture |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u372084.shtml |access-date=17 April 2010 |website=[[Folha de S.

From the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A África civiliza |url=http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/africa_civiliza.html |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Secretaria Municipal de Educação da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro |language=pt}}</ref> The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tour Rio De Janeiro's Oldest Slave Port With This New App |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/07/18/537948535/tour-rio-de-janeiros-oldest-slave-port-with-this-new-app |access-date=12 September 2019 |website=NPR.org |language=en}}</ref>

When [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] proclaimed the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of Brazil]] in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his [[Empire of Brazil|new empire]] while the place was enriched with sugar cane agriculture in the Campos region and, especially, with the new coffee cultivation in the [[Paraíba Valley]].<ref name="HCRJ" /> In order to separate the province from the capital of the Empire, the city was converted, in the year of 1834, in Neutral Municipality, passing the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|province of Rio de Janeiro]] to have [[Niterói]] as capital.<ref name="HCRJ" />

As a political centre of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century.<ref name="HCRJ" /> At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing.<ref name="HCRJ" /> Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|replaced]] by a republic.

On 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, with the name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a complex with varying architectural styles like [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and a tower in [[Mansard roof|Mansard Roof]] style. After the opening in 1893, workers from [[Great Britain]] arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared. In May 1894, [[Thomas Donohoe]], a British worker from [[Busby, East Renfrewshire|Busby]], Scotland, arrived in Bangu.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who is the true father of football in Brazil? |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24537173 |access-date=25 November 2015 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref>

Donohoe was horrified to discover that there was absolutely no knowledge of football among Brazilians. So he wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to bring a football when she joined him. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. It was a five-a-side match between British workers, and took place six months before the first game organized by [[Charles William Miller|Charles Miller]] in São Paulo. However, the Bangu Football Club was not formally created until 1904.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bangu Athletic Club History [Portuguese] |url=http://www.bangu-ac.com.br/historia.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101115818/http://www.bangu-ac.com.br/historia.htm |archive-date=1 January 2016}}</ref>

At the time Brazil's [[First Brazilian Republic|Old Republic]] was established, the city lacked [[urban planning]] and [[sanitation]], which helped spread several diseases, such as [[yellow fever]], [[dysentery]], [[variola]], [[tuberculosis]] and even [[black death]]. [[Francisco Pereira Passos|Pereira Passos]], who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the [[cortiço]]s where most of the poor population lived. These people, mostly descendants of slaves, then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first [[favelas]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Suppia |first=Alfredo |last2=Scarabello |first2=Marília |date=7 May 2014 |title=As reformas do Rio de Janeiro no início do século XX |url=http://pre.univesp.br/as-reformas-do-rio-de-janeiro-no-inicio-do-seculo-xx#.WP3sUfnysdU |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523110959/http://pre.univesp.br/as-reformas-do-rio-de-janeiro-no-inicio-do-seculo-xx#.WP3sUfnysdU |archive-date=23 May 2014 |publisher=Universidade Virtual do Estado de São Paulo |language=pt}}</ref> Inspired by the city of [[Paris]], Passos built the [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theatre]], the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[National Library of Brazil|National Library]] in the city's center; brought [[electric power]] to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to [[automobiles]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Reforma Urbanística de Pereira Passos, o Rio com cara de Paris |url=http://educacao.globo.com/artigo/reforma-urbanistica-de-pereira-passos-o-rio-com-cara-de-paris.html |publisher=[[Grupo Globo]] |language=pt}}</ref> Passos also named Dr. [[Oswaldo Cruz]] as Director General of Public Health. Cruz's plans to clean the city of diseases included compulsory vaccination of the entire population and forced entry into houses to kill mosquitos and rats. The people of city rebelled against Cruz's policy, in what would be known as the [[Vaccine Revolt]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cabral dos Santos |first=Marco |date=31 July 2005 |title=Revolta da Vacina: Oswaldo Cruz e Pereira Passos tentam sanear Rio |url=https://educacao.uol.com.br/disciplinas/historia-brasil/revolta-da-vacina-oswaldo-cruz-e-pereira-passos-tentam-sanear-rio.htm |website=UOL Educação |language=pt}}</ref>

In 1910, Rio saw the [[Revolt of the Lash]], where [[Afro-Brazilian]] crew members in the [[Brazilian Navy]] mutinied against the heavy use of [[corporal punishment]], which was similar to the punishment slaves received. The mutineers took control of the [[Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes|battleship ''Minas Geraes'']] and threatened to fire on the city. Another military revolt occurred in 1922, the [[18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt]], a march against the Old Republic's [[coronelism]] and [[café com leite politics]]. This revolt marked the beginning of [[Tenentism]], a movement that resulted in the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]] that started the [[Vargas Era]].

Until the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighbourhood now known as the historic city centre (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called [[South Zone (Rio de Janeiro)|Zona Sul]] (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between [[Botafogo]] and the neighbourhood that is now known as [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]]. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boone |first=Christopher G |year=1995 |title=Streetcars and Politics in Rio de Janeiro: Private Enterprise versus Municipal Government in Mass Transit Delivery, 1903–1920 |journal=Journal of Latin American Studies |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=343–365 |doi=10.1017/s0022216x00010786}}</ref> Botafogo's natural environment, combined with the fame of the [[Copacabana Palace]] Hotel, ''the'' luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town. This reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade and [[Brazilian police militias|militias]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 October 2009 |title=Drugs and violence in Rio: The bottom line |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14700720 |access-date=21 January 2010}}{{Subscription}}</ref>

Plans for moving the nation's capital city from Rio de Janeiro to the centre of Brazil had been occasionally discussed, and when [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital.<ref>[http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jk/htm/biografias/juscelino_kubitschek.asp Juscelino Kubitschek and the city of Rio de Janeiro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315094527/http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jk/htm/biografias/juscelino_kubitschek.asp |date=15 March 2015 }}</ref> Though many thought that it was just [[Political campaign|campaign]] rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have [[Brasília]] and a new [[Distrito Federal (Brazil)|Federal District]] built, at great cost, by 1960. On 21 April of that year, the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Brasília. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]], after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup d'état]] that installed a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], the [[city-state]] was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. Then, in 1975, a presidential decree known as "The Fusion" removed the city's federative status and merged it with the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|State of Rio de Janeiro]], with the city of Rio de Janeiro replacing [[Niterói]] as the state's capital, and establishing the [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 September 2013 |title=Em 15 de março de 1975, Guanabara e Rio se transformaram num único estado |url=http://acervo.oglobo.globo.com/fatos-historicos/em-15-de-marco-de-1975-guanabara-rio-se-transformaram-num-unico-estado-10121382 |access-date=22 April 2017 |website=Acervo O Globo |publisher=[[O Globo]] |language=pt}}</ref>

In 1992, Rio hosted the [[Earth Summit]], a [[United Nations]] conference to fight [[environmental degradation]]. Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on [[sustainable development]], named [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]]. The city hosted the [[World Youth Day 2013|World Youth Day in 2013]], the second [[World Youth Day]] in South America and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the [[2007 Pan American Games]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]]. On 2 October 2009, the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics|announced]] that Rio de Janeiro would host the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympic Games]] and the [[2016 Summer Paralympics|2016 Paralympic Games]], beating competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and [[Madrid]]. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after [[Mexico City]] in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]) to host the Games.

==Geography==
[[File:Rio de Janeiro, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2011-05-09 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Right|upright=1.2|[[Satellite]] view of [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]]]]

Rio de Janeiro is on the far western part of a strip of Brazil's Atlantic coast (between a strait east to [[Ilha Grande]], on the [[Costa Verde (Brazil)|Costa Verde]], and the [[Cabo Frio]]), close to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], where the shoreline is oriented east–west. Facing largely south, the city was founded on an inlet of this stretch of the coast, [[Guanabara Bay]] (Baía de Guanabara), and its entrance is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (Pão de Açúcar) – a "calling card" of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=8 March 2011 |title=Where is Rio de Janeiro? |url=http://riobrazilblog.com/where-is-rio-de-janeiro |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105085554/http://riobrazilblog.com/where-is-rio-de-janeiro |archive-date=5 November 2013 |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher=Riobrazilblog.com}}</ref>

The centre ([[Centro (Rio de Janeiro)|Centro]]), the core of Rio, lies on the plains of the western shore of Guanabara Bay. The greater portion of the city, commonly referred to as the North Zone ({{ill|Zona Norte, Rio de Janeiro|pt|Zona Norte (Rio de Janeiro)}}), extends to the northwest on plains composed of marine and continental sediments and on hills and several rocky mountains. The South Zone (Zona Sul) of the city, reaching the beaches fringing the open sea, is cut off from the centre and from the North Zone by coastal mountains. These mountains and hills are offshoots of the [[Serra do Mar]] to the northwest, the ancient gneiss-granite mountain chain that forms the southern slopes of the [[Brazilian Highlands]]. The large West Zone (Zona Oeste), long cut off by the mountainous terrain, had been made more easily accessible to those on the South Zone by new roads and tunnels by the end of the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/rio-de-janeiro Rio de Janeiro – History.com Articles, Video, Pictures and Facts]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822105017/http://www.history.com/topics/rio-de-janeiro |date=22 August 2011 }}</ref>

The city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National Park, the world's first urban forest and [[UNESCO]] Environmental Heritage and Biosphere Reserve; [[Pedra Branca State Park]], which houses the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]] complex; the [[Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro|Botanical Garden]];<ref>{{Cite web |date=7 October 2005 |title="Cochicho da Mata" recria floresta dentro da floresta |url=http://www.jbrj.gov.br/materias/07_10_2005.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118155016/http://www.jbrj.gov.br/materias/07_10_2005.htm |archive-date=18 January 2012 |access-date=15 May 2017 |publisher=Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro |language=pt}}</ref> Rio's Zoo; [[Parque Lage]]; and the [[Passeio Público (Rio de Janeiro)|Passeio Público]], the first public park in the [[Americas]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca (PEPB) |url=http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/unidades/pqpedra_branca.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012125009/http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/unidades/pqpedra_branca.asp |archive-date=12 October 2012 |access-date=22 September 2012 |website=Governo do Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Instituto Nacional do Ambiente |language=pt}}</ref> In addition the [[Flamengo Park]] is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much vegetation.

===Environment===
Due to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region, the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The [[Guanabara Bay]] has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the [[World Health Organization]], in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Afra Balazina |date=21 September 2007 |title=Estudo revela poluição elevada em seis capitais |trans-title=Study reveals high pollution levels in six capitals |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u330220.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221042944/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u330220.shtml |archive-date=21 December 2007 |access-date=26 October 2008 |website=Folha Online |language=pt}}</ref>

The waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29 million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers. With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high concentrations of heavy metals – mainly [[zinc]] and [[cadmium]] – have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], [[Itaguaí]] and [[Nova Iguaçu]], constructed under the supervision of State policies.<ref name="OQ">{{Cite web |year=2001 |title=Contexto ambiental da Baía de Sepetiba |url=http://www.koinonia.org.br/oq/dossies/marambaia/not_contexto1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501032842/http://www.koinonia.org.br/oq/dossies/marambaia/not_contexto1.htm |archive-date=1 May 2013 |access-date=26 October 2008 |publisher=Observatório Quilombola (OQ) |language=pt}}</ref>

The Marapendi lagoon and the [[Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon]] have suffered with the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment buildings close by. The illegal discharge of sewage and the consequent deaths of algae diminished the oxygenation of the waters, causing fish mortality.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hélio Almeida |date=11 January 2011 |title=Lagoa de Marapendi sofre com poluição da água |trans-title=Marapendi Lagoon suffers with water pollution |url=http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/116507+lagoa+de+marapendi+sofre+com+poluicao+da+agua |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119050726/http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/116507+lagoa+de+marapendi+sofre+com+poluicao+da+agua |archive-date=19 January 2011 |access-date=18 November 2012 |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Agência Brasil |date=18 May 2010 |title=Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas estará despoluída até 2014, diz secretário |trans-title=Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon will be unpolluted until 2014, says secretary |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/vidae,lagoa-rodrigo-de-freitas-estara-despoluida-ate-2014-diz-secretario,553395,0.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518003936/http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/vidae,lagoa-rodrigo-de-freitas-estara-despoluida-ate-2014-diz-secretario,553395,0.htm |archive-date=18 May 2013 |access-date=18 November 2012 |website=O Estado de S.

There are, on the other hand, signs of decontamination in the lagoon made through a [[public-private partnership]] established in 2008 to ensure that the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing. The decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.<ref>{{Cite news |title=For rowers in Rio's Olympic water, it's all about avoiding the splash |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-olympic-rowing-dirty-water-20160806-story.html |access-date=8 May 2017}}</ref>

Rio has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') that closely borders a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]], and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between December and March.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alvares |first=Clayton Alcarde |last2=Stape |first2=José Luiz |last3=Sentelhas |first3=Paulo Cesar |last4=de Moraes Gonçalves |first4=José Leonardo |last5=Sparovek |first5=Gerd |year=2013 |title=Köppen's climate classification map for Brazil |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |publisher=E.

In inland areas of the city, temperatures above {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}} are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}} can occur on a monthly basis.

Along the coast, the breeze, blowing onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from [[Antarctica]], especially during autumn and winter, causing frequent weather changes. In summer there can be strong rains, which have, on some occasions, provoked catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite web |title=BBC Weather – Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/3451190 |access-date=14 May 2015 |website=BBC Weather}}</ref> The city has had rare [[frost]]s in the past.

Drought is very rare, albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city's strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014–2015, most severe in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]] and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the [[Paraíba do Sul]] River to the [[Guandu River (Rio de Janeiro)|Guandu]] River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Paraíba do Sul to the [[Sistema Cantareira]] (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken [[Greater São Paulo]] area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 September 2014 |title=Brazil drought crisis leads to rationing and tensions |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2014/sep/05/brazil-drought-crisis-rationing |access-date=2 February 2015 |website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=23 January 2015 |title=Brazil's worst drought in history prompts protests and blackouts |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/23/brazil-worst-drought-history |access-date=2 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 February 2015 |title=Paraíba do Sul River might not have enough water to rescue São Paulo's Sistema Cantareira |url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2015/02/rio-paraiba-do-sul-pode-nao-ter-agua-para-socorrer-sistema-cantareira.html |access-date=2 February 2015 |publisher=G1 |language=pt}}</ref>

Temperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. During the winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (in the form of winds from the [[Amazon Forest]]), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an [[extratropical cyclone]]) and summer [[evapotranspiration]] bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns. As a result, temperatures over {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, that may happen about year-round but are much more common during the summer, often mean the actual temperature feeling is over {{convert|50|°C|0|abbr=on}}, when there is little wind and the [[relative humidity]] percentage is high.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 February 2010 |title=Com sensação térmica de 48°C, cariocas se refugiram do calor nas praias |trans-title=Feeling like 48°C, cariocas bathe in beaches trying to escape from the heat |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1502179-5606,00-COM+SENSACAO+TERMICA+DE+C+CARIOCAS+SE+REFUGIAM+DO+CALOR+NAS+PRAIAS.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226030724/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0%2C%2CMUL1502179-5606%2C00-COM%2BSENSACAO%2BTERMICA%2BDE%2BC%2BCARIOCAS%2BSE%2BREFUGIAM%2BDO%2BCALOR%2BNAS%2BPRAIAS.html |archive-date=26 February 2010 |access-date=25 June 2013 |publisher=G1 |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=25 December 2012 |title=Sensação térmica no Rio de Janeiro chega a 50°C nesta terça-feira |trans-title=Rio de Janeiro will be feeling like 50°C this Tuesday |url=http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/sensa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-t%C3%A9rmica-rio-de-janeiro-chega-a-50-233457951.html |access-date=25 June 2013 |publisher=Yahoo!

Rio de Janeiro is second only to [[Cuiabá]] as the hottest Brazilian state capital outside [[North Region, Brazil|Northern]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] Brazil; temperatures below {{convert|14|°C|0|abbr=on}} occur yearly, while those lower than {{convert|11|°C|0|abbr=on}} happen less often. The phrase, ''fazer frio'' ("making cold", i.e. "the weather is getting cold"), usually refers to temperatures going below {{convert|21|°C|0|abbr=on}}, which is possible year-round and is commonplace in mid-to-late autumn, winter and early spring nights.

Between 1961 and 1990, at the INMET (Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology) conventional station in the neighborhood of [[Saúde, Rio de Janeiro|Saúde]], the lowest temperature recorded was {{convert|10.1|°C|1|abbr=on}} in October 1977,<ref name="RecordLowC_INMET" /> and the highest temperature recorded was {{convert|39|°C|1|abbr=on}} in December 1963.<ref name="RecordHighC_INMET" /> The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|167.4|mm|1|abbr=on}} in January 1962.<ref name="RainfallAbsoluteINMET" /> However, the absolute minimum temperature ever recorded at the INMET [[Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro|Jacarepaguá]] station was {{convert|3.8|°C|1|abbr=on}} in July 1974,<ref name="RecordLowC_INMET" /> while the absolute maximum was {{convert|43.2|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 26 December 2012<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 December 2012 |title=Temperatura desta quarta no Rio é recorde histórico, diz Inmet |url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2012/12/temperatura-desta-quarta-e-mais-alta-no-rio-em-29-anos-diz-inmet.html |access-date=8 September 2012 |publisher=G1 Rio de Janeiro |language=pt}}</ref> in the neighborhood of the [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]] station.

The city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], [[Campo Grande, Rio de Janeiro|Campo Grande]] and the wealthy newer [[Barra da Tijuca]] district.

===Central Zone===
{{Main|Zona Central, Rio de Janeiro|Centro, Rio de Janeiro}}
[[File:Centro do Rio visto do museu chácara do céu.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Aerial view of [[Centro (Rio de Janeiro)|Downtown Rio]]]]

Centro or Downtown is the historic core of the city, as well as its [[financial centre]]. Sites of interest include the [[Paço Imperial]], built during colonial times to serve as a residence for the Portuguese governors of Brazil; many historic churches, such as the [[Candelária Church]] (the former cathedral), São Jose, Santa Lucia, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Santa Rita, São Francisco de Paula, and the monasteries of Santo Antônio and São Bento. The Centro also houses the modern concrete [[Rio de Janeiro Cathedral]]. Around the [[Cinelândia]] square, there are several landmarks of the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' of Rio, such as the [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theatre]] and the [[National library|National Library]] building.

Among its several museums, the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]] (National Museum of Fine Arts) and the [[National Historical Museum (Brazil)|Museu Histórico Nacional]] (National Historical Museum) are the most important. Other important historical attractions in central Rio include its [[Passeio Público (Rio de Janeiro)|Passeio Público]], an 18th-century public garden. Major streets include Avenida Rio Branco and Avenida Vargas, both constructed, in 1906 and 1942 respectively, by destroying large swaths of the colonial city. A number of colonial streets, such as Rua do Ouvidor and Uruguaiana, have long been pedestrian spaces, and the popular Saara shopping district has been pedestrianized more recently. Also located in the center is the traditional neighbourhood called [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]], an important bohemian area frequented by both townspeople and tourists.

===South Zone===

[[File:Bondinho chegando no Pão de Açúcar.JPG|thumb|[[Sugarloaf Cable Car|Cablecar]] arriving at [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugarloaf]]]]

The South Zone of Rio de Janeiro ({{lang|pt|Zona Sul}}) is composed of several districts, among which are [[São Conrado]], [[Leblon]], [[Ipanema]], [[Arpoador]], [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]], and [[Leme (Rio de Janeiro)|Leme]], which compose Rio's famous [https://web.archive.org/web/20131022024238/http://rio2014.info/praias-melhores-de-rio-de-janeiro-best-beaches-rio-de-janeiro/ Atlantic beach coastline]. Other districts in the South Zone are Glória, Catete, [[Flamengo, Rio de Janeiro|Flamengo]], [[Botafogo]], and [[Urca]], which border [[Guanabara Bay]], and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]], [[Cosme Velho]], [[Laranjeiras]], [[Humaitá, Rio de Janeiro|Humaitá]], [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro|Lagoa]], [[Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro|Jardim Botânico]], and [[Gávea]]. It is the wealthiest part of the city and the best known overseas; the neighborhoods of Leblon and Ipanema, in particular, have the most expensive real estate in all of South America.

The neighbourhood of Copacabana beach hosts one of the world's most spectacular New Year's Eve parties ("Reveillon"), as more than two million revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the [[fireworks|fireworks display]]. From 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event.<ref>[http://www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2006/0104/zillah_0104.asp?nome=Zillah%20Branco&cod=5264 Rio Reveillon]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013145446/http://www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2006/0104/zillah_0104.asp?nome=Zillah%20Branco&cod=5264 |date=13 October 2007 }}</ref>

To the north of Leme, and at the entrance to Guanabara Bay, is the district of [[Urca]] and the [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugarloaf Mountain]] ('Pão de Açúcar'), whose name describes the famous mountain rising out of the sea. The summit can be reached via a two-stage [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] trip from Praia Vermelha, with the intermediate stop on Morro da Urca. It offers views of the city second only to Corcovado mountain. [[Hang gliding]] is a popular activity on the Pedra Bonita (literally, "Beautiful Rock"). After a short flight, gliders land on the Praia do Pepino (''Pepino'', or "[[cucumber]]", Beach) in São Conrado.

Since 1961, the [[Tijuca Forest|Tijuca National Park]] (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded [[urban forest]] and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Engelbrecht Ferreira |first=Daniel Ernesto |date=April 2005 |title=Poluição afeta Pedra Branca |language=pt |work=[[O Globo]] |url=http://www.biodiversityreporting.org/index.php?pageId=sub&lang=pt_BR&currentItem=article&docId=18381&c=Brasil&cRef=Brazil&year=2006&date=abril%202005 |url-status=dead |access-date=18 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007173549/http://www.biodiversityreporting.org/index.php?pageId=sub&lang=pt_BR&currentItem=article&docId=18381&c=Brasil&cRef=Brazil&year=2006&date=abril%202005 |archive-date=7 October 2007}}</ref>

The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio ([[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro|Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro]] or PUC-Rio), Brazil's top private university, is located at the edge of the forest, in the Gávea district. The 1984 film ''[[Blame It on Rio]]'' was filmed nearby, with the rental house used by the story's characters sitting at the edge of the forest on a mountain overlooking the famous beaches. In 2012, [[CNN]] elected Ipanema the best city beach in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Forgan |first=Duncan |date=23 May 2012 |title=World's best city beaches #2 |url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/best-city-beaches-209050?page=0,1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901062305/http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/best-city-beaches-209050?page=0%2C1 |archive-date=1 September 2012 |access-date=31 October 2012 |publisher=CNNGo.com}}</ref>

===North Zone===
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Aerea2 maracana.jpg|thumb|left|The iconic [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracanã Stadium]]]]
[[File:Palácio_de_São_Cristóvão.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paço de São Cristóvão|Palace of São Cristóvão]], the former residence of the [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperors of Brazil]], was the National Museum of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]], at [[Quinta da Boa Vista]], located in [[Imperial de São Cristóvão|São Cristóvão]] imperial neighbourhood.]]

The North Zone ({{lang|pt|Zona Norte}}) begins at Grande Tijuca (the middle class residential and commercial ''bairro'' of [[Tijuca]]), just west of the city center, and sprawls for miles inland until [[Baixada Fluminense]] and the city's Northwest.

This region is home to the [[Estádio do Maracanã|Maracanã stadium]] (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest capacity [[Association football|football]] venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as it did for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|final]] of [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]. More recently its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000; it will eventually hold around 80,000 people. Maracanã was the site for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football competition of the [[2007 Pan American Games]]; hosted the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]] of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Closing Ceremonies]] and the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics|football matches]] of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

Besides Maracanã, the North Zone of Rio also has other tourist and historical attractions, such "Nossa Senhora da Penha de França Church", the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)]] with its stairway built into the rock bed, 'Manguinhos', the home of [[Fundação Oswaldo Cruz|Instituto Oswaldo Cruz]], a centenarian [[biomedicine|biomedical]] [[research institute|research institution]] with a main building fashioned like a [[Moors|Moorish]] palace, and the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]], the park where the historic [[Paço de São Cristóvão|Imperial Palace]] is located. Nowadays, the palace hosts the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum]], specialising in Natural History, Archaeology, and Ethnology. The [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport|International Airport of Rio de Janeiro]] (Galeão&nbsp;– Antônio Carlos Jobim [[International airport|International Airport]], named after the famous Brazilian musician [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]]), the main campus of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] at the Fundão Island, and the [[Rio de Janeiro State University|State University of Rio de Janeiro]], in Maracanã, are also located in the Northern part of Rio.

This region is also home to most of the [[samba school]]s of Rio de Janeiro such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Império Serrano, Unidos da Tijuca, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, among others. Some of the main neighbourhoods of Rio's North Zone are Alto da Boa Vista which shares the [[Tijuca Forest|Tijuca Rainforest]] with the South and Southwest Zones; Tijuca, Vila Isabel, Méier, [[São Cristóvão (Rio de Janeiro neighborhood)|São Cristovão]], Madureira, Penha, Manguinhos, Fundão, Olaria among others. Many of Rio de Janeiro's roughly 1000 [[slums]], or [[favelas]], are located in the North Zone.<ref>"Reinventing Rio"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Reinventing-Rio.html], Alan Riding, September 2010, ''Smithsonian''</ref> The favelas resemble the slums of [[Paris]], [[New York City|New York]] or other major cities in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States and Europe, or similar neighborhoods in present underdeveloped countries.

===West Zone===

West Zone (''Zona Oeste'') of Rio de Janeiro is a vaguely defined area that covers some 50% of the city's entire area, including Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhoods. The West Side of Rio has many historic sites because of the old "Royal Road of Santa Cruz" that crossed the territory in the regions of Realengo, Bangu, and Campo Grande, finishing at the Royal Palace of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz region. The highest peak of the city of Rio de Janeiro is the Pedra Branca Peak (Pico da Pedra Branca) inside the [[Pedra Branca State Park]]. It has an altitude of 1024m. The Pedra Branca State Park (Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inea – Portal |url=http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/Portal/Agendas/BIODIVERSIDADEEAREASPROTEGIDAS/UnidadesdeConservacao/INEA_008594 |access-date=25 November 2015 |website=www.inea.rj.gov.br}}</ref> is the biggest urban state park in the world comprising 17 neighborhoods in the west side, being a "giant lung" in the city with trails,<ref>{{Cite web |title=[PDF] Trail Guide of Pedra Branca State |url=http://www.inea.rj.gov.br/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=13669&dDocName=PRODUCAO_PORTAL011861}}</ref> waterfalls and historic constructions like an old aqueduct in the Colônia Juliano Moreira<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bispo do Rosário Museum, the contemporary museum of Colônia |url=http://museubispodorosario.com}}</ref> in the neighborhood of [[Taquara, Rio de Janeiro|Taquara]] and a dam in [[Camorim]]. The park has three principal entrances: the main one is in Taquara called Pau da Fome Core, another entrance is the Piraquara Core in [[Realengo]] and the last one is the Camorim Core, considered the cultural heritage of the city.

Santa Cruz and Campo Grande Region have exhibited economic growth, mainly in the [[Campo Grande, Rio de Janeiro|Campo Grande neighborhood]]. Industrial enterprises are being built in lower and lower middle class residential [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], one of the largest and most populous of Rio de Janeiro's neighbourhoods, most notably [[Ternium|Ternium Brasil]], a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, which is planned to be South America's largest steel works.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SIDERÚRGICA DO ATLÂNTICO VAI GERAR 18 MIL EMPREGOS NA ZONA OESTE |url=http://www.alerj.rj.gov.br/common/noticia_corpo.asp?num=11187 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112104626/http://www.alerj.rj.gov.br/common/noticia_corpo.asp?num=11187 |archive-date=12 January 2016 |access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref> A tunnel called ''Túnel da Grota Funda'', opened in 2012, creating a [[public transit]] facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz, lessening travel time to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro.<ref name="VejaRio2011">{{Cite web |date=19 November 2011 |title=Topo do blog Quais serão os novos ares cariocas? |url=http://vejario.abril.com.br/blog/as-ruas-do-rio/tags/tunel-da-grota-funda |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709100044/http://vejario.abril.com.br/blog/as-ruas-do-rio/tags/tunel-da-grota-funda |archive-date=9 July 2014 |website=Veja Rio |language=pt}}</ref>

===Barra da Tijuca region===
[[File:Praia da Barra e Montanhas do Parque Nacional da Tijuca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barra da Tijuca]] with [[Pedra da Gávea]] in background]]

This is an elite area of the West Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It includes [[Barra da Tijuca]], [[Recreio dos Bandeirantes]], Vargem Grande, Vargem Pequena, [[Grumari]], [[Itanhangá, Rio de Janeiro|Itanhangá]], Camorim and [[Joá]]. Westwards from the older zones of Rio, Barra da Tijuca is a flat complex of barrier islands of formerly undeveloped coastal land, which constantly experiences new constructions and developments. It remains an area of accelerated growth, attracting some of the richer sectors of the population as well as luxury companies. [[Tower block|High rise]] flats and sprawling shopping centers give the area a far more [[Modernism|modern]] feel than the crowded city centre.

The urban planning of the area, completed in the late 1960s, mixes zones of single-family houses with residential skyscrapers. The beaches of Barra da Tijuca are also popular with the residents from other parts of the city. One of the most famous hills in the city is the {{convert|842|m|ft|0|abbr=off|adj=mid|-high}} [[Pedra da Gávea]] ([[Crow's nest]] Rock) bordering the South Zone. On the top of its summit is a huge rock formation (some, such as [[Erich von Däniken]] in his 1973 book, ''In Search of Ancient Gods'', claim it to be a sculpture) resembling a sphinx-like, bearded head that is visible for many kilometres around.

Different ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the [[French Brazilian|French]] were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tem índio no Rio |url=http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813071626/http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |archive-date=13 August 2007 |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=Paginas.terra.com.br}}</ref>

People of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.<ref>{{Google books |id=QPDe42CBSeMC |page=107 |title=Os lusíadas na aventura do Rio moderno }}</ref>

The [[Afro-Brazilian|black community]] was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and [[West African]] descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city.

Today, nearly half of the city's population is by phenotype perceptibly black or part black.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brasil 500 anos |url=http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/negros/origem.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518220742/http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/negros/origem.html |archive-date=18 May 2008 |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=.ibge.gov.br}}</ref> A large majority has some recent sub-Saharan ancestor.

According to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro, the "pardos" there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the "whites" (who thought of themselves as "very mixed") were found to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The "pardos" for example thought of themselves as ⅓ European, ⅓ African and ⅓ Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Negros e pardos do Rio têm mais genes europeus do que imaginam, segundo estudo |url=http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153557/http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |archive-date=6 July 2011 |access-date=15 September 2011 |publisher=Meionews.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ensp.fiocruz.br/informe/anexos/ric.pdf |url=http://www4.ensp.fiocruz.br/informe/anexos/ric.pdf |access-date=23 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Other studies showed similar results<ref name="laboratoriogene.info" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Durso |first=DF |last2=Bydlowski |first2=SP |last3=Hutz |first3=MH |last4=Suarez-Kurtz |first4=G |last5=Magalhães |first5=TR |last6=Pena |first6=SD |year=2014 |title=Association of genetic variants with self-assessed color categories in Brazilians |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=e83926 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...983926D |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0083926 |pmc=3885524 |pmid=24416183}}</ref>

There have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to [[Public housing|housing projects]] such as [[Cidade de Deus (Rio de Janeiro)|Cidade de Deus]] to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas and bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the "Favela Bairro" program and deployment of [[Pacifying Police Unit]]s.

Rio has more people living in slums than any other city in Brazil, according to the 2010 Census.<ref>{{Cite news |date=21 December 2011 |title=Rio é a cidade com maior população em favelas do Brasil |language=pt-BR |work=O Globo |url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/rio-a-cidade-com-maior-populacao-em-favelas-do-brasil-3489272 |access-date=4 August 2017}}</ref> More than 1,500,000 people live in its 763 favelas, 22% of Rio's total population.

Rio de Janeiro has the second largest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by [[São Paulo]]. According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], it was approximately US$201&nbsp;billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban [[metropolis]] (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of economy |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/29092003estatisticasecxxhtml.shtm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103124742/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/29092003estatisticasecxxhtml.shtm |archive-date=3 January 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Ibge.gov.br}}</ref>

Greater Rio de Janeiro, as perceived by the IBGE, has a GDP of US$187&nbsp;billion, constituting the second largest hub of national wealth.

Benefiting from the federal capital position it had for a long period (1763–1960), the city became a dynamic administrative, financial, commercial and cultural center. Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. The city was chosen as headquarters for [[Public property|state-owned]] companies such as [[Petrobras]], [[Eletrobras]], [[Caixa Econômica Federal]], [[Brazilian Development Bank|National Economic and Social Development Bank]] and [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]] (which was privatized in the 1990s). The [[Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange]] (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845. Despite the transfer of the capital to [[Brasília]] in 1960, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area.

The off-shore oil exploration in the [[Campos Basin]] began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[EBX Group|EBX]] and [[Esso]]. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil,<ref>{{Cite web |title=IBGE – Economy of Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&o=17&i=P&c=793 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Sidra.ibge.gov.br}}</ref> with [[oil refineries]], shipbuilding industries, steel, [[metallurgy]], petrochemicals, cement, [[pharmaceutic]]al, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.

Major international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: [[Merck KGaA|Merck]], [[Roche Applied Science|Roche]], Arrow, Darrow, [[Baxter International|Baxter]], Mayne, and Mappel. A newer electronics and computer sector has been added to the more-established industries. Construction, also an important activity, provides a significant source of employment for large numbers of unskilled workers and is buoyed by the number of seasonal residents who build second homes in the Greater Rio de Janeiro area.

Rio is an important financial centre, second only to São Paulo in volume of business. Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to São Paulo, is still of major importance. Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Economy Of Rio de Janeiro, need To Know Economy Of Rio de Janeiro, About Economy Of Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.barra-brazilbeach.com/about_us/Economy_Of_Rio_de_Janeiro.html |access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref> The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as [[Intelig Telecom|Intelig]], [[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi]] and [[Embratel]]. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like [[Organizações Globo]] and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: ''[[Jornal do Brasil]]'', ''[[O Dia]]'', and ''Business Rio''.

Tourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life. The city is the nation's top tourist attraction for both Brazilians and foreigners.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tourism in Rio |url=http://www.portalemfoco.com.br/artigos.php?pag=artigo&artigoid=150 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153936/http://www.portalemfoco.com.br/artigos.php?pag=artigo&artigoid=150 |archive-date=6 July 2011 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Portalemfoco.com.br}}</ref>

To attract industry, the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state government]] has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rio de Janeiro será a capital do petróleo entre os dias 13 e 16 de setembro – Agricultura &#124;RuralBR |url=http://agricultura.ruralbr.com.br/noticia/2010/09/rio-de-janeiro-sera-a-capital-do-petroleo-entre-os-dias-13-e-16-de-setembro-3035609.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105160734/http://agricultura.ruralbr.com.br/noticia/2010/09/rio-de-janeiro-sera-a-capital-do-petroleo-entre-os-dias-13-e-16-de-setembro-3035609.html |archive-date=5 November 2013 |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher=Agricultura.ruralbr.com.br}}</ref>

Owing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the centre, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centres, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Economy of Rio |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/504192/Rio-de-Janeiro/29045/Climate# |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>

{{Main|Tourism in Brazil}}
Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's primary tourist attraction and resort. It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82&nbsp;million international tourists a year.<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 January 2010 |title=Rio de Janeiro is the main tourist destination in the South Hemisphere |url=https://www.rio2016.com/en/news/rio-de-janeiro-is-the-main-tourist-destination-in-the-south-hemisphere |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118174506/http://www.rio2016.com/en/news/rio-de-janeiro-is-the-main-tourist-destination-in-the-south-hemisphere |archive-date=18 November 2015 |access-date=11 February 2010}}</ref>

The city boasts world-class hotels, like [[Copacabana Palace|Belmond Copacabana Palace]], approximately 80&nbsp;kilometres of beaches and the famous [[Corcovado]], [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugarloaf]] mountains and [[Maracanã Stadium]]. While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Flickr roger4336 |title=Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/rio-de-janeiro/overview.html |access-date=14 May 2015 |website=TouristLink}}</ref>

The fact that [[Brasília]] replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that [[São Paulo]] replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.<ref name="Worldwide destinations" />

Rio de Janeiro's government has since undertaken to modernise the city's economy, reduce its chronic social inequalities, and improve its commercial standing as part of an initiative for the regeneration of the tourism industry.<ref name="Worldwide destinations">{{Cite book |last=Boniface |first=Brian G. |url=https://archive.org/details/worldwidedestina0000boni/page/233 |title=Worldwide destinations casebook: the geography of travel and tourism |last2=Cooper |first2=Christopher P. |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2005 |isbn=0-7506-6440-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldwidedestina0000boni/page/233 233–35] |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Primary schools are largely under municipal administration, while the state plays a more significant role in the extensive network of secondary schools.

Rio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the [[Portugal|Portuguese Imperial family]] and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by [[Architecture of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Architecture of England|English]], and [[French architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=FBN Summit |url=http://www.fbnsummit.org/2013/brazil-and-the-city-of-rio/ |access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref>

Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The [[Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival]]<ref>festivaldorio.com.br</ref> has been held annually since 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0001488/overview |access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref>

Internationally famous, Brazilian-made movies illustrating a darker side of Rio de Janeiro include ''[[Elite Squad]]'' and [[City of God (2002 film)|''City of God'']].

[[File:Esculturas, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes 02.jpg|thumb|[[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]]]

Rio has many important cultural landmarks, such as the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library), one of the largest libraries in the world with collections totalling more than 9 million items; the [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]]; the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]; the [[Carmen Miranda Museum]]; the [[Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden]]; the [[Parque Lage]]; the [[Quinta da Boa Vista]]; the [[Paço Imperial|Imperial Square]]; the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]]; the [[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro|Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro]]; and the [[National Museum of Brazil|Natural History Museum]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Literature of Brazil}}
After Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a [[Culture of Europe|European-style]] bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]]'s ''[[A Moreninha]]'' (1844) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune.

[[File:Academia brasileira de letras 2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]]]]

The first notable work of realism focusing on the urban [[lower middle class|lower-middle class]] is [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]]'s ''[[Memórias de um sargento de milícias]]'' (1854), which presents a series of picaresque but touching scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Piers Armstrong |title=Rio's novel history |url=http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521825334_CCOL0521825334A008 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Cco.cambridge.org}}</ref>

The most famous author of Rio de Janeiro, however, was [[Machado de Assis]], who is also widely regarded as the greatest writer of [[Brazilian literature]]<ref>[[Antonio Candido|Candido; Antonio.]] (1970) ''Vários escritos.'' São Paulo: Duas Cidades. p.18.</ref> and considered the founder of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in Brazil, with the publication of ''[[The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas]]'' (1881).<ref>Faraco, Carlos Emílio e Moura, Francisco Mato. ''Português Projetos''. São Paulo: Editora Ática, 2009, p.227.</ref> He commented on and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from [[Empire of Brazil|Empire]] to Republic with his numerous [[chronicle]]s published in newspapers of the time.<ref>Gledson, John. J. ''Machado de Assis, ficção e história''. Rio de Janeiro: Paz e Terra, 1986, p. 13.</ref> Many of his short stories and novels, like ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' (1891) and ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), are placed in Rio.

The headquarters of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] is based in Rio de Janeiro. It was satirized by the novelist [[Jorge Amado]] in ''[[Pen, Sword, Camisole]]''. Amado, himself, went on to be one of the 40 members of the Academy.

The Biblioteca Nacional ([[National Library of Brazil]]) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Library of Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/national-library.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830173312/http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/national-library.htm |archive-date=30 August 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Rio-de-janeiro.info}}</ref> Located in [[Cinelândia]], the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the [[History of Portugal]] and [[History of Brazil|Brazil]]; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Antônio de Araújo de Azevedo, the "Count of Barca", including the 125-volume set of prints "Le Grand Théâtre de l'Univers;" a collection of documents regarding the Jesuítica Province of Paraguay and the "Region of Prata;" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]. The collection contains 48,236 items. Individual items of special interest include a rare first edition of ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' by [[Luís de Camões|Luis de Camões]], published in 1584; two copies of the Mogúncia Bible; and a first edition of Handel's Messiah.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 August 2008 |title=Official website – National Library of Rio |url=http://www.bn.br/portal/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328091608/http://www.bn.br/portal/ |archive-date=28 March 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Bn.br}}</ref>

The Real Gabinete Português de Leitura (Portuguese Royal Reading Library) is located at Rua Luís de Camões, in the Centro (Downtown). The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three [[Portuguese people|Portuguese immigrants]], [[political refugee]]s, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire. The history of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] is linked to the Real Gabinete, since some of the early meetings of the Academy were held there.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 May 2011 |title=Um pedaço de Portugal no Rio de Janeiro – Opinião e Notícia |url=http://opiniaoenoticia.com.br/cultura/um-pedaco-de-portugal-no-rio-de-janeiro/ |website=opiniaoenoticia.com.br}}</ref>

===Music===

The official song of Rio de Janeiro is "[[Cidade Maravilhosa]]", which means "marvelous city". The song is considered the civic anthem of Rio, and is always the favourite song during Rio's [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] in February. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, are considered the centre of the [[urban contemporary|urban music]] movement in Brazil.<ref>Behague, Gerard. "Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in [[Música popular brasileira|Brazilian Popular Music]] (1985–1995)." [[Latin American music|Latin American Music]] Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79–90</ref>

"Rio was popularised by the hit song "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]", composed by [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]] and [[Vinicius de Moraes]] and recorded by [[Astrud Gilberto]] and [[João Gilberto]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. It is also the main key song of the [[bossa nova]], a [[music genre]] born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is [[Funk carioca|Funk Carioca]]. While [[samba]] music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of [[electronic music]] associated with the current US [[African-American music|black music]] scene, including [[hip hop]], modern soul, and [[house music]]."<ref>Sansone, Livio. "The Localization of Global Funk in Bahia and Rio." In Brazilian Popular Music & Globalization, 135–60. London: Routledge, 2002.</ref>

Brazil's return to democracy in 1985 allowed for a new music expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture, in a wave of Rock'n'roll that swept the 80s. [[Lobão]] emerged as the most legendary rocker in Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 February 2004 |title=Rio de Janeiro Carnival |url=https://www.carnivaland.net/rio-de-janeiro-carnival/ |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=carnivaland.net}}</ref> Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and [[Brazilian hip hop]]. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the [[Punk in Brazil]], and that of [[Brazilian thrash metal]]. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{Cite journal |last=Behague |first=Gerard |year=2006 |title=Globalization/Modernization: Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985–1995) |journal=Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=79–90 |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 |s2cid=191430137}}</ref>

Rio de Janeiro's [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]] is one of the most attractive buildings in the central area of the city. Home of one of the largest stages in Latin America and one of Brazil's best known venues for opera, ballet, and classical music, the building was inspired by the [[Palais Garnier]], home of the [[Paris Opera]]. Construction of the Theatro Municipal began in 1905 following designs of the architect Francisco Pereira Passos. The statues on the top, of two women representing Poetry and Music, are by Rodolfo Bernardelli, and the interior is rich with furnishings and fine paintings. Inaugurated in 1909, the Teatro Municipal has close to 1,700 seats. Its interior includes turn of the century stained glass from France, ceilings of rose-colored marble and a 1,000&nbsp;pound crystal bead chandelier surrounded by a painting of the "[[Dance of the Hours]]". The exterior walls of the building are dotted with inscriptions bearing the names of famous Brazilians as well as many other international celebrities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teatro Municipal do Rio |url=http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/teatro-municipal.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406222751/http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/teatro-municipal.htm |archive-date=6 April 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Rio-de-janeiro.info}}</ref>

[[Cidade da Música|Cidade das Artes]] (City of Arts) is a cultural complex in Barra da Tijuca in the Southwest Zone of Rio de Janeiro, which was originally planned to open in 2004. Formally known as "Cidade da Música" (City of Music), it was finally inaugurated at the beginning of 2013.
The project will host the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra becoming a main center for music as will be the largest modern concert hall in South America, with 1,780 seats. The complex spans approximately {{convert|90|e3m2|e6ft2|0|abbr=off}} and also features a chamber music hall, three theaters, and 12 rehearsal rooms. From the terrace there is a panoramic view of the zone. The building was designed by the French architect [[Christian de Portzamparc]] and construction was funded by the city of Rio de Janeiro.

Every 31 December, 2.5&nbsp;million people gather at [[Copacabana Beach]] to celebrate New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all night at the hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second largest celebration only next to the [[Rio Carnival|Carnival]]. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the champagne bottle and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds to the spirit of the festivities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=New Year – Rio |url=http://www.copacabana.info/new-years-eve.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229014744/http://www.copacabana.info/new-years-eve.html |archive-date=29 December 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Copacabana.info}}</ref>

====Carnival====
{{Main|Rio Carnival|Brazilian Carnaval}}
[[File:Banda de Ipanema.jpg|thumb|[[Banda de Ipanema]], one of the largest [[carnival block]]s of the city]]

Carnaval, is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40&nbsp;days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had Bourbon and Austrian ancestors. Up until the time of the [[marchinha]]s, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music became more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the famous [[samba school]] (''Escolas de Samba)''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Castro Brunetto |first=Carlos Javier |title=Between categories, beyond boundaries: Arte, ciudad e identidad |publisher=Libargo |year=2013 |isbn=978-84-938812-9-0 |location=Granada |pages=112–130 |chapter=Arte popular y estética contemporánea en las escuelas de samba de Río de Janeiro}}</ref> parades in the [[Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí|sambadrome]] exhibition center and the popular ''[[Carnival block|blocos de carnaval]]'', street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city. The most famous ones are:
* ''Cordão do Bola Preta'': Parades in the centre of the city. It is one of the most traditional carnavals. In 2008, 500,000 people attended in one day.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cordão do Bola Preta in Rio |url=http://carnaval.uol.com.br/noticias/riodejaneiro/2008/02/02/ult5681u63.jhtm |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Carnaval.uol.com.br}}</ref> In 2011, a record 2 million people attended the city covering three different metro stations.
* ''Suvaco do Cristo'': Band that parades in the [[Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro|Botanic Garden]], directly below the Redeemer statue's arm. The name translates to 'Christ's armpit' in English, and was chosen for that reason.
* ''Carmelitas'': Band that was supposedly created by nuns, but in fact is just a theme chosen by the band. It parades in Santa Teresa, a ''bairro'' from where one can see extensive panoramas.
* ''Simpatia é Quase Amor'': One of the most popular parades in Ipanema. Translates as 'Friendliness is almost love'.
* ''[[Banda de Ipanema]]'': The most traditional in [[Ipanema]]. It attracts a wide range of revellers, including families and a wide spectrum of the [[LGBT]]/[[Queer]] population (notably drag queens).

In 1840, the first Carnaval was celebrated with a masked ball. As years passed, adorned floats and costumed revelers became a tradition among the celebrants. Carnaval is known as a historic root of [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian music]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brazilian Music: Roots 3 |url=http://www.maria-brazil.org/mpb3.htm |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=Maria-brazil.org}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref>

Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]s, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the [[Maracanã Stadium]] hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team's matches. The Maracanã was also the location of the infamous tournament-deciding match between [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2–1 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracanã hosted seven matches, including [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]], where [[Germany national football team|Germany]] beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 1–0.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 July 2014 |title=Germany 1–0 Argentina |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28181689 |access-date=14 July 2014 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

===Other sports===
The city has a history as host of major international sports events. The [[Ginásio do Maracanãzinho]] was the host arena for the official [[FIBA Basketball World Championship]] for its [[1954 FIBA World Championship|1954]] and [[1963 FIBA World Championship|1963]] editions. Later, the [[Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet|Jacarepaguá]] circuit in Rio de Janeiro was the site for the [[Formula One]] [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] from 1978 to 1989. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] [[Brazilian Grand Prix]] from 1995 to 2004 and the [[Champ Car]] event from 1996 to 1999. [[Association of Surfing Professionals|WCT/WQS]] [[surfing]] championships were contested on the beaches from 1985 to 2001. The [[Rio Champions Cup]] Tennis tournament is held in the spring. As part of its preparations to host the [[2007 Pan American Games]], Rio built a new stadium, [[Estádio Olímpico João Havelange]], to hold 45,000 people. It was named after Brazilian ex-[[FIFA]] president [[João Havelange]]. The stadium is owned by the city of Rio de Janeiro, but it was rented to [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas]] for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name="rent">{{Cite web |title=Botafogo vai administrar estádio olímpico do Engenhão |url=http://noticias.correioweb.com.br/materias.php?id=2715287&sub=Esporte |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217095517/http://noticias.correioweb.com.br/materias.php?id=2715287&sub=Esporte |archive-date=17 December 2007 |access-date=28 August 2007 |publisher=Correio Web}}</ref> Rio de Janeiro has also a multi-purpose arena, the [[HSBC Arena (Rio de Janeiro)|HSBC Arena]].

[[File:Crianças jogando futebol de areia.jpg|thumb|right|Children playing beach football]]

The Brazilian Dance/Sport/[[Martial art]] [[Capoeira]] is very popular. Other popular sports are [[basketball]], [[Beach soccer|beach football]], [[beach volleyball]], Beach American Football, [[footvolley]], [[surfing]], [[kite surfing]], [[hang gliding]], [[motor racing]], [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]], [[Luta Livre]], [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]], and competitive [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Another sport that is highly popular in beaches of Rio is called "Frescobol" ({{IPA-pt|fɾe̞ɕko̞ˈbɔw|pron}}), a type of beach tennis. Rio de Janeiro is also paradise for [[Rock climbing|rock climbers]], with hundreds of routes all over the city, ranging from easy boulders to highly technical big wall climbs, all inside the city. The most famous, Rio's granite mountain, the [[Sugarloaf Mountain (Brazil)|Sugar Loaf]] (''Pão de Açúcar''), is an example, with routes from the easy third grade (American 5.4, French 3) to the extremely difficult ninth grade (5.13/8b), up to {{convert|280|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}.

[[Horse racing]] events are held Thursday nights and weekend afternoons at [[Hipódromo da Gávea]]. An impressive place with excellent grass and dirt tracks, it runs the best horses in the nation. Hang gliding in Rio de Janeiro started in the mid-1970s and quickly proved to be well-suited for this town, because of its geography: steep mountains encounter the Atlantic Ocean, which provide excellent take-off locations and great landing zones on the beach.

One of the most popular sea sports in the city is [[yachting]]. The main yacht clubs are in [[Botafogo]] area that extends halfway between [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] and the center of town. Though the most exclusive and interesting is probably the Rio Yacht club, where high society makes it a point to congregate. Most yacht clubs are open to members only and gate crashing is not easy. Copacabana is also a great place to surf, as well as "Arpoador of Ipanema" beach and "Praia dos Bandeirantes". The sea at these beaches is rough and dangerous, and the best surfers from Brazil and other sites of the world come to these beaches to prove themselves.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sports in the city of Rio |url=http://www.studylanguages.org/portuguesecourses/brazil/riodejaneiro/riodejaneiro-sports.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511032038/http://studylanguages.org/portuguesecourses/brazil/riodejaneiro/riodejaneiro-sports.asp |archive-date=11 May 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Studylanguages.org}}</ref>

==Transportation==
===Airports ===
The city of Rio de Janeiro is served by the following airports for use:
[[File:Airj aeroporto internacional do mundo rio de janeiro - panoramio.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport]]]]
[[File:Santos_Dumont_by_Diego_Baravelli.jpg|thumb|[[Santos Dumont Airport|Rio de Janeiro–Santos Dumont National Airport]]]]

* [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport|Galeão–Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport]]: used for all international and most of the domestic flights. Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to the city. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Galeão has connections to 19 countries. It has a capacity to handle up to 30&nbsp;million users a year in two passenger terminals. It is located {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from downtown Rio. The airport complex also has Brazil's longest runway at {{convert|4000|m|2|abbr=on}}, and one of South America's largest cargo logistics terminals. The airport is connected to the express bus service.<ref>{{Cite web |title=International Airport of Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=213 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423091928/http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=213 |archive-date=23 April 2008 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Infraero}}</ref>
* [[Santos Dumont Airport]]: used mainly by the services to [[São Paulo]], some short and medium-haul domestic flights, and general aviation. Located on [[Guanabara Bay]] just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Rio, during the 1990s Santos-Dumont began to outgrow its capacity, besides diverging from its specialization on short-hop flights, offering routes to other destinations in Brazil. For this reason, in late 2004 Santos-Dumont returned to its original condition of operating only shuttle flights to and from [[Congonhas-São Paulo Airport|Congonhas Airport]] in São Paulo, along with regional aviation. The passenger terminal has undergone extensive renovation and expansion, which increased its capacity to 9,9&nbsp;million users a year. The airport is connected to the city light rail system ([[Rio de Janeiro Light Rail]]), which connects several transport systems to downtown.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Airport of Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=212 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521200151/http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=212 |archive-date=21 May 2008 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Infraero}}</ref>
* [[Jacarepaguá Airport|Jacarepaguá-Roberto Marinho Airport]]: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil [[Flying club]]). The airport is located in the district of Baixada de Jacarepaguá, within the municipality of Rio de Janeiro approximately {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city center.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jacarepaguá Airport |url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=214 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706115512/http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=214 |archive-date=6 July 2009 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Infraero}}</ref>

Military airports include:
* [[Galeão Air Force Base]]: A [[Brazilian Air Force]] airbase, sharing some facilities with Galeão&nbsp;- Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport;
* [[Santa Cruz Air Force Base]]: A Brazilian Air Force airbase. Formerly called [[Bartolomeu de Gusmão Airport]], it was built by the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin]]. Today it is one of the most important Air Force Bases in Brazil;
* [[Afonsos Air Force Base]]: One of the historical Brazilian Air Force airbases. It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da Força Aérea),<ref>{{Cite web |title=UNIFA – Página inicial |url=http://www.unifa.aer.mil.br/ |access-date=11 October 2017 |website=www.unifa.aer.mil.br}}</ref> the [[Museu Aeroespacial]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=MUSEU AEROESPACIAL |url=http://www.musal.aer.mil.br/ |access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref> and where air shows take place.

=== Ports ===
[[File:Cruise_Ship_Costa_Serena_docked_in_Rio_de_Janeiro_(city)_-_Feb._2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Port of Rio de Janeiro]]]]

The [[Port of Rio de Janeiro]] is Brazil's third busiest port in terms of cargo volume, and it is the center for cruise vessels. Located on the west coast of the [[Guanabara Bay]], it serves the States of Rio de Janeiro, [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Minas Gerais, and [[Espírito Santo]]. The port is managed by Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro. The Port of Rio de Janeiro covers territory from the Mauá Pier in the east to the Wharf of the Cashew in the north. The Port of Rio de Janeiro contains almost {{convert|7|e3m|e3ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} of continuous wharf and an {{convert|883|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off}} pier. The Companhia Docas de Rio de Janeiro administers directly the Wharf of the Gamboa general [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]]; the wheat terminal with two warehouses capable of moving 300 tons of grains; General Load Terminal 2 with warehouses covering over {{convert|20|e3m2|e3ft2|0|abbr=off}}; and the Wharves of Are Cristovao with terminals for wheat and liquid bulk.<ref>{{Cite web |title=WPS – Port of Rio de Janeiro contact information |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/BRA_Port_of_Rio_de_Janeiro_1327.php |access-date=31 October 2012 |publisher=Worldportsource.com}}</ref>

At the Wharf of Gamboa, leaseholders operate terminals for sugar, paper, iron and steel products.

===Public transportation===
[[File:Public transport map of Rio de Janeiro.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Public transport map]]

In Rio de Janeiro, buses are the main form of [[public transportation]]. There are nearly 440 municipal bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio's transportation policy has been moving towards trains and subway in order to reduce surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in São Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services. Rio is a country.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rio de Janeiro, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 95 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 min, while 35% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 12.3&nbsp;km, while 37% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rio de Janeiro Public Transportation Statistics |url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Brazil_Rio_de_Janeiro-322 |access-date=19 June 2017 |publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>

====Subway and urban trains====
{{Main|Rio de Janeiro Metro|SuperVia}}
Rio de Janeiro has three [[Rapid transit|subway]] lines (''Metrô Rio'') with {{convert|58|km|mi|0}} and 41 stations plus several [[commuter rail]] lines. Future plans include building a fourth subway line to [[Niterói]] and [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]], including an underwater tunnel beneath [[Guanabara Bay]] to supplement the ferry service currently there.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 February 2008 |title=O DIA Online&nbsp;– Linha 3 do metrô vai receber R$35 milhões da União |url=http://odia.terra.com.br/rio/htm/linha_3_do_metro_vai_receber_r_35_milhoes_da_uniao_152725.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226043911/http://odia.terra.com.br/rio/htm/linha_3_do_metro_vai_receber_r_35_milhoes_da_uniao_152725.asp |archive-date=26 February 2008 |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=odia.terra.com.br}}</ref> The [[Rapid transit|Metro]] is Rio's safest and cleanest form of public transport.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Do G1, no Rio, com informações da TV Globo |title=Metro Rio – Transport |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1405729-5606,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194749/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0%2C%2CMUL1405729-5606%2C00.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=G1.globo.com}}</ref>

The three lines serve the city seven days a week. The first line runs from [[Tom Jobim Station|General Osório]] in [[Ipanema]] to Uruguai Station in [[Tijuca]]. The second line runs from Botafogo, sharing ten stations with the first line, terminating at Pavuna in northern Rio. The third connects [[Tom Jobim Station|General Osório]] to [[Jardim Oceânico Station]], in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, where the 2016 Olympic Games were held. The Metro runs services from 05:00&nbsp;am to 12:00 midnight, Monday to Saturday, and from 07:00&nbsp;am to 11:00&nbsp;pm Sundays and public holidays. People can buy tickets for the Metro at train stations and can either buy single tickets or rechargeable cards. People can also buy tickets for the Metro at buses that make connect places far from the Metro. Integration with buses are possible in several forms, an integrated Metro and bus ticket for a single journey is available for some lines paying an additional fee and is known as an Integração Expressa (Express Integration) and Expresso Barra, the other possibility is taking the Metro na Superfície (Surface Metro) with no additional fee.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Metro Rio |url=http://www.metrorio.com.br/ |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Metro Rio}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Metro Rio Integrações |url=http://www.metrorio.com.br/integracoes.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217095517/http://noticias.correioweb.com.br/materias.php?id=2715287&sub=Esporte |archive-date=17 December 2007 |access-date=10 August 2011 |publisher=Metro Rio}}</ref>

[[SuperVia]] connects the city of Rio with other locations in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] with surface trains. It has 8 lines and {{convert|270|km|mi|0}}, with 102 stations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SuperVia |url=http://www.supervia.com.br/site/index.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106162745/http://www.supervia.com.br/site/index.php |archive-date=6 January 2011 |access-date=16 October 2010 |publisher=SuperVia}}</ref>

====Light rail====
[[File:VLT Rio 07 2016 7746.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Rio de Janeiro Light Rail]] in Downtown Rio]]

In order to improve traffic in the central zone, the prefecture started the project "Porto Maravilha" (Marvelous Port), which foresees a modern [[tram]]way system. Its lines will connect the central business district to [[Santos Dumont Airport]], the ferry station at XV Square, the [[Novo Rio Bus Terminal|Novo Rio terminal bus station]] at Santo Cristo, and the future [[high-speed rail]] Leopoldina station between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Resultados |first=AM4 – A Internet de |title=Porto Maravilha |url=http://www.portomaravilha.com.br/web/esq/projEspVLT.aspx |website=portomaravilha.com.br}}</ref>

In 2016, for the Olympic Games, the light rail system was inaugurated, with 28&nbsp;km, 42 stations, distributed in 3 lines. The trams are the first in the world to use a combination of ground-level power supply (APS) and on-board supercapacitor energy storage (SRS), in order to eliminate overhead lines along the entire route.

====Bus====

It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the "''Bilhete Único Carioca (BUC)''") in order to benefit of this system.

Another type of local bus is called the "''Frescão''" (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned – about {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} – more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$6.00–R$12.00.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nossas Linhas – Premium |url=http://www.realautoonibus.com.br/Site/NossasLinhas-Premium-00,undefined,REAL72219720120509134104-2.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615070806/http://www.realautoonibus.com.br/Site/NossasLinhas-Premium-00,undefined,REAL72219720120509134104-2.html |archive-date=15 June 2013 |access-date=9 May 2012 |publisher=Real Auto Ônibus}}</ref> However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing "Castelo").

====Ferry====
[[File:Barca Pão de Açúcar (4).jpg|thumb|Rio de Janeiro ferry]]

The most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of [[Guanabara Bay]] is [[Niterói]]. Many people who live in Niterói, as well its neighbouring municipalities [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]] and [[Maricá]], commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro ([[Praça XV Station|Praça XV]]) and Niterói (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several "fast cat" [[hydrofoil]] boats.
One of the city neighborhoods is [[Paquetá Island]], which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquetá leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to [[Cocotá]].

===Road transport===
[[File:Rio de Janeiro Ponte Niteroi Aerea 102 Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rio-Niterói Bridge]]]]

Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car fleet. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, [[Avenida Brasil (Rio de Janeiro)|Avenida Brasil]], Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique ([[Aterro do Flamengo]]); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Driving in Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.rioholiday.com/Driving-in-Rio-de-Janeiro.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524065912/http://www.rioholiday.com/Driving-in-Rio-de-Janeiro.htm |archive-date=24 May 2009 |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=Rioholiday.com}}</ref> Because of the organization of the [[2016 Olympics]] the city is installing four [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] systems to link [[Barra da Tijuca]] with other major neighbourhoods: [[TransOlimpica]] (between Barra and [[Deodoro (Rio de Janeiro)|Deodoro]]); TransBrasil (over the [[Avenida Brasil (Rio de Janeiro)|Avenida Brasil]] expressway); [[TransCarioca]] (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and [[TransOeste]] (between Barra and [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], over Avenida das Américas).

In Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and [[Sepetiba]] port). Rio has roads to all neighbour [[States of Brazil|States]]. Some roads (like [[Rodovia Presidente Dutra|Via Dutra]], to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From [[São Paulo]]: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the [[Brazilian Highway System|BR-101]] (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From [[Belo Horizonte]]: BR-040. From [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]: BR-101 or [[BR-324]]/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.

===Bicycles===
[[File:BikeRio 11 2015 Praça Mauá 706.JPG|thumb|[[Bike Rio]] rental station in Mauá Square, Downtown Rio]]

The city has {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} of cycle paths that, wherever they exist, are very much preferable to riding in the city's traffic. Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the Marina da Glória, Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. {{convert|6|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} of cycle paths traverse the [[Tijuca Forest|Tijuca National Park]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Getting around Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/104/getting_around/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127043742/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/104/getting_around/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro.html |archive-date=27 January 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net}}</ref>

The [[Bike Rio]] began operations in October 2011. This [[bicycle sharing system]] is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with [[Itaú Unibanco|Banco Itaú]]. The bike sharing system has 600 bicycles available at 60 rental stations in 14 neighborhoods throughout the city.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Louise Peres |date=28 October 2011 |title=Prefeitura lança Bike Rio, novo sistema de aluguel de bicicletas da cidade |language=pt |trans-title=City Hall launches Bike Rio, the city's new bike sharing system |work=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja Rio]] |url=http://vejario.abril.com.br/especial/aluguel-bicicleta-rio-645043.shtml |url-status=dead |access-date=11 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402101912/http://vejario.abril.com.br/especial/aluguel-bicicleta-rio-645043.shtml |archive-date=2 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Louise Peres |date=28 October 2011 |title=Itaú patrocina programa de aluguel de bicicletas no Rio |language=pt |trans-title=Itau sponsors bike sharing program in Rio |work=[[Exame (magazine)|Exame]] |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/marketing/noticias/itau-patrocina-programa-de-aluguel-de-bicicletas-no-rio |url-status=dead |access-date=11 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402101927/http://exame.abril.com.br/marketing/noticias/itau-patrocina-programa-de-aluguel-de-bicicletas-no-rio |archive-date=2 April 2013}}</ref>
