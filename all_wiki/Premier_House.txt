'''Premier House''' ({{lang-mi|Te Whare Pirimia}}) is the [[official residence]] of the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]], located at 260 Tinakori Road, [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]], [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].

A private house purchased for the Prime Minister's official residence when government shifted its base to [[Wellington]] in 1865, it was first greatly expanded and then, as its wooden structure deteriorated, shunned by the more modest political leaders on learning the cost of repairs.

It was leased to private individuals for six years in the late 1890s then returned to use as an official residence for the Prime Minister until the [[Great Depression]] when a [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|new government]] in 1935 wished to avoid "show". For more than half a century generations of children came to know the building as their [[Pediatric dentistry|dental clinic]] until it was renovated and recommissioned as Premier House in 1990.

==Early history==

===Construction===
The original house was built in the early days of the New Zealand colony in 1843 for Wellington's first Mayor, [[George Hunter (mayor)|George Hunter]]. This house, or at least a portion of it, is still located at the southern end of the current building.{{cn|date=June 2018}} It has been greatly expanded over the years. Later the residence of [[Nathaniel Levin]], the house was bought from Richard Collins in early March 1865 to become the official residence of the nation's Premier.<ref name=HBH group=note>"The Government have been fortunate in securing, at a moderate figure, the beautiful house and grounds, formerly the property of N. Levin, Esq, situated in the Tenekorie Road. It has now become the official residence of the Hon. F. A. Weld. The price paid was £2,950, which, considering the quantity of the land (2½ acres), the locality, etc., must be considered cheap" [https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18650313.2.5 ''The Wellington Evening Post''] page 2, 13 March 1865</ref><ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DSC18650919.2.16 ''Daily Southern Cross''] page 5, 19 September 1865</ref> Wellington's ''The Evening Post'' thought the £2900 price "must be considered cheap". Auckland's ''Daily Southern Cross''  described it as "one of the handsomest villas in the country",<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DSC18650321.2.19 ''Daily Southern Cross''] page 5, 21 March 1865 </ref> but Auckland's local morning paper,  ''The New Zealand Herald'', noted the acquisition with the comment "a piece of illegal extravagance".<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH18650321.2.11 ''The New Zealand Herald''] page 4, 21 March 1865</ref>  A few weeks later the ''Daily Southern Cross'' described the original plan to build a new house as a "monstrous waste of public money".<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DSC18650329.2.13.1 ''Daily Southern Cross''] page 4, 29 March 1865</ref>

===Expansion===
The house changed little until [[Julius Vogel]] and his wife, Mary, arrived in 1873.<ref>Editorial, ''Evening Post'', Volume IX, Issue 78, 14 May 1873, Page 2</ref> Within a year they had turned it into an eight-bedroom mansion complete with conservatory and ballroom. The grounds featured what is thought to have been the country's first [[tennis]] court.<ref name=register>{{NZHPT|1371|Prime Minister's Residence|17 April 2011}}</ref> The Vogels were noted for their lavish entertaining, resulting in the house acquiring the nickname of  "The Casino".<ref>{{cite web|title=Premier House, 1880 |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/33202/premier-house-1880|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=6 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>

His recurring gout resulted in an extra office being added for Cabinet meetings and in 1886 the construction of New Zealand's first [[elevator|lift]].
:The country entered a Depression in the late 1880s and after the Vogels moved out, the new government tried to sell the property. MPs’ salaries had been cut, and the Liberal ministers of the 1890s had to live cheaply. But the press and public fought back. Wellington people valued its spacious grounds as a public amenity. Only the furniture was sold. Some suggested turning the site into an old men’s home or a university, but it stayed empty.

One party of particular note was the farewell party given by Miss Eileen Ward, daughter of Sir Joseph Ward, to farewell near neighbour [[Katherine Mansfield]] a few days before she left New Zealand for the last time in 1908.

===Dental clinic===
In 1935 Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]], faced with rebuilding the country's economy in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], lived in Seddon's former residence at 47 Molesworth Street, later purchasing a house high in Northland. Premier House was turned into a school for dental nurses and a children's dental clinic, known to all as "the murder house".<ref>Fran Wilde, ''Thorndon, My Brilliant Suburb'', Platform Publishing, Wellington 1985 {{ISBN|0908725000}}</ref> It had 40 chairs, later 50.<ref>260 Tinakori Road, ''Evening Post'', Volume CXXIII, Issue 130, 3 June 1937, Page 10</ref> Before fluoridation the molars of the nation's children were soon cored with amalgam.<ref>[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=9M0sAAAAIAAJ&q=fluoridation+zealand&dq=fluoridation+zealand&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjRnpLJnojOAhVEtJQKHUYgARgQ6AEIGjAA Report of the Commission of Inquiry 1957]</ref>  At the time, Mr Langstone, the Minister of Lands, was living there and a new house was built for him in the grounds on the site of the stable.<ref name=EP19370604/> During the war the garden grew vegetables for the local [[New Zealand Forces Club|Armed Forces Service Clubs]].<ref>Work Increases, ''Evening Post'', Volume CXXXV, Issue 20, 25 January 1943, Page 6</ref>

===Restoration===
[[File:Premier House, Wellington 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Premier House in 2015, the colour scheme giving some shape to the agglomeration of disparate structures]]
After many years of institutional use, by the 1980s the building had fallen into disrepair. It was rescued from this decline by [[Michael Bassett]], Minister of Internal Affairs, who initiated moves for the restoration of the building to its early grandeur.

The restoration was undertaken by Auckland's Grant Group Architects and L.T. McGuinness Construction between December 1989 and 1991. The internal walls were retained and all rooms and most passages were left in their original position. Fire sprinklers, central heating and air conditioning systems were installed along with a new hydraulic lift.<ref>{{cite web |title=Premier House Prime Minister's Residence |url=http://www.ltmcguinness.co.nz/projects/heritage/premier_house/ |publisher=LT McGuinness Ltd. |accessdate=5 May 2020}}</ref> The interior decoration carefully reproduces many 19th-century period features, while the overall design is modern. The decor includes a considerable collection of New Zealand art, both old and new.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}
 
The conservation of Premier House, as it was renamed, was a 1990 Sesquicentennial project. That year [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]] and his wife, Margaret, became its first official residents.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside Premier House in 1990 |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/inside-premier-house-1990 |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=5 May 2020}}</ref> In 2018 the house was upgraded, with repairs and maintenance undertaken, at a cost of NZ$3 million.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walls |first1=Jason |title=Upgrade costs for Premier House, official Wellington residence of PM Jacinda Ardern, triple to $3 million |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12166993 |accessdate=5 May 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=27 November 2018 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>

It was purchased for Michael Joseph Savage "because it is now not necessary (to be within easy walking distance of Parliament) and a Prime Minister is no longer bound to the lowly areas of the Thorndon flats".<ref>Local Gossip, ''New Zealand Herald'', Volume LXXVI, Issue 23339, 6 May 1939, Page 4</ref><ref>''Dominion Post'' (Wellington), 2012: 1 December pE1 & 26 December pA14</ref>
