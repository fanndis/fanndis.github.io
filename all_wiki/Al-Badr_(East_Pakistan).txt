==History==
===Organization===
Al-Badr was constituted in September 1971 under the auspices of General [[Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi]], then chief of the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistan Army eastern command]].  Members of Al-Badr were recruited from public schools and [[madrasas]] (religious schools).  The unit was used for raids and special operations;<ref name="Sisson" /> the [[Pakistan army]] command initially planned to use the locally recruited militias (Al-Badr, [[Razakars (Pakistan)|Razakar]], [[Al-Shams (Bangladesh)|Al-Shams]]) for policing cities of East Pakistan, and regular army units to defend the border with India.<ref>{{cite book |last=Siddiqi |first=A.

Despite their similarities in opposing the [[independence of Bangladesh]], the Razakar and Al-Badr had differences; [[Razakar (Pakistan)|Razakars]] opposed the [[Mukti Bahini]] in general, while Al-Badr's tactics were [[terrorism]] and [[extrajudicial killing|political killings.]]<ref name=":0" />  All three groups operated under Pakistani command.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hasina |first=Sheikh |date=1999 |chapter=Opposition Leader Sheikh Hasina’s parliamentary speech given on 16 April 1992 on the subject of Golam Azam and the public tribunal |chapter-url=http://www.bangladeshmariners.com/HmdrRprt/pm.html |title=Documents on crimes against humanity committed by Pakistan Army and their agents in Bangladesh during 1971 |publisher=Liberation War Museum |location=Dhaka |isbn=984311048X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022018/http://www.bangladeshmariners.com/HmdrRprt/pm.html |archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref>

===Dissolution===
After the [[Pakistani Instrument of Surrender|surrender]] of the [[Pakistan Army]] on 16 December 1971, Al-Badr was dissolved together with the Razakar and Al-Shams.  Many members were arrested.  During the time of president [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], all of the collaborators, including those of Al-Badr were pardoned and in 1975 any attempt to try them was repealed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Islam |first=Md Saidul |date=March 2011 |title='Minority Islam' in Muslim Majority Bangladesh |url=http://www.bdresearch.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=249:minority-islam--in-muslim-majority-bangladesh-the-violent-road-to-a-new-brand-of-secularism&catid=101:political-issues&Itemid=125 |journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=130 |doi=10.1080/13602004.2011.556893 |issn=1360-2004 |accessdate=22 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623192814/http://www.bdresearch.org/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=249:minority-islam--in-muslim-majority-bangladesh-the-violent-road-to-a-new-brand-of-secularism&catid=101:political-issues&Itemid=125 |archive-date=23 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==War crimes==
Al-Badr perpetrated atrocities against civilians during the war of 1971, in particular, the [[1971 killing of Bengali intellectuals|massacre of intellectuals]] in [[Dhaka]] that occurred on 14 December 1971.<ref>P.

According to journalist Azadur Rahman Chandan, Al-Badr was experimentally launched in [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]], [[Mymensingh]] on April 1971 as a voluntary force with [[Islami Chhatra Shangha]] activists as its first recruits to wage war against the nationalist fighters. They were enlisted and trained under the guidance of [[Mohammad Kamaruzzaman]], the assistant secretary general of Jamaat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chandan |first=Azadur Rahman |date=February 2011 |origyear=2009 |script-title=bn:একাত্তরের ঘাতক ও দালালরা |trans-title=The Killers and Collaborators of 71 |language=bn |edition=Revised 2nd |publisher=Jatiya Sahitya Prakash |location=Dhaka <!-- Invalid ISBN; listed on publisher's web site, but still not valid. 13-digit ISBNs start with 978 or 979. |isbn=984-70000-0121-4 -->|pages=48–54}}</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=July 2016}}
