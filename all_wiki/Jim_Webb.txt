On July 2, 2015, he announced that [[Jim Webb presidential campaign, 2016|he would be joining the race for the Democratic nomination for president]], but stepped down from running in the primaries on October 20, 2015, stating that he was "not comfortable" with many political positions from the party's leadership.<ref name=PrimaryWithdrawal>{{cite web|title=A Statement from Jim Webb|last1=Webb|first1=Jim Jr.|date=2015-10-20|url=https://www.webb2016.com/news/a-statement-from-jim-webb/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027230545/https://www.webb2016.com/news/a-statement-from-jim-webb/|archive-date=2015-10-27|access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Webb was born in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], to James Henry Webb Sr., and his wife, Vera Lorraine (Hodges).<ref name=WARGS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/webb.html|title=The Ancestors of James Webb|last=Reitwiesner|first=William Addams|publisher=WARGS}}</ref> The second of four children and the older son, he grew up in a military family, moving frequently as his father's career in the [[United States Air Force]] required. The family crisscrossed the country, living in Missouri, Illinois, Texas, Alabama, Nebraska, California, and Virginia, as well as in England, where his father was an exchange officer with the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Webb |title=I Heard My Country Calling: A Memoir |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2014 |page=59 |isbn=978-1476741123}}</ref> His father flew [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]] and [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] during World War II, and flew Air Force cargo aircraft during the 1948-49 [[Berlin airlift]]. After developing an inner ear disorder, [[Meniere's Disease]], he became a pioneer in the Air Force missile program, later serving as the commanding officer of the 1001st Missile Squadron at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. Webb's parents are buried at the [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Webb is descended from [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] immigrants from [[Ulster]] who [[Immigration to the United States|emigrated]] in the mid-18th century to the British [[Thirteen Colonies|North American colonies]]. Webb's 2004 book ''Born Fighting: How the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] Shaped America'' details his family history, noting that his ancestors fought in every major American war. A 2014 [[Television documentary|TV documentary]] on the [[Smithsonian Channel]], also entitled ''Born Fighting'', was adapted from Webb's book and is narrated by him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/series/799/born-fighting|title=Born Fighting|work=Smithsonian Channel|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|access-date=December 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230043321/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/series/799/born-fighting|archive-date=December 30, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Webb attended more than a dozen schools across the U.S. and in England.

==Military service==
After graduating from the Naval Academy, Webb was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the U.S. Marine Corps. Attending the [[The Basic School|Marine Corps Officer Basic School]] shortly after leaving Annapolis, he graduated first in his class. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in the second half of his tour in Vietnam. He served as a [[Platoon#United States organization|platoon commander]] with [[Delta Company]], [[1st Battalion 5th Marines]]. He was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for heroism in Vietnam, the second-highest decoration in the Navy and Marine Corps. Webb also was awarded the [[Silver Star]], two [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Stars]], and two [[Purple Heart]]s.<ref name="Antle">{{cite magazine | last = Antle | first = W.

He was then assigned to the Secretary of the Navy's office for the remainder of his active duty. His war wounds left him with shrapnel in his knee, kidney, and head. The injury to his knee led to a medical board that decided on medical retirement.

Webb received the Navy Cross for actions on July 10, 1969. The citation read:

{{quote|The Navy Cross is presented to James H. Webb, Jr., First Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism while serving as a Platoon Commander with Company D, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]. On July 10, 1969, while participating in a company-sized [[search and destroy]] operation deep in hostile territory, First Lieutenant Webb's platoon discovered a well-camouflaged bunker complex that appeared to be unoccupied. Deploying his men into defensive positions, First Lieutenant Webb was advancing to the first bunker when three enemy soldiers armed with hand grenades jumped out. Reacting instantly, he grabbed the closest man and, brandishing his [[M1911 pistol|.45 caliber pistol]] at the others, apprehended all three of the soldiers. Accompanied by one of his men, he then approached the second bunker and called for the enemy to surrender. When the hostile soldiers failed to answer him and threw a grenade that detonated dangerously close to him, First Lieutenant Webb detonated a [[M18 Claymore mine|claymore mine]] in the bunker aperture, accounting for two enemy casualties and disclosing the entrance to a tunnel. Despite the smoke and debris from the explosion and the possibility of enemy soldiers hiding in the tunnel, he then conducted a thorough search that yielded several items of equipment and numerous documents containing valuable [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] data. Continuing the assault, he approached a third bunker and was preparing to fire into it when the enemy threw another grenade. Observing the grenade land dangerously close to his companion, First Lieutenant Webb simultaneously fired his weapon at the enemy, pushed the Marine away from the grenade, and shielded him from the explosion with his own body. Although sustaining painful fragmentation wounds from the explosion, he managed to throw a grenade into the aperture and completely destroy the remaining bunker. By his courage, aggressive leadership, and selfless devotion to duty, First Lieutenant Webb upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.<ref name=HomeofHeroes>{{Cite web|url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/07_RVN-nc/nc_19rvn_usmcS.html|title=S–Z|work=Full Text Citations For Award of The Navy Cross: US Marine Corps Awards - Vietnam|publisher=HomeofHeroes.com|accessdate=2006-03-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829180040/http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/07_RVN-nc/nc_19rvn_usmcS.html|archivedate=2006-08-29}}</ref>}}

In the October 13, 2015, CNN Democratic Debate, when asked, "Which enemy are you most proud of?", Webb stated, "I'd have to say, the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5IlFlVhBFL8|title=YouTube|website=m.youtube.com}}</ref>

In a November 19, 2006 appearance on ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Webb told host [[Tim Russert]], "I'm one of these people who – there aren't many of us – who can still justify for you the reasons that we went into [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], however screwed up the strategy got."<ref name="MTP20061119">{{Cite news|accessdate=2007-01-04|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15751399|title=MTP Transcript for November 19: Jim Webb, Jon Tester, Ted Koppel, Robin Wright|work=Meet the Press|publisher=NBC News|date=November 19, 2006}}</ref>

==Post-military career==
[[File:James Webb, Assistant Secretary of Defense, official photo.JPEG|thumb|right|James Webb as Assistant Secretary of Defense, 1984.]]
Webb attended [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law Center]] from 1972 to 1975, graduating with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. While at Georgetown, he wrote his first book, ''Micronesia and U.S. Pacific Strategy''.<ref name="Webb1974">{{Cite book |title=Micronesia and U.S. Pacific Strategy: A Blueprint for the 1980s |last=Webb |first=James H. |isbn=0-275-08940-1 |publisher=Praeger Publishers Inc. |location=New York |year=1974 |url=https://archive.org/details/micronesiauspaci00webb }}</ref>

From 1977 to 1981, Webb worked on the staff of the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House]] Committee on Veterans Affairs. During this time, he also represented veterans [[pro-bono]]. Webb taught at the Naval Academy and was criticized for a 1979 article published in ''Washingtonian'' magazine, titled "Women Can't Fight"<ref name="Webb1979">{{cite magazine |last=Webb|first=James|date=November 1979|title=Women Can't Fight|magazine=Washingtonian| publisher=Washingtonian Magazine, Inc.|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/mediapolitics/2182.html|accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref> (see "2006 Senate campaign" below). He attended the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] in Detroit and led the Pledge of Allegiance in the opening session.<ref>[http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/GOP-CONVENTION-DAY-1-SESSION-2-REPUBLICAN-NATIONAL/6b7ae88d1cad4c3f92478bdb3d98e356?query=CELEBRITY+NEWS&current=17&orderBy=Relevance&hits=338&referrer=search&search=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DCELEBRITY%2520NEWS%26allFilters%3DABC%3ASource%2CPOLITICS%3AKeyword%2CUNIVERSITIES%3AKeyword%2CUNIVERSITY%2520OF%2520MICHIGAN%3AKeyword&allFilters=ABC%3ASource%2CPOLITICS%3AKeyword%2CUNIVERSITIES%3AKeyword%2CUNIVERSITY+OF+MICHIGAN%3AKeyword&productType=IncludedProducts&page=1&b=98e356 1980 Republican Convention Summary, Day 1 Session 2]</ref>

During the [[Reagan Administration]], Webb served as the nation's first Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs from 1984-87. In 1987, he served as [[Secretary of the Navy]], becoming the first [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]] graduate to serve as the civilian head of the Navy. As Navy Secretary, Webb pushed the appointment of [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]] as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], hoping that Gray could reshape the Corps into the elite unit it once was.<ref name="Ricks1997">{{Cite book|last=Ricks|first=Thomas E.|title=Making the Corps|isbn=0-684-83109-0|year=1997|location=New York|publisher=Scribner|url=https://archive.org/details/makingcorps00rick_1}}</ref> Webb resigned in 1988 after refusing to agree to reduce the size of the Navy. Webb had wished to increase the Navy to [[600-ship Navy|600 ships]]. As revealed in ''[[The Reagan Diaries]]'', President [[Ronald Reagan]] wrote on February 22, 1988: "I don't think Navy was sorry to see him go."<ref name="Reagan">{{Cite book|title=The Reagan Diaries|last=Reagan|first=Ronald|isbn=978-0-06-087600-5|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2007|page=[https://archive.org/details/reagandiaries00reag/page/580 580]|url=https://archive.org/details/reagandiaries00reag/page/580}}</ref>

In a 1990 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' opinion piece, Webb opposed further U.S. military escalation in [[Saudi Arabia]] during [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]] citing lack of a coherent strategy and consent from the United States Congress. He also warned against a permanent military presence in the Middle East.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/23/opinion/in-the-gulf-the-danger-of-a-diplomatic-solution-and-the-horrors-of-a-desert-war.html|title=In the Gulf, the Danger of a Diplomatic Solution ...

{{quote|questioned whether an overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]] would "actually increase our ability to win the war against international terrorism" and pointed out that the measure of military success can be preventing wars as well as fighting them. He charged, "those who are pushing for a unilateral war in Iraq know full well that there is no exit strategy if we invade." He concluded, "the Iraqis are a multiethnic people filled with competing factions who in many cases would view a U.S. occupation as infidels invading the cradle of Islam.... In Japan, American occupation forces quickly became 50,000 friends. In Iraq, they would quickly become 50,000 terrorist targets."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Scott|last=McConnell|author-link=Scott McConnell|date=December 4, 2006|url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2006/dec/04/00006|title=Go Webb Go|magazine=[[The American Conservative]]}}</ref>}}

[[File:Jwebb.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of Webb]]
During the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential campaign]], Webb wrote an [[op-ed]] piece for ''[[USA Today]]'' in which he, as a military veteran, evaluated the candidacies of [[John Kerry]] and [[George W. Bush]]. He criticized Kerry for the nature of his opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1970s while affiliated with the [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]], and accused Bush of using his father's connections to avoid service in Vietnam. Webb wrote that Bush had "committed the greatest strategic [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] in modern memory" with the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref name="Webb2004usat">{{Cite news|last=Webb|first=James|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2004-02-18-veterans-edit_x.htm|title=Veterans face conundrum: Kerry or Bush?|work=USA Today|date=2004-02-18|accessdate=2006-10-29}}</ref>

Webb supported [[Nebraska]] Senator [[Bob Kerrey]]'s campaign for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992|1992 Democratic presidential nomination]].<ref name="Antle" /> In 1994, he endorsed incumbent Democrat [[Charles Robb]] for reelection to his Senate seat, over Webb's former Naval Academy classmate [[Oliver North]]; like Webb, both Robb and North were decorated Marine veterans of the Vietnam war.<ref>{{cite news|title=Six Veterans Bash North, Push Robb for Senate|first=Kent Jr.|last=Jenkins |newspaper=The Washington Post|location=Washington, D.C.|date=October 8, 1994|page = B.01}}</ref> Webb subsequently endorsed Republican [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] over Robb in 2000,<ref>{{cite news|title=Can the Democrats Handle a Heretic?|first=Joe|last=Klein|magazine=Time|location=New York|date=June 12, 2006|volume=167|issue=24|page=25}}</ref> and then ran against Allen himself in 2006.

In late 2005, a campaign to [[Draft (politics)|draft]] Webb to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 2006 began on the internet, promoted by [[netroots]] activists such as those at the blog [[Raising Kaine]]. On February 7, 2006, he announced that he would seek the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for the 2006 Senate race against incumbent [[Virginia]] Senator [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]].<ref name="Shear20060208">{{Cite news|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/07/AR2006020701852.html |title=Reagan Navy Secretary Will Run for U.S. Senate |work=The Washington Post |date=2006-02-08|accessdate=2006-10-29 |page=B05}}</ref>

In the Democratic primary on June 13, 2006, Webb faced longtime businessman and lobbyist [[Harris Miller]]. Webb won with 53.5% of the vote, in a race with low turnout.<ref name="PrimaryResults">{{Cite web|url=http://sbe.virginiainteractive.org/june2006/d_025.htm|title=Official Results: Primary Election, June 13, 2006|publisher=Commonwealth of Virginia|accessdate=2006-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620015747/http://sbe.virginiainteractive.org/june2006/d_025.htm|archive-date=June 20, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On August 11, 2006, an incident occurred in which Allen used the word ''[[Macaca (slur)|macaca]]'' to refer to Webb campaign associate [[S.R. Sidarth]], who was filming an event as a "tracker" for the Webb campaign. A poll the following week showed Webb gaining 10 percentage points. The race, which at one point looked like a sure win for Allen, became one of the most watched and closest races of the 2006 elections. Webb's entry into the race and primary victory changed the political landscape. Political analyst [[Larry Sabato]] said in May that "Jim Webb is George Allen's worst nightmare: a war hero and a Reagan appointee who holds moderate positions.... Allen tries to project a Reagan aura, but Webb already has it."<ref name="Donnelly2006">{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1191863,00.html|date=May 15, 2006|work=Time|title=Betting on a Novice in Virginia|last=Donnelly|first=Sally B.}}</ref>

On September 7, 2006, Webb released his first television advertisement, which included footage of a 1985 speech by [[Ronald Reagan]] that praised Webb's service as a Marine.<ref name="Shear20060908">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701596.html|title=Television Ad Shows Reagan Praising Webb In 1985 Speech|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=September 8, 2006|page=B8|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> The next day, the Chief of Staff for the [[Reagan Library]] wrote Webb's campaign on behalf of former first lady [[Nancy Reagan]], urging them not to air the advertisement saying it was neither fair nor respectful because it gave the impression of an endorsement.<ref name="reagan">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/08/AR2006090801720.html|title=Nancy Reagan Asks Webb to Pull Ad With Her Husband|accessdate=2008-05-22|work=The Washington Post|date=September 9, 2006|last1=Shear|first1=Michael D.|first2=Tim|last2=Craig|page=B01}}</ref><ref name="wp0914">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/14/AR2006091401583.html|title=Editorial: Let Reagan Be Reagan|work=The Washington Post|date=September 15, 2006|page=A18}}</ref> The Webb campaign disagreed, saying, "What Reagan said about Jim Webb, that belongs to Jim Webb, frankly."<ref name="reagan" /> The library said they ask all candidates to refrain from using the former president's image but declined to say if they would request the Allen campaign to remove the image of Reagan used on his campaign website.<ref name="reagan" />

Five female graduates of the [[United States Naval Academy]] held a press conference, decrying Webb's 1979 article, "Women Can't Fight." The women said Webb's article contributed to an atmosphere of hostility and harassment [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2006#Webb|towards women at the academy]]. Webb was later endorsed by nine military women who stated that Webb is a "man of integrity" who "recognizes the crucial role that women have in the military today."<ref name="wt1018">{{Cite news |url=http://www.washtimes.com/metro/20061017-114853-2578r.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102021546/http://www.washtimes.com/metro/20061017-114853-2578r.htm|archivedate=November 2, 2006|title=Military women support Webb as 'man of integrity'|last=McLaughlin|first=Seth|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=October 18, 2006}}</ref>

In October 2006, the Allen campaign issued a press release quoting several passages from Webb's novels with sexual content, including graphic references to female anatomy and purported pedophilia, homosexuality and incest, citing a passage in which a Southeast Asian father ritually places the penis of his young son in his mouth. The press release said that the passages showed a "continued pattern of demeaning women".<ref name="Drudge">{{Cite web|accessdate=2006-10-27 |url=http://www.drudgereport.com/flashaw.htm |archivedate=October 31, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031204746/http://www.drudgereport.com/flashaw.htm |title=Allen's revenge: Exposes Underage Sex Scenes in Opponent's Novels |work=[[Drudge Report]] |url-status=dead }}</ref> Allen's campaign refused to tell a local radio news station, [[WTOP-FM]], whether it in fact had issued a news release on the matter.

On November 9, 2006, after AP and [[Reuters]] projected that Webb had won the seat, Allen conceded the election.

===Senator-elect===
On November 15, 2006, Senate majority-leader-in-waiting [[Harry Reid]] assigned Webb to three committees: the committees on [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]], [[United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs]], and [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]].<ref name="Maze2006">{{Cite news|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-2358029.php|last=Maze|first=Rick|date=November 15, 2006|title=Webb to serve on key Iraq-related Senate panels|work=Air Force Times}}</ref>

"That same day, an op-ed authored by Webb appeared in the pages of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Titled 'Class Struggle: American workers have a chance to be heard'. The piece addressed the harmful economic inequality in the U.S., with the elites on one side and American workers on the other side. The article cites the "age of globalization and outsourcing, and with a vast underground labor pool from illegal immigration", as well as extravagant executive compensation, the detrimental effects of free trade and globalization, iniquitous tax cuts, speedily rising health care costs, and stagnation in income as the reasons for the increasing disparity between the elites and American workers.<ref name="Webb2006ojwsj">{{Cite news|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009246|title=Class Struggle: American workers have a chance to be heard|last=Webb|first=Jim|date=November 15, 2006|work= The Wall Street Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106023536/http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009246|archivedate=January 6, 2010}}</ref>

====Exchange with President Bush====
On November 28, 2006, at a White House reception for those newly elected to Congress, Webb did not choose to wait in the line to have his picture taken with the president,<ref>Webb, in an interview on [[The Brian Lehrer Show]], WNYC, May 21, 2014</ref> whom Webb often criticized during the campaign. The president approached Webb later and asked him, "How's your boy?", referring to Webb's son, a Marine serving in Iraq. Webb replied "I'd like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President." Bush responded, "That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?", Webb responded, "That's between me and my boy, Mr. President." ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' cited an anonymous source who claimed that Webb was so angered by the exchange that he confessed he was tempted to "slug" the president.<ref name="Heil2006">{{Cite news|url=http://hill6.thehill.com/under-the-dome/son-also-rises-in-testy-webb-bush-exchange-2006-11-29.html|title=Son also rises in testy Webb-Bush exchange|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|first=Emily|last=Heil|date=November 29, 2006|accessdate=2006-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218102937/http://hill6.thehill.com/under-the-dome/son-also-rises-in-testy-webb-bush-exchange-2006-11-29.html|archive-date=December 18, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Webb later remarked in an interview, "I'm not particularly interested in having a picture of me and George W.

Webb was asked about the exchange in a January 4, 2007 appearance on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]''. He told [[Chris Matthews|Matthews]]:

{{quote|My feeling about that – first of all, it's been kind of a bit overblown. But I think when people are now seeing how [[John McCain]] is handling the situation with his son being in the [[USMC|Marine Corps]], perhaps they can understand a little bit more what I was having to go through during the entire campaign. I greatly respect my son's service and all of the people who are serving. At the same time, I have not commented, even to many of my friends, about the operational side. That's personal to me in terms of my feelings about it. And it was not a casual comment. As I said in the piece that you just ran, I think the best article that was written on that was by Peggy Noonan in ''The Wall Street Journal'' when she basically said that the lack of civility was not mine and I feel that way.<ref name=Matthews20070104>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16485135|series=Hardball with Chris Matthews|title='Hardball with Chris Matthews' for January 4 – Guests: Jim Webb, Hilary Rosen, Susan Molinari, Trent Lott, Chaka Fattah, A.B.

===Tenure as Senator===
[[File:Jim Webb, leaning against pillar, 2007.jpg|thumb|Jim Webb in 2007]]
[[File:US Navy 071013-N-6512M-021 Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, a former Secretary of the Navy, delivers remarks during the Navy Day celebration held at the U.S. Navy Memorial.jpg|thumb|Senator and former Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb delivers remarks during the [[Navy Day]] celebration held at the [[U.S. Navy Memorial]]]]
On January 4, 2007, Webb was sworn into the [[110th United States Congress|110th U.S. Senate]], accompanied by Sen. [[John Warner]], R-Va., a fellow former [[Secretary of the Navy]]; and former Virginia Democratic Sen. [[Chuck Robb]], who held the same seat before losing to Allen.
On his first day in the Senate, Webb introduced the [[Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008|Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act]], to expand benefits for military families, which he had written. The act replaces key provisions of the Montgomery [[G.I. Bill]] for recent veterans and "makes veterans benefits identical to those soldiers received following World War II". "With many of our military members serving two or three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is past time to enact a new veterans' education program modeled on the World War II era G.I. bill. This is exactly what our legislation does", Webb said. It became law on June 30, 2008, as part of the [[Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.2642 - Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/2642|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref>

In a January 4, 2007, appearance on ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]'', Webb articulated his position on the [[Iraq War]]:

<blockquote>What we really need to do is to get into the arena where we can talk about a strategy, talk about the pluses and the minuses of the [[Iraq Study Group|Baker-Hamilton Commission]] and work toward a solution that, on the one hand, will allow us to remove our combat troops, but on the other, will increase the stability of the region, allow us to continue to fight against international terrorism and allow us, as a nation, to address our strategic interests around the world. And this is – this is one of the drawbacks that we've had with so many troops having been put into this constant rotational basis inside one country when we have a war against international terrorism that's global.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}</blockquote>

Asked by [[Wolf Blitzer]] if he would ever support the efforts of [[Dennis Kucinich]] to cut funding for the war, Webb said,

<blockquote>I – you know, I lived through Vietnam. I lived through it as a Marine and I know that those sorts of approaches, while they seem attractive on one level are really not that realistic. What we want to do – and I was talking with a number of senators today – is to try to get some of these so-called emergency legislation packages back into the committee process so that the committees can actually play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/04/sitroom.04.html |series= THE SITUATION ROOM|title=Momentous day On Capitol Hill; Some Things May Get Lost In Shuffle Next Week On Capitol Hill; Jim Webb Interview; House Administration Committee Investigating Contested Florida House Race|publisher=CNN|date=January 4, 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

On March 5, 2007, Webb introduced his second piece of legislation, {{USBill|110|S|759}}, intended to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in [[Iran]] without the prior approval of Congress. In a statement on the floor of the Senate, Webb said, "The major function of this legislation is to prevent this Administration from commencing unprovoked military activities against Iran without the approval of the Congress. The legislation accomplishes this goal through the proper constitutional process of prohibiting all funding for such an endeavor."<ref name="WebbPressRelease">{{Cite press release|publisher=Senator Jim Webb|url=http://www.webb.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=270138|title=Senator Jim Webb Introduces Bill Prohibiting Use of Funds for Military Operations in Iran|date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2007-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425203636/http://webb.senate.gov/newsroom//record.cfm?id=270138|archive-date=April 25, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On March 26, 2007, a senatorial aide of Webb, Phillip Thompson, was arrested for carrying Webb's loaded pistol as he entered the Russell Senate Office Building and for carrying unregistered ammunition.

On August 14, 2009, Webb visited [[Myanmar]] (Burma), seeing its junta's leader, Gen. [[Than Shwe]], and also the pro-democracy leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who was under house arrest. During Webb's visit with Than Shwe, Webb negotiated the release and deportation of an imprisoned American, [[John Yettaw]].<ref name="ap15aug">{{Cite news|title=Senator wins release of US prisoner in Myanmar|agency=Associated Press|date=August 15, 2009|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hzXtyPYr-eVVrsJcBLfO_b_Nl3jQD9A3CL8G0}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Seth Mydans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/world/asia/17myanmar.html |title=American Held in Myanmar Is Released |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 16, 2009 |page=A4}}</ref> Upon his return to the U.S., Webb wrote an editorial titled "We Can't Afford to Ignore Myanmar" for ''[[The New York Times]]'', arguing for the easing of sanctions on the country.

Webb visited [[Vietnam]] as part of a two-week trip to five Southeast Asian countries. Webb, who can speak Vietnamese, has had a continuous involvement in Asian and Pacific affairs that long predates his time in the Senate. In addition to his more recent visits as a member of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], Webb has worked and traveled throughout this vast region, from [[Micronesia]] to Burma, for nearly four decades, as a Marine Corps officer, a defense planner, a journalist, a novelist, a Department of Defense executive, and as a business consultant.

====Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2009====
On March 26, 2009, Webb filed the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.714: Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2009] (SB 714), which would create a blue ribbon commission to reevaluate the criminal justice system and drug policy and make recommendations for reform.<ref>{{cite news | last = Smith | first=Jordan|date=March 27, 2009|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2009-03-27/759715|title=Time to Fix Criminal Justice System: Sen.

He also criticized the lack of standards in prison administration and highlighted the justice system's negative impact on communities. The subcommittee chairman, Sen. [[Arlen Specter]] (D-PA), expressed support for the bill at the hearing and indicated his intent to move the bill to the full [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]].<ref>{{YouTube|TSjrcFn_SBI|Highlights of Judiciary Subcommittee Hearing on Sen.

In the fall of 2009, an amendment to SB 714 was proposed by Sen.
