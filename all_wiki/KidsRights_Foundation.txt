"KidsRights seeks to give a voice to the utterly voiceless," the organisation quotes [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Desmond Tutu]] as saying.

The organisation's mission is to support and empower vulnerable children around the world, by raising funds for small-scale local projects, and by raising awareness for childrenâ€™s rights through the international media.

The foundation has instituted an annual award, the [[International Children's Peace Prize]], to honour a child who has made a significant contribution to advocating children's rights and improving the situation of vulnerable children. The first Children's Peace Prize was presented in 2005 by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the Nobel for Peace Summit in [[Rome]], an annual meeting of Nobel Peace Prize winners. The $10,000 prize was posthumously awarded to [[Nkosi Johnson]], a [[South Africa]]n boy who brought attention to children with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and set up the [[Nkosi's Haven]] orphanage.

Charitable events to raise funds for KidsRights have been nationally televised in the [[Netherlands]] and have featured performances from well-known artists like [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Ronan Keating]], [[Ilse DeLange|Ilse de Lange]] and the [[Sugababes]]. Corporate sponsors include [[ABN-AMRO]], [[Akzonobel]] and [[Wilde Ganzen]].

KidsRights Foundation is not related to KIDSRIGHTS, an [[Indianapolis]]-based publisher and distributor of materials on child abuse prevention and treatment.
