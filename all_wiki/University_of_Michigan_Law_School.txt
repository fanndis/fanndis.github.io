==History==
[[File:Law Building, U. of M., Ann Arbor, Mich. (NBY 7895).jpg|thumb|University of Michigan Law Building, circa 1910s]]

The Law School was founded in 1859, and quickly rose to national prominence. By 1870, Michigan was the largest law school in the country.

In 1870, Gabriel Franklin Hargo graduated from Michigan as the second African-American to graduate from law school in the United States. In 1871 [[Sarah Killgore]], a Michigan Law graduate, became the first woman to both graduate from law school and be admitted to the [[Admission to the bar|bar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/historyandtraditions/students/Documents/Sarah_Killgore_Bio.pdf|title=Michigan's First Woman Lawyer|publisher=University of Michigan Law School|access-date=2013-09-14}}</ref>

Although the law school is part of the public [[University of Michigan]], less than 2 percent of the law school's expenses are covered by state funds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.law.umich.edu/ALUMNIANDFRIENDS/GIVING/THIRDYEARCHALLENGE/Pages/FAQ.aspx | title=Nannes Third-Year Challenge: Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=University of Michigan Law School | access-date=2013-09-26}}</ref>  The remainder (97–98% of Michigan Law's budget) is supplied by private gifts, tuition, and endowments.

In 2009, Michigan Law began a $102 million enterprise to construct a new law building that would remain loyal to the [[English Gothic]] style. The enterprise was fully funded by endowments and private gifts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/buildingproject/Pages/home.aspx|title=A New Legal Landscape | publisher=University of Michigan Law School|access-date=2013-09-14}}</ref> 2009 also marked the school's sesquicentennial celebration.  As a part of the festivities, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] visited the school and participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the new building.  The building was dedicated in 2012 and called South Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/dedicationweekend/Pages/default.aspx|title=South Hall Dedication|publisher=University of Michigan Law School|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref>  In December 2018, South Hall was renamed Jeffries Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://record.umich.edu/articles/jeffries-33m-gift-dedicated-student-support-law-school|title=Jeffries’ $33M gift dedicated to student support at Law School|publisher=University of Michigan Record|access-date=2019-08-16}}</ref>

Built between 1924 and 1933 by the architectural firm [[York and Sawyer]] with funds donated by attorney and alumnus [[William W. Cook]], the Cook Law Quadrangle comprises four buildings:

*Hutchins Hall, the main academic building, named for former Dean of the Law School and President of the University, [[Harry Burns Hutchins]]
*The Legal Research Building. In 2007, the University of Michigan Reading Room was named 94th on a list of "American's Favorite Buildings."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.favoritearchitecture.org/ |title=America's Favorite Architecture |publisher=Favoritearchitecture.org |access-date=2013-09-09}}</ref> The building is one of only three law buildings on the list.
*John Cook Dormitory
*The Lawyer's Club, providing additional dormitory rooms and a meeting space for the residents of the Quad; highlighted by a Great Lounge, and a [[dining room]] with a high-vaulted ceiling, an [[oak]] floor, and dark oak [[paneling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/HISTORYANDTRADITIONS/BUILDINGS/Pages/default.aspx |title=Michigan Law School – History and Traditions |publisher=Law.umich.edu |access-date=2013-09-09}}</ref>
In 2012, extensive renovations of the Lawyers Club were undertaken thanks in part to a $20 million gift from Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charles T. Munger, and was re-opened on August 19, 2013 for the Fall 2013 school year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/multimedia/Documents/lawyersclubreopening2013.html|title=University of Michigan Law School-Image Gallery|website=Law.umich.edu|access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref>

==Student Funded Fellowships==
Student Funded Fellowships (SFF) is a program designed to fund Michigan Law students who accept public interest summer jobs with low pay and to help 1Ls finance the living costs associated with their summer jobs. SFF is governed by a board of law students and operates independently of the Law School. The Board elects its own officers, including two co-chairs, a treasurer, and various committee chairs. Board members head fundraising efforts throughout the year, ranging from Donate a Day's Pay (DADP), in which highly paid law firm summer associates donate a day's salary to SFF, to a grand auction in March that invites bids on various donated items, including sports tickets, meals and activities with faculty members, and art. In the late spring, Board members review applications for summer funding and select a limited number of qualified students for grants. Beginning with the summer of 2016, SFF began offering every 1L an interest-free $4000 loan for their summer expenses that is repaid on a sliding scale depending on how much money they make during their 1L and 2L summers.

==Employment and cost of attendance==

Assuming no tuition increases, a typical three-year course of study at Michigan therefore costs $208,284 (or $69,428 per year) for residents and $217,434 (or $72,428 per year) for non-residents.<ref>[http://www.law.umich.edu/financialaid/Pages/tuitionrates.aspx "Law School Tuition Rates 2014-2015"] Accessed July 16, 2014.</ref>
