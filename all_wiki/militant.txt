'''Militant''' means vigorously [[Active lifestyle|active]], [[combative]] and/or [[aggression|aggressive]], especially in support of a cause, as in "militant reformers".<ref name="DictionaryReference.com"/><ref name="Merriam-Webster">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/militant |title=Merriam-Webster |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> It comes from the 15th century [[Latin]] "''militare''" meaning "to serve as a soldier". The related modern concept of the [[militia]] as a defensive organization against invaders grew out of the Anglo-Saxon [[fyrd]]. In times of crisis, the [[militiaman]] left his civilian duties and became a soldier until the emergency was over, when he returned to his civilian occupation.

The current meaning of ''militant'' does not usually refer to a registered soldier: it can be anyone who subscribes to the idea of using vigorous, sometimes extreme, activity to achieve an objective, usually political. A "militant [political] activist" would be expected to be more confrontational and aggressive than an activist not described as militant.

Militance may or may not include physical violence, armed [[combat]], terrorism, and the like. The [[Trotskyist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group in the United Kingdom published a newspaper, was active in labour disputes, moved resolutions in political meetings, but was not based on violence. The purpose of the Christian [[Church Militant]] is to struggle against sin, the [[devil]] and ". . . the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places" (Ephesians 6:12), but it is not a violent movement.

==As adjective==
Militant can mean "vigorously [[Active lifestyle|active]] and [[aggression|aggressive]], especially in support of a cause" as in 'militant reformers'.<ref name="DictionaryReference.com">{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/militant |title=Dictionary Reference.com |publisher=Dictionary Reference.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]], defines ''militant'' as "Having a combative character; aggressive, especially in the service of a cause". The [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] defines ''militant'' as "aggressively active (as in a cause)".<ref name="Merriam-Webster"/> It says that the word ''militant'' might  typically be used in phrases such as 'militant conservationists' or 'a militant attitude'.<ref name="Merriam-Webster"/>

An example of the adjective usages is demonstrated when ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article titled ''Militant Environmentalists Planning Summer Protests to Save Redwoods'' describing a group that believes in "confrontational demonstrations" and "nonviolent tactics" to get across their message of preserving the environment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/19/us/militant-environmentalists-planning-summer-protests-to-save-redwoods.html?pagewanted=all |title=The New York Times |date=19 June 1990 |accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times |last1=Bishop |first1=Katherine |last2=Times |first2=Special To the New York }}</ref> Another usage example includes 'a militant political activist',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ask.com/web?q=dictionary%3A+militant&content=ahdict%7C62622&o=0&l=dir |title=American Heritage Dictionary |publisher=Ask.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> drawing attention to behaviours typical of those engaged in intensive political activism. The political protests headed by the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] have been described as militant in nature in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-1118403.html ''[[The Washington Post]]'', by Howard Kurtz, 30 March 1990.]</ref>

The word "militant" is sometimes used to describe groups that do not name or describe themselves as militants, but that advocate [[extreme violence]]. In the early 21st Century, members of groups involved in [[Islamic terrorism]] such as [[Al-Qaeda]]  and [[ISIS]] are usually described as militants.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13801385 BBC: Nigeria blast blamed on Islamic militant group Boko Haram.] Example of use of "militant" to describe a group suspected of carrying out a [[suicide bombing]](Boko Haram)</ref>

==As noun==
A ''militant'', as a noun, is a person who uses militant methods in pursuit of an objective;<ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/militant_7#militant_11 Macmillan dictionary definition of militant as noun]</ref> the term is not associated with the military. In general usage, a ''militant'' person is a ''confrontational'' person who does not necessarily use violence. ''Militant'' can refer to individuals or groups displaying aggressive behavior or attitudes.

''Militant'' is sometimes used as a [[euphemism]] for ''terrorist'' or ''armed insurgent''.<ref name="SandersDecoding" /> (For more on this, see [[#Mass media usage|mass media usage]] below.)

''Militant'' is often used within some religious circles to denote the continuous battle of Christians (as church members) or the [[Christian Church]] in their struggle against sin. In particular, the Roman Catholic Church differentiates between [[Church militant and church triumphant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/THEOLOGY/SPIRCATH.HTM#07 |title=Catholic View of Church Militant – Theology |publisher=Ewtn.com |date=12 January 1935 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/faith/Teachings/chura1.htm |title=Catholic View of Church Militant – Teachings |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> [[Ellen G. White]], one of the founders of the [[Seventh-day Adventist church]], says "Now the church is militant. Now we are confronted with a world in darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteestate.org/books/mh/mh43.html |title=The Ministry of Healing, page 504 |publisher=Whiteestate.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>

Such religious meaning must not be confused with the word '[[belligerent]]' used to describe extremist religious behaviours found in some who, based on their extreme religious beliefs or ideologies, take up weapons and become involved in warfare, or who commit acts of violence or terrorism in an attempt to advance their extremist religious agendas. Such extremist groups can be Christian,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/b/2004/01/12/thanks-be-to-god-and-christian-terrorists.htm |title=Terrorism by Christians |publisher=Atheism.about.com |accessdate=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302213735/http://atheism.about.com/b/2004/01/12/thanks-be-to-god-and-christian-terrorists.htm |archive-date=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/eland/?articleid=14244 |title=Third Article on Terrorism by Christians |publisher=Antiwar.com |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> Muslims,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muhammadanism.org/Terrorism/Terrorist_Mind.htm |title=Terrorism by Muslim |publisher=Muhammadanism.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sean O’Neill, Zahid Hussain and Michael Evans |url=http://sheikyermami.com/2009/04/14/uk-prosecuting-islamic-terrorists-will-only-create-more-islamic-terrorists/ |title=More terrorism by Muslims |publisher=Sheikyermami.com |date=12 April 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. Mark Gabriel |url=http://www.internationalwallofprayer.org/A-052-Why-Islamic-Terrorists-Do-What-They-Do-Dr-Mark-Gabriel.html |title=Third Article on Terrorism by Muslims |publisher=Internationalwallofprayer.org |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> Jewish,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thewebfairy.com/nerdcities/Palestine/terror-against-british.htm |title=Jewish Terrorism Against the British |publisher=Thewebfairy.com |accessdate=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929010653/http://thewebfairy.com/nerdcities/Palestine/terror-against-british.htm |archive-date=29 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/jan/28/jewish-terrorism-government-action |title=More Terrorism by Jews |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=28 January 1947 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Judith Apter Klinghoffer |url=http://hnn.us/articles/832.html |title=Third Article on Terrorism by Jews |publisher=Hnn.us |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> or of any other religious affiliation.

==Mass media usage==
Newspapers, magazines, and other information sources may deem ''militant'' a neutral term,<ref>Juergensmeyer, Mark. Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. Comparative studies in religion and society, 13. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. Page 9.</ref> whereas ''terrorist''<ref>Richard Jackson, Jeroen Gunning, Marie Breen Smyth, Critical Terrorism Studies: A New Research Agenda. Taylor & Francis, 2009. Page 162.</ref> or ''[[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]''<ref>Peloso, Vincent C. Work, Protest, and Identity in Twentieth-Century Latin America. Jaguar books on Latin America, no. 26. Wilmington, Del: Scholarly Resources, 2003. Page 238.</ref> conventionally indicates disapproval of the behavior of the individual or organization so labeled, regardless of the motivations for such behavior. ''Militant'', at other times, can refer to anyone not a member of formal [[armed forces]] engaging in warfare or serving as a [[combatant]].

The mass media sometimes uses the term "''militant''" in the context of terrorism.<ref name="SandersDecoding" /> Journalists sometimes apply the term ''militant'' to [[paramilitary]] movements using terrorism as a tactic. The mass media also has used the term ''militant groups'' or ''radical militants'' for terrorist organizations.<ref name="SandersDecoding">Sanders, Clinton.

===Legal inferences===
Those resisting a foreign military occupation can be seen as not meriting the label ''terrorists'' because their acts of political violence against military targets of a foreign occupier do not violate international law. Protocol 1 of the [[Geneva Conventions]] gives lawful combatant status to those engaging in armed conflicts against alien (or foreign) [[Military occupation|occupation]], [[colonialism|colonial domination]] and racist [[regime|régimes]]. Non-uniformed guerrillas also gain combatant status if they carry [[weapon|arms]] openly during [[military operation]]s. Protocol 1 does not legitimize attacks on civilians by militants who fall into these categories.

In the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] Resolution on terrorism (42/159, 7 December 1987). which condemns international terrorism and outlines measures to combat the crime, with one proviso: "that nothing in the present resolution could in any way prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, as derived from the [[Charter of the United Nations]], of peoples forcibly deprived of that right [...], particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes and foreign occupation or other forms of colonial domination, nor...the right of these peoples to struggle to this end and to seek and receive support [in accordance with the Charter and other principles of international law]."

==Span of militancy==
Militants occur across the [[political spectrum]], including racial or religious [[Supremacism|supremacists]], [[separatist]]s, abortion opponents and proponents, and environmentalists. Examples of left-wing, right-wing, and [[advocacy group]] militants include militant reformers, militant feminists, militant [[animal rights]] advocates, and militant anarchists. The phrase ''[[militant Islam]]'' can suggest violent and aggressive political activity by Islamic individuals, groups, movements, or governments. Various secret societies that have been known to be militarists are known as militant.

Using the [[U.S. president|president]]’s authority to assassinate people worldwide who pose an "imminent threat" if "capture is not feasible",<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Brian Williams |url=http://www.themilitant.com/2012/7624/762403.html |title=Obama: less rights, more drones–don't worry, it's legit  |magazine=The Militant |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> the Obama administration routinely called every victim of [[extrajudicial killing]] a militant.<ref>{{cite news| author=Michael Boyle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/11/obama-drone-wars-normalisation-extrajudicial-killing |title=Obama's drone wars and the normalisation of extrajudicial murder  |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>

==Organizations==
Among organisations that describe themselves as militants, the [[Ulster Young Militants]] are an example of a group resorting to violence (intimidation, arson, and murder) as a deliberate tactic.

==Militant research==
Militant research is defined as a type of research that is distinct from academia while also not synonymous with the political militant. It refuses the alienating practices of academia which separate researchers from the political meaning of their activity.<ref>{{cite web| author=Colectivo Situaciones |url=http://eipcp.net/transversal/0406/colectivosituaciones/en |title=On the researcher militant  |publisher=EIPCP |date=Sep 2003 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> In recent years it has become an increasingly popular approach for doing research<ref>{{cite journal| author=Sam Halversen |title=Militant research against‐and‐beyond itself: critical perspectives from the university and Occupy London | journal=Area |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=466–472 |date=9 Sep 2015 |doi=10.1111/area.12221 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1472683/1/Halvorsen-2015-Area.pdf }}</ref> especially since it attempt to resolve academic concerns related to representation and auto-critique.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Jared Sacks |title=On Militancy, Self-reflection, and the Role of the Researcher | journal=Politikon |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=438–455 |date=20 Sep 2018 |doi=10.1080/02589346.2018.1523349 }}</ref>
