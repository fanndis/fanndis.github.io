==History==

===Background===
[[File:Krym SS.jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister of the Crimean Regional Government [[Solomon Krym]], 1919]]
{{further|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|Modern history of Crimea|Crimean Oblast|Crimean Gothic}}[[File:The transfer of Crimea.jpg|thumb|left|Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet "About the transfer of the Crimean Oblast", 1954]]Crimea was first [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed]] by the Russian Empire in April 1783, under the Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]]. While ostentibly recognised by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in December that year, the annexation sowed tensions which ultimately contributed to the outbreak of [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|Russo-Turkish war]] of 1787–1792, in which the Ottoman Empire attempted to reverse it, but to no avail: the 1792 [[Treaty of Jassy]], which formally ended the war, reaffirmed the 1783 annexation again. From 1802, Crimea constituted a southern part of the [[Taurida Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] until the [[Russian Revolution|collapse thereof]] in 1917. During the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1921) Crimea changed hands multiple times, being ''inter alia'' the last territory held by the [[White movement|White]] [[Government of South Russia|Russian government]] in the European part of Russia in 1920, and finally became an [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous republic]] within [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) in 1921.

During [[World War II]], in 1944, the central Soviet authorities [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deported]] the [[Crimean Tatars]] for alleged collaboration with the Nazi occupation regime; in 1945, the region was stripped of its autonomy status.
[[File:Jalta-confer.jpg|thumb|The "[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]" at the [[Yalta Conference]] in Crimea: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Joseph Stalin]].]]

In 1954, the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[USSR]] [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] the region from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], another [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic]] of the USSR, then a highly centralised state, wherein borders between constituent republics was a technical issue of administration, despite the fact that Ukraine was a separate member of the UN. The Crimean Tatars were allowed to return to Crimea in the mid-1980s under [[perestroika]].<ref>"The Crimean Tatars began repatriating on a massive scale beginning in the late 1980s and continuing into the early 1990s. The population of Crimean Tatars in Crimea rapidly reached 250,000 and leveled off at 270,000 where it remains as of this writing [2001]. There are believed to be between 30,000 and 100,000 remaining in places of former exile in Central Asia."
Greta Lynn Uehling, ''The Crimean Tatars'' (Encyclopedia of the Minorities, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn) [http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/krimtatars.html iccrimea.org]</ref>

With the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], Crimea became part of the newly independent Ukraine, which led to tensions between [[Russia]] and Ukraine.{{#tag:ref|In a summer 2013 poll by [[VTSIOM]] where respondents in Russia were asked what they consider Russian territory 56% claimed that Crimea was part of Russia.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/09/10/6997678/ Майже 60% росіян вважають, що Крим - це Росія ''Almost 60% of Russians believe, that Crimea - is Russian''], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (10 September 2013)</ref>|group=nb}} With the [[Black Sea Fleet]] based on the peninsula, worries of armed skirmishes were occasionally raised. Crimean Tatars began returning from exile and resettling in Crimea. Ukraine restored Crimea's [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|autonomous status]] in 1991. Crimea's autonomous status was re-affirmed in 1996 with the ratification of Ukraine's [[Constitution of Ukraine|current constitution]], which designated Crimea as the "Autonomous Republic of Crimea", but also an "inseparable constituent part of Ukraine".<ref name="Wikisource">

On 11 March 2014, the [[Supreme Council of Crimea|Crimean parliament]] and the [[Sevastopol]] City Council jointly [[Declaration of Independence of Crimea and Sevastopol|issued a letter of intent]] to [[unilateral declaration of independence|unilaterally declare independence]] from Ukraine in the event of a 'Yes' vote in the referendum to join the region to Russia, that was to be held on 16 March.<ref name="KrimRada">{{cite web|title=Парламент Крыма принял Декларацию о независимости АРК и г.

The [[2014 Crimean referendum|referendum on the status of Crimea]] allowed citizens to vote on whether Crimea should apply to join Russia as a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject of the Russian Federation]], or restore the [[Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea|1992 Crimean constitution]] and Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine.

{{See also|Ministry of Crimean Affairs}}
On 18 March 2014, the self-proclaimed independent Republic of Crimea signed a treaty of accession to the Russian Federation. The accession was granted but separately for each the former regions that composed it: one accession for the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] as the ''Republic of Crimea''—the same name as the short-lived self-proclaimed independent republic—and another accession for Sevastopol as a federal city. The accession was only recognised internationally by a few states with most regarding the action as illegal. Ukraine refused to accept the annexation, still the Ukrainian military began to withdraw from Crimea on 19 March.<ref>{{cite news|author=Carol Morello and Kathy Lally|title=Ukraine says it is preparing to leave Crimea|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pro-russian-forces-break-into-ukrainian-naval-base-in-crimea/2014/03/19/2a9c5eaa-af46-11e3-a49e-76adc9210f19_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=19 March 2014}}</ref> A transition period, during which both parties to the accession treaty were to resolve the issues of integration of the new subjects "in the economic, financial, credit and legal system of the Russian Federation", was set to last until 1 January 2015.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The integration process started within days: on 24 March the [[Russian ruble]] went into official circulation with parallel circulation of the [[Ukrainian hryvnia]] permitted until 1 January 2016, however, [[taxes]] and [[fees]] were to be paid in rubles only, and the [[wages]] of employees at budget-receiving organisations were to be paid out in rubles as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/724972|title=TASS: Russia - Russian ruble goes into official circulation in Crimea as of Monday|work=TASS}}</ref> On 29 March, the clocks in Crimea were moved forward to Moscow time<ref>{{cite news|title=Ukraine crisis: Crimea celebrates switch to Moscow time|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26806583|accessdate=29 March 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=29 March 2014}}</ref> and on 31 March the Russian [[Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation|Prime Minister]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] announced a series of programmes aimed at swiftly incorporating the territory into Russia's [[economy]] and [[infrastructure]].

On 3 April 2014, [[Moscow]] sent a [[diplomatic note]] to [[Ukraine]] on terminating the actions of agreements concerning the deployment of the [[Russian Federation]]'s [[Black Sea Fleet]] on the territory of Ukraine. As part of the agreements, Russia used to pay the [[Ukrainian government]] $530 million annually for the base, and wrote off nearly $100 million of [[Kyiv]]'s debt for the right to use Ukrainian waters. Ukraine also received a discount of $100 on each 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas imported from Russia, which was provided for by cutting export duties on the gas, money that would have gone into the Russian state budget. The [[Kremlin]] declared that because the base is no longer located in Ukraine, so there are no legal grounds for the discount to be continued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140403/189015854/Moscow-Sent-Diplomatic-Note-to-Ukraine-on-Terminating-Black-Sea.html|title=Moscow Sent Diplomatic Note to Ukraine on Terminating Black Sea Fleet Agreements|author=Sputnik|date=3 April 2014|work=ria.ru}}</ref>

===Post-annexation===
After annexation, Crimean authorities started nationalization of what they called strategically important enterprises, which included not only transportation and energy production enterprises, but also, for example, a wine factory in [[Massandra]]. The enterprises which belonged to Russian citizens were nationalized against financial reimbursement, which was, however, much lower than the actual value; those which belonged to Ukrainian citizens, for example, [[PrivatBank]] owned by [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]] or [[Ukrtelecom]] owned by [[Rinat Akhmetov]], were expropriated without any reimbursement. The future of the nationalized enterprises is decided by the government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/publications/?fa=59199|title=Изображая Чавеса: чем закончился год национализаций в Крыму|last=Sambros|first=Andrey|date=27 February 2015|publisher=carnegie.ru|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Crimea}}

===Political geography===
If considered to be a part of Russia, then Crimea is one of two parts of [[European Russia]] that have no land connection to the rest of the country, the other being [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] on the [[Baltic Sea]]. Being a [[Enclave and exclave|semi-exclave]], the peninsula is connected to the rest of Russia by a multibillion-dollar road–rail fixed link across the Kerch Strait,<ref>{{cite news|title=Putin orders military exercise as protesters clash in Crimea|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-bridge-idUSKCN0XF1YS|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=reuters}}</ref> dubbed [[Crimean Bridge]] by the Russian government. The link is operational for road traffic since 2018, and for rail traffic since 2019 (passenger) and 2020 (freight).<ref>{{cite news|date=16 August 2020|title=На Крымском мосту установили новый рекорд автотрафика|trans-title=A new road traffic record was set on the Crimean bridge|agency=TASS|url=https://tass.ru/obschestvo/9212191|language=ru}}</ref>

If Crimea is considered separate from [[Ukraine]], which continues to claim sovereignty over the peninsula, then Ukraine is the only country with which it shares a land border, with a number of road and rail connections. These crossings have been under the control of Russian troops since at least mid-March 2014.

In March 2014 Crimean GDP was estimated at $4.3 billion or 0.2% of Russia based on current prices and 0.5% based on purchasing power parity.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

After annexation of the peninsula, Russia doubled payments to about 560,000 pensioners and 200,000 public workers (in Crimea).<ref name="m.gulfnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://m.gulfnews.com/opinion/editorials/in-crimea-cash-is-king-1.1466516|title=In Crimea, cash is king|work=gulfnews.com}}</ref> Those raises were cut back in April 2015.<ref name="Bad_Memory">{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21654059-land-grab-started-russias-conflict-wests-has-fallen-bottom | work=The Economist | title=Bad_Memory | date=11 June 2015}}</ref>

Starting in the summer of 2014 Crimea's government [[nationalized]] various large Crimean companies and assets; reasons given for this were (among others) "the company helped to finance military operations against [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Lugansk People's Republic]]" and "the resort complex illegally blocked public access to nearby park lands".<ref name=ncbn181114/> The government can nationalise assets considered to have "particular social, cultural, or historical value".<ref name=ncbn181114/> In the case of the [[Zalyv Shipbuilding yard]], Crimean "self-defense" forces stormed the company's headquarters to demand nationalization.<ref name=ncbn181114/> [[Head of the Republic of Crimea|Head of the Republic]] [[Sergey Aksyonov]] claimed that in at least one case "Employees established control of the enterprise on their own, we just helped them a little".<ref name=ncbn181114>[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-18/crimea-gets-renationalized Russia Delivers a New Shock to Crimean Business: Forced Nationalization], [[Bloomberg News]] (18 November 2014 )</ref> The Crimean assets of [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]] have also been nationalized; according to Aksyonov this was "totally justified due to the fact that he is one of the initiators and financiers of the special [[ATO zone|anti-terrorist operation]] in the [[Eastern Ukraine]] where [[Russian citizens]] are being killed".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceeinsight.net/2014/09/05/kolomoyskyis-assets-nationalized-crimea-sergey-aksyonov/ |title=Kolomoyskyi's assets to be nationalized in Crimea (Sergey Aksyonov)|website= ceeinsight.net|date= 5 September 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://tass.ru/en/economy/854261 Ukrainian tycoon’s estate in Crimea sold for $18 mln], [[Russian News Agency TASS]] (3 February 2016)</ref>

{{main|Political status of Crimea}}
The status of the republic is disputed as Russia and some other states recognised the independence declared by the Autonomous Republic and Sevastopol and their subsequent incorporation into the Russian Federation. Most other nations do not recognise these actions due to the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention]] that occurred as these events unfolded. Russia argues that the results of [[2014 Crimean referendum|a referendum held in Crimea and Sevastopol]] justify the accession. In the West, Russia's actions have been [[International reactions to the 2014 Crimean crisis|widely condemned]] as a violation of sovereignty of Ukraine and as an act of aggression. Ukraine still considers both the Autonomous Republic and Sevastopol as subdivisions of Ukraine under Ukrainian territory and subject to Ukrainian law. According to some unverified media reports, the Ukrainian government however has allegedly discontinued supplying the region with water through the [[North Crimean Canal]].

The official line of the [[US]], [[EU]] and [[Australia]] is that they don't grant visas to Crimeans with [[Russian passport]]s.<ref name="Bad_Memory"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uatoday.tv/politics/crimean-residents-may-not-be-able-to-visit-western-countries-using-russian-passports-388411.html|title=Crimean residents may not be able to visit Western countries using Russian passports|work=uatoday.tv}}</ref> Nevertheless, Russian media claims Crimeans get visas for some EU countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/758494|title=TASS: Russia - Crimean citizens get Schengen visas in Moscow despite EU ban|work=TASS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourskidka.ru/greciya-vydast-krymchanam-shengenskie-vizy|title=Греция выдаст крымчанам шенгенские визы|work=Горящие туры в Египет, туры в Турцию, Грецию.
