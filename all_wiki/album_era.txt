The '''album era''' was a period in [[popular music]] from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s, in which the [[album]] was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2017/08/ode-ipod-enduring-impact-worlds-most-successful-music-player|title=An ode to the iPod: the enduring impact of the world's most successful music player|first=Natalia|last=Bus|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=August 3, 2017|accessdate=November 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Zipkin">{{cite web|last=Zipkin|first=Michele|date=April 8, 2020|url=https://thestacker.com/stories/3713/best-albums-last-decade-according-critics|title=Best albums from the last decade, according to critics|website=Stacker|accessdate=June 3, 2020}}</ref> It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats: the 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm [[LP record|long-playing record (LP)]], the [[Compact Cassette|audiocassette]], and the music [[compact disc]]. [[Rock music]]ians were often at the forefront of the era, which is sometimes called the '''album-rock era''' in reference to their sphere of influence and activity.

LP albums developed in the early 20th century and were originally marketed for [[classical music]] and wealthier adult consumers, while [[single (music)|single]]s dominated the music industry, eventually through the success of [[rock and roll]] performers in the 1950s. It was not until the mid 1960s, when [[the Beatles]] began to release artistically ambitious and top-selling LPs, that more rock acts followed suit and the industry embraced pop albums to immense success while burgeoning [[rock critic]]s validated their cultural value. By the next decade, the LP had emerged as a fundamental artistic unit and a widely popular item with young people, often marketed using the idea of a [[concept album]].

At the end of the 1970s, LP albums experienced a decline in sales while the singles format was reemphasized by the developments of [[punk rock]], [[disco]], and [[MTV]]'s [[music video]] programming. The record industry combated this trend by gradually displacing LPs with CDs, releasing fewer singles that were hits to force sales of their accompanying albums, and inflating the prices of CD albums in the 1990s, when their production proliferated. However, by the end of the decade, [[file sharing]] networks such as [[Napster]] undermined the format's viability, as consumers were able to [[ripping|rip]] and share CD tracks digitally over the [[Internet]].

In the early 21st century, [[music download]]ing and [[streaming media|streaming]] services emerged as popular means of distribution, as album sales more than halved and recording acts generally focused on singles, effectively ending the album era. However, at the end of the 2010s, concept albums reemerged with culturally-relevant and critically successful personal narratives, while high-profile pop acts continued to market their album releases seriously.

[[File:Vinyl Player Original.jpg|thumb|An [[LP record]] on a phonograph]] 

Technological developments in the early 20th century led to sweeping changes in the way recorded music was made and sold. Prior to the LP, the standard medium for recorded music had been the 78 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]] [[gramophone record]], made from [[shellac]] and featuring a three-to-five minute capacity per side.<ref name="economics"/> The capacity limitations placed constraints on the composing processes of recording artists, while the fragility of shellac prompted the packaging of these records in empty booklets resembling [[photo album]]s,<ref name="economics"/> with typically brown-colored wrapping paper as covers.<ref name="visual"/> The introduction of [[polyvinyl chloride]] in record production led to vinyl records, which played with less noise and more durability.<ref name="economics"/>

In the 1940s, the market for commercial- and home-use recordings was dominated by the competing [[RCA Victor]] and [[Columbia Records]], whose chief engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] pioneered the development of the [[LP record|12-inch long play (LP) vinyl record]].<ref name="economics"/> This format could hold recordings as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peakvinyl.com/record-playtimes/|title=How Much Music Can Fit on a Vinyl Record?|last=Reitano|first=Bryce|date=August 24, 2019|accessdate=June 3, 2020|website=Peak Vinyl}}</ref> at a speed of 33 1‚ÅÑ3 rpm, and was playable with a small-tipped "microgroove" [[stylus]] designed for [[phonograph|home playback systems]].<ref name="economics"/> Officially introduced in 1948 by Columbia, LPs became known as "record albums", termed in reference to the photo album-like 78 packaging.<ref name="economics">{{cite book|last=Byun|first=Chong Hyun Christie|title=The Economics of the Popular Music Industry: Modelling from Microeconomic Theory and Industrial Organization|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=9781137467058|chapter=Introduction|year=2016}}</ref> Another innovation from Columbia was the addition of graphic and typographic design to album jacket covers, introduced by Alex Steinweiss, the label's art director.

The mid 1960s to the late 1970s was the era of the LP and the "golden era" of the album. According to [[BBC Four]]'s ''When Albums Ruled the World'' (2013), "These were the years when the music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood."<ref name=BBC>{{cite AV media|title=When Albums Ruled the World|date=February 8, 2013|publisher=[[BBC Four]]|people=O'Hagan, Steve (director)|medium=Documentary film|location=UK|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qhn70|accessdate=June 3, 2020}}</ref> "The album era had ushered in the notion of the rock singer as an artist who is worth paying attention to for more than the length of a hit", Pareles later observed. "Performers could become vivid presences to their fans even when they weren't ubiquitous on the [[Top 40]], and loyalties were formed that continue[d] to the [1990s] for some performers of the 1960s and 1970s, from [[the Kinks]] to [[Michael Jackson]] to [[Sting (singer)|Sting]]."<ref name=Pareles/> [[Marc Hogan]] of ''Pitchfork'' comments that female musicians and African Americans were rarely included in what became a predominantly white-male "rock-stuffed canon" during the album era, with exceptions being records by [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Marvin Gaye]], among others.<ref name="Hogan">{{cite magazine|last=Hogan|first=Marc|authorlink=Marc Hogan|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/ok-computer-at-20/10038-exit-music-how-radioheads-ok-computer-destroyed-the-art-pop-album-in-order-to-save-it/|title=Exit Music: How Radiohead's OK Computer Destroyed the Art-Pop Album in Order to Save It|magazine=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=March 11, 2010|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref> According to [[Eric Olsen (writer)|Eric Olsen]], [[Pink Floyd]] was "the most eccentric and experimental multi-platinum band of the album rock era", while [[Bob Marley]] was "the only towering figure of the rock era not from America or the U.K."<ref>{{cite web|last=Olsen|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Olsen (writer)|date=March 30, 2004|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/10-best-rock-bands-ever-2D80554936|title=The 10 best rock bands ever|website=[[Today.com]]|accessdate=November 15, 2020}}</ref>

The 1970 [[Joni Mitchell]] LP ''[[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|Ladies of the Canyon]]'' is commonly regarded as one of the album era's most important records.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perone|first=James E.|year=2016|title=Smash Hits: The 100 Songs That Defined America: The 100 Songs That Defined America|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1440834691|page=223}}</ref> The productions of [[Bob Ezrin]] ‚Äì who worked on 1970s albums by [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]' ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (1976) ‚Äì are also highlighted from this era. As music journalist James Campion writes, "The 1970s album era was perfectly suited to his cinematic approach. Its format, with its two sides, as if two acts in a play with an intermission, allows for a crucial arc in the storytelling."<ref name="Campion">{{cite book|last=Campion|first=James|year=2015|title=Shout It Out Loud: The Story of Kiss's Destroyer and the Making of an American Icon|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|chapter=5) School's Out|isbn=978-1617136450}}</ref> Along with the LP record, the [[8-track tape]] was another format popular in the US in this period.<ref name=BBC/>

Elaborating on the 1970s LP aesthetic, Campion identifies cultural and environmental factors that, in his mind, made the format ideal for young people during the decade. He describes the "solitary ambience" offered to listeners by the turntable and headphones, which "enveloped [them] in intricate stereo panning, atmospheric sounds, and multilayered vocal trickery". The popularity of recreational drugs and mood lamps at the time provided further settings for more focused listening experiences: "This kept the listener rapt to each song: how one flowed into the other, their connecting lyrical content, and the melding of instrumentation."<ref name="Campion"/>

[[File:Listening to is Yes' self-titled debut album from 1969 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Rhodes College]] student listening to the 1969 ''[[Yes (Yes album)|Yes]]'' LP on campus, c. 1970]]
In comparison to future generations, Campion explains that people growing up in the 1970s found greater value in album listening, in part because of their limited access to any other home entertainment appliance: "Many of them were unable to control the family television or even the kitchen radio. This led to prioritizing of the bedroom or upstairs den: the imagination capsule, locked away inside the headphone dreamscape, studying every corner of the 12-inch artwork and delving deeper into lyrical subtext, whether in ways intended by the artist or not. As if sitting in their own theater of the mind ‚Äì already hijacked by comic-book fantasy images of horror and science fiction, advertising propaganda, and the American promise of grandeur ‚Äì they were willing participants in the playful meandering of their rock-and-roll heroes."<ref name="Campion"/> Adding to this observation, Pareles says, "Pop stars develop staying power when listeners' affection and fascination is transferred from a hit song, or a string of hits, to the singer. Successive songs become a kind of narrative, held together by the image of and fantasies about the performer."<ref name=Pareles/>

According to Hogan, with ''Sgt. Pepper'' having provided the impetus, the idea of a "concept album" became a marketing tool by the 1970s, as "no shortage of bands used the pretense of 'art' to sell tens of millions of records." Citing hugely successful albums like Pink Floyd's 1973 LP ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', Hogan says "record sales spiraled upward until 1977, when they began ticking downward."<ref name="Hogan"/> This decline is attributed by Pareles to the developments of punk rock and disco in the late 1970s: "Punk returned the focus to the short and noisy song. Disco concentrated on the physical moment when a song makes a body move."<ref name=Pareles/> [[Robert Christgau]] similarly said, "the singles aesthetic began to reassert itself with disco and punk", suggesting this ended the "High Album Era".<ref name="Christgau1985">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=March 19, 1985|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv3-85.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=March 3, 2019}}</ref> In a different analysis, historian [[Matthew Restall]] observed in this period popular acts struggling to sustain the high level of success afforded to their previous albums. Citing the disappointing receptions of [[Elton John]]'s ''[[Blue Moves]]'' (1976) and [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'' (1979), Restall said, "[These] are dramatic examples of how the recording artists of the great album era ... suffered the receiving end of a horizon of expectations."<ref>{{cite book|chapter=3) Best of, Volume 300|last=Restall|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew Restall|year=2020|title=Elton John's Blue Moves|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|isbn=9781501355431}}</ref>

The fall of LP record sales at the end of the 1970s marked the end of the LP-driven "golden age".<ref name=BBC/> The success of [[MTV]]'s [[music video]] programming also reemphasized the single format in the 1980s and early 1990s. According to Pareles, it soon became apparent that, "after the album-rock era of the 1970s, MTV helped return the hit single to prominence as a pop marketing tool" and influenced record buyers' consuming habits toward more "disposable hits". Dependent on outlets like MTV that exclusively played hit songs, record companies placed more pressure on recording acts to achieve instant commercial success and marketability. "The 1980s and 1990 brought record sales to new peaks while the performers themselves tended to flash and burn out", Pareles wrote.<ref name=Pareles>Jon Pareles.

The album format eventually consolidated its domination of the recorded music market, first with the brief emergence of the cassette.<ref name=BBC/> According to ''[[PC Mag]]'' columnist [[John C. Dvorak]], "the album era had resulted in too many albums with only one good song on each of them, so cassettes let users do their own [[mixtape|mixes]]", a trend expedited by the introduction of the [[Sony Walkman]] in 1979. The introduction of the CD, along with the portable [[Discman]] player in 1984, effectively displaced the cassette<ref name="pcmag">{{cite magazine|last=Dvorak|first=John C.|authorlink=John C.

[[File:DJ Premier Digging33.jpg|thumb|As LPs fell out of favor to CDs, [[hip hop producer]]s repurposed them as [[sampling (music)|sampling]] sources, contributing to the development of [[record collecting]].]]

In the transition to CDs, well-regarded albums of the past were reissued on the format by their original record labels, or the label to whom the album's ownership had been transferred in the event of the original's closure, for instance. However, many LPs were overlooked for digital rerelease "because of legal and contractual problems, as well as simple oversight", Strauss explains.<ref name="Strauss"/> Instead, such records were often rediscovered and collected through the [[crate digging]] practices of North American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] producers seeking rare sounds to [[sampling (music)|sample]] for their own recordings. In her account of the 1980s hip hop crate-diggers, media and culture theorist Elodie A. Roy writes, "As they trailed second-hand shops and [[car boot sale]]s ‚Äì depositories of unwanted capitalist surplus ‚Äì diggers were bound to encounter realms of mainstream, mass-produced LP records now fallen out of grace and fashion." This development also contributed to the phenomenon of the "popular collector", which [[material culture]] scholar Paul Martin describes as those generally interested in "obtainable, affordable and appealing" items ‚Äì such as music releases ‚Äì and attributes to [[mass production]].<ref name="Roy">{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Elodie A.|pages=118, 119, 167, 177|title=Media, Materiality and Memory: Grounding the Groove|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317098744|year=2016}}</ref>

According to Pareles, after "the individual song returned as the pop unit" through the 1980s, record companies at the end of the decade began to abstain from releasing hit singles as a means of pressuring consumers to purchase the album on which the single featured.<ref name=Pareles/> By the end of the 1980s, seven-inch vinyl single sales were dropping and almost entirely displaced by [[cassette single]]s, neither of which ultimately sold as well as albums.<ref name=BBC/> By the mid-1990s, single song delivery of music to the consumer was almost dead, at least in the US.<ref name=Leeds/>  In 1998, ''Billboard'' magazine [[Billboard Hot 100#Album cuts|ended the requirement of a physical single]] for charting on its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart after several of the year's major hits were not released as singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer|title=How The Hot 100 Became America's Hit Barometer|work=[[NPR]]|date=August 1, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref>

Album production proliferated in the 1990s, with Christgau approximating 35,000 albums worldwide were released each year during the decade.<ref>{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Joshua|date=March 29, 2002|url=https://aux.avclub.com/robert-christgau-christgaus-consumer-guide-albums-of-1798193851|title=Robert Christgau: Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums Of The '90s|website=[[The A.V.

He suggested that consumers had been exploited through the decade by increasing prices of CD albums, which are less expensive to produce than vinyl records, and longer run-times with considerably lower-quality music. While acknowledging some recording acts still attempt to abide by ideals from the album era, he said most have renounced their responsibilities as artists and storytellers and embraced indulgent recording practices in order to profit from the CD boom.<ref name="Kot"/>

In 1999, Kot published a faux obituary for the 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm LP form in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. In it, he argued that the LP had "been made obsolete by MP3 downloads, movie soundtracks and CD shufflers ‚Äì not to mention video games, cable television, the Internet and the worldwide explosion of media that prey upon the attention spans of what used to be known as album buyers."<ref name="Kot"/> That same year, the Internet [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] service [[Napster]] allowed Internet users to easily download single songs in [[MP3]] format, which had been [[ripping|ripped]] from the digital files located on CDs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Andrew R.|title=Computers in Music Education: Amplifying Musicality|page=194|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415978507}}</ref> By early 2001, Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jupiter Media Metrix|date=July 20, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413104420/http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249|archivedate=April 13, 2008|title=Global Napster Usage Plummets, But New File-Sharing Alternatives Gaining Ground|website=comScore.com|url=http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249|accessdate=April 13, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although Napster was shut down in 2001 for copyright violations, several other [[music download]] services took its place.<ref>{{cite book|page=231|last1=Ohmae|first1=Kenichi|last2=≈åmae|first2=Ken'ichi|title=The Next Global Stage|year=2005|isbn=9780131479449|publisher=Wharton School Pub.}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iTunes]] service was introduced and the [[iPod]], a consumer-friendly MP3 player, was released later that year. This and other legal alternatives as well as illicit file sharing continued to depress sales of recorded music on physical formats. By 2006, CD sales were outnumbered for the first time by digital single downloads, with digital music consumers buying singles over albums by a margin of 19:1.<ref name=Leeds>Jeff Leeds.

With the rise of [[digital media]] in the 2000s, the "popular collector" of physical albums had transitioned to the "digital" and "electronic" collector. Of such collectors, Roy says it can be argued they are "not equipped with sufficient archiving knowledge or tools to preserve his/her collection in the long run", citing the vulnerable shelf life of digital files.<ref name="Roy"/> Concurrently, the demise of physical music stores allowed for websites to emerge as domains for album collecting, including the music review database [[AllMusic]], the streaming service [[Spotify]], and [[Discogs]], which began as a music database before developing into an online marketplace for physical music releases.<ref name="Buck">{{cite web|last=Buck|first=David|date=August 8, 2019|url=https://tedium.co/2019/08/08/record-collecting-streaming-effects/|title=Vinyl Collecting in 2019|website=tedium|accessdate=February 24, 2020}}</ref>

By the latter part of the decade, record labels had generally invested in streaming platforms such as Spotify and [[Pandora Radio]], with strategies focused on curated playlists and individual tracks rather than albums.<ref name="Zipkin"/> According to ''[[Deseret News]]'' writer Court Mann in 2019, "services like Spotify and [[Apple Music]] have moved our [music] libraries off personal hard drives, iPods and CDs, and into [[cloud storage|the cloud]]. Our music is decreasingly self-contained and private."<ref name="Mann"/> With consumers abandoning albums, more performers focused on releasing singles, a trend which critics felt undermined their artistic potential and produced many [[one-hit wonder]]s.<ref name=Morey>Tejas Morey.

Other critics still believe in the album as a viable concept in the 21st century. In 2003, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine had assigned Christgau to write an article discussing if the album was "a dying art form", to which he concluded: "For as long as artists tour, they'll peddle song collections with the rest of the merch, and those collections will be conceived as artfully as the artists possibly can." In 2019, as CD and digital download sales plummeted and theories still persisted about the "death" of the physical album format, Christgau found his original premise even more valid. "Because the computer giveth as the computer taketh away", he wrote in an essay accompanying the [[Pazz & Jop]] music poll that year, explaining that the current affordability of adequate recording equipment makes album production accessible to musicians of various levels of competence. Regarding professional acts, he said, "Writing songs is in their DNA, and if said songs are any good at all, recording them for posterity soon becomes irresistible."<ref name="christ13">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=February 7, 2019|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2019/02/07/pazz-jop-the-deans-list/|title=Pazz & Jop: The Dean's List|newspaper=The Village Voice|accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>

In a year-ending essay on the album in 2019, [[Ann Powers]] writes for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' that the year found the medium in a state of "metamorphosis" rather than dead. In her observation, many recording artists had revitalized the concept album around autobiographical narratives and personal themes, such as intimacy, [[intersectionality]], African-American life, boundaries among women, and grief associated with death. She cites such albums as [[Brittany Howard]]'s ''[[Jaime (album)|Jaime]]'', [[Raphael Saadiq]]'s ''[[Jimmy Lee (album)|Jimmy Lee]]'', [[Rapsody]]'s ''[[Eve (Rapsody album)|Eve]]'', [[Jenny Lewis]]' ''[[On the Line (Jenny Lewis album)|On the Line]]'', and [[Nick Cave]]'s ''[[Ghosteen]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Powers|first=Ann|authorlink=Ann Powers|date=December 17, 2019|url=https://slate.com/culture/2019/12/music-club-2019-concept-albums-not-dead.html|title=The album is evolving.|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=September 15, 2020}}</ref> Writing in 2020, arts and culture journalist Michelle Zipkin believes albums are still "an integral, relevant, and celebrated component of musical creation and artistry". She cites the review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s tabulation of the most acclaimed albums from the 2010s, which showcased musicianship from a diverse range of artists and often serious themes, such as grief, [[race relations]], and [[identity politics]], while adding that, "Albums today offer a fresh way of approaching a changing industry".<ref name="Zipkin"/>

Between March 6 and 12, 2020, physical album sales fell 6% due in part to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Later that month, [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] temporarily suspended incoming shipments of music CDs and vinyl records from U.S. suppliers in an effort to prioritize items deemed more essential.<ref name="Zipkin"/> According to Peter Robinson of ''[[The Guardian]]'', while the release format is "dead" commercially, high-profile artists in the 21st century such as [[U2]], [[1975 (band)|the 1975]], [[Taylor Swift]], and [[Katy Perry]] still presented their work within a self-defined "album era", representing each project's aesthetic lifetime in the style of themed album campaigns by performers of the past, such as [[David Bowie]], [[Madonna]], and [[Pet Shop Boys]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Robinson|title=Achtung, maybe?

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Mikael Wood elaborated on this point, saying, "Yet as she kept her music off Spotify ‚Äì conditioning her loyal audience to think of buying her songs and albums as an act of devotion ‚Äì younger artists like [[Ariana Grande|<nowiki>[Ariana]</nowiki> Grande]] emerged to establish themselves as streaming favorites." However, Swift used all major streaming services to release her 2019 album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'', which ''Quartz'' said "might be the last CD we buy" and is "perhaps a final death note for the CD".<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Singh-Kurtz|first1=Sangeeta|last2=Dan|first2=Kopf|date=August 23, 2019|title=Taylor Swift is the only artist who still sells CDs|url=https://qz.com/1692498/taylor-swifts-new-album-lover-proves-she-can-still-sell-cds/|access-date=July 1, 2020|website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]}}</ref>
