==Incidents==
In 1950, ''Stern'' published an article that criticized the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for wasting money and resources during their occupation of Germany. British military authorities responded and had its publication shut down for a week.

It is notorious internationally for publishing the so-called [[Hitler Diaries]] in its 28 April 1983 edition.<ref name="ser">{{cite journal|last=Esser|first=Frank|author2=Uwe Hartung |title=Nazis, Pollution, and no Sex: Political Scandals as a Reflection of Political Culture in Germany|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2004|volume=47|issue=1040|doi=10.1177/0002764203262277|pages=1040–1071}}</ref> Scientific examination soon proved them [[Forgery|forgeries]] committed by [[Konrad Kujau]], who had created the journals between 1981 and 1983. A British broadsheet newspaper, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', had begun a serialization of the diaries, but after the hoax was uncovered, cancelled it and issued an official apology.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/25/newsid_4464000/4464109.stm 1983: 'Hitler diaries' published] ''BBC''</ref> The fiasco led to the resignation of the magazine's editors and a major scandal that is still regarded as a low point in German journalism. The incident caused a major crisis for the magazine. Its credibility was severely damaged and it had to rebuild its reputation from an abysmal level. It took the magazine ten years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation.<ref name="ser"/>

In Germany, it is also remembered for the publication in 1971 of ''[[We've had abortions!]]'', a public declaration by several hundred women provoked by [[Alice Schwarzer]] to defy its illegality at that time in West Germany.

In 1990, ''Stern'' published the title story "I am a masochist" in which author [[Sina-Aline Geißler]] discussed her literary coming-out as a member of the [[BDSM]] scene. This caused an intense public debate, and radical feminists occupied the editorial office of ''Stern''.

Four ''Stern'' journalists have been killed while reporting. In January 1995, [[Jochen Piest]] was killed by a sniper near the Chechen capital of [[Grozny]]. [[Killing of Gabriel Grüner and Volker Krämer|Gabriel Grüner and Volker Krämer]] were killed near [[Dulje]], [[Kosovo]]. In November 2001 [[Volker Handloik]] was killed in an ambush in northern [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=nyt>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EFDC1038F930A25752C1A9679C8B63 A Nation Challenged: The News Media; Two French Radio Journalists and a German Are Killed in Taliban Ambush of a Rebel Force] ''The New York Times''.</ref>
