==Plot==
Convenience store robber Herbert I. "Hi" McDunnough and police officer Edwina "Ed" meet after she takes the [[mugshot]]s of the [[Recidivism|recidivist]]. During subsequent visits, Hi learns that Ed's [[fiancé]] has left her. Hi proposes to her after his latest release from prison, and the two get married. They move into a desert [[mobile home]], and Hi gets a job in a machine shop. They want to have children but Ed is [[Infertility|infertile]], and they cannot adopt because of Hi's criminal record, even though Ed is a police officer. Devastated, Ed quits her job. The couple learns of the "Arizona [[multiple birth|Quints]]", quintuplet sons of locally famous furniture magnate Nathan Arizona; driven by envy, Hi and Ed kidnap one of the babies, whom they believe to be Nathan Junior. Hi and Ed return home and are soon visited by Hi's cellmates, Gale and Evelle Snoats, who have just escaped from prison. Facing ridicule by the Snoats brothers for his new domestic life, Hi is tempted to return to his [[Felony|felonious]] ways. That evening, Hi has an intense nightmare in which he foresees the arrival of an apocalyptic biker, later revealed to be bounty hunter Leonard Smalls.

The next day, Hi and Ed are visited by Hi's [[Construction foreman|foreman]] Glen and his family. Glen's wife Dot speaks of her desire to have more children with Glen, while Glen confesses to Hi that he and Dot are [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]], and he proposes exchanging wives. Hi assaults Glen in his wrath and chases him off the property. That night, Hi robs a convenience store and steals a package of diapers for Junior, but Ed, furious, ditches him, forcing Hi to escape on foot from the police, two armed cashiers, and a pack of dogs. Glen returns the next day to fire Hi, and reveals that he has inferred Junior's identity because of the newspaper article he read about Junior missing. He threatens to turn Hi in to the police unless Glen and Dot get custody of Junior. Gale and Evelle overhear this conversation and overpower Hi in a wild fight in his home, tying him to a chair and taking Junior for themselves. When Ed comes home, she frees Hi and the two arm themselves and set out together to retrieve the child. Meanwhile, the [[bounty hunter]] Leonard Smalls approaches Nathan Arizona Sr. with an offer to find the child for $50,000. Nathan Sr. declines the offer, believing that Smalls himself is the kidnapper. Smalls decides to recover the child anyway to sell on the [[black market]].

Gale and Evelle rob a bank but leave Junior there as they make their getaway. One of the bank's anti-theft [[Dye pack|dye canisters]] explodes in their loot sack, blocking the car's windows and incapacitating them. At the bank, Smalls arrives for Junior just ahead of Ed and Hi. Ed grabs the baby and flees; Hi is able to fend Smalls off for a while, but is eventually overwhelmed by Smalls's superior strength, armament and viciousness. As Smalls throws Hi to the ground and prepares to kill him, Hi holds up his hand to reveal that he has pulled the pin from one of the [[hand grenades]] on Smalls's vest. Smalls cannot get rid of the grenade in time and is blown to pieces when it explodes and sets off all his weapons. Hi and Ed sneak Junior back into the Arizona home and are confronted by Nathan Sr. After Nathan Sr. learns why they took his son, he sympathizes with their predicament and decides not to turn them in. When Hi and Ed say that they are splitting up, he advises them to sleep on it. Hi and Ed go to sleep in the same bed, and Hi has a dream about Gale and Evelle returning to prison, realizing they "weren't ready yet to come out into the world"; Glen gets his due from a [[Polish-American]] police officer whom he has no luck getting to listen to his "wild tales" about Hi and Ed after he "threw in one [[Polack]] joke too many"; and Nathan Jr. gets a football for Christmas from "a kindly couple who wish to remain unknown", later becoming a football star. The dream ends with an elderly couple (implied to be Hi and Ed) together enjoying a holiday visit from a large family of children and grandchildren.

==Production==

===Casting and conception===
The Coen Brothers started working on ''Raising Arizona'' with the idea to make it as different as possible from their previous film, ''[[Blood Simple]]'', by having it be far more optimistic and upbeat.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Coen Brothers: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series)|last=Allen|first=William Rodney|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=2006|isbn=1578068894}}</ref> The starting point of scriptwriting came from the idea of the character of Hi, who has the desire to live a regular life within the boundaries of the law.<ref name=":1" /> To create their characters' dialect, Joel and Ethan created a hybrid of local dialect and the assumed reading material of the characters, namely, magazines and [[the Bible]].<ref name=":1" /> In contrast to ''Blood Simple'', the characters in ''Raising Arizona'' were written to be very sympathetic.<ref name=":1" /> The Coens wrote the character Ed for Holly Hunter.<ref name=":1" /> The character of Leonard Smalls was created when the Coen Brothers tried to envision an "evil character" not from their imagination, but one that the character would have thought up.<ref name=":1" /> His name is widely thought to be a reference to the character of Lennie Small, from [[John Steinbeck]]'s novella ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} John Goodman was drawn to characters of "great feeling, [guys] who could explode or start weeping at any moment"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coen Brothers: The Story of Two American Filmmakers|last=Levine|first=Josh|publisher=ECW PRESS|year=2000|location=Toronto, Canada|page=52}}</ref> and became a [[List of frequent Coen Brothers collaborators|frequent collaborator]] following his performance as Gale Snoats. The script took three and a half months to write.<ref name=":1" />

The film was influenced by the works of director [[Preston Sturges]] and writers such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[Flannery O'Connor]] (who was known for her [[Southern literature]]; “She also has a great sense of eccentric character,” Ethan Coen told one interviewer).<ref name=":1" /> Joel and Ethan showed the completed script to Circle Films, their American distributor for ''Blood Simple''. Circle Films agreed to finance the movie.<ref name=":1" /> The Coens came to the set with a complete script and storyboard.<ref name=":1" /> With a budget of just over five million dollars, Joel Coen noted that "to obtain maximum from that money, the movie has to be meticulously prepared".<ref name=":1" />

===Filming===
''Raising Arizona'' was shot in ten weeks. Many crew members who had worked with Joel and Ethan on ''Blood Simple'' returned for ''Raising Arizona'', including cinematographer [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], co-producer Mark Silverman, production designer Jane Musky, associate producer and assistant director Deborah Reinisch, and film composer [[Carter Burwell]].<ref name=":1" />

The relationship between actor [[Nicolas Cage]] and the Coens was respectful, but turbulent. When he arrived on-set, and at various other points during production, Cage offered suggestions to the Coen brothers, which they ignored. Cage said that "Joel and Ethan have a very strong vision and I've learned how difficult it is to accept another artist's vision. They have an autocratic nature."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Coen Brothers: The Story of Two American Filmmakers|last=Levine|first=Josh|publisher=ECW PRESS|year=2000|location=Toronto, Canada|page=54}}</ref> Randall "Tex" Cobb also gave the Coens difficulty on set, with Joel noting that "he's less an actor than a force of nature ... I don't know if I'd rush headlong into employing him for a future film."<ref name=":0" />

==Release and reception==
''Raising Arizona'' was initially released in the US, three dates; A New York City premiere on the 6th March 1987, a limited release on the 13th March 1987 and a Nationwide release on the 17th April 1987. The film was also released in Argentina on the 26th March 1987 before it was screened out of competition at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/434/year/1987.html|title=Festival de Cannes: Raising Arizona|work=festival-cannes.com|access-date=2009-07-25}}</ref>

Despite the cult following of their later films, such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', Ethan Coen described their second feature as "the last movie [we] made that made any significant amount of money".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coen Brothers: The Story of Two American Filmmakers|last=Levine|first=Josh|publisher=ECW PRESS|year=2000|location=Toronto, Canada|page=104}}</ref>

The [[Film score|score]] to ''Raising Arizona'' is written by [[Carter Burwell]], the second of his collaborations with the [[Coen brothers]].  The sounds are a mix of [[Organ (music)|organ]], massed choir, [[banjo]], [[whistling]], and [[yodeling]].

Themes are borrowed from the "Goofing Off Suite", originally recorded by [[Pete Seeger]] in 1955, which includes an excerpt from the Chorale movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] and "Russian Folk Themes and Yodel". Credited musicians for the film include Ben Freed (banjo), Mieczyslaw Litwinski ([[Jew's harp]] and [[guitar]]), and John R. Crowder (yodeling). Holly Hunter sings a traditional [[murder ballad]], "[[Down in the Willow Garden]]", as an incongruous "lullaby" during the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowell|first=Erica|title=The brothers Grim: the films of Ethan and Joel Coen|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5850-3|page=264}}</ref>

Selections from Burwell's score to ''Raising Arizona'' were released on an album in 1987, along with selections from the Coens' sole previous feature film, ''Blood Simple''.  The tracks from ''Raising Arizona'' constitute the first ten tracks on a 17-track CD that also features selections from the [[Blood Simple#Soundtrack|''Blood Simple'' soundtrack]].
