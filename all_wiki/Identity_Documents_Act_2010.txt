The '''Identity Documents Act 2010''' (c. 40) is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom which reverses the [[Identity Cards Act 2006|introduction of identity cards]], and requires the destruction of the information held on the National Identity Register.

As a bill, it was presented to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] on 26 May 2010, making it the first government bill to be introduced to the 55th Parliament of the United Kingdom by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron ministry]].

==Parliamentary passage==
The government initially aimed to have the bill passed into law by August 2010, but the bill did not make sufficient progress to achieve this.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8707355.stm |title=Identity cards scheme will be axed 'within 100 days' |date=27 May 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> 

The bill passed the House of Commons on 15 September 2010, and was unopposed by the [[Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition (UK)|Opposition]]. It was introduced to the [[House of Lords]] on 5 October 2010, and received its second reading on 18 October 2010, and successfully passed through a Committee of the Whole House without amendment. 

At report stage on 17 November 2010, however, peers accepted a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] amendment to pay compensation to people who had already paid the charge to purchase an ID Card.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11781783 |title=Government suffers Lords defeat over ID card refunds |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> 

The amendment remained in place until the bill returned to the House of Commons, where it was rejected by the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] as it imposed an additional charge on the public purse not authorised by the Commons, which holds financial supremacy over the House of Lords. The Lords accepted the Commons disagreement to their amendment, and the bill received Royal Assent on 21 December 2010.

==Provisions==
The Act repeals the [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] and requires the destruction of the information held on the [[National Identity Register]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmbills/001/2011001.pdf Identity Documents Bill 2010 ''as introduced'']</ref> It legislates to:<ref>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/queens-speech/2010/05/queens-speech-identity-documents-bill-50641 Queen’s Speech – Identity Documents Bill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528110952/http://www.number10.gov.uk/queens-speech/2010/05/queens-speech-identity-documents-bill-50641 |date=2010-05-28 }}, Number10.gov.uk, published May 25, 2010, accessed May 27, 2010</ref>
