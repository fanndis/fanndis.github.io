"'''Needed Me'''" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer and songwriter [[Rihanna]] from her eighth studio album, ''[[Anti (album)|Anti]]'' (2016). It was written by Rihanna, Brittany Hazard, Charles Hinshaw and Derrus Rachel together with its producer [[DJ Mustard]] and its co-producers Twice as Nice and [[Frank Dukes]]. The song was serviced to the urban radio stations on 30 March 2016 as a follow up single from ''Anti'' together with "[[Kiss It Better (Rihanna song)|Kiss It Better]]". Afterwards, Def Jam released "Needed Me" to mainstream radio. "Needed Me" is a "mellow" [[dubstep]]-flavored [[Electro music|electro]]-[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, that contains a downtempo and loose production with synthetic sounds. The song's lyrics discuss romantic rejection.

In the United States, the song peaked at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] becoming Rihanna's 29th top 10 single on the chart, spending sixteen weeks in the top ten and later becoming the singer's longest-charting hit. The song's accompanying music video was directed by film producer [[Harmony Korine]] and premiered on April 20, 2016, in celebration of [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]. The video is set in Miami and depicts Rihanna with a gun, riding on a motor bike, before attending a strip club where she kills a man. Rihanna performed "Needed Me" during the [[Anti World Tour]]. The song received a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance|Best R&B Performance]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|59th ceremony]].

== Writing and production ==
On September 15, 2014, American producer [[DJ Mustard]] confirmed that he and Rihanna had collaborated on a song for the singer's eighth studio album, ''Anti'': "We haven't got our club record just yet but we have a ballad that I really like and that she likes too."<ref name="vulture">{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/rihanna-r8-everything-we-know-about-her-new-album.html|title=Everything We Know About Rihanna's Next Album: A Timeline|last=Lockett|first=Dee|date=March 12, 2015|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=March 17, 2015|publisher=}}</ref> DJ Mustard worked on fifty songs in an attempt for them to be included on ''Anti'', "Needed Me" was one of the last songs that he worked on. Speaking about the writing and production process Mustard stated "I was at the studio and I was like "I don’t want to go, I don’t feel like going, I’ve done so many songs, she's not going to like it’... The next day they told me she liked it. It was great that I had a team (Twice as Nice) that could take me and actually get it done because if it wasn't for them I probably wouldn't have went. There would have been no ‘Needed Me’."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Au|first1=Christopher Kevin|title=Interview: DJ Mustard Talks Producing For Rihanna & His $4000 Versace Jacket|url=http://lifewithoutandy.com/news/news/interview-dj-mustard-discusses-producing-for-rihanna-his-4000-versace-jacket/|accessdate=July 21, 2016|work=Life Without Andy|date=March 18, 2016}}</ref>

===Accolades===
''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked "Needed Me" at number 9 on their "100 Best Pop Songs of 2016" list: "We already knew that Rihanna was a savage -- her supreme self-confidence and total lack of f---s to give have made that abundantly clear over the years. But in case you missed the memo, "Needed Me" is the perfect reminder, pairing nihilistic razor-sharp lyrical barbs with a bass-heavy down-tempo beat that could almost be confused with a pained love song—but only if you weren't paying attention. The way she eviscerates a former lover ("Don't get it twisted / You was just another n---a on the hit list") is delivered so casually and with so much barely-concealed contempt that it can't even be called cocky; she's just stating the truth, and if you haven't caught on by now there's no hope left for catching up."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2016/7617635/billboard-top-100-pop-songs-of-2016|title=Billboard's 100 Best Pop Songs of 2016: Critics' Picks|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=December 12, 2016|date=December 12, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' would later list "Needed Me" on their ranking of the 100 best songs of 2016 at number 88.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9981-the-100-best-songs-of-2016/?page=10|title=The 100 Best Songs of 2016|publisher=Pitchfork Media|date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> In the annual ''[[Village Voice]]'''s [[Pazz & Jop]] mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2016, "Needed Me" was ranked at number 21, tied with [[Ariana Grande]]'s "[[Into You (Ariana Grande song)|Into You]]" and [[Miranda Lambert]]'s "[[Vice (Miranda Lambert song)|Vice]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazznjop/singles/2016|title=PAZZ+JOP 2016|newspaper=Village Voice|date=January 25, 2017|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>

==Music video==
[[File:HarmonyKorine07TIFF.jpg|upright|thumb|left|150px|The music video was directed by filmmaker [[Harmony Korine]].]]
In March 2016, media outlets reported that Rihanna was filming the music video for "Needed Me" during her Anti World Tour. The reports featured photos that saw Rihanna topless outdoors and images of Rihanna dressed in a backless bronze leather jumpsuit while riding on the back of a motorcycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/67995/20160321/rihanna-needed-me-music-video-miami-anti-tour-photos.htm|title=Rihanna Spotted Filiming 'Needed Me' Music Video During Miami ANTI World Tour Stop [PHOTOS]|work=Music Times|date=March 21, 2016|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref> On April 20, 2016, Rihanna posted three video stills onto her official Instagram, and announced that the song's official music video would be released later that day in celebration of [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]. The same Instagram stills revealed that the music video was directed by filmmaker [[Harmony Korine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/04/20/rihanna-is-celebrating-420-by-premiering-the-needed-me-video|title=Rihanna Is Celebrating 4/20 By Premiering The "Needed Me" Video|author=Owen Myers|work=[[The Fader]]|date=April 20, 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}</ref>

The video is set in a "gritty" area of Miami and features appearances from gun carrying and bike-riding characters. The video moves on to feature tattooed strippers in slow motion with low lit candle lighting. Rihanna, meanwhile, plays the action anti-hero, smoking and staring out into the distance from the patio of her luxurious pad, in a sheer cover-up. Later, she slowly makes her way through the grungy strip club with a pistol, setting her sights on one unlucky tattoo-heavy guy getting a lap dance—and kills him.<ref name="slatevideo"/>

Aisha Harris of ''[[Slate Magazine|Slate]]'' stated that the accompanying video for "Needed Me" was inspired by Korine's film ''[[Spring Breakers]]'', a sentiment also echoed by Jamieson Cox of ''[[The Verge]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Jamieson|title=Watch Rihanna's NSFW video for Needed Me, directed by Harmony Korine|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/20/11466702/rihanna-needed-me-video-watch-harmony-korine|accessdate=July 22, 2016|work=[[The Verge]]|date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> with Harris also noting that "it's difficult to tell if this video is trying to say anything particularly meaningful or is just an example of empty exploitation. Maybe it's a bit of both, but one thing is for sure: It's impossible to look away from."<ref name="slatevideo">{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Aisha|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/20/rihanna_s_harmony_korine_directed_video_for_needed_me_feels_a_lot_like_spring.html|title=Rihanna's Harmony Korine–directed video for "Needed Me" feels a lot like Spring Breakers (VIDEO)|work=Slate Magazine|date=April 20, 2016|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Adelle Platon of ''Billboard'' called it "a badass clip",<ref>{{cite news|last1=Platon|first1=Adelle|title=Watch Rihanna Hit The Strip Club, Go In For The Kill in NSFW 'Needed Me' Video|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7340766/rihanna-needed-me-video|accessdate=July 22, 2016|work=Billboard|date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> while Brittany Spanos of ''Rolling Stone'' noted it to be reminiscent of her "[[Bitch Better Have My Money]]" video and named it "violent" and "dark".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spanos|first1=Brittany|title=Watch Rihanna's Violent, Dark 'Needed Me' Video|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-rihannas-violent-dark-needed-me-video-20160420|accessdate=July 22, 2016|work=Rolling Stone|date=April 20, 2016}}</ref>
Patrick Ryan of USA Today placed the music video at number one on his list of "6 music videos that prove Rihanna is a 'Video Vanguard'". Speaking on the video Ryan stated that "Rihanna creates indelible characters in each of her videos", but praised the ones that came from the "ANTI era" which he described as being a " gun-toting, DGAF ice queen: half-naked, smoking a joint oceanside one minute, before sauntering into a strip club to mow you down the next. With Spring Breakers director Harmony Korine at the helm, Needed Me explores the hazy, sordid underbelly that this version of RiRi inhabits, with visuals so eye-poppingly WTF that you can’t look away from the carnage."<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/08/26/rihanna-vmas-6-iconic-music-videos-video-vanguard-award/89272330/</ref>
