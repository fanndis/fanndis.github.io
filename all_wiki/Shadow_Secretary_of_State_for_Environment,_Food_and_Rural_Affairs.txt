{{refimprove|date=September 2015}}
'''Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs''' is a position with the [[UK Opposition]]'s [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] that deals with issues surrounding the [[environmentalism|environment]] and food and rural affairs; if the opposition party is elected to government, the designated person is a likely choice to become the new [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].

The position existed as '''Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment''' until 1997, when it was renamed '''Environment, Transport and the Regions''' to match the Government's reorganisation. It changed to its current name in 2001 for the same reason. Under [[Michael Howard]], the arrangement was slightly different. There was a Shadow Environment Secretary outside Shadow Cabinet and (together with the [[Shadow Secretary of State for Transport|Shadow Transport Secretary]]) under the direction of the Shadow Secretary of State for Environment and Transport.
