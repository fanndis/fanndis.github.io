'''Pittsburgh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|s|b|ɜːr|ɡ}} {{Respell|PITS|burg}}) is a city in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States, and is the [[county seat]] of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]]. A population of about 300,286 (2019) residents live within the city limits, making it the [[List of United States cities by population|66th-largest city in the U.S.]] and the [[List of municipalities in Pennsylvania#Municipalities|second-most populous]] city in Pennsylvania behind [[Philadelphia]].

Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]], in honor of British statesman [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]].

In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] via the rivers.<ref name="chronology" /> During 1753–54, the British hastily built [[Fort Prince George]] before a larger French force drove them off. The French built [[Fort Duquesne]] based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The [[French and Indian War]], the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]], began with the future Pittsburgh as its center.

During [[Pontiac's Rebellion]], native tribes conducted a [[siege of Fort Pitt]] for two months until Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] relieved it after the [[Battle of Bushy Run]].

During this period, the powerful nations of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], the [[William Penn|Penns]] were allowed to purchase the modern region from the [[Iroquois]].

Following the [[American Revolution]], the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the [[Ohio Country]]. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] was started, and in 1787, the [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh Academy]] was chartered. Unrest during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers came via routes over the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes.<!-- and then what? up the Ohio River? --> [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the [[Northwest Territory]].

The [[War of 1812]] cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats, that increased trading traffic on the rivers.

In the 1830s, many [[Welsh people]] from the [[Merthyr]] steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the [[Merthyr Rising]]. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. The [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh]] destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22&nbsp;million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, the most came from Germany.

While Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the [[Underground Railroad]] in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.<ref name="freedom">William J. Switala, ''Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania'', Stackpole Books, 2001, pp. 88-89</ref> The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.<ref name="exhibit">[http://exhibit.library.pitt.edu/freeatlast/fugitive_laws.html Exhibit: ''Free at Last? Slavery in Pittsburgh in the 18th and 19th Centuries''], 2009, University of Pittsburgh Library</ref> Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 [[Fugitive Slave Act]], as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.<ref name="freedom"/>

The [[American Civil War]] boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. [[Andrew Carnegie]] began steel production in 1875 at the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania]], which evolved into the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. He adopted the [[Bessemer process]] to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.

In 1901, [[J. P. Morgan]] and attorney [[Elbert Henry Gary|Elbert H. Gary]] merged [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and several other companies into [[U.S. Steel]]. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|nation's 8th-largest city]], accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.

The [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by [[T. G. Masaryk]], concerning the future foundation of [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref>PRECLÍK, Vratislav.

The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs.

Following the war, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.<ref name="diaspora"/>

In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.

During the [[late 2000s recession]], Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Pittsburgh]] [[metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices—the highest appreciation of the largest 25 MSAs in the United States, as 22 of the top 25 MSAs saw a depreciation of housing values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2011/12/more-pittsburgh-real-estate-trends.html|title=More Pittsburgh real estate trends|last=Briem|first=Christopher|date=December 30, 2011|work=Nullspace|access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref> Pittsburgh's story of economic regeneration was the inspiration of President [[Barack Obama]] to host the [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8072894.stm |work=BBC News | title=US to host next G20 world meeting | date=May 28, 2009 | access-date=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Buena vista.JPG|thumb|left|The North Side]]
The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]], and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh until it was merged with Pittsburgh in 1907 under great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as [[Heinz Field]], [[PNC Park]], [[Carnegie Science Center]], [[National Aviary]], [[Andy Warhol Museum]], [[Mattress Factory]] art museum, [[Children's Museum of Pittsburgh]], [[Randyland]], [[Penn Brewery]], [[Allegheny Observatory]], and [[Allegheny General Hospital]].<ref>Allegheny City: A History of Pittsburgh's North Side by Dan Rooney and Carol Peterson</ref>

The South Side was once the site of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Since the late 20th century, the city undertook a [[Main Street program]] in cooperation with the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years up to 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last = O'Neill |first = Brian|title = Rising home prices tell Pittsburgh's uplifting story  |work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date = January 8, 2014 |url = http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/brian-oneill/2014/01/09/Rising-home-prices-tell-Pittsburgh-s-uplifting-story/stories/201401090182}}</ref>  East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.

In 1993 the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh]] purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development, to include a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Pitt Panthers]].

In 2019, the "State of the Air" report from the [[American Lung Association]] (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. Outside of California, Allegheny County is the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.lung.org/local-content/_content-items/about-us/media/press-releases/air-quality-in-pittsburgh.html|title=Air Quality in Pittsburgh Metro Area Worsened for both Ozone and Particle Pollution, Finds 2019 'State of the Air' Report|date=24 April 2019|work=American Lung Association}}</ref>
In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh.

Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis.

===Local dialect===
{{Main|Western Pennsylvania English}}

The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called ''[[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburghese]]'', was influenced by [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], German, and [[Eastern European]] immigrants and African Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu/PittsburghSpeech_History.html|title=History|website=pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref> Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as "[[Yinzer]]s" (from the local word "yinz" [var. ''yunz''], a blended form of "you ones," similar to "y'all" and "you all" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: "slippy" (slippery), "redd up" (clean up), "jagger bush" (thorn bush), and "gum bands" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb "to be". In Pittsburghese one would say "the car needs washed" instead of "needs to be washed," "needs washing," or "needs a wash." The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat [[staccato]] rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted ''[[The New York Times]]'' to describe Pittsburgh as "the [[Galapagos Islands]] of American dialect".<ref>{{cite news |last=Sultan |first=Tim |date=March 17, 2006 |title=It's Not the Sights, It's the Sounds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/travel/escapes/its-not-the-sights-its-the-sounds.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109203001/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/travel/escapes/17accent.html?pagewanted=2 |archive-date=January 9, 2007 |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> The lexicon itself contains notable loans from [[Polish language|Polish]] and other European languages; examples include [[headscarf|babushka]], [[pierogi]], and [[halušky]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu/PittsburghSpeech_SpeechOverview.html | title = Overview | work = Pittsburgh Speech and Society | access-date = August 14, 2007 }}</ref>

Livability rankings typically consider factors such as cost of living, crime, and cultural opportunities. Pittsburgh has a low cost of living compared to other northeastern U.S. cities. According to the Federal Housing Board, the average price for a 3- to 4-bedroom, 2-bath family home in Pittsburgh for 2004 is $162,000, well below the national average of $264,540. Average 2010 rent for all bedrooms in Pittsburgh was $789.

Enhancing Pittsburgh's livability is the fact that the area faces little risk of natural disasters from such causes as earthquake, hurricane, wildfire, or tornado.

[[File:Pittsburgh (view from the North Hills).JPG|thumb|I-279]]
Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from [[downtown Pittsburgh]] as the "parkways." [[Interstate 376]] is both the "parkway east" connecting to [[Interstate 76 (Ohio–New Jersey)|Interstate 76]] ([[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]) and the "parkway west" connecting to [[Interstate 79]], the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], the Ohio end of the Turnpike and [[Interstate 80]]. The "parkway north" is [[Interstate 279]] connecting to I-79. The "crosstown" is [[Interstate 579]] allowing access to the heart of downtown, the [[Liberty Tunnels]] and the [[PPG Paints Arena]]. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of [[Pennsylvania Route 28]] and [[U.S. Route 22]] also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. [[Interstate 70]], 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped "beltway" with [[Interstate 68]] and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the [[Mon–Fayette Expressway]], [[Pennsylvania Route 576]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 66#Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass|Route 66]] also help traffic flow. The non-expressway [[Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System]] serves navigation in the region.

The city announced plans to make several improvements to the expressways and highways in 2017:
* Interstate 279/Parkway North will have emergency pull-offs and crossover areas constructed in both directions; $87.9&nbsp;million project<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2017/03/28/pittsburgh-traffic-construction-projects-roadwork/stories/201703280113|title=TRAFFIC: Prep work underway for Parkway North construction project|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref>
* Interstate 376 will undergo median crossover work; $66.3&nbsp;million project<ref name=":0" />
* Interstate 79 will be repaved; $16.7&nbsp;million project<ref name=":0" />
* Route 65 will have improvements such as concrete patching, an asphalt overlay, bridge reconstruction, base repairs, drainage and guide rail updates, new signs, retaining wall repairs and pavement-marking installation; $25.3&nbsp;million project<ref name=":0" />

[[File:Steel Plaza Subway Station.JPG|thumb|The [[Steel Plaza (PAT station)|Steel Plaza subway station]]]]

[[Port Authority of Allegheny County]], commonly known as the Port Authority, but sometimes referred to by its former nickname "PAT" or "PAT Transit", is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area (the nation's 20th largest metro area), it is the 11th largest transit agency in the nation and helped the region rank 8th on commuters that use non-car means to work, second to only Chicago in metros outside the Northeast corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/4968949-74/pittsburgh-cities-among#axzz2j7qCvZ3v|title=Pittsburgh ranked eighth among large cities for commuting without cars|work=TribLIVE.com|access-date=June 11, 2015}}</ref> Port Authority runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the [[Monongahela Incline]] [[Funicular]] railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on Mount Washington, a [[Pittsburgh Light Rail|light rail]] system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest [[bus rapid transit|busway]] systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q1bus.pdf|work=American Public Transportation Association|title=Largest Transit Agencies|access-date=July 6, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220849/http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q1bus.pdf|archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> The [[Duquesne Incline]] is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duquesneincline.org/ |title=Duquesne Incline, historic cable car railway serving commuters and tourists since 1877, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |publisher=Incline.pghfree.net |date=October 14, 2008 |access-date=January 5, 2009}}</ref> but accepts Port Authority passes and charges Port Authority fares.

The Bus System lines are [[List of bus routes in Pittsburgh|labeled by number and letter]]. These are the largest portion of Port Authority and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania|Monroeville]], [[McCandless, Pennsylvania|McCandless]], and the borders of [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] and [[Beaver County, Pennsylvania]]. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the "T") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the street car area. The light rail currently{{when|date=July 2019}} runs from [[Heinz Field]] to [[South Hills Village]] and [[Library, Pennsylvania|Library]], while taking commuters through one of two routes; one which serves [[Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania|Castle Shannon]], [[Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Mt. Lebanon]], and [[Beechview (Pittsburgh)|Beechview]], while the other is an express line using railways through [[Overbrook (Pittsburgh)|Overbrook]]

===Freight rail===
[[File:Pittsburgh Penn Station (6962200876).jpg|thumb|Penn Station was built in 1903]]

Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] first opened service between the city and Philadelphia, the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]] entered the city in 1871. In 1865 [[Andrew Carnegie]] opened the [[Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works]] which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the [[Union Railroad (Pittsburgh)|Union Railroad]] in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while [[George Westinghouse]]'s [[Wabtec]] has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.

Pittsburgh is home to one of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s busiest freight corridors, the [[Pittsburgh Line]], and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban [[Conway Yard|Conway Rail Yard]]—originally built in 1889—was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. [[CSX]], the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S. also has [[Pittsburgh Subdivision|major operations]] around Pittsburgh.

===Port===
The [[Port of Pittsburgh Commission|Port of Pittsburgh]] ranks as the [[List of ports in the United States|20th-largest port]] in the United States with almost 34&nbsp;million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked 9th-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/2011%20U%20S%20%20PORT%20RANKINGS%20BY%20CARGO%20TONNAGE.pdf |title=U.S. PORT RANKING BY CARGO VOLUME 2011 : Short Tons : Foreign Trade |website=Aapa.files.cms-plus.com\accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref>
