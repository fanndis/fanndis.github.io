'''Yuriy Ivanovych Yekhanurov''' ({{lang-uk|Юрій Іванович Єхануров}}; born August 23, 1948) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician who was [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] from 2005 to 2006 and [[Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|Minister of Defense]] from 2007 to 2009.

==Background and professional career==

Yekhanurov was born in the village [[Ust-Maysky District|Belkachi]] in the far-north [[Yakut ASSR]], which is currently the [[Sakha Republic]] within the [[Russian Federation]]. His father, Ivan Mikhailvich Yekhanurov is an ethnic [[Buryats|Buryat]], while his mother, Halyna Ivanivna is an ethnic [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]. Between 1955 and 1963 Yuriy Yekhanurov attended a school in the village of Buy, [[Bichursky District]], [[Buryatia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ехануров, Юрий|url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14161221/full/|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]}}</ref> In 1963 he moved to Kyiv, Ukraine, where he has spent most of his life and career. He holds a [[Kandidat|PhD-equivalent degree]] in Economics, is married, and has one son.

Yekhanurov graduated from a construction [[tekhnikum|Technical School]] in 1967, and the [[Kyiv National Economic University]] in 1973. As his first job in 1974, he was assigned as a manager of a [[reinforced concrete]] plant at the state company "Kyivmiskbud-4". Yekhanurov quickly rose through the ranks, moving on to the "Stroydetal'" industrial group from 1985 to 1988. In that year, he was appointed deputy chairman of the Kyiv construction [[:wikt:directorate|directorate]], the "GolovKyivMiskBud".

==Statesman and politician==
[[File:Yuriy-yekhanurov-2008.jpg|thumb|250px| Yuriy Yekhanurov inspecting troops of the 95th Airmobile Brigade on Khreshchatyk in Kyiv on the Independence day 2008.]]
When Ukraine gained independence in 1991, Yekhanurov started working for the [[Legal status and local government of Kyiv|Kyiv municipal government]], overseeing economic reforms. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine in 1993, and later headed the State Property Fund of Ukraine (which coordinated the [[privatisation]]) from 1994 to 1997. Yekhanurov also served for a short time as Minister of Economy in the cabinet of [[Pavlo Lazarenko]] in 1997. He was elected member of the Ukrainian parliament, the [[Verkhovna Rada]], in 1998.

When [[Viktor Yushchenko]] was appointed as Prime Minister of Ukraine in 1999, Yekhanurov joined his cabinet as First Vice Prime Minister. After the ousting of the government in 2001, Yekhanurov joined Yushchenko's [[People's Union Our Ukraine]] and was elected again a member of parliament. In June 2002, he was appointed Head of the State Committee for Industrial Policy and Entrepreneurship.

After the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2005, Yekhanurov was appointed Head of the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] State Administration (i.e. a governor) on April 1, 2005. He was also elected head of the Central Executive Committee of [[People's Union Our Ukraine]] party. <!--(The [[Constitution of Ukraine]] prohibits members of Parliament from holding  office; although deputies have been known to "forget" to submit their resignations on being appointed ministers.)Looks like POV: please point to him and reference, or delete--->

==Prime minister==

On September 8, 2005 Yekhanurov was appointed Acting Prime Minister by President Viktor Yushchenko, after the President had sacked the previous [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]]. He was succeeded by [[Victor Yanukovich]] on August 4, 2006. Yekhanurov's candidacy was hotly contested in [[Verkhovna Rada|parliament]], most notably by former Prime Minister and Yushchenko's ally [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]. His confirmation required two rounds of voting; in the first round on September 20, 2005, Yekhanurov was only three votes short of the 226 needed for approval. On September 22, 2005, after negotiations between President Yushchenko and opposition groups, he was approved by 289 deputies out of 339 present. The [[Communist Party of Ukraine|CPU]] and [[United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine|SDPU(o)]] factions abstained from voting.

Yekhanurov was widely regarded as an experienced administrator, a caretaker rather than a politician. Like Yushchenko, he is a supporter of economic liberalization and privatisation, but opposed "reprivatization" of previously sold companies that were thought to have been privatized illegally under the administration of President [[Leonid Kuchma]].

Yekhanurov government lost a vote of no confidence on January 10, 2006<ref>http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=31268</ref> but stayed in power until the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] two months later.

After the signing of a coalition agreement (June 22, 2006) by the political parties behind the "Orange Revolution" it was agreed that [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] would be restored as Prime Minister of Ukraine after nearly three months of negotiating and political uncertainty.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5101380.stm |work=BBC News | title=Ukraine allies 'agree coalition' | date=June 21, 2006}}</ref> Yulia Tymoshenko election was expected to be only a formality but opposition members ([[Party of Regions]] & [[Communist Party of Ukraine]]) blocked the parliament from Thursday, June 29, 2006<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5127414.stm |work=BBC News | title=Sit-in disrupts Ukraine assembly | date=June 29, 2006}}</ref> till Thursday, July 6, 2006<ref name="pravda">[http://www2.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2006/7/6/5674.htm YANUKOVYCH CALLED OFF THE BLOCKADE / Ukrayinska Pravda<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313093240/http://www2.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2006/7/6/5674.htm |date=March 13, 2007 }}</ref> because they felt they hadn't got enough chairmen in [[parliamentary]] [[committees]]<ref name="pravda"/> Yekhanurov was skeptical about the new government and he wanted the [[Party of Regions]] to be a part of the new government<ref>[http://www2.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2006/6/22/5544.htm Yekhanurov Demitted Speakership Because of Yanukovych / Ukrayinska Pravda<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930220141/http://www2.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2006/6/22/5544.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> He felt that would have been better for the [[Economic stability|stability]] of [[Ukraine]].

==Gas crisis of 2005–2006 and fallout==

Late 2005/January 2006, [[Russia]] and Ukraine had a serious [[Russia–Ukraine gas dispute of 2005–2006|dispute over the import of gas]]. Russia had been charging Ukraine traditionally low prices for gas, but decided to increase them to reflect the market price, breaking the previously signed contract that was to last through 2010. After cutting off the flow of gas to Ukraine for several days, a complicated deal was struck on January 4, 2006. According to President Yushchenko and Yekhanurov, it was a compromise.

Nonetheless, the Ukrainian parliament was not happy with the deal, and passed a vote of no-confidence on January 10, 2006. But President Yuschenko "quickly dismissed the vote as a publicity stunt by the opposition"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/11/international/europe/11ukraine.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1136981940-yDIPIirPl/C6oC5j8p3Y4Q | work=The New York Times | title=Parliament in Ukraine Votes to Scold Government | first=Andrew E. | last=Kramer | date=January 11, 2006}}</ref> Yekhanurov continued to perform his duties until the newly elected [[Verkhovna Rada]] convened and formed a majority in July. He was succeeded by [[Viktor Yanukovych]].

==Minister of Defense of Ukraine==
As part of the President quota of Ministers in the Ukrainian cabinet appointed on December 18, 2007 Yekhanurov became Minister of Defense in the second Tymoshenko cabinet.
