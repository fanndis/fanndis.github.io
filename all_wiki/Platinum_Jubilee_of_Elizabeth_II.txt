Carly Ledbetter, writing in the [[Huffington Post]], suggested that the fact that planning for the [[Platinum jubilee|Platinum Jubilee]] was underway meant that any rumours that Elizabeth was planning to step down when she reached the age of 95 in 2021, in favour of her son [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], were false.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ledbetter |first=Carly |date=13 November 2020 |title=Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee Plans Seemingly Silence Rumors Of Stepping Down |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/queen-elizabeth-step-down-95_n_5fad6b34c5b6cae94043cb84?utm_hp_ref=au-us-entertainment&guccounter=1 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |location=Australia |access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref>

==The Queen’s Green Canopy==
A campaign, known as 'The Queen’s Green Canopy', will be launched in May 2021, ahead of the Jubilee in 2022. People across the United Kindgom are expected to 'Plant a Tree for the Jubilee' to mark the milestone. To help the environment and make local areas greener, people will be urged to create this 'special gift', for the Queen, in her Platinum Jubilee year. In a statement, Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] said, “As we celebrate Her Majesty’s incredible 70 years of service, I encourage everyone to get behind this scheme, and go ‘Plant a Tree for the Jubilee'.”<ref>{{Cite news|date=29 November 2020 |title=Queen’s Platinum Jubilee: Public urged to plant a tree to help mark monarch’s 70-year reign|url=https://www.itv.com/news/2020-11-28/public-urged-to-plant-a-tree-for-the-queens-platinum-jubilee |website=ITV }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Queen’s Green Canopy|url=https://www.coolearth.org/projects/queens-green-canopy/|website=Cool Earth|language=en}}</ref>
