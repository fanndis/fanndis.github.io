'''Duke University School of Law''' (also known as '''Duke Law School''' or '''Duke Law''') is the [[law school]] of [[Duke University]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]], United States. One of Duke's 10 schools and colleges, the School of Law is a constituent academic unit that began, in 1868, as the '''Trinity College School of Law'''.  In 1924, following the renaming of [[History of Duke University|Trinity College]] to Duke University, the school was renamed Duke University School of Law.

==History==
[[Image:DukeLanguages.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Built in 1929, the Languages Building (as it is currently known) was the home of Duke Law from 1930 to 1962]]The date of founding is generally considered to be 1868 or 1924.

However, in 1855 [[History of Duke University#Beginnings: 1841-1886|Trinity College]], the precursor to Duke University, began offering lectures on (but not degrees in) Constitutional and International Law (during this time, Trinity was located in [[Randolph County, North Carolina]]).

In 1865, Trinity's Law Department was officially founded, while 1868 marked the official chartering of the School of Law. After a ten-year hiatus from 1894 to 1904, [[James B. Duke]] and [[Benjamin Newton Duke]] provided the endowment to reopen the school, with Samuel Fox Mordecai as its senior professor (by this time, Trinity College had relocated to Durham, North Carolina).  When Trinity College became part of the newly created Duke University upon the establishment of the Duke Endowment in 1924, the School of Law continued as the Duke University School of Law.  In 1930, the law school moved from the Carr Building on Duke's East Campus to a new location on the main [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] of  West Campus.  During the three years preceding this move, the size of the law library tripled.  Among other well-known alumni, President Richard Nixon graduated from the school in 1937.  In 1963, the school moved to its present location on Science Drive in West Campus.

Law students at Duke University established the first U.S. Chapter of the [[International Criminal Court Student Network]] (ICCSN) in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://law.duke.edu/news/4487/ |title=International Criminal Court Student Network takes hold at Duke |publisher=Duke University |work=Duke Law News |access-date=1 June 2017 |date=1 January 2009}}</ref>

==Facilities==
[[File:Duke Law - panoramio.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The rear entrance to the Law School's present location, on Science Drive]]
The Trinity College School of Law was located in the Carr Building prior to the renaming of Trinity to Duke University in 1924. The Duke University Law School was originally housed in what is now the Languages Building, built in 1929 on Duke's West Campus quad.

The law school is presently located at the corner of Science Drive and Towerview Road and was constructed in the mid-1960s.

The first addition to the law school was completed in 1994, and a dark polished [[granite]] façade was added to the rear exterior of the building, enclosing the interior courtyard.

In 2004, Duke Law School broke ground on a building construction project officially completed in fall 2008. The renovation and addition offers larger and more technologically advanced classrooms, expanded community areas and eating facilities, known as the Star Commons, improved library facilities, and more study options for students.

==Center for the Study of the Public Domain==
''Center for the Study of the Public Domain'' is an university center, aiming to redress the balance of academic study of [[intellectual property]]. In their analysis, academic focus has been too great on the incentives created by these rights, rather than the contribution to creativity from information which is not subject to them and also opposing the fair use,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/about/ |title=About page, Center website |publisher=Law.duke.edu |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref> as they're focusing on [[Copyright Act of 1909]] rather than [[Copyright Act of 1976]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2019/pre-1976/ |title=Public Domain Day 2018 Pre-1976, Center website |publisher=Law.duke.edu |accessdate=2019-10-12}}</ref>

==Law journals==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2020}}
[[Image:CarrBldg.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Trinity College School of Law was located in the Carr Building prior to the renaming of Trinity to [[Duke University]] in 1924]]

Duke Law School publishes eight [[academic journals]] or [[law review]]s, which are, in order of their founding:
*''Law and Contemporary Problems''
*''Duke Law Journal''
*''Alaska Law Review''
*''Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law''
*''Duke Environmental Law & Policy Forum''
*''Duke Journal of Gender Law & Policy''
*''Duke Law & Technology Review''
*''Duke Journal of Constitutional Law & Public Policy''

''Law and Contemporary Problems'' is a quarterly, interdisciplinary, faculty-edited publication of the law school. Unlike traditional law reviews, ''L&CP'' uses a symposium format, generally publishing one symposium per issue on a topic of contemporary concern.  ''L&CP'' hosts an annual conference at the law school featuring the authors of one of the year’s four symposia.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us – Law and Contemporary Problems|url=http://lcp.law.duke.edu/about/|publisher=Duke University School of Law}}</ref> Established in 1933, it is the oldest journal published at the law school.

The ''[[Duke Law Journal]]'' was the first student-edited publication at Duke Law and publishes articles from leading scholars on topics of general legal interest.

Duke publishes the ''[[Alaska Law Review]]'' in a special agreement with the Alaska Bar Association, as the state of Alaska has no law school.

The ''Duke Journal of Gender Law & Policy'' (''DJGLP'') is the preeminent journal for its subject matter in the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The  ''Duke Law & Technology Review'' has been published since 2001 and is devoted to examining the evolving intersection of law and technology.

The ''Duke Journal of Constitutional Law & Public Policy'' was founded by members of the Class of 2006.  Professors [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] and [[Christopher H. Schroeder]] served as the ConLaw journal's inaugural faculty advisors. Mikkelsen was the first [[editor-in-chief]]; the current editor-in-chief is Daniel Browning.<ref>https://djclpp.law.duke.edu/masthead/</ref> The journal intends to fill a gap in [[law journal]] scholarship with a publication that could "cover [[Constitutional law|constitutional developments]] and [[litigation]], and their intersection with [[public policy]]". To ensure that the journal would remain timely, it established a partnership with the Duke Program in Public Law to produce "Supreme Court Commentaries" summarizing and explaining the impact recent cases could have on current issues. The journal publishes continually online and annually in print. It has sponsored speaker series and conferences exploring various issues in constitutional law and public policy.

The law school provides free online access to all of its academic journals, including the complete text of each journal issue dating back to January 1996 in a fully searchable HTML format and in Adobe Acrobat format (PDF).  New issues are posted on the web simultaneously with print publication.

In 2005, the law school was featured in the June 6 unveiling of the Open Access Law Program, an initiative of [[Creative Commons]], for its work in pioneering open access to legal scholarship.

==Joint-degree programs==
The School offers joint-degree programs with the Duke University [[Graduate School of Duke University|Graduate School]], the [[Duke Divinity School]], [[Fuqua School of Business]], the [[Duke University School of Medicine|Medical School]], the [[Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences]], the [[Pratt School of Engineering]], and the [[Sanford School of Public Policy]]; and a JD/LLM dual degree program in International and Comparative Law. Approximately 25 percent of students are enrolled in joint-degree programs.

== Employment ==
According to Duke's 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 93.8 percent of the class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation and not funded by the school&nbsp;– the highest number for any law school in the country.<ref name="Employment Statistics">{{cite web|url=https://law.duke.edu/news/duke-law-no-1-full-time-legal-employment-class-2017/|title=Employment Statistics}}</ref> According to the NLJ, Duke ranks third among all law schools in the percentage of 2017 graduates working in federal clerkships or jobs at firms of 100 or more lawyers, a category NLJ terms "elite jobs". Duke also ranks fourth in federal clerkships.<ref name="Employment Statistics"/>

Law School Transparency gave Duke Law the highest "Employment Score" in the country at 93.8 percent and lowest "Under-Employment Score" of 0.4 percent in 2017.<ref>http://www.lstscorereports.com/national/</ref>

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Duke for the 2015–2016 academic year is $80,937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.duke.edu/admis/tuition/ |title=Tuition and Expenses}}</ref> The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $329,609.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lstscorereports.com/schools/duke/costs/2013/ |title=Duke University Profile}}</ref>
