'''''The New York Review of Books''''' (or '''''NYREV''''' or '''''NYRB''''') is a semi-monthly magazine<ref>Normally, it is published 20 times a year, with only one issue in each of January, July, August and September.

The ''Review'' publishes long-form reviews and essays, often by well-known writers, original poetry, and has letters and personals advertising sections that had attracted critical comment. In 1979 the magazine founded the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', which soon became independent. In 1990 it founded an Italian edition, ''la Rivista dei Libri'', published until 2010. [[Robert B. Silvers]] and [[Barbara Epstein]] edited the paper together from its founding in 1963, until Epstein's death in 2006. From then until his death in 2017, Silvers was the sole editor.<ref name=Wheatcroft>Wheatcroft, Geoffrey.

Gabriel Winslow-Yost and Emily Greenhouse were named co-editors in February 2019. The ''Review'' has a book publishing division, established in 1999, called [[New York Review Books]], which publishes reprints of classics, as well as collections and children's books. Since 2010, the journal has hosted a blog written by its contributors.

The ''Review'' celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013. A [[Martin Scorsese]] film called ''[[The 50 Year Argument]]'' documents the history and influence of the paper over its first half century.

==History and description==

===Early years===
''The New York Review'' was founded by [[Robert B. Silvers]] and [[Barbara Epstein]], together with publisher [[A. Whitney Ellsworth]]<ref>Grimes, William.

They were backed and encouraged by Epstein's husband, [[Jason Epstein]], a vice president at [[Random House]] and editor of [[Vintage Books]], and Hardwick's husband, poet [[Robert Lowell]]. In 1959 Hardwick had published an essay, "The Decline of Book Reviewing", in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'',<ref name=Decline>Hardwick, Elizabeth.

During the [[1962–63 New York City newspaper strike]], when ''[[The New York Times]]'' and several other newspapers suspended publication, Hardwick, Lowell and the Epsteins seized the chance to establish the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined.<ref name=EpsteinBlog>Jason Epstein recounts the story of the initial meeting of the Epsteins, Hardwick and Lowell in [http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/mar/16/strike-start-founding-new-york-review "A Strike and a Start: Founding The New York Review"], ''NYR Blog'', ''The New York Review of Books'', March 16, 2013</ref> Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books.<ref>Harvey, Matt.

''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' later commented that the list of contributors in the first issue "represented a '[[shock and awe]]' demonstration of the intellectual firepower available for deployment in mid-century America, and, almost equally impressive, of the art of editorial networking and jawboning.

Neither time nor space, however, have been spent on books which are trivial in their intentions or venal in their effects, except occasionally to reduce a temporarily inflated reputation or to call attention to a fraud. ...

Silvers said of the editors' philosophy, that "there was no subject we couldn't deal with. And if there was no book [on a subject], we would deal with it anyway. We tried hard to avoid books that were simply competent rehearsals of familiar subjects, and we hoped to find books that would establish something fresh, something original."<ref name=Atlantic50/> In particular, "We felt you had to have a political analysis of the nature of power in America – who had it, who was affected". The editors also shared an "intense admiration for wonderful writers".<ref name=SFC>Benson, Heidi.

As [[Mark Gevisser]] explained: "The essays ... made the book review form not just a report on the book and a judgment of the book, but an essay in itself. And that, I think, startled everyone – that a book review could be exciting in that way, could be provocative in that way."<ref name=Gevisser/> Early issues included articles by such writers as Hardwick, Lowell, Jason Epstein, [[Hannah Arendt]], [[W.

===Since 1979===
During the year-long lockout at ''[[The Times]]'' in London in 1979, the ''Review'' founded a daughter publication, the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.

===Description===
The ''Review'' has been described as a "kind of magazine ... in which the most interesting and qualified minds of our time would discuss current books and issues in depth ... a literary and critical journal based on the assumption that the discussion of important books was itself an indispensable literary activity."<ref>[http://chengdu.usconsulate.gov/periodicals_-_irc_chengdu.html Profile of the ''Review''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318155652/http://chengdu.usconsulate.gov/periodicals_-_irc_chengdu.html |date=2007-03-18 }}, U.S. Consulate General in China</ref><ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/about/ "About the ''Review''"], ''The New York Review of Books'', accessed October 1, 2014</ref> Each issue includes a broad range of subject matter, including "articles on art, science, politics and literature."<ref name=McGrath>McGrath, Charles. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/books/robert-silverss-long-reign-at-the-new-york-review-of-books.html?ref=books "Editor Not Ready to Write an Ending"], ''The New York Times'', March 16, 2012</ref> Early on, the editors decided that the ''Review'' would "be interested in everything ... no subject would be excluded. Someone is writing a piece about Nascar racing for us; another is working on Veronese."<ref name=Cooke2014/> The ''Review'' has focused, however, on political topics; as Silvers commented in 2004: "The pieces we have published by such writers as [[Brian Urquhart]], [[Thomas Powers]], [[Mark Danner]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]] have been reactions to a genuine crisis concerning American destructiveness, American relations with its allies, American protections of its traditions of liberties. ... The aura of patriotic defiance cultivated by the [Bush] Administration, in a fearful atmosphere, had the effect of muffling dissent."<ref>Sherman, Scott.  [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040607/sherman/2 "The Rebirth of the NYRB"], ''[[The Nation]]'', May 20, 2004, p. 2</ref> Silvers told ''The New York Times'': "The great political issues of power and its abuses have always been natural questions for us."<ref name=McGrath />

''[[The Nation]]'' gave its view of the political focus of the ''New York Review of Books'' in 2004:
<blockquote>[T]he Review took a vocal role in contesting the [[Vietnam War]]. ... Around 1970, a sturdy liberalism began to supplant left-wing radicalism at the paper. As [[Philip Nobile]] observed in ... 1974 ... the ''Review'' returned to its roots and became "a literary magazine on the British nineteenth-century model, which would mix politics and literature in a tough but gentlemanly fashion." ...  The publication has always been erudite and authoritative – and because of its analytical rigor and seriousness, frequently essential – but it hasn't always been lively, pungent and readable. ... But the election of [[George W. Bush]], combined with the furies of [[9/11]], jolted the editors. Since 2001, the Review's temperature has risen and its political outlook has sharpened. ...  Prominent [writers for] the Review ... charged into battle not only against the White House but against the lethargic press corps and the "liberal hawk" intellectuals. ... In stark contrast to ''The New Yorker'' ... or ''The New York Times Magazine'' ..., the ''Review'' opposed the [[Iraq War]] in a voice that was remarkably consistent and unified.<ref>Sherman, Scott. [http://www.thenation.com/article/rebirth-nyrb "The Rebirth of the NYRB"], ''The Nation'', May 20, 2004, p. 1, accessed 18 August 2010</ref></blockquote>

Over the years, the ''Review'' has featured reviews and articles by such international writers and intellectuals, in addition to those already noted, as [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Russell Baker]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Harold Bloom]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], Ian Buruma, [[Noam Chomsky]], [[J. M.

Stone]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[John Updike]], [[Derek Walcott]], [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Garry Wills]] and [[Tony Judt]].  According to the [[National Book Foundation]]: "From Mary McCarthy and Edmund Wilson to Gore Vidal and [[Joan Didion]], ''The New York Review of Books'' has consistently employed the liveliest minds in America to think about, write about, and debate books and the issues they raise."<ref name=National />

The ''Review'' also devotes space in most issues to poetry, and has featured the work of such poets as [[Robert Lowell]], [[John Berryman]], [[Ted Hughes]], [[John Ashbery]], [[Richard Wilbur]], [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Octavio Paz]], and [[Czeslaw Milosz]].<ref>[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/5201/New-York-Review-Books.html The New York Review of Books], jrank.org, accessed 20 January 2010</ref> For writers, the "depth [of the articles], and the quality of the people writing for it, has made a ''Review'' byline a résumé definer. If one wishes to be thought of as a certain type of writer – of heft, style and a certain gravitas – a ''Review'' byline is pretty much the gold standard."<ref name=Tucker>Tucker, Neely. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-new-york-review-of-books-turns-50/2013/11/06/5e031f64-4703-11e3-a196-3544a03c2351_story.html "''The New York Review of Books turns 50''"], ''The Washington Post'', November 6, 2013</ref> In editing a piece, Silvers said that he asked himself "if [the point in any sentence could] be clearer, while also respecting the writer’s voice and tone. You have to listen carefully to the tone of the writer’s prose and try to adapt to it, but only up to a point. [No change was made without the writers' permission.] ... Writers deserve the final word about their prose."<ref name=DannerNYMag2013/>

In addition to domestic matters, the ''Review'' covers issues of international concern.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Silvers, Robert B. |editor2=Barbara Epstein |editor3=Rea S.

[M]uch of what we've published has come from some of the most respected and brilliant Israeli writers ... [[Amos Elon]], [[Avishai Margalit]], [[David Grossman]], [[David Dean Shulman|David Shulman]], among them.  What emerges from them is a sense that occupying land and people year after year can only lead to a sad and bad result."<ref name=DannerNYMag2013/>

Caricaturist [[David Levine]] illustrated ''The New York Review of Books'' from 1963 to 2007, giving the paper a distinctive visual image.<ref name=Observer/> Levine died in 2009.<ref name=Levineobit/> [[John Updike]], whom Levine drew many times, wrote: "Besides offering us the delight of recognition, his drawings comfort us, in an exacerbated and potentially desperate age, with the sense of a watching presence, an eye informed by an intelligence that has not panicked, a comic art ready to encapsulate the latest apparitions of publicity as well as those historical devils who haunt our unease."<ref name=gallery/> Levine contributed more than 3,800 pen-and-ink caricatures of famous writers, artists and politicians for the publication.<ref name=gallery>[http://www.nybooks.com/gallery/ "David Levine Gallery,"] ''New York Review of Books'', accessed April 15, 2009</ref><ref>Margolick, David.

''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the "lively literary disputes" conducted in the 'letters to the editor' column of the ''Review'' as "the closest thing the intellectual world has to bare-knuckle boxing".<ref name=Postobit/> In addition to reviews, interviews and articles, the paper features extensive advertising from publishers promoting newly published books. It also includes a popular "personals" section that "share[s] a cultivated writing style" with its articles.<ref name=Mohan>Mohan, Jake.

Several of the magazine's editorial assistants have become prominent in journalism, academia and literature, including [[Jean Strouse]], [[Deborah Eisenberg]], [[Mark Danner]] and [[A. O.

So much of [business today] is about people doing things quickly, with haste. One of the first things to go out the window is a type of graciousness. ... There’s a whole sort of rhythm and tone of how they deal with people. I’m sure it was always rare. But it feels incredibly precious now."<ref name=Tucker/>

The ''Review'' has published, since 2009, the ''NYR Daily'', which focuses on the news.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/page/244 | title=NYR Daily | publisher=The New York Review of Books | accessdate=March 15, 2019}}</ref>

==Critical reaction==
''The Washington Post'' calls the ''Review'' "a journal of ideas that has helped define intellectual discourse in the English-speaking world for the past four decades. ... By publishing long, thoughtful articles on politics, books and culture, [the editors] defied trends toward glibness, superficiality and the cult of celebrity".<ref name=Postobit/> Similarly, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' praised the paper as "one of the few venues in American life that takes ideas seriously. And it pays readers the ultimate compliment of assuming that we do too."<ref>[[Keller, Julia]]. [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-06-26/features/0606260216_1_barbara-epstein-new-york-review-erudition "Farewell to a champion of ideas"], ''Chicago Tribune'', June 26, 2006, accessed October 1, 2014</ref> In a 2006 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine feature, [[James Atlas]] stated: "It's an eclectic but impressive mix [of articles] that has made ''The New York Review of Books'' the premier journal of the American intellectual elite".<ref name=NYmag>[[Atlas, James]].  [http://nymag.com/news/media/21344/index.html "The Ma and Pa of the Intelligentsia"], ''New York'', September 18, 2006</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' commented in 2011 that the ''Review'' is written with "a freshness of perspective", and "much of it shapes our most sophisticated public discourse."<ref>[[Osnos, Peter]]. [https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/12/the-phenomenal-new-york-review-of-books/249912/ "The Phenomenal ''New York Review of Books''], ''The Atlantic'', December 13, 2011</ref> In celebrating the 35th birthday of the ''Review'' in 1998, ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, "The N.Y.R. gives off rogue intimations of being fun to put out. It hasn't lost its sneaky nip of mischief".<ref>[[Wolcott, James]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/04/bookend/bookend.html "35 Years of Fireworks"], ''The New York Times'', October 4, 1998</ref>

In 2008, Britain's ''[[The Guardian]]'' deemed the ''Review'' "scholarly without being pedantic, scrupulous without being dry".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/25/new-york-review-books "In praise of ... ''New York Review of Books''"], Editorial, ''The Guardian'', October 25, 2008, p. 34</ref> The same newspaper wrote in 2004: 
<blockquote>The ... issues of the ''Review'' to date provide a history of the cultural life of the east coast since 1963.  It manages to be ... serious with a fierce democratic edge. ... It is one of the last places in the English-speaking world that will publish long essays ... and possibly the very last to combine academic rigour – even the letters to the editor are footnoted – with great clarity of language.<ref name=Brown/></blockquote> In ''New York'' magazine, in February 2011, [[Oliver Sacks]] stated that the ''Review'' is "one of the great institutions of intellectual life here or anywhere."<ref>Salisbury, Vanita. [http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/02/oliver_sachs_has_luxuriant_eyelashes.html "Oliver Sacks Has Luxuriant Eyelashes"]. ''New York'' magazine, February 9, 2011</ref> In 2012, ''The New York Times'' described the ''Review'' as "elegant, well mannered, immensely learned, a little formal at times, obsessive about clarity and factual correctness and passionately interested in human rights and the way governments violate them."<ref name=McGrath/>

Known throughout its history as a left-liberal journal, what [[Tom Wolfe]] called "the chief theoretical organ of [[radical chic]]",<ref name=Wolfe>Wolfe, Tom. [http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index16.html "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's"], ''New York'', June 8, 1970, accessed April 20, 2009</ref> the ''Review'' has, perhaps, had its most effective voice in wartime.  According to a 2004 feature in ''[[The Nation]]'',
<blockquote>One suspects they yearn for the day when they can return to their normal publishing routine – that gentlemanly [[pastiche]] of philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, East European politics, literary fiction – unencumbered by political duties of a confrontational or oppositional nature. That day has not yet arrived. If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did not, and that ''The New York Review of Books'' ... was there when we needed it most.<ref>Sherman, Scott.  [https://www.thenation.com/article/rebirth-nyrb/ "The Rebirth of the NYRB"], ''[[The Nation]]'', May 20, 2004, p. 5</ref></blockquote>

Sometimes accused of insularity, the ''Review'' has been called "The New York Review of Each Other's Books".<ref>Bloom, Alexander. ''Prodigal Sons: The New York Intellectuals and Their World'', Oxford University Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-19-505177-7}}; p. 327</ref> [[Philip Nobile]] expressed a mordant criticism along these lines in his book ''Intellectual Skywriting: Literary Politics and the New York Review of Books''.<ref name=NYmag/> ''The Guardian'' characterized such accusations as "sour grapes".<ref name=Brown/> [[Phillip Lopate]] commented, in 2017, that Silvers "regarded his contributors as worthy authors, and so why punish them by neglecting their latest work?".<ref name=Lopate>[[Phillip Lopate|Lopate, Philip]]. [https://theamericanscholar.org/robert-silvers/# "Robert Silvers: ''In memoriam''"], ''[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]]'', March 31, 2017</ref> In 2008, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' wrote, "the pages of the 45th anniversary issue, in fact, reveal the actuality of [the paper's] willfully panoramic view".<ref name=SFC/>

''The Washington Post'' called the 2013 50th Anniversary issue "gaudy with intellectual firepower. Four Nobel Laureates have bylines. U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] muses on reading Proust. There's the transcript of a long-lost lecture by [[T. S. Eliot]]."<ref name=Tucker/> In 2014, [[Rachel Cooke]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' of a recent issue: "The offer of such an embarrassment of riches is wholly amazing in a world where print journalism increasingly operates in the most threadbare of circumstances".<ref name=Cooke2014/> ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' magazine echoed [[Zoë Heller]]'s words about the ''Review'': "I like it because it educates me."<ref>Reidy, Maurice Timothy. [http://americamagazine.org/issue/minds-work "Minds at Work"], ''America'' magazine, September 15, 2014</ref> Lopate adds that the ''Review'' "was and is the standard bearer for American intellectual life: a unique repository of thoughtful discourse, unrepentantly highbrow, in a culture increasingly given to dumbing down."<ref name=Lopate/> [[Timothy Noah]] of ''[[Politico]]'' called it "the country’s best and most influential literary journal. ... It's hard to imagine that Hardwick ... would complain today that book reviewing is too polite."<ref>[[Noah, Timothy]].

== Book-publishing arm ==
The book-publishing arm of the ''Review'' is [[New York Review Books]]. Established in 1999, it has several imprints: New York Review Books, NYRB Classics, The New York Review Children's Collection, New York Review Comics, NYRB Poets, NYRB Lit and the Calligrams. NYRB Collections publishes collections of articles from frequent ''Review'' contributors.<ref>[https://www.nyrb.com/pages/about New York Review Books: About Us], ''The New York Review of Books'', accessed March 9, 2019</ref> The Classics imprint reissues books that have gone out of print in the US, as well as translations of [[classic book]]s. It has been called "a marvellous literary imprint ... that has put hundreds of wonderful books back on our shelves."<ref name=Cooke2014/>

== Archives ==
The [[New York Public Library]] purchased the NYRB archives in 2015.<ref>Gajanan, Mahita.
