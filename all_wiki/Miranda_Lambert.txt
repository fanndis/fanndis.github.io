==Early life==
Miranda Leigh Lambert was born November 10, 1983,<ref name="dob"/> to Rick and Bev (née Hughes) Lambert in [[Longview, Texas]],<ref name="Miranda Lambert Biography"/> and was raised in [[Lindale, Texas]].  She was named after her great-grandmother, Lucy Miranda.<ref name="usmagazine.com">''Us Weekly'', March 30, 2011, "[http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-miranda-lambert-2011303 25 Things You Don't Know About Me: Miranda Lambert]."

Her parents met while Bev was attending camp at [[Southern Methodist University]] and Rick was an on-campus undercover narcotics officer, and they got together a few years later.  Rick is a former [[Dallas]] police officer who played in a country-rock group called Contraband in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/14/singles-going-steady-2|title=Singles Going Steady|date=November 14, 2005|work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Rick and Bev later became [[private detectives]] and even worked on the high-profile case of the impeachment of President [[Bill Clinton]].

After the downturn, things got better and her parents began a faith-based ministry and offered their home as a shelter for the victims of domestic violence and their children.  Miranda has said that this experience fueled her music and that her song "Gunpowder & Lead" is a reflection of that.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/28/miranda-lambert-country-renegade-interview |title=Miranda Lambert: 'Im not just that girl with fire in my head' |date=March 28, 2016 |access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref>
