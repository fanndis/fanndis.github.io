== History ==
[[File:CO-Denver 1916 1 Ref.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, as it appeared around 1916.]]
Congress created a new judicial circuit in 1929 to accommodate the increased caseload in the federal courts. Between 1866 and 1912, twelve new states had entered the Union and been incorporated into the Eighth and Ninth Circuits. The Eighth Circuit encompassed 13 states and had become the largest in the nation.<ref name="FJC.gov">Establishment of the Tenth Judicial Circuit: "An Act To amend sections 116, 118, 126 of the Judicial Code, as amended, to divide the eighth judicial circuit of the United States, and to create a tenth judicial circuit." Federal Judiciary History. [http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/16a_bdy FJC.gov]. Retrieved September 24, 2009.</ref>

Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] suggested the reorganization of the Eighth Circuit Court in response to widespread opposition in 1928 to a proposal to reorganize the nation's entire circuit structure. The original plan had sprung from an [[American Bar Association]] committee in 1925 and would have changed the composition of all but two circuits.<ref name="FJC.gov"/>

The House of Representatives considered two proposals to divide the existing Eighth Circuit. A bill by Representative [[Walter Newton]] would separate the circuit's eastern and western states. An alternate proposal divided the northern from the southern states. With the judges and bar of the existing Eighth Circuit for Newton's bill and little opposition to dividing the circuit, lawmakers focused on providing for more judgeships and meeting places of the circuit courts of appeals in their deliberations.<ref name="FJC.gov"/>

Congress passed a statute that placed [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]] in the Eighth Circuit and created a Tenth Circuit that included [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]], [[Kansas]], and [[Oklahoma]]. Three additional judgeships were authorized and the sitting circuit judges were reassigned according to their residence. The Tenth Circuit was assigned a total of four judgeships.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/16a_bdy| title=Tenth Circuit Act of 1929| work=Official website of the Federal Judicial Center| accessdate=October 20, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060926090047/http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/16a_bdy <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 26, 2006}}</ref>
