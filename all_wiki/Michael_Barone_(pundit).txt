He is best known as the principal author of ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'', a highly detailed reference work on Congress and state politics; it has been published biennially by ''[[National Journal]]'' since 1972. The ''Almanac'' has been called "definitive and essential for anyone writing seriously about campaigns and Congress."<ref name=Hack>[[Alex Pareene|Pareene, Alex]] (2010-11-23) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/11/23/hack_list_16/index.html War Room's Hack Thirty – No. 16: Michael Barone], ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref> Barone is also a regular commentator on United States elections and political trends for the [[Fox News Channel]].

He received a bachelor's degree from [[Harvard College]] in 1966 and a law degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1969, where he was an editor of the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.  After law school he clerked for Judge [[Wade H. McCree]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]].  Although he has been conservative as an adult, in the 1960s he worked as an intern for [[Jerome Cavanagh]], the Democratic mayor of Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/barone/2007/12/21/mitt-romney-out-of-the-50s.html#read_more|title="Mitt Romney: Out of the '50s", Michael Barone (usnews.com)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> He was also a supporter of [[George McGovern]] in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/barone/2008/10/9/the-race-isnt-necessarily-over-for-barack-obama-and-john-mccain.html |title=The Race Isn't Necessarily Over for Barack Obama and John McCain – Michael Barone |publisher=usnews.com |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2010-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422214255/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/barone/2008/10/9/the-race-isnt-necessarily-over-for-barack-obama-and-john-mccain.html |archive-date=2009-04-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1975 Barone married [[Joan Shorenstein]]. She died at age 38 in 1985 after a 10-year battle with cancer. In 2011 he married the Brazilian novelist and diplomat [[Alexandre Vidal Porto]], in New York City.

== Political analyst ==
Barone is a senior political analyst for the ''[[Washington Examiner]]'', where he writes a twice weekly column and contributes to their blog. His column is nationally syndicated by [[Creators Syndicate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/michael-barone/partisan-divide-eggheads-get-what-they-wished-for.html|title=Partisan Divide: Eggheads Get What They Wished For , by Michael Barone|date=2 August 2012|publisher=}}</ref> He is also a frequent contributor during [[Fox News Channel]]'s election coverage.  His political views are generally [[Conservatism|conservative]].  Barone has said he is not [[religious]], although he is sympathetic to and respectful of [[social conservatism|social conservatives]].

His commentary has been concerned with the topic of [[immigration]]. Perhaps partly as a result of being a descendant of [[Italian-American|Italian immigrants]], Barone takes an optimistic view of contemporary immigration into the US. He says that [[Hispanic]] immigration has parallels to the Italian experience and that, given the right circumstances, current and future Hispanic and other immigrants can become [[Americanization|Americanized]] and [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilated]], just as the Italians were.

In November 2008, Barone said journalists criticized Republican vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] because "she did not abort her [[Down syndrome]] baby." Barone later said he was "attempting to be humorous and ... went over the line."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15527.html |title=Barone: Media wanted Palin abortion – Mike Allen and Andy Barr |publisher=Politico |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref>

Barone has been covering the 2020 presidential election through numerous opinion pieces published in the Washington Examiner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/author/michael-barone/|title=Michael Barone {{!}} AEI Scholar|website=AEI|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> Barone argues in 2020 that [[United States presidential nominating convention|national presidential nominating conventions]] are no longer needed or useful. He welcomes their replacement by virtual conventions with minimal participation. They were useful before the advent of television in 1952, he says: 
: National conventions no longer serve their original purpose, or the uses the parties and the press have made of them in the past half-century. The national conventions were, for their first 130 years, a unique communications medium. They were the only place and time where party politicians could communicate frankly and bargain personally. They were the only place where people could discover which candidates had genuine support and which just gave lip service.<ref>Michael Barone, [https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/political_commentary/commentary_by_michael_barone/goodbye_after_nearly_two_centuries_to_the_national_conventions?utm_campaign=RR07242020DN&utm_source=criticalimpact&utm_medium=email "Goodbye, After Nearly Two Centuries, to the National Conventions" ''Rasmussen Reports'' July 24, 2020]</ref>
