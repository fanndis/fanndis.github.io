People may remain single for a variety of reasons, including (but not limited to):

* Financial duress<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/record-share-of-americans-have-never-married/|title=Record Share of Americans Have Never Married {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2014-09-24|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>

* Lack of suitable partners<ref name="auto3"/>
* Changes in perceptions of the necessity of marriage<ref name="auto3"/>
* Dedication to religions orders that do not allow for marriage<ref name="auto2"/>

*The increasing trend of marrying later in life and [[cohabitation]]<ref name="auto3"/>

Some single people regard and appreciate [[solitude]] as an opportunity. Some people stay single by choice. In addition to choosing singleness as a preferential option, there are also those who choose not to marry for religious reasons. These religious traditions include:

* The Christian monastics cultures of Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Coptism
* The specific Buddhist monastic traditions<ref>{{Citation|last=Weckman|first=George|title=Monasticism: An Overview|date=2005|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX3424502096/GVRL?u=nclivewfuy&sid=GVRL&xid=696954c8|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|volume=9|pages=6121–6126|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Lindsay|edition=2nd.|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>

==Single culture in specific countries==
===United States===
According to the [[United States Bureau of the Census]], the fastest-growing household type since the 1980s has been the single person. Previously both socially uncommon and unaccepted due to perceived roles, public awareness, modern socioeconomic factors and increasingly available popular and lengthier education and careers have made the single lifestyle a viable option for many Americans, especially after the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Blackwell companion to the sociology of families |first=Jacqueline L. |last=Scott |first2=Judith |last2=Treas |first3=Martin |last3=Richards |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-22158-6 |pages=377–378}}</ref>

According to the United States Bureau of the Census, in 2016 single adults counted for over 45% of the US population. Sixty-Five Percent of this group had never been married.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2017/single-americans-week.html|title=Unmarried and Single Americans Week: Sept. 17-23, 2017|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> In 2014, [[Pew Research Center]] notes that the highest percentage of never married adults between White, Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans were Black Americans. The same study also projected that about 25% of millennials may not get married.<ref name="auto3"/>

===United Kingdom===
Similar to the United States, single-person households have been seen to be increasingly popular in the [[United Kingdom]]. In the 2000s, studies found that more citizens were seen to be valuing their career over personal relationships. The increase in single-person households was also partly attributed to the high [[self-esteem]] it can offer to some people.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article550955.ece "Single living is the new way to find happiness"]. ''Times Online''. 3 August 2005. Retrieved 2 June 2010.</ref>

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], it is not uncommon for citizens to choose to remain single. This has been illustrated with many public figures and celebrities. Women typically value friendships over romantic relationships; many continue to have jobs and marry later, or forego marriage completely.<ref>{{cite book|last = Schefft|first= J|title = Better Single Than Sorry|url = https://archive.org/details/bettersinglethan00sche_725|url-access = limited|publisher= Harper Collins|year= 2007|page= [https://archive.org/details/bettersinglethan00sche_725/page/n19 12]}}</ref>

However, people in Japan who do wish to date have reported that it is difficult to find the time to do so due to being [[overwork|overworked]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Semuels |first= Alana |date= 20 July 2017 |title= The Mystery of Why Japanese People Are Having So Few Babies |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/japan-mystery-low-birth-rate/534291/ |work= The Atlantic |access-date= 27 June 2019}}</ref>

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]] an unofficial holiday called [[Black Day (South Korea)|Black Day]] is observed on 14 April each year by and for single people. Singles who did not receive gifts on [[Valentine's Day]] or [[White Day]] meet dressed in black and eat [[jajangmyeon]], noodles covered in black bean paste.

==Terminology==
Terminology for singleness vary. The variation usually based on gender, language, and country. Generally singles can be categorized by the following terms: never married, separated, divorced, and widowed.

=== English ===
Terms used to describe single men are seldom used, and carry positive connotations. Single men are often simply referred to as ''[[bachelor]]s''.

The English language has more terms for single, unwed women. These terms typically carry a negative connotation. Single women are sometimes called ''[[bachelorette]]s'', especially in festive contexts in [[American English]]. However, the historic term for unwed women is [[spinster]]. The connotations of the word ''spinster'' have changed so much over time that it is now considered a derogatory term. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] says in its usage notes for the word:

:The development of the word spinster is a good example of the way in which a word acquires strong connotations to the extent that it can no longer be used in a neutral sense. From the 17th century the word was appended to names as the official legal description of an unmarried woman: Elizabeth Harris of London, Spinster. This type of use survives today in some legal and religious contexts. In modern everyday English, however, spinster cannot be used to mean simply ‘unmarried woman’; it is now always a derogatory term, referring or alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/spinster|title=spinster - definition of spinster in English - Oxford Dictionaries}}</ref>

Though spinster has a long history of being negative, there are some authors, such as [[Kate Bolick|Katie Bolick]], that are trying to change the word's connotation into something positive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spinster : making a life of one's own|last=Bolick, Kate|isbn=9780385347136|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=902726565|year=2015|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spinstermakingli0000boli}}</ref> Additionally, the phrase ''[[Spinster|Old Maid]]'' is used to describe an unmarried women.

===French===
''[[Catherinette]]'' was a traditional [[France|French]] label for girls of 25 years old who were still unmarried by the Feast of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]].

=== Chinese ===
The term [[sheng nu]] is used to describe unmarried women who are in mid to late twenties in China and East Asia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lubowiecki-Vikuk |first=AP |title=Determinants of recreational and tourism activity among single men and women from the Wielkopolska Province |publisher=AWF Poznan |year=2011 |pages=12–17}}</ref>

=== Japanese ===
In Japan, men that have no interest in getting married are called Sōshoku(-kei) danshi (草食(系)男子 ) or [[Herbivore men]].  This term also describes as young men who have lost their "manliness".

==Relationship status and health==
A person's relationship status can have an effect on their health. People have different perspectives on the ways in which relationship status influences health.

According to researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, "Being single is not good for your health and lifespan."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Healthday/story?id=4507568.ece |title = Single, Free, but Not So Healthy?}}</ref> Being single makes it easier for people to lose connection to others. Lack of social relationships will cause people to gradually lose self-identity, support and purpose<ref>[http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/52/2/145 " Mechanisms Linking Social Ties and Support to Physical and Mental Health"]. |first= Peggy A. |last= Thoits | ''Sage Journals”.</ref> according to psychology professor Peggy A. Thoits at Indiana University. In a recent{{when|date=July 2019}} survey "There are 32 percent higher rates of early death in single men compared to married men. While single women have 23 percent higher rates of death compared to married women"<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/18/single-death-early-married_n_930465.html.ece " Being Single Could Mean An Earlier Death: Study"]. |first= Amanda |last= Chan | ''Huffpost Healthy Living''. 18 August 2011.</ref> report by the American Journals of Epidemiology Study. Researchers explained that single people experience more emotional factors that cause them to die sooner. Regarding a recent{{when|date=July 2019}} Harvard study "Socially isolated men have an 82 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease".<ref name="auto">[http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mens_Health_Watch/2010/July/marriage-and-mens-health.ece " Marriage and men's health"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912045442/http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mens_Health_Watch/2010/July/marriage-and-mens-health.ece |date=2014-09-12 }}. ''Harvard Health Publications''. 10 July 2011.</ref> A peer-reviewed study also suggests that single people have a higher mortality rate after major surgery than married couples.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Idler |first1= Ellen |last2= Bouilfard |first2= David |last3=Contrada |first3=Richard |date= 1 March 2012 |title= Mending Broken Hearts: Marriage and Survival Following Cardiac Surgery |journal= Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume= 53 |issue= 1 |pages= 33–49|doi= 10.1177/0022146511432342|pmid= 22382719 }}</ref>

A study that compared attachment patterns of long-term singles and coupled adults found that compared to coupled participants single people reported "higher levels of loneliness, depression, anxiety and sexual dissatisfaction".<ref>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-shrink-tank/200902/being-single-aint-all-its-cracked-be Being single ain't all it's cracked up to be]. ''Psychology Today''. Author - Jared DeFife. Published 20 February 2009. Retrieved 7 September 2018.</ref> 

People who support being single have different opinions on it, pointing out that not all marriages are created equally. Healthy people, with psychological well being, have happy relationships with their partners. In contrast, unhappy marriages will have the opposite effect, “A bad marriage can make a person feel more isolated than being single”<ref name="auto1">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/health-benefits-of-being-single_n_2678357.html.ece " Health Benefits Of Being Single"].  ''Huffpost Healthy Living''. 12 February 2013.</ref> according to a sociologist professor Eric Klinenber at New York University. Another study of more than 10,000 adults found that married couples were more likely to gain weight during their process of romantic ventures than single people.<ref name="auto"/> 
In other words, married couples have a higher risk of weight gain that may be large enough to pose a health risk,<ref name="auto1"/> report by a professor of sociology Zhenchao Qian, at Ohio State University.

==Targeting==
[[Dating services]] are an especially targeted and advertised service for singles.<ref>Jarice Hanson. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6j0GhI1MrdkC&pg=PA81 ''24/7: how cell phones and the Internet change the way we live, work, and play''], p. 81</ref> The growth of the dating services and dating events industry has been so drastic that the phrase "dating–industrial complex" (reminiscent of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s term "[[military industrial complex]]") has been coined to capture the amount of money and manpower devoted to dating services for singles.<ref>Jane Ganahl. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/03/28/LVGJ65Q2PQ1.DTL "The downside of cyber-romance"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 28 March 2004</ref><ref>Roy S. Gutterman. [http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/15731/ "There's a Science (and Terminology) to the Process of Getting Rejected"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621071505/http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/15731/ |date=2008-06-21 }}, ''The (Philadelphia) Jewish Exponent'', 3 April 2008</ref>

[[Singles event]]s have been an area of particular growth in singles-related commerce.<ref>Larry Glanz and Robert H. Phillips. (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0FYJaDOFUPUC&pg=PA59&dq=%22singles+events%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22singles%20events%22&f=false ''Guy Gets Girl, Girl Gets Guy: Where to Find Romance and What to Say When You Find It''], p. 59</ref> Many events are aimed at singles of particular affiliations, interest, or religions.<ref>Monica B. Morris. (2005) [https://archive.org/details/fallinginloveaga00morr/page/80 ''Falling in love again: the mature woman's guide to finding romantic fulfillment''], p. 80</ref> Some of the most strongly attended such events are the [[Christmas Eve]] party targeted at young Jewish singles in major cities in North America, particularly the [[Matzo Ball]] and its big city competitors.<ref>Jessica Gresko, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/contentr/article/2006/12/23/AR2006122300971.html ''Dec. 24 Becomes Party Night for Jewish Singles''], Associated Press (Washington Post), 24 December 2006</ref> A variety of other religious organizations' singles events are also very popular. However, dating via religious-sponsored singles events has also been criticized for fostering invasion of daters' privacy and undue expectations.<ref>William July, II. (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uMI_UItS4z0C&pg=PA113 ''Confessions of an ex-bachelor''], p. 113</ref>

Also there is a [[Single supplement|Single Supplement]] that adds extra fees to those traveling alone.

In some countries, particular laws may directly or indirectly disadvantage single persons. In the [[United States]], for example, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] [[Social Security (United States)#WIDOWBENEFITS|widow(er) benefits]] are only available to those persons who have been previously married, and single people in the United States pay more income taxes than married people.  In many countries tour and holiday operators impose a penalty (often as much as 100%) on persons who travel alone.

Older singles are also a targeted market, for much the same reasons.  They are typically divorcees or widowed, perhaps reconciled to being single for the rest of their lives, and looking to make the most of what remains to them.  Their children, if any, will typically be financially independent. They may, or may not, be looking for another relationship. They also are heavily targeted by marketers.  There is a whole industry dedicated to making unsolicited telephone calls to this group in the hope of exploiting the ones who are unable to distinguish between the honest and the dishonest.
