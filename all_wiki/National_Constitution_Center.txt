The '''National Constitution Center''' is a nonprofit institution devoted to the [[Constitution of the United States]]. On [[Independence Mall (Philadelphia)|Independence Mall]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the center is an interactive museum and a national town hall for constitutional dialogue, hosting government leaders, journalists, scholars, and celebrities for public discussions (including presidential debates). The center offers civic learning resources onsite and online. It does not house the original Constitution, which is stored at the [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

The groundbreaking ceremony (attended by President [[Bill Clinton]])<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theconstitutional.com/about/abou-enable.html| title = The Constitutional Walking Tour of Philadelphia| accessdate = 27 March 2013 }}</ref> was held on September 17, 2000, the 213th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. The center opened on July 4, 2003,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/travel/travel-advisory-constitution-center-to-open-in-philadelphia.html | title=TRAVEL ADVISORY; Constitution Center To Open in Philadelphia – New York Times | accessdate = 28 March 2013 | work=The New York Times | date=22 June 2003}}</ref> joining other historic sites and attractions in what has been called "America's most historic square mile"<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence Visitor Center|url=http://phlvisitorcenter.com/attraction/independence-visitor-center|work=Independence Visitor Center|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> because of its proximity to [[Independence Hall]] and the [[Liberty Bell]].

==Background==

The center was created by the Constitution Heritage Act.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theconstitutional.com/about/abou-enable.html | title = The Constitutional Walking Tour of Philadelphia | accessdate = 28 March 2013}}</ref> Approved on September 16, 1988 and signed by President Ronald Reagan,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/iconog/uphp/indnoll2/linked%20pages/INHP%20HISTORY.htm | title=Untitled Document | accessdate=28 March 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128184221/http://www.brynmawr.edu/iconog/uphp/indnoll2/linked%20pages/INHP%20HISTORY.htm | archive-date=2012-11-28 | url-status=dead }}</ref> the act defined the National Constitution Center as "within or in close proximity to the Independence National Historical Park. The Center shall disseminate information about the United States Constitution on a non-partisan basis in order to increase the awareness and understanding of the Constitution among the American people."<ref>{{cite web |title=H.R. 1939 (100th): Constitution Heritage Act of 1988 |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/100/hr1939/text/enr |website=Gov Track |publisher=www.govtrack.us |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref> The center is at 525 Arch Street, an address chosen because May 25 (5/25) was the date that the [[Timeline of drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution|Constitutional Convention began]] in Philadelphia.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The architectural firm of [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] designed the center,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pcf-p.com/a/p/9810/r0.html | title = Pei Cobb Freed & Partners | accessdate = 28 March 2013}}</ref> and [[Leslie E. Robertson]] Associates were the structural engineers for the project. Witold Rybczynski of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Quiet but assertive, respectful of its surroundings, considerate of its public, this building is destined to take its place among the nation's leading public monuments."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/08/arts/architecture-review-more-perfect-union-of-function-and-form.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title = ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; More Perfect Union Of Function And Form – New York Times | accessdate = 28 March 2013 | work=The New York Times | first=Witold | last=Rybczynski | date=8 July 2003}}</ref>

[[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]] designed the center's visitor experience and exhibition hall.  The public space is {{convert|160000|sqft|m2}}, including galleries. The center has {{convert|75785|sqft|m2}} of exhibit space. The center is made of American products, including {{convert|85000|sqft|m2}} of Indiana limestone, 2.6 million pounds of steel, and a half-million cubic feet of concrete.  Construction of the center was overseen by project manager [[Hill International]].
