'''Trinity Washington University''' is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[university]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].  There are five schools within the university; the undergraduate College of Arts & Sciences maintains its original status as a [[Liberal arts college|liberal arts]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]], while men attend Trinity's other schools at both the graduate and undergraduate level.<ref>https://discover.trinitydc.edu/all-programs</ref>

==History==
Trinity College was founded by the [[Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur]] in 1897 as the nation's first Catholic liberal arts college for women.

For more than 70 years, Trinity educated middle-class Catholic women, who were underrepresented in America's colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Video-How-an-Elite-Women-s/228533|title=Video: How an Elite Women's College Lost Its Base and Found Its Mission - The Chronicle of Higher Education|publisher=Chronicle.com|date=2015-03-25|accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref> (For more background on women's higher education, see [[Women's colleges in the United States#Origins and types|Origins and types of Women's colleges in the United States]].) 

When many all-male colleges became co-ed, Trinity's full-time enrollment dropped - from 1,000 in 1969 to 300 in 1989. The school's 12th president, [[Religious sisters|Sister]] Donna Jurick, responded in the early 1980s by opening a weekend college for working women from the District of Columbia, a racially diverse population the school had previously not served. The first such program in Washington, it became very popular; within three years, it had more students than the undergraduate program.<ref name="Devoted"/>

Under [[Patricia McGuire]], a Trinity alumna, who became president of the college in 1989, Trinity became a multifaceted university that reached out to the Black and Hispanic women of Washington. McGuire split the college into three schools: the historic women's college became the College of Arts and Sciences; the higher-revenue teacher college became the School of Education; and the continuing education classes were folded into a School of Professional Studies. Trinity began recruiting at D.C. high schools. She expanded the professional schools, whose combined enrollment rose from 639 in 1989 to 974 in 1999. By the school's 1997 centennial, it had become the private college of choice for the women of D.C. public schools.<ref name="Devoted">{{cite news|title=The Devoted: She spent her life transforming Trinity.
