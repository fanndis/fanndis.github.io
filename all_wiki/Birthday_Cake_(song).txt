"'''Birthday Cake'''" is a song by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]], from her sixth studio album, ''[[Talk That Talk (Rihanna album)|Talk That Talk]]'' (2011). After it leaked onto the internet, fans expressed interest in the track being included on ''Talk That Talk'', but it was later revealed that the 1:18 (one minute, 18 seconds) length that leaked was in fact the final cut and was not being considered for inclusion on the album. Due to a high level of fan interest, the song was included on the album as an [[Break (music)|interlude]]. The full length version, also known as the official remix of the track, featuring Rihanna's ex-boyfriend [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]], premiered online on February 20, 2012, to coincide with Rihanna's 24th birthday. The song peaked in the top fifty on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Hot 100.
]]
The lyrics to "Birthday Cake" express the desire to have [[Quickie (sex)|spontaneous sex]]. [[Music journalism|Music critics]] were divided on "Birthday Cake", with the majority both praising and criticising the song's sexual lyrical content. Several critics compared the song to the previous track on the album "[[Cockiness (Love It)]]", which also consists of sexually explicit lyrics. Upon the release of ''Talk That Talk'', the song debuted on the lower regions of the singles charts in South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

==Background and development==
[[File:SAS Royal Hotel, Copenhagen, 1955-1960.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"Birthday Cake" was recorded in Room 1306 at the [[Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]].]]
"Birthday Cake" was written by [[The-Dream]], [[Rihanna]], Marcos Palacios, and Earnest Clark, with production helmed by Da Internz and The-Dream. The interlude was recorded in room 1306 of the [[Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, Copenhagen|Radisson Blu Royal Hotel]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.<ref name="Album notes"/> In an interview for The Boom Box, producer {{Nowrap|The-Dream}} answered a question about fans being disappointed that "Birthday Cake" would not be featured on ''[[Talk That Talk (Rihanna album)|Talk That Talk]]'' (2011) after it leaked online before the album's November 2011 release; the producer explained that only an interlude had been produced, and that a full length version of the song would be released at some point during the ''Talk That Talk'' era, saying:
{{quote|I was just talking to Rihanna about that, because she [originally] made [just] an interlude. I was like, 'Your fans are going to be so mad at you.' As soon as I said that, I got back, and I guess she released a piece of it, and they saw how long it is. Man, they tore me up on Twitter! So I hit her on the phone. I was like, 'Yo, your fans, they're going crazy on me right now, like I could make you do something.' So 'Birthday Cake' is on there. It's going to turn into a whole song because the fans are ganging up on me, and I don't want to be murdered by the Rihanna Navy!.<ref name="TheDreamBoomBox">{{cite web|url=http://defpenradio.com/the-dream-says-rihannas-birthday-cake-will-become-a-full-song/|title=Ester Dean Talks Solo Career, Writing 'S&M' and 'Firework'|work=Def Pen Radio|publisher=Def Pen|date=2011-11-28|access-date=2012-01-06}}</ref>}}

The lyrical content of the interlude is spare and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting, "cake cake cake cake cake cake."<ref name="Flavour"/><ref name="LATimes"/> Aside from the repetitive chant of "cake", the interlude consists of multiple sexual metaphors.<ref name="NewYorkTimes"/> The lyric "I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticing/ Nothing else like this, I'ma make you my bitch/ And it's not even my birthday/ But you wanna put your name on it" is a metaphor referring to a vagina.<ref name="MTVCameo"/> Rihanna sings about the desire to have [[Quickie (sex)|spontaneous sex]].<ref name="T'Cha"/><ref name="Flavour"/> Rihanna promises her lover that she will make him do whatever she pleases, singing "I'mma make you my bitch."<ref name="T'Cha"/> T'Cha Dunlevy of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' described the lyric as a "promise", with Rihanna intending to act upon her desires.<ref name="T'Cha"/> The interlude ends mid-[[Verse (music)|verse]] and mid-lyric with a [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade]] at 1:18.<ref name="T'Cha"/><ref name="PopdustReview"/> Katherine St. Asaph of Popdust described the fade as "ungraceful", as well as writing that it makes the track appear as though it is not finished.<ref name="PopdustReview"/> Upon the fade, Rihanna puts forward the line "Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now."<ref name="T'Cha"/> Dunlevy and St. Asaph were critical of the final line, with the former labelling it as "blatant",<ref name="T'Cha"/> and the latter noting that "cursing makes everything obvious."<ref name="PopdustReview"/>

==Critical reception==
"Birthday Cake" garnered mixed reviews from music critics. Jayson Lipshutz of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' praised the interlude, writing "We're all for birthday-themed naughtiness in pop music form, but only 78 seconds of 'Birthday Cake' is just not enough of a celebration!"<ref name="Jason">{{cite news|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/465081/rihanna-talk-that-talk-track-by-track-review|title=Rihanna, 'Talk That Talk': Track-By-Track Review|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2011-11-17|access-date=2011-12-29}}</ref> Lipshutz continued to compare the song's lyrical message to [[Jeremih]]'s "[[Birthday Sex]]".<ref name="Jason"/> Sam Lansky of [[MTV|MTV Buzzworthy]] was complimentary of "Birthday Cake", writing, "The only misstep on the album – not because it's not amazing (it is!), but because it's only 78 seconds long.

Giovanny Caquias of CultureBlues expressed distaste for "Birthday Cake", calling the track "horrendous", but referred to it being "only a minimal waste of time" due to its short length.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caquis|first=Giovanny|url=http://www.cultureblues.com/2011/11/album-review-talk-that-talk-rihanna/|title=Album Review: "Talk That Talk" – Rihanna|publisher=CultureBlues|date=November 2011|access-date=2011-12-30}}</ref> Mike Diver of [[BBC|BBC Music]] was equally critical, writing that "Birthday Cake" is a "wholly pointless minute-something in the company of star producer The-Dream, wasted on the boring profanities of Birthday Cake."<ref>{{cite web|last=Diver|first=Mike|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fzq4|title=Rihanna Talk That Talk Review|publisher=[[BBC Music]].

{{quote|The hottest lines on the album come nearly as an afterthought on the all-too-brief 'Birthday Cake,' produced by The-Dream. 'I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticin'/ Nothin' else like this/ I'mma make you my bitch,' she sings. But as if the network censors had let the song run before realizing their mistake, a little over a minute into it the music fades out, just as it's getting dirty, leaving us wondering whether Rihanna really believes what she's selling on "Talk That Talk."<ref name="LATimes"/>}}

"'''Birthday Cake'''" was remixed with vocals from American recording artist [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]], and is a full length version of the interlude which was originally included on ''Talk That Talk''. It was sent to radio as the fourth US single from the album on March 6, 2012.<ref name="UrbanRadio">{{cite web |url=http://www.allaccess.com/urban/future-releases |title=Urban/UAC Future Releases |publisher=All Access Media Group |date=2012-02-29 |access-date=2012-02-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65s9Mjcjj?url=http://www.allaccess.com/urban/future-releases |archivedate=2012-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At first, it was rumored that [[Christina Aguilera]] would feature on the remix version after Rihanna posted a message on [[Twitter]] saying that she wanted someone "Dirrrty" on the re-recording, a supposed reference to Aguilera's 2002 song "[[Dirrty]]". However, the singer later tweeted that she wanted a male vocalist, not a female vocalist, to accompany her on the remix via Twitter with a tweet reading 'No girls allowed on #CAKE'. It was later revealed that Brown was the featured artist on the full length version. Despite receiving negative attention regarding Rihanna's choice of collaborator from the media and fans alike, the singer defended her decision saying that it is simply music.

The remix of "Birthday Cake{{" '}}s lyrics are similar to the interlude, but with new lyrics provided by Brown. Critical reception of the collaboration was met with a mixed response from music critics, many of whom were shocked at the fact that Rihanna and Brown had collaborated on a song together despite their relationship history, but cited the remix as an improvement upon the original interlude. The remix peaked at number 24 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, and number two on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. American rappers [[Fabolous]], [[Rick Ross]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] appeared on additional remixes of the song.

Due to the high level of demand by the singer's fans to release a full length of "Birthday Cake", Rihanna posted a message via her official [[Twitter]] account, promising that it was at the top of her agenda to record and release it.<ref name="FullLength">{{cite web|last=St. Asaph|first=Katherine|url=http://popdust.com/2011/12/29/rihannas-full-birthday-cake-track-is-coming-honest/|title=Rihanna's full 'Birthday Cake' is coming, honest|publisher=PopDust|date=2011-12-29|access-date=2012-01-06}}</ref> Despite fans wanting to hear the updated version, Katherine St. Asaph of PopDust criticized the notion, writing "Honestly, at this point Rihanna and Def Jam would be better off just calling 'Birthday Cake' an interlude, not an incomplete version, because otherwise that's saying the album is released but essentially unfinished."<ref name="FullLength"/> Beck Bain of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] noted that the release of the full length song is "doubtful", writing "the song is already too dirty in its current minute-and-twenty-second version.

In February 2012, it was speculated that [[Christina Aguilera]] would appear as the featured artist on the release after Rihanna posted a message on Twitter saying, "I need somebody #DIRRRTY {{sic}} on my Birthday #CAKE {{sic}}," a supposed reference to Aguilera's 2002 song "[[Dirrty]]", which contains lyrical content relating to various sexual activities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Seymour|first=Craig|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,351102,00.html|title='Dirty' (2007)|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2002-09-13|access-date=2007-06-16}}</ref> The singer later confirmed that she did not want a female artist to feature on the collaboration, stating, "No girls allowed on #CAKE. {{sic}}"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4music.com/news/news/3031/Will-Rihannas-next-single-feature-Christina-Aguilera|title=Will Rihannas next single feature Christina Aguilera?|publisher=[[4Music]]|date=2012-02-08|access-date=2012-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/is_rihanna_hinting_at_christina_q0beSjsUTzONxLnzROBGWN|title=Is Rihanna hinting at Christina Aguilera collaboration?|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=Paul Carlucci|date=2012-02-06|access-date=2012-02-07}}</ref> On February 15, 2012, Kosine of Da Internz, who produced the interlude, revealed that the featured collaborator will "shock the world," and that the full length version would premiere between February 16, and February 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rebecca|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1679296/rihanna-birthday-cake-cameo.jhtml|title=Rihanna 'Birthday Cake' Cameo Will 'Shock The World'|publisher=MTV.

On March 15, 2012, Rihanna explained her collaboration with Brown on "Birthday Cake" and the remix of his song "[[Turn Up the Music (Chris Brown song)|Turn Up the Music]]" to [[Ryan Seacrest]] during his morning show: "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, we ended up recording them at the same time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R&B artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent."<ref>{{cite web|title=Rihanna on Chris Brown collaboration: It 'made sense'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/03/rihanna-on-innocent-chris-brown-collabs-it-made-sense.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 16, 2012|date=March 16, 2012|author=Gerrick D.

===Critical reception===
Beth Hardie for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the remix came as a shock, because of how Brown "beat her virtually senseless in a car three years ago just before the Grammys,"<ref name="Mirror1"/> and noted that Rihanna would face harsh criticism from journalists and fans alike for not setting a good example to younger girls.<ref name="Mirror1"/> Hardie continued to state that although the collaboration came as a surprise, "We have to admit, it’s a pretty amazing stroke of genius in terms of publicity and messing with people’s minds."<ref name="Mirror1"/> Regarding the collaboration on the remix Jo Usmar from ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' compared the collaboration to the physical altercation between Rihanna and Brown at the 2009 Grammy Awards, writing "In case you've been living in a cave for the last two years this is extraordinarily controversial as Brown was convicted of assaulting Rihanna in 2009 and there was a restraining order issued against him."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rihanna-leaves-her-hotel-for-the-brits-wearing-713599|title=Rihanna sets off to the Brits wearing the biggest hoodie in the world|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|last=Usmar|first=Jo|date=2012-02-21|access-date=2012-02-21}}</ref> Ben Rayner for the ''Toronto Sun'' was complimentary of the remix, writing that it was an improvement upon the original interlude, "What was empty, unfinished titillation before, then, has become empty, overstated, boardroom-written pseudo-pornography for the pop charts."<ref name="TorontoSun"/>

[[File:Chris Brown 5, 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A picture of a man singing|Critics were divided on the decision to include Rihanna's ex-boyfriend [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]] on the remix of "Birthday Cake" due to their past together.]]
Jon Caramanica for ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that the remix of "Birthday Cake", as well as the original, was "very much so" a good song.<ref name="NYTimes"/> However, Caramanica was critical of the collaboration itself, due to Rihanna and Brown's history, writing "You want to forget? Fine. But don’t forgive."<ref name="NYTimes"/> Caramanica continued to explain his distaste, writing "It displays an advanced understanding of marketing and an understanding of moral obligations and ethics that's not much more than rudimentary. It is a woman publicly accepting her abuser - nothing more, nothing less."<ref name="NYTimes"/> J. Bryan Lowder for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' labelled the song as "innuendo-iced" with regard to the song's explicit lyrics.<ref name="Huffington">{{cite news|last=Lowder|first=J.

{{quote|Even though we know that collaborations like this are almost always commercial in motivation, we like to imagine that the artist's choice of a creative partner gives us some kind of access to their private, emotional world. Collaboration suggests a personal relationship, and our eavesdropping on that interplay conjures up a feeling of intimacy between audience and artist that is very powerful. We feel like we know what's really going on with Rihanna and Chris Brown because we are virtually present in the studio with them, and here, the thing we're meant to know is that everything's OK now. The problem is, the strategy won't work; because of an infamous leaked photograph, we were also virtually present in the car that night three years ago when Brown beat Rihanna till her face was bruised and bloodied. And that kind of terrifying intimacy is not easily forgotten.<ref name="Huffington"/>}}
