'''Times Books''' (previously the '''New York Times Book Company''') is a [[publishing]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] owned by [[The New York Times Company]] and licensed to [[Henry Holt and Company]].

Times Books began as the New York Times Book Company in 1969,<ref name="TimesBooksObserver"/> when The New York Times Company purchased '''Quadrangle Books''', a small publishing house in [[Chicago, Illinois]], founded in 1959 by Michael Braude. Its President was Melvin J. Brisk. Initially run entirely by The New York Times Company, the publishing arm name was changed to Times Books in 1977.

In 1984, the Times Company licensed the imprint to [[Random House]]. From 1991 through 1996, during the Random House tenure, the head of Times Books was [[Peter Osnos]], who later founded [[PublicAffairs|Public Affairs Books]].<ref name="OsnosTimesBooks"/><ref name="OsnosOnOsnos"/>

Times Books was re-licensed in 2000 as an imprint of Henry Holt, which is itself an imprint<ref name="RosenGatekeepers"/> of Holtzbrinck Publishers/Macmillan, the [[United States|U.S.]] arm of the [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]].

Editorial directors for Times Books have included David Sobel<ref name="SobelPubWeekly"/> and Paul Golob.<ref name="GolobPubWeekly"/>

Times Books has had a somewhat controversial [[right of first refusal]] policy <ref name="TimesBooksObserver"/><ref name="SobelPubWeekly"/><ref name="FirstRefusal"/><ref name="Auletta"/> with respect to manuscripts by employees of [[The New York Times Company]].

The current location of Times Books is 120 Broadway in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[United States]].

"It goes way beyond [Woodward]," said one Post reporter who recently wrote a book. "I literally tried to count—there are 25 people in the newsroom who are currently writing or going off to write books. The Post is very nurturing of that. They understand it's to its benefit." <br /> "Nobody at The Times will get the deal Woodward has," the senior Times staffer said. Times tradition has put the newspaper above all, encouraging budding authors to get lost—so long, [[Gay Talese]]!—or to accept punishingly cheap deals from The Times' house imprint. }}</ref>
