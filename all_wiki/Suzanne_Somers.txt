Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. That marriage ended in 1968.

Somers became a prize model on ''[[Anniversary Game]]'' (1969–70), where she met host [[Alan Hamel]]. They married in 1977.

Somers has three granddaughters, [[Camelia Somers|Camelia]], Violet and [[DAISY (band)|Daisy Hamel-Buffa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/suzanne-somers-granddaughters-bold-and-the-beautiful|title=Why You Should Follow Suzanne Somers's Granddaughters on Instagram|last=Wmag|website=W Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref>

Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a [[lumpectomy]] to remove the cancer followed by [[radiation therapy]], but decided to forgo chemotherapy, which doctors prescribe, in favor of a fermented [[mistletoe]] extract called Iscador.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schneider|first=K.S.|access-date=September 9, 2009 |date=April 30, 2001 |title=A Matter of Choice |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134247,00.html |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early acting roles===
Somers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the "Blonde in the white Thunderbird" in ''[[American Graffiti]]'', and an episode of the American version of the sitcom ''[[Lotsa Luck]]'' as the [[femme fatale]] in the early 1970s). She also appeared in ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless "pool girl" in ''[[Magnum Force]]'' in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', in the 1977 episode "Cheshire Project,” as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]''.  She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde "Chrissy Snow" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on ''[[Match Game]]'', and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on ''[[Tattletales]]''.<ref name="TV.com">{{cite web|title = Suzanne Somers|url = http://www.tv.com/people/suzanne-somers/|website = TV.com|access-date = 2016-02-14|last = TV.com}}</ref><ref name="boomsbeat.com">{{cite web|title = 50 facts about Suzanne Somers, known for her television roles as Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and as Carol Lambert on Step by Step|url = http://www.boomsbeat.com/articles/22062/20150818/50-things-suzanne-somers-known-television-roles-chrissy-snow-threes.htm|website = BOOMSbeat|date = 2015-08-18|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = 1970s SUZANNE SOMERS as Chrissy Three's Company 70s Vintage TV Iron On tee shirt transfer Original Authentic retro nos|url = http://www.irononstation.com/products/1970s-suzanne-somers-as-chrissy-threes-company-70s-vintage-tv-iron-on-tee-shirt-transfer-original-authentic-retro-nos|website = Irononstation, vintage 70s t-shirt iron-ons|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref>

===''Three's Company''===
{{Further|Three's Company#Cast changes}}
[[File:Suzanne Somers aboard USS Ranger (CV-61), 1981.JPEG|thumb|left|180px|Suzanne Somers on the {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|6}} in 1981, shortly after her departure from ''[[Three's Company]]'']] 
Somers was cast in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Three's Company]]'' in January 1977. After actresses [[Suzanne Zenor]] and [[Susan Lanier]] did not impress producers during the first two [[Pilot episode|test pilots]], Somers was suggested by ABC president  [[Fred Silverman]], who had seen her on the ''[[Tonight Show]]'' and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed [[Chrissy Snow]], a stereotypical [[Blonde stereotype|dumb blonde]], who was employed as an office [[secretary]].

The series co-starred [[John Ritter]] and [[Joyce DeWitt]] in a [[comedy of errors]] about two single women  living with a single man who pretends to be [[Homosexuality|gay]] in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], eventually spawning a short-lived [[The Ropers|spin-off series]] (starring [[Norman Fell]] and [[Audra Lindley]]). Somers became an audience favorite, with the media proclaiming her the show's [[Breakout character|breakout star]], and leading to her status as a popular [[sex symbol]] of the era. She was generally credited for transforming the program into a worldwide phenomenon.<ref>{{cite book|author=Horace Newcomb|title=Encyclopedia of Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUzIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2327|date=3 February 2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-19479-6|page=2327}}</ref>

When ''Three's Company'' began its fifth season in 1980, Somers demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences.
After ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth shows of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. She finished the remaining season on her contract, but her role was decreased to just 60 seconds per episode, her character only appearing in the episode's closing tag in which Chrissy calls the trio's apartment from her parents' home. After ABC fired her from the program and terminated her contract, Somers sued the network for $2 million, saying her credibility in show business had been damaged. The lawsuit was settled by an arbitrator who decided Somers was owed $30,000, due to a single missed episode for which she had not been paid. Future rulings also favored the network and  producers. Somers says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as [[Alan Alda]] and [[Carroll O'Connor]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohen|first=Y|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/interviews/female-comedians-funny-actresses|title=We'll Show You Who's FUNNY|work=[[Marie Claire]]|date=2009-03-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317124355/http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/interviews/female-comedians-funny-actresses|archive-date=2009-03-17}}</ref>

Before the feud with ABC and ''Three's Company'' producers had ended, rival network [[CBS]] knew that Somers was ultimately going to be available. They signed her to a contract and a development deal for her own sitcom, to be called ''The Suzanne Somers Show'', in which she was to play an "over-the-top" airline stewardess. Once she was indeed available (after her firing from ''Three's Company''), CBS gave Somers&nbsp;– and the public&nbsp;– a time frame in which to expect the show to hit the air, but due to a change in administration at CBS' entertainment division in early 1982, executives ended up passing on the project. In her book ''After the Fall'' ([[1998 in literature|1998]]) Somers said the producers of ''Three's Company'' kept sending [[cease and desist]] forms to CBS stating that Somers could not use any of her Chrissy Snow characterization, which she said chilled the creative process.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Somers and her ''Three's Company'' co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 1, 2011|title=Suzanne Somers made peace with John Ritter before his death|url=https://blog.seattlepi.com/people/2011/02/01/suzanne-somers-made-peace-with-john-ritter-before-his-death/|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Infomercials===
Calling her a legend in the industry, on May 2, 2014, Direct Marketing Response inducted Somers into the infomercial Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/may/02/shifting-market-shapes-made-tv-market/|title=A Shifting Market Shapes The Made For TV Market|author=Erik Anderson|work=KPBS Public Media}}</ref>

===''Playboy'' pictorials===
Somers appeared in two ''[[Playboy]]'' cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by [[Stan Malinowski]] in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', she denied ever posing nude (except for a ''[[High Society (magazine)|High Society]]'' topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20075637,00.html|title=Naked Came the Danger to Suzanne Somers' Career, but She Had An Ace Up Her Sleeve|work=people.com}}</ref> Somers' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]].<ref name="first-playboy">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43141333/ |title=Playboy exposure continues to haunt Suzanne Somers |last=Dangaard |first=Colin |publisher=[[Ottawa Journal]]|date=1980-03-26|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref> The second nude pictorial by [[Richard Fegley]] appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the ''Three's Company'' debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial.<ref name="second-playboy">{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/06/Scotts-World-Suzanne-bares-all/4965468565200/ |title=Scott's World: Suzanne bares all |last=Scott |first=Vernon |publisher=[[UPI]]|date=1984-11-06|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>

===Spokeswoman for the Thighmaster===
During the 1980s, Somers became a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] entertainer.<ref>{{cite book|author=Emmis Communications|title=Orange Coast Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37|date=July 1988|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=37|issn=0279-0483}}</ref> In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the [[Thighmaster]], a piece of [[exercise equipment]] that is squeezed between one's thighs.

===''She's the Sheriff''===
At the height of her exposure as official spokesperson for Thighmaster infomercials, Somers made her first return to a series, although not on network television. In 1987, she starred in the sitcom ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'', which ran in [[first-run syndication]]. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons.

===''Step by Step''===
In 1990, Somers returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Her roles in these, including the movie ''[[Rich Men, Single Women]]'', attracted the attention of [[Lorimar Television]] and [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], who were developing a new sitcom. Somers had starred in the film with [[Heather Locklear]], who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Somers due to Locklear's starring role on ''[[Going Places (American TV series)|Going Places]]'' (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Somers back, since they alone had produced ''[[She's the Sheriff]]''.

In September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step By Step]]'' (with [[Patrick Duffy]]), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented ''[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]'' lineup. A week after the premiere of ''Step By Step'', a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled ''Keeping Secrets'' (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled ''Suzanne Somers'', which lasted one season. ''Step By Step'' continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Somers was chosen to co-host the network's revival of ''[[Candid Camera]]'' with [[Peter Funt]], which began airing later that season.<ref name="boomsbeat.com"/><ref>{{cite web|title = Suzanne Somers|url = http://www.starpulse.com/Actresses/Somers,_Suzanne/Biography/|website = Starpulse|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref>

===''Candid'' cohost===
From 1997–99, Somers cohosted the revised ''[[Candid Camera]]'' show, when CBS chose to bring it back with [[Peter Funt]]. Somers stayed for two years before PAX TV renewed the series without her.

===''The Blonde in the Thunderbird''===
[[File:Suzanne Somers USO 2.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Somers receiving patriotic civilian service award for past [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour performances after performing ''The Blonde in the Thunderbird'' for members of the US military and their families.]]
In summer 2005, Somers made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in a one-woman show, ''The Blonde in the Thunderbird'', a collection of stories about her life and career. The show was supposed to run until September, but was cancelled in less than a week after poor reviews and disappointing ticket sales.<ref>{{cite news|last=Somensky|first=A|title=2005 Year In Theater|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/arts/features/article_10659.php/2005_Year_In_Theater?page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012081943/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/arts/features/article_10659.php/2005_Year_In_Theater?page=3|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-10-12|publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]]|date=2005-12-28|access-date=2009-09-09 }}</ref> She blamed the harsh reviews (''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to it as "''...a drab and embarrassing display of emotional exhibitionism masquerading as entertainment''"<ref>{{cite news|last=Isherwood|first=C|title=THEATER REVIEW; Self-Help Expert Gets Back Her Own|date=2005-07-18|access-date=2009-09-09|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/18/theater/reviews/selfhelp-expert-gets-back-her-own.html}}</ref>) and told the ''[[New York Post]]'': ''"These men [New York critics] are curmudgeons, and maybe I went too close to the bone for them.

===''Breaking Through''===
In 2012, Somers began an online talk show, ''Suzanne Somers Breaking Through,'' at [[CafeMom]]. 
Three of the episodes featured a reunion and reconciliation with former ''Three's Company'' co-star  [[Joyce DeWitt]]; the two had not seen nor spoken to each other in 31 years. Somers and Dewitt briefly discussed John Ritter and how glad they were that they both had spoken to him shortly before Ritter passed away.

===''The Suzanne Show''===
In the fall of 2012, the Suzanne Show, hosted by Somers, aired for a 13-episode season on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Network]]. Somers welcomed various guests covering a wide range of topics related to health and fitness.

===''Dancing with the Stars''===

On February 24, 2015, Somers was announced as one of the stars participating on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|20th season]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.

Somers and [[T. S. Wiley]], the originator of the Wiley Protocol, have been criticized for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors, all of whom utilize bioidentical hormone therapies to address health issues in women, issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]], in which they state that the protocol is "scientifically unproven and dangerous" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications.<ref name="Schwartz E, Schwarzbein D. et al."/> The use of bioidentical hormone therapies is a very controversial area of medicine;<ref name=nytbattle>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/fashion/15suzanne.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Battle Over 'Juice of Youth'|work=The New York Times|author=Ellin, Abby|date=October 15, 2006|access-date=2007-12-01}}</ref> its efficacy has never been tested and numerous groups have expressed concern over its safety and the misleading claims made by practitioners,<ref>{{Cite journal

In 2001, Somers was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy, and radiation, but declined to undergo chemotherapy.<ref name=nytbattle/> In November 2008,  Somers announced she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer by six doctors, but she learned a week later that she was misdiagnosed.

I don't know if Suzanne Somers even knows there IS a logical, scientific method.' ...
