A '''film producer''' is a person who oversees [[film production]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?page=faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Producers Guild of America|website=www.producersguild.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> Either employed by a [[production company]] or working [[Independent film|independently]], producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting the script; coordinating writing, directing, editing; and arranging financing.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url = http://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/ma-filmmaking/areas-study/producing|title=Producing |publisher= London Film School|website= lfs.org.uk }}</ref>

During the "discovery stage", the producer finds and selects promising material for development.<ref name=":1"/> Then, unless the film is based on an existing script, the producer has to hire a [[screenwriter]] and oversee the [[Filmmaking#Development|development of the script]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/27-2012.01|title=27-2012.01 - Producers|website=www.onetonline.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> Once a script is completed, the producer will lead a [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] to secure the financial backing (a "[[Green-light|green light]]") to allow production to begin.

The producer also supervises the pre-production, production, and post-production stages of filmmaking. One of the most important tasks is to hire the [[Film director|director]] and other key crew members. Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production, the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations, though some directors also produce their own films. The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget,<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-producer#|title=TV or film producer|website=nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> and has the final say on creative decisions. Finally, the producer will oversee the marketing and [[Film distribution|distribution]].

For various reasons, producers cannot always supervise all of the production. In this case, the main producer or executive producer may hire and delegate work to associate producers, assistant producers, [[line producer]]s or [[unit production manager]]s.<ref name="nyt22">{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/three-studios-agree-to-plan-to-certify-who-deserves-to-be-a-producer/|title=Three Studios Agree to Let a Guild Certify Credits for Film Producers|last=Cieply|first=Michael|date=8 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|Executive producer}}
The executive producer oversees all of the other producers working on the same project. They make sure that the producers are fulfilling their roles on the given production.

==Responsibilities==
===Development and Pre-production===
{{Main|Pre-production}}
During this stage of the production process, producers bring together people like the [[film director]], [[cinematographer]], and [[production designer]].<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles/757_producer|title=Producer|website=creativeskillset.org|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> Unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate [[screenwriter]].<ref name="rottentomatoes.com2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/news/1648610/007_writers_to_tackle_quotbarbarellaquot/|title=writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have been hired to pen the screenplay for producer Dino de Laurentiis|accessdate=13 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmakers.com/artists/williamgoldman/biography/page2.htm|title=Goldman was contacted by director/producer Rob Reiner to write the screenplay|accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref> If an existing script is considered flawed, they are able to order a new version or make the decision to hire a [[script doctor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidlynch.de/dunetimeout.html|title=He began work on the scripter.

===Production===
{{main|Principal photography}}
During production, the producer's job is to make sure the film stays on schedule and under budget.<ref name=":14"/> They will always be in contact with directors and other key creative team members.<ref name=":03"/><ref name = bergan>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/30/bernd-eichinger-obituary|title=Bernd Eichinger [obituary]|quote =In 1979, Eichinger bought a large stake in the Munich-based production and distribution company Constantin Film, which he ran as a hands-on producer for over 30 years|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref><ref name = europacorp>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-movie-business-luc-besson-s-growing-empire-a-612371.html|title=Europacorp studio posted $186 million in revenues last year, making it second only to Germany's Constantin Film as Europe's largest independent studio|accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref>

For various reasons, producers cannot always personally supervise all parts of their production. For example, some producers run a company which also deals with film distribution.<ref name = bergan/><ref name = europacorp/> Also, cast and [[film crew]] often work at different times and places, and certain films even require a [[second unit]].

===Post-production===
{{Main|Post-production}}
During post-production, the producer has the last word on whether sounds, music, or scenes have to be changed or cut. Even if the shooting has been finished, the producers can still demand that additional scenes be filmed. In the case of a negative [[test screening]], producers may even demand and get an alternative film ending. For example, the audience reacted very negatively to [[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]]'s death in the test screening for the film ''[[First Blood]]'', and the producers requested that the cast and crew shoot a new ending.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidmorrell.net/rambo-pages/david-morrell-on-rambo/|title=test audiences nearly rioted after cheering for Rambo and then seeing him die. So the producers went back to Hope, British Columbia, the location for the film, and shot a new ending in which Rambo lives|accessdate=15 March 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Jy9cGldP?url=http://davidmorrell.net/rambo-pages/david-morrell-on-rambo/|archive-date=28 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Producers also oversee the sales, marketing and distribution rights of the film, often working with specialist third-party firms.<ref name=":14"/>

==The union==
Within the United States film and television industry, all producers union contracts are negotiated by [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)]]. It was founded in 1924 by the U.S Trade Association as the Association of Motion Picture Producers.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url = http://collections.oscars.org/link/bio/1473|title = Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) records|website =Special Collections: Margaret Herrick Library |publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences}}</ref> The AMPTP was originally responsible for negotiating labor contracts, but during the mid-1930s it took over all contract negotiation responsibilities previously controlled by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=":4" /> Today, the AMPTP negotiates with various industry associations when dealing with producers union contracts, including the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] (AFTRA), the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA), and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG).<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://amptp.org/|title=AMPTP|website=amptp.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> In 2012, the AMPTP negotiated over eighty industry-wide union agreements on behalf of 350 producers. Since 1982, the AMPT has been responsible for negotiating these union agreements and it's now considered the official contract negotiation representative for everyone within the industry.<ref>[http://filmmakeriq.com/2012/09/a-guide-to-hollywood-unions/ "A Guide to Hollywood Unions | FilmmakerIQ.com"].

==Career process==
There are many different ways to become a film producer. [[Stanley Kramer]] started as an [[Film editing|editor]] and [[writer]], while other producers started as actors or directors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/stanley-kramer-collection|title=Mr. Kramer began his career in the 1930s as an editor and writer, later forming an independent production company|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref>

However, many producers start in a college, university or [[film school]]. On the occasion of announcing his own film school, 'École de la Cité, film producer [[Luc Besson]] admitted that at the beginning of his career, he would have appreciated the chance to attend a film school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoledelacite.com/en/|title=École de la cité|website=Ecole de la cité}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/luc-besson-launches-film-school-1118055818/|title=Luc Besson launches film school|work=Variety|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> [[Film school]]s and many [[University|universities]] offer [[Academic degree|degree courses]] that include film production knowledge, with some courses that are especially designed for future film producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenacademyscotland.ac.uk/content-114|title=The MFA Advanced Film Practice programme aims to equip you with the creative, professional and technical knowledge you will need to enter the professional arena as a writer, producer or director.|accessdate=15 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416155055/http://www.screenacademyscotland.ac.uk/content-114|archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionecsc.it/context.jsp?ID_LINK=18&area=7|title=The training course last three years and the interdisciplinary teaching programme prepares students in the specific areas of directing, scriptwriting, acting, photography, editing, sound techniques, production, set design, props and wardrobe|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> These courses focus on key topics like [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]], [[script development]], script assessment, shooting schedule design, and budgeting.<ref name="Filmakademie2">{{cite web|url=https://www.filmakademie.de/en/studium/course-of-study/production/production/|title=Course of Study - Production |website = Filmakademie Baden Wurttemberg GmbH}}</ref><ref name=":1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/schools/media/departments/photography|title=Our BA in Film Production is one of our most highly sought-after courses.|accessdate=15 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202000449/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/schools/media/departments/photography|archivedate=2 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dffb.de/html/en/studium/produktion|title=Producing seminars teach through practical studies in production, script development, budgeting, and media economics|accessdate=15 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119153325/http://www.dffb.de/html/en/studium/produktion|archive-date=19 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Students can also expect practical training regarding [[post-production]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfm.ee/programmes/film-arts/film-arts-ma/|title=All student films are developed, shot and post-produced in teams, closely mirroring a realistic industry work process in order to ease graduates' transitions to the professional environment|accessdate=15 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513160527/http://www.bfm.ee/programmes/film-arts/film-arts-ma/|archive-date=13 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Training at a top producing school is one of the most efficient ways a student can show professionals they are not a rookie.<ref name=":22">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/becoming-a-producer-tried-and-tested-career-paths/|title=Becoming a Producer - Tried and Tested Career Paths|date=2015-06-12|access-date=2017-02-20|newspaper=Student Resources}}</ref>

While education is one way to begin a career as a film producer, experience is also required to land a job. [[Internship]]s are a great way to gain experience while in school and give students a solid foundation on which to build their career. Many internships are paid, which enable students to earn money while gaining hands-on skills from industry professionals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-get-a-production-internship-1283507|title=Where to Look for Internship Programs in Entertainment|access-date=2017-02-03|newspaper=The Balance}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/ways_into_the_industry|title=Ways into the film industry - Film Industry - Creative Skillset|website=creativeskillset.org|access-date=2017-02-03}}</ref> Through internships, students get to network with people in the film industry as well. This pays off in the end when looking for jobs after school. Once an internship is over, the next step typically will be to land a junior position, such as a [[production assistant]].<ref name=":22" />

Although rates can vary based on a producer's role and the location of filming, the average salary can start anywhere from $20,000 to $70,000, even doubling when working in Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/jobs-film-average-salary-career-paths/|title=Jobs in Film: Average Salary & Career Paths|date=2014-12-01|access-date=2017-02-20|newspaper=Student Resources}}</ref> The average annual salary for a producer in the U.S. is $109,844. When examining more than 15,000 producers in the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area, the average annual salary is $138,640.<ref name="entertainment.howstuffworks.com2">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/highest-paying-jobs-film-industry.htm#page=1|title=10 Highest Paying Jobs in the Film Industry|date=30 May 2008}}</ref> Producers can also have an agreement to take a percentage of a movie's sales.<ref name="entertainment.howstuffworks.com2" />

There is no average work day for a film producer, since their tasks are changing from day to day. A producer's work hours are often irregular and can consist of very long days with the possibility of working nights and weekends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/television-film-video-producer|title=Television/film/video producer job profile {{!}} Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>
