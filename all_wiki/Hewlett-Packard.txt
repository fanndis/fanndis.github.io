The '''Hewlett-Packard Company''', commonly shortened to '''Hewlett-Packard''' or '''HP''', ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|l|ɪ|t|_|ˈ|p|æ|k|ər|d}} {{respell|HEW|lit|_|PAK|ərd}}), was an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[information technology|information]] [[technology company]] headquartered in [[Palo Alto, California]], that developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components, as well as software and related services to consumers, small and medium-sized businesses ([[small and medium-sized enterprises|SMBs]]) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. The company was founded in a one-car garage in [[Palo Alto, California]] by [[Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] in 1939, and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The [[HP Garage]] at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the "Birthplace of '[[Silicon Valley]]'".

The company got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments for production of [[Walt Disney]]'s hugely successful animated film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. This success led Hewlett and Packard to formally establish their Hewlett-Packard Company on January 1, 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way, which was adopted by other businesses worldwide. HP was the world's [[Market share of personal computer vendors|leading PC manufacturer]] from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when [[Lenovo]] moved ahead of HP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/379297/hp-regains-pc-lead-over-lenovo |title=HP regains PC lead over Lenovo |publisher=PC Pro |date=January 14, 2013 |access-date=April 27, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410034352/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/379297/hp-regains-pc-lead-over-lenovo |archive-date=April 10, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmontlake/2013/07/11/lenovo-shares-jump-as-pc-shipments-overtake-hp/ Lenovo Shares Jump As PC Shipments Overtake HP].

Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP directly marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.

In 1999, Hewlett-Packard Company [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business as [[Agilent Technologies]]; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It [[merger|merged]] with [[Compaq]] in 2002, and acquired [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] in 2008, leading to combined revenues of $118.4&nbsp;billion that year and a [[Fortune 500]] ranking of 9 in 2009.

[[Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] graduated with degrees in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1935. The company originated in a [[HP Garage|garage]] in nearby [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] during a fellowship they had with past professor [[Frederick Terman]] at Stanford during the [[Great Depression]]. They considered Terman a mentor in forming Hewlett-Packard.<ref name="isbn1-59184-152-6">{{cite book |author=Malone, Michael |title=Bill & Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio Hardcover |year=2007 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/billdavehowhewle00malo/page/39 39–41] |isbn=978-1-59184-152-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/billdavehowhewle00malo/page/39}}</ref> In 1938, Packard and Hewlett began part-time work in a rented garage with an initial capital investment of US$538, {{Inflation|US|538|1938|fmt=eq}}. In 1939, Hewlett and Packard decided to formalize their partnership. They tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard (HP) or Packard-Hewlett.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/about-hp/history/hp-timeline/timeline.html|title=HP Timeline {{!}} HP® Official Site|website=www8.hp.com|language=en-us|others=1938-1939|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref> HP was incorporated on August 18, 1947, and went public on November 6, 1957.<ref name=HP />{{rp|35,40,64,70,196}}

Of the many projects they worked on, their first financially successful product was a precision audio [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] known as the Model [[HP200A]]. Their innovation was the use of a small incandescent [[light bulb]] (known as a "pilot light") as a temperature dependent [[resistor]] in a critical portion of the circuit, the negative feedback loop which stabilized the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform. This allowed them to sell the Model 200A for $89.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. The Model 200 series of generators continued production until at least 1972 as the 200AB, still tube-based but improved in design through the years.

One of the company's earliest customers was Bud Hawkins, chief [[sound engineer]] for [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], who bought eight Model 200B [[audio oscillators]] (at $71.50 each) for use in the animated film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. HP's profit at the end of 1939, its first full year of business, was $1563 on revenues of $5369.<ref name="HP">{{cite book |last1=Packard |first1=David |title=The HP Way |url=https://archive.org/details/hpwayhowbillhewl00pack |url-access=registration |date=1995 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=9780060845797 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hpwayhowbillhewl00pack/page/44 44-46]}}</ref>

They worked on counter-radar technology and artillery shell [[proximity fuze]]s during World War II, which allowed Packard (but not Hewlett) to be exempt from the draft.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hewlett-Packard-Company |title=Hewlett-Packard Company |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |website=www.britannica.com |access-date=March 31, 2018 |author=Mark Hall}}</ref> Hewlett served as an officer in the [[Army Signal Corps]] after being called to active duty. In 1942, they built their first building at 395 Page Mill Road and were awarded the [[Army-Navy "E" Award]] in 1943. HP's line of products during the war included the audio oscillator, a wave analyzer, distortion analyzers, an audio-signal generator, and the Model 400A [[Voltmeter#VTVMs and FET-VMs|vacuum-tube voltmeter]], and employed 200 people.<ref name=HP />{{rp|54–60,195}}

In 1947, the company incorporated with Packard as president. He handed the presidency over to Hewlett when he became chairman in 1964, but remained CEO of the company.

Sales reached $5.5 million in 1951 with 215 employees. In 1959, a manufacturing plant was established in [[Böblingen]] and a marketing organization in [[Geneva]].<ref name=HP />{{rp|196}}

===1960s===
[[File:Hp200a-front-panel.JPG|thumb|right|The [[HP200A]], a precision audio [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], was the company's very first financially successful product.]]
HP is recognized as the symbolic founder of [[Silicon Valley]], although it did not actively investigate [[semiconductor devices]] until a few years after the "[[traitorous eight]]" had abandoned [[William Shockley]] to create [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in 1957. Hewlett-Packard's HP Associates division, established around 1960, developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use. HP Associates was co-founded by another former [[Bell Labs]] researcher, [[MOSFET]] (MOS [[transistor]]) inventor [[Mohamed Atalla]],<ref name="atalla">{{cite web|title=Martin Atalla in Inventors Hall of Fame, 2009|url=https://www.invent.org/inductees/martin-john-m-atalla|access-date=21 June 2013}}</ref> who served as Director of Semiconductor Research.<ref name="Lojek321">{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |pages=321–3}}</ref> Instruments and [[calculators]] were some of the products using semiconductor devices from HP Associates.

During the 1960s, HP partnered with Sony and the [[Yokogawa Electric]] companies in Japan to develop several high-quality products. The products were not a huge success, as there were high costs involved in building HP-looking products in Japan. In 1963, HP and Yokogawa formed the joint venture Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard to market HP products in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|date=March 17, 1961|title=HP History: 1960s|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/timeline/hist_60s.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021231173316/http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/timeline/hist_60s.html|archive-date=December 31, 2002|access-date=July 7, 2011|publisher=Hewlett-Packard}}</ref> HP bought Yokogawa Electric's share of Hewlett-Packard Japan in 1999.<ref>{{cite press release|website=Yokogawa Electric Corporation|date=July 7, 1999|title=Yokogawa Electric Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company Announce "Hewlett-Packard Japan to become Wholly Owned HP Subsidiary" HP and Yokogawa Sign Agreement|url=http://www.yokogawa.com/pr/Corporate/News/1999/pr-news-1999-03-en.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://archive.today/2013.01.05-180239/http://www.yokogawa.com/pr/Corporate/News/1999/pr-news-1999-03-en.htm|archive-date=January 3, 2013|access-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref>

HP spun off the small company Dynac to specialize in digital equipment. The name was picked so that the HP logo could be turned upside down to be a reflected image of the logo of the new company. Eventually, Dynac was renamed Dymec, and was folded back into HP in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dynac Model DY-2500 Computing Digital Indicator, c. 1956|url=https://www.hpe.com/us/en/about/history/innovation-gallery/006-product.html|access-date=October 7, 2020|website=[[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]]}}</ref> HP experimented with using [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) minicomputers with its instruments, but after deciding that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC, HP entered the computer market in 1966 with the [[HP 2100]] / [[HP 1000]] series of minicomputers. These had a simple [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]-based design, with two accumulator registers and, in the HP 1000 models, two [[index register]]s. The series was produced for 20 years, in spite of several attempts to replace it, and was a forerunner of the [[HP 9830|HP 9800]] and [[HP 250]] series of desktop and business computers.

At the end of 1968, co-founder Packard handed over the duties of CEO to Hewlett to become [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]] in the incoming Nixon administration. He resumed the chairmanship in 1972 and served until 1993, but Hewlett remained the CEO.

The [[HP 3000]] was an advanced stack-based design for a business computing server, later redesigned with [[RISC]] technology. The [[HP 2640]] series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms-based interfaces to [[ASCII]] terminals, and also introduced [[screen labeled function keys]], now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs. The HP 2640 series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that when combined with the [[HP 2100]] 21MX F-Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?hwdoc=110 |title=HP1000 F-Series |publisher=HP Museum |access-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref> enabled the first commercial [[WYSIWYG]] [[Presentation Program]], [[BRUNO]] that later became the program HP-Draw on the [[HP 3000]]. Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing, HP would eventually surpass even IBM as the world's largest technology vendor, in terms of sales.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2009/full_list/ |title=Global 500 2009: Global 500 1-100 – FORTUNE on CNNMoney.com |publisher=CNN |date=July 20, 2009 |access-date=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

HP is identified by ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine as the producer of the world's first device to be called a personal computer: the [[Hewlett-Packard 9100A]], introduced in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/12/the-first-pc/ |title=The First PC |magazine=Wired |date=December 1, 2000 |access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref> HP called it a desktop calculator because, as Bill Hewlett said, "If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an [[IBM mainframe|IBM]]. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared." An engineering triumph at the time, the logic circuit was produced without any [[integrated circuits]]; the assembly of the CPU having been entirely executed in discrete components. With [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display, magnetic-card storage, and printer, the price was around $5,000. The machine's keyboard was a cross between that of a scientific calculator and an adding machine. There was no alphabetic keyboard.

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] originally designed the [[Apple I]] computer while working at HP and offered it to them under their [[right of first refusal]] to his work; they did not take it up as the company wanted to stay in scientific, business, and industrial markets. Wozniak said that HP "turned him down five times", but that his loyalty to HP made him hesitant to start Apple with [[Steve Jobs]].<ref name="AI">{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/06/apple_co_founder_offered_first_computer_design_to_hp_5_times |title=Apple co-founder offered first computer design to HP 5 times |publisher=appleinsider.com}}</ref>

The company earned global respect for a variety of products. They introduced the world's first ''handheld scientific electronic [[calculator]]'' in 1972 (the [[HP-35]]), the first ''handheld programmable'' in 1974 (the [[HP-65]]), the first ''alphanumeric, programmable, expandable'' in 1979 (the [[HP-41]]C), and the first symbolic and graphing calculator, the [[HP-28C]]. Like their scientific and business calculators, their [[oscilloscope]]s, [[logic analyzer]]s, and other measurement instruments have a reputation for sturdiness and usability (the latter products are now part of spin-off [[Agilent Technologies|Agilent]]'s product line, which were later spun off from Agilent as [[Keysight Technologies]]).<ref name="Company History">{{cite web|url=https://about.keysight.com/en/companyinfo/history/ |title=Company History |publisher=Keysight.com}}</ref> The company's design philosophy in this period was summarized as "design for the guy at the next bench".{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The [[HP 9800 series]] of technical desktop computers started in 1975 with the 9815, and the cheaper [[HP series 80]], again of technical computers, started in 1979 with the 85.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?class=1&cat=9 |title=HP Computer Museum |publisher=HP Museum |access-date=May 9, 2010}}</ref> These machines used a version of the [[BASIC programming language]] which was available immediately after they were switched on, and used a proprietary magnetic tape for storage. HP computers were similar in capabilities to the much later [[IBM Personal Computer]], although the limitations of available technology forced prices to be high.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1978 co-founder Hewlett stepped down as CEO and was succeeded by [[John A. Young]].

In 1984, HP introduced both [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] and [[laser printer]]s for the desktop. Along with its [[image scanner|scanner]] product line, these have later been developed into successful [[multifunctional|multifunction]] products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's tremendously popular [[HP LaserJet|LaserJet]] line of laser printers depend almost entirely on [[Canon Inc.]]'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by [[Xerox]]. HP develops the hardware, firmware, and software to convert data into dots for printing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc_0AkhysO0C&q=HP+develops+the+hardware%2C+firmware%2C+and+software+that+convert+data+into+dots+for+the+mechanism+to+print&pg=PT62|title=Power of Marketing|last=Ma'arif|first=Nelly Nailatie|date=2008|publisher=Penerbit Salemba|isbn=9789796914456|pages=76|language=en}}</ref>

On March 3, 1986, HP registered the HP.com domain name, making it the [[List of the oldest currently-registered Internet domain names|ninth Internet]] [[.com]] domain ever to be registered.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280090622/The-first-ever-20-domain-names-registered|title=The first ever 20 domain names registered|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In 1987, the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a [[California Historical Landmarks in Santa Clara County, California|California State historical landmark]].

===1990s===
In the 1990s, HP expanded their computer product line, which initially had been targeted at university, research, and business users, to reach consumers. HP also grew through acquisitions. It bought [[Apollo Computer]] in 1989 and [[Convex Computer]] in 1995.

In 1992, CEO John Young was succeeded by [[Lewis E. Platt]], and in 1993 and co-founders Hewlett and Packard stepped down from the board with Platt succeeding Packard as chairman.

Later in the decade, HP opened hpshopping.com as an independent subsidiary to sell online, direct to consumers; in 2005, the store was renamed "HP Home & Home Office Store."

From 1995 to 1998, Hewlett-Packard were sponsors of the English football team [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

In 1999, all of the businesses not related to computers, storage, and imaging were spun off from HP to form [[Agilent]] Technologies. Agilent's spin-off was the largest [[initial public offering]] in the history of [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>Arensman, Russ.

On September 3, 2001, HP announced that an agreement had been reached with [[Compaq]] to merge the two companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2001/010904a.html |title=HP Press Release: Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Agree to Merge, Creating $87&nbsp;billion Global Technology Leader |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |access-date=May 9, 2010}}</ref> In May 2002, after passing a shareholder vote, HP officially merged with Compaq. Prior to this, plans had been in place to consolidate the companies' product teams and product lines.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=302442#.X36bCi9h1VQ|title=HP Closes Compaq Merger|publisher=Hewlett-Packard|access-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref>

Compaq had already taken over [[Tandem Computers]] in 1997 and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in 1998. HP therefore still offers support for the former Tandem NonStop family and Digital Equipment products PDP-11, VAX and AlphaServer.

The merger occurred after a proxy fight with Bill Hewlett's son Walter, who objected to the merger. Compaq itself had bought [[Tandem Computers]] in 1997 (which had been started by ex-HP employees), and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998. Following this strategy, HP became a major player in [[desktop computer|desktops]], laptops, and servers for many different markets. After the merger with Compaq, the new [[ticker symbol]] became "HPQ", a combination of the two previous symbols, "HWP" and "CPQ", to show the significance of the alliance and also key letters from the two companies '''H'''ewlett-'''P'''ackard and Compa'''q''' (the latter company being famous for its "Q" logo on all of its products).

In 2004, HP released the DV 1000 Series, including the [[HP Pavilion dv 1658]] and 1040 two years later in May 2006, HP began its campaign, "The Computer is Personal Again". The campaign was designed to bring back the fact that the [[Personal computer|PC]] is a personal product. The campaign utilized viral marketing, sophisticated visuals and its own website (www.hp.com/personal). Some of the ads featured [[Pharrell]],<ref>{{Citation|last=youthconnectionss|title=05 HP - the Computer is Personal Again - Pharrell|date=January 15, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HkcHWh3XOM|access-date=April 3, 2017}}</ref> [[Petra Nemcova]], [[Mark Burnett]], [[Mark Cuban]], [[Alicia Keys]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.hp.com/za/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=859724#.WOKRdBLytTY|title=HP News - HP Launches "Everybody On" Global Marketing Campaign|website=www8.hp.com|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2017}}</ref> [[Jay-Z]],<ref>{{Citation|last=mikehoho|title=HP Personal - Jay-Z (CEO of Hip-Hop)|date=September 5, 2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyI5OnECBoM|access-date=April 3, 2017}}</ref> [[Gwen Stefani]], and [[Shaun White]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the first few years of Hurd's new role, HP's stock price more than doubled. By the end of Fiscal 2007, HP hit the $100 Billion mark for the first time.

[[Dell]] purchased [[Perot Systems]] recently to invade into the technology consulting business area previously dominated by [[IBM]].

===Takeover of Autonomy===
{{see also|Autonomy Corporation#Hewlett Packard}}
In November 2012, HP recorded a writedown of around $8.8 billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the UK based [[Autonomy Corporation]] [[Public limited company|PLC]]. HP accused Autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover. The former management team of Autonomy flatly rejected the charge.

At the time, HP had fired its previous CEO for expenses irregularities a year before, and appointed [[Léo Apotheker]] as CEO and President. HP was seen as problematic by the market, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services. Apotheker's strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable [[software]] [[Business service provider|services]] [[business sector|sector]].

As part of this strategy, Autonomy was acquired by HP in October 2011. HP paid $10.3 billion for 87.3% of the shares, valuing Autonomy at around $11.7 billion (£7.4 billion) overall, a [[Control premium|premium]] of around 79% over market price. The deal was widely criticized as "absurdly high", a "botched strategy shift" and a "chaotic" attempt to rapidly [[Turnaround management|reposition]] HP and enhance earnings,<ref name="bloomberg29nov2012" /><ref name="telegraph19aug2011" /><ref name="reuters3oct2011" /> and had been objected to even by HP's own [[CFO]].<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" /><ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014" />{{rp|3–6}} Within a year, Apotheker himself had been fired, major [[cultural conflict|culture clashes]] became apparent and HP had [[Write-off|written off]] $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value.<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" />

HP claim this resulted from "[[fraud|accounting improprieties]], [[misrepresentation]]s and disclosure failures" by the previous management, who in turn accuse HP of a "textbook example of [[gaming the system|defensive stalling]]"<ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014" />{{rp|6}} to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross [[management|mismanagement]] and undermining of the company, noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues<ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014" />{{rp|3}} and that even HP's [[CFO]] disagreed with the price paid.<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" /><ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014" />{{rp|3–6}} External observers generally state that only a small part of the write-off appears to be due to accounting mis-statements, and that HP had overpaid for businesses previously.<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" /><ref name="marketwatch19aug2014">[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-mysterious-case-of-hewlett-packards-autonomy-deal-2014-08-19 The mysterious case of Hewlett-Packard's Autonomy deal], ''[[Marketwatch]]'', August 19, 2014</ref>

The [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)]], and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in investigating the potential anomalies.

In August 2014 a [[United States district court]] [[United States federal judge|judge]] threw out a proposed settlement, which Autonomy's previous management had argued would be [[collusive lawsuit|collusive]] and intended to divert scrutiny of HP's own responsibility and knowledge, by essentially engaging the plaintiff's attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous Autonomy vendors and management, for a fee of up to $48 million, with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against HP's management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous Autonomy vendors and management.<ref>{{cite news|date=August 25, 2014|title=U.S. judge casts doubt on HP-shareholder settlement in Autonomy lawsuit|work=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/hp-autonomy/u-s-judge-casts-doubt-on-hp-shareholder-settlement-in-autonomy-lawsuit-idUSL1N0QV15P20140825|access-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=August 25, 2014|title=US Judge Rejects Settlement Deal Reached In HP's Derivative Lawsuits|url=https://www.rttnews.com/2374756/us-judge-rejects-settlement-deal-reached-in-hp-s-derivative-lawsuits.aspx?type=bn|access-date=October 7, 2014|website=RTTNews}}</ref> In January 2015 the SFO closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30883288 |title=Autonomy HP sale investigation by Serious Fraud Office closes |work=BBC News |date=January 19, 2015}}</ref> The dispute is still being litigated in the US, and is being investigated by the UK and Ireland [[Financial Reporting Council]].

Another term of the shareholder settlement was to sue Autonomy management. This trial took place in London in 2019. In a trial that lasted 93 days with 58 witnesses, HP "failed to produce a smoking gun for the fraud it alleges."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/hp-s-long-legal-war-over-a-10-billion-takeover-heads-to-a-close|title=Bloomberg - A Long Legal War Over a $10 Billion Takeover Heads to a Close|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> HP's own accountants admitted that they "never formally prepared anything to attribute the irregularities to the amount of the fraud."<ref name=":1" />

===Bribery===
On April 9, 2014, an administrative proceeding before [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] was settled by HP consenting to an order acknowledging that HP had violated the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) when HP subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and Mexico made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain lucrative public contracts.<ref>{{cite web|title=HP Pays $108 Million To Settle Bribery Cases|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hp-pays-108m-to-settle-bribery-cases-2014-4|website=Business Insider}}</ref>

The SEC's order finds that HP's subsidiary in Russia paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. In Poland, HP's subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency. And as part of its bid to win a software sale to Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, HP's subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and money was funneled to one of those officials. HP agreed to pay $108 million to settle the SEC charges and a parallel criminal case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370541453075 |title=SEC.gov - SEC Charges Hewlett-Packard With FCPA Violations |publisher=sec.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hp-pays-108m-to-settle-bribery-cases-2014-4 |title=HP Pays $108M To Settle Bribery Cases |date=April 9, 2014 |work=Business Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/04/09/h-p-in-108m-settlement-with-doj-over-foreign-practices/ |title=H-P Pays $108M to DOJ, SEC Over Anti-Bribery Allegations |author=Jennifer Booton |work=Fox Business |access-date=April 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411002238/http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/04/09/h-p-in-108m-settlement-with-doj-over-foreign-practices/ |archive-date=April 11, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
