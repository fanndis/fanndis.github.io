A '''caucus''' is a meeting of supporters or members of a specific [[political party]] or movement. The exact definition varies between different countries and political cultures.

The term originated in the [[United States]], where it can refer to a meeting of members of a political party to nominate candidates, plan policy, etc, in the [[United States Congress]], or other similar representative organs of government. It has spread to certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]], where it generally refers to a regular meeting of all [[members of Parliament]] who belong to a [[parliamentary party]]: in such a context, a party caucus can be quite powerful, as it has the ability to elect or dismiss the party's [[parliamentary leader]].

==Etymology==
[[Image:Alice par John Tenniel 09.png|thumb|[[Lewis Carroll]] mocked the futility of caucuses in "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale", Chapter 3 of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865): when the "Caucus-race" of running in a circle stops, everyone is declared a winner by the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] and Alice is told to hand out [[prize]]s to all others, receiving her own thimble as her prize.]]

The origin of the word ''caucus'' is debated, but it is known to have first come into use in the British colonies of North America.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/caucus.html |title=Party CAUCUS: The word and its history |website=community.middlebury.edu |access-date=2016-02-26 }}</ref>

A February 1763 entry in the diary of [[John Adams]] of [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Braintree, Massachusetts]], is one of the earliest appearances of ''Caucas'', already with its modern connotations of a "[[smoke-filled room]]" where candidates for public election are pre-selected in private:
<blockquote>This day learned that the Caucas Clubb meets at certain Times in the Garret of [[Thomas Dawes|Tom Daws]], the Adjutant of the Boston Regiment. He has a large House, and he has a moveable Partition in his Garrett, which he takes down and the whole Clubb meets in one Room. There they smoke tobacco till you cannot see from one End of the Garrett to the other. There they drink [[Flip (cocktail)|Phlip]] I suppose, and there they choose a Moderator, who puts Questions to the Vote regularly, and [[Selectman]], Assessors, Collectors, Wardens, Fire Wards, and Representatives are Regularly chosen before they are chosen in the Town&nbsp;...<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/01-01-02-0008-0001-0005 |title=Founders Online: Boston Feby. 1763. |website=founders.archives.gov |access-date=2016-02-26 }}</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>
'''The Origin of the "Caucus"'''<br>
The presidential nominating convention is a modern institution. In the early days of the Republic a very different method was pursued in order to place the candidates for the highest office in the land before the people.<br>
In the first place, as to the origin of the "caucus." In the early part of the eighteenth century a number of [[Caulk|caulkers]] connected with the shipping business in the North End of Boston held a meeting for consultation. That meeting was the germ of the political caucuses which have formed so prominent a feature of our government ever since its organization. The anti-Britain episode happened on March 5, 1770 and on that occasion five Bostonians were killed by the English musketry; but this interpretation seems to be contradicted, besides by the abovementioned John Adams, also by William Gordon (1728–1807), who lived the whole course of the American Revolution and shortly thereafter published his history of those events: "The word caucus, and its derivative caucusing, are often used in Boston […] The word is not of novel invention. More than fifty years ago, Mr. Samuel Adams's father, and twenty others, one or two from the north end of the town, where all the ship business is carried on, used to meet, make a caucus, and lay their plan for introducing certain persons into places' of trust and power."<ref>William Gordon, ''The History of the Rise, Progress and Establishment of the Independence of the United States of America: including an account of the late war, and of the thirteen colonies, from their origin  to that period...'' vol. I, London, 1788, p. 365.</ref>
</blockquote> 
No wholly satisfactory etymology has been documented.<ref>[http://boston1775.blogspot.com/2008/01/colonial-boston-vocabulary-caucus-part.html J. L. Bell, ""Boston 1775: Colonial Boston Vocabulary: 'caucus,' part 2"]</ref> [[James Hammond Trumbull]] suggested to the [[American Philological Association]] that it comes from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for "counsel", 'cau´-cau-as´u'. The word  might also derive from the Algonquian ''cawaassough'', meaning an advisor, talker, or orator.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=James |title=The Earth Shall Weep |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |year=1999 |location=New York City, NY |pages=[https://archive.org/details/earthshallweephi00wils/page/104 104–105] |isbn=0-87113-730-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/earthshallweephi00wils/page/104 }}</ref> This explanation was favoured by [[Charles Dudley Warner]].<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3129/pg3129.txt ''The Story of Pocahontas"], Project Gutenberg</ref> The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' suggests that it possibly derived from medieval [[Latin]] ''caucus'', meaning "drinking vessel",<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=caucus|encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary |edition=4th |year=2000|location=Boston, MA|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}</ref> such as might have been used for the [[Flip (cocktail)|flip]] drunk at [[Caucus Club]] of colonial [[Boston]]. In fact, the appearance of the term coincides with the  spreading in England – and therefore also in America – of the inns they called ''cocues'' because they were places to drink the new cheap liquor called "gin" or "cuckoo liquor" since it was obtained from the distillation of so-called "cuckoo barley", namely barley sown very late in the spring and therefore unsuitable for the distillation of beer.<ref>See [[Pub#Beer houses and the 1830 Beerhouse Act]] and [[Gin#History]].</ref> That these were places where people drank abundantly is also attested by Obadiah Benjamin Franklin Bloomfield in his autobiography: "Richard had set out hospitably [...] A caucus had been accordingly held by these worthies, and it was resolved nem. con. that they should first make a drunkard of him, and then pluck him, aye, even of the last feather."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Life and Adventures of Obadiah Benjamin Franklin Bloomfield M.D. […] written by himself |location=Philadelphia |year=1818 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeandadventur00frangoog/page/n156 138] |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeandadventur00frangoog }}</ref>

An [[Plural form of words ending in -us|analogical Latin-type plural]] "cauci" is occasionally used.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/blog/2013/10/17/cauci.aspx |title=Cauci? > National Conference of State Legislatures |website=www.ncsl.org |access-date=2016-02-26 }}</ref>

==In the United States==

In United States politics and government, ''caucus'' has several distinct but related meanings. Members of a [[political party]] or subgroup may meet to coordinate members' actions, choose group policy, or nominate candidates for various offices.

===Caucuses to select election candidates===
{{further|Iowa caucuses|Texas caucuses|Nevada caucuses|Colorado Caucus}}
{{See also|United States presidential primary|United States presidential nominating convention}}
There is no provision for the role of political parties in the [[United States Constitution]]. In the first two presidential elections, the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] handled nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 which selected [[George Washington]]. After that, Congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party's presidential candidates. Nationally, these caucuses were replaced by the party convention starting in 1832 following the lead of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] 1831 convention.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shafer|first1=Byron E|title=Bifurcated Politics: Evolution and Reform in the National Party Convention|date=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674072561|page=[https://archive.org/details/bifurcatedpoliti00shaf/page/11 11]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAQ_cWsAW-cC&q=Emergence+of+the+Presidential+Nominating+Convention%2C+1789%E2%80%931832&pg=PA11|accessdate=February 1, 2016|chapter=Emergence of the Presidential The Nomination and the Convention|url=https://archive.org/details/bifurcatedpoliti00shaf/page/11}}</ref>

The term ''caucus'' is frequently used to discuss the procedures used by some states to select [[presidential nominee]]s such as the [[Iowa caucuses]], the first of the modern [[United States presidential election|presidential election cycle]], and the [[Texas caucuses]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/23/heres-how-the-iowa-caucuses-work/ |title=Iowa caucuses: Here's how the voting works |last=Weigel |first=David |date=2016-01-23 |newspaper=The Washington Post |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |access-date=2016-02-26 }}</ref> Since 1980 such caucuses have become, in the aggregate, an important component of the nomination process.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZC2mB4e_TCIC |title=Why Iowa?: How Caucuses and Sequential Elections Improve the Presidential Nominating Process |last1=Redlawsk |first1=David P. |last2=Tolbert |first2=Caroline J. |last3=Donovan |first3=Todd |author-link2=Caroline Tolbert |date=2011 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226706962 |language=en }}</ref>

===Congressional caucuses===
{{main|Congressional caucus}}
Another meaning is a sub grouping of officials with shared affinities or ethnicities who convene, often but not always to advocate, agitate, lobby or to vote collectively, on policy. At the highest level, in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and many state legislatures, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members organize themselves into a caucus (occasionally called a "conference").<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.dems.gov U.S. House of Representatives Democratic Caucus], [http://www.gop.gov U.S. House of Representatives Republican Conference]; [http://democrats.senate.gov/members/ U.S. Senate Democratic Caucus]; [http://src.senate.gov U.S. Senate Republican Conference]; [http://democrats.sen.ca.gov/ California State Senate Democratic Caucus]</ref> There can be smaller caucuses in a legislative body, including those that are multi-[[Partisan (political)|partisan]] or even [[Bicameralism|bicameral]]. Of the many [[Congressional caucus]]es, one of the best-known is the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], a group of [[African-American]] members of Congress. Another prominent example is the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]], whose members voice and advance issues affecting [[Hispanics]] in the United States, including [[Puerto Rico]]. In a different vein, the Congressional Internet Caucus is a bipartisan group of Members who wish to promote the growth and advancement of the Internet. Other congressional caucuses such as the [[Out of Iraq Caucus]], are openly organized tendencies or [[political faction]]s (within the [[House Democratic Caucus]], in this case), and strive to achieve political goals, similar to a European "[[platform (European politics)|platform]]", but generally organized around a single issue.

==In Commonwealth nations==
===Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa===
The term is also used in certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]. However, when used in these countries, "caucus" is more usually a collective term for all members of a party in Parliament, otherwise called a [[parliamentary group]], rather than a word for a regular meeting of these [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]]. Thus, the Australian Federal Parliamentary Labor Party is commonly called "the [[Australian Labor Party Caucus|Labor Caucus]]".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://australianpolitics.com/2001/05/09/establishment-of-federal-labor-caucus.html |title=The Establishment Of The Federal Labor Caucus |website=australianpolitics.com |access-date=2016-02-26 }}</ref>

The word was used in New Zealand from at least the 1890s, when organized political parties began to emerge: the largest of them, the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], used it to refer to its parliamentary members.<ref>{{cite news| title=The Liberal Caucus |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TS18930627.2.42 |newspaper=The Star |issue=4681 |page=3 |date=27 June 1893 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref> It was introduced to Australia in 1901 by [[King O'Malley]], an American-born [[Australian Labor Party|Labour]] member of the first [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]].

In New Zealand, the term is now used by all political parties,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/how-parliament-works/ppnz/00HOOOCPPNZ_71/chapter-7-parties-and-government |title=Chapter 7 Parties and Government |website=www.parliament.nz |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |language=en-NZ |access-date=2016-02-26 }}</ref> but in Australia, it continues to be used only by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. For the Australian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]], [[National Party of Australia|National]] and [[Australian Greens|Green]] parties, the usual equivalent term is "party room". In [[South Africa]] all parties use the term "caucus".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.anc.org.za/caucus/show.php?ID=1963 |title=The ANC Parliamentary Caucus |website=www.anc.org.za |publisher=Parliament of the Republic of South Africa |access-date=2016-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309210340/http://www.anc.org.za/caucus/show.php?ID=1963 |archivedate=2016-03-09 }}</ref> In Canada, "caucus" refers to all members of a particular party in Parliament, including senators, or a [[province|provincial]] legislature.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/parliament-101-what-s-a-caucus-anyway-1.2515858 |title=What's a caucus anyway? 3 things to know |website=www.cbc.ca |access-date=2016-02-26 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/WeekInHouse/index-e.asp |title=Parliament of Canada – A Week in the House of Commons |website=www.lop.parl.gc.ca |access-date=2016-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225211158/http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/WeekInHouse/index-e.asp |archive-date=2016-02-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These members elect among themselves a [[caucus chair]] who presides over their meetings. This person is an important figure when the party is in [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]], and is an important link between [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and the [[backbencher|backbench]] when the party is in [[government]].

In such contexts, a party caucus can be quite powerful, as it can elect or dismiss the party's parliamentary leader. The caucus system is a departure from the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]] in giving members of the upper house a say in the election of the party leader, who may become head of government. The caucus also determines some matters of policy, parliamentary tactics, and disciplinary measures against disobedient MPs. In some parties, the caucus also has the power to elect MPs to Cabinet when the party is in government. For example, this is traditionally so in the [[Australian Labor Party]] and the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].

===United Kingdom===

His luggage includes a scroll marked "Caucus", several string puppets, and a box of "wire pulling machinery", all in allusion to his reputation as a backstage political manager.]]

;Historic
The word "caucus" had a wide currency in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 19th century, in reference to a highly structured system of management and control within a political party, specifically the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. It was originally a pejorative term, used by detractors of the system with overtones of corrupt American practices; but the name was soon adopted by the Liberals themselves.

The system had originated at a local level in [[Birmingham]] in preparation for the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]], when, under the [[Reform Act 1867|1867 Reform Act]], the city had been allocated three [[Electoral district|parliamentary seats]], but each elector had only two votes. In order to spread votes evenly, the secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Association, [[William Harris (Birmingham Liberal)|William Harris]] (later dubbed the "father of the Caucus") devised a four-tier organizational structure (of [[electoral ward|ward]] committees, general committee, executive committee, and management committee) through which Liberal voters in different wards could be instructed in the precise combinations in which to cast their votes.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

Shortly afterwards the term "caucus" was applied to this system by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, which referred to "the 'caucus' with all its evils", and by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] prime minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]].<ref>{{cite news |title=[Leading article] |newspaper=The Times |date=12 June 1877 |issue=28966 |page=9 |quote=There is to be a sort of Liberal Parliament organized, which, in American language, seems intended to act as a great Liberal 'Caucus'. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Chamberlain |authorlink=Joseph Chamberlain |title=A new political organization |journal=Fortnightly Review |series=n.s. |volume=22 |issue=127 |date=1 July 1877 |pages=126–34 (134) |quote=... what the ''Times'' calls the new Liberal Caucus ... }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=[Leading article] |newspaper=The Times |date=31 July 1878 |page=10 |quote=We may say, and say truly, that the policy of the politicians of the Midland capital will bring upon us the 'caucus' with all its evils, but we cannot hope to checkmate it by giving it a bad name.

[[Moisey Ostrogorsky]] devoted some nine chapters of his ''Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties'' (1902) to discussion of the development and operation of the "Caucus" in this sense.<ref>{{cite book |first=M. |last=Ostrogorski |authorlink=Moisey Ostrogorsky |title=Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties |translator-first=Frederick |translator-last=Clarke |place=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=1902 |volume=1 |pages=161–249, 329–441, 502–529, 580–627 |url=https://archive.org/stream/democracyandtheo031734mbp#page/n223/mode/2up }}</ref>

;Contemporary
On the rare occasions when the term "caucus" is encountered in modern UK politics, it is generally used to mean a subgroup, [[political faction|faction]] or [[pressure group]]{{dn|date=September 2020}} within a political party. For example, in 2019 the [[One Nation Conservatives (caucus)|One Nation Conservatives]] and [[Blue Collar Conservativism|Blue Collar Conservatives]] were established as factions within the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], both being described as "caucuses".<ref>{{cite tweet |user=RichardHRBenyon |number=1130522197347508224 |date=20 May 2019 |title=So pleased and proud to be at a meeting of the One Nation Conservative Caucus.

== In organizations ==
In [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], where the membership from different parts of the organization may gather, each separate group within the organization may meet prior to the convention as a caucus.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised |last=Robert|first=Henry M.|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-306-82020-5|location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=605–6|edition=11th|display-authors=etal|title-link=Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> Each caucus may decide how the group would vote on various issues that may come up at the convention.<ref name=":0" /> Unless the votes are made binding, however, each delegate is still free to vote in any fashion.<ref name=":0" />

==In alternative dispute resolution==
The term ''caucus'' is also used in [[mediation]], [[facilitator|facilitation]] and other forms of [[alternative dispute resolution]] to describe circumstances wherein, rather than meeting at a common table, the disputants retreat to a more private setting to process information, agree on negotiation strategy, confer privately with counsel or with the mediator, or simply gain "breathing room" after the often emotionally difficult interactions that can occur in the common area where all parties are present.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/adr/1stmed.htm |title=ADR – How to Get Through Your First Mediation and What You Expect |website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=2016-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319025231/http://www.cdc.gov/od/adr/1stmed.htm |archive-date=2016-03-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The degree to which caucuses are used can be a key defining element, and often an identifier, of the mediation model being used. For example, "facilitative mediation" tends to discourage the use of caucuses and tries to keep the parties talking at a single table, while "evaluative mediation" may allow parties to separate more often and rely on the mediator to shuttle information and offers back and forth.<ref>Further details in Julie MacFarlane, ''Dispute Resolution: Readings and Case Studies'', 2003:356-62, excerpts from C.
