==Personal life==
On 31 July 1989, Azarenka was born in [[Minsk]], [[Byelorussian SSR]], Soviet Union to Alla and Fyodor Azarenka in a middle-class family. She has an elder brother Max.

Her tennis idol is German former player [[Steffi Graf]]. In an interview, Azarenka stated: "Graf's Calendar Golden Slam in 1988 is my biggest motivation."<ref>[http://sports.163.com/12/0214/11/7Q7I84E200051CDG.html 阿扎伦卡欲效仿格拉芙 抵多哈表雄心期待金满贯] Retrieved 2016-08-01</ref>

At age 15, Azarenka moved full-time to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], United States, from [[Minsk]], Belarus, to train and live. In this she was aided by [[National Hockey League]] goalie [[Nikolai Khabibulin]] and his wife, who is a friend of Azarenka's mother.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rising Azarenka makes waves on tennis court|date=1 March 2010|url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/azetc/articles/2009/03/10/20090310spt-azarenka.html|accessdate=2 February 2012|work=The Arizona Republic|first=Andrew|last=Pentis}}</ref> In 2012, she became registered in Monaco but in August 2013 she purchased a large ocean-overlooking house as her principal residence where she lives in [[Manhattan Beach, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/dirt/real-estalker/tennis-pro-victoria-azarenka-buys-manhattan-beach-house-1201517712/|title=Tennis star Victoria Azaranka buys a house in Los Angeles|last=David|first=Mark|date=11 June 2013|work=Variety|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref> Azarenka is fluent in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], Russian, and English, and has some fluency in French and Ukrainian.

Azarenka dated American musician [[Redfoo]] between late 2012 and early 2014. Azarenka has spoken openly about her experience of depression during her injury-induced absence from professional tennis in 2014.<ref>[http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/01/vika-azarenka-my-mind-i-skipped-whole-season/53554/#.VPJVq_msVp4 "Azarenka on 2014: 'In my mind, I skipped the whole season'"]</ref>

Azarenka and former boyfriend Billy McKeague, have one son, Leo, born 19 December 2016.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/sports/tennis/victoria-azarenka-return-pregnancy-serena-williams.html?mcubz=1</ref>  Immediately after [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2017 Wimbledon]] they split and became involved in custody case for their son in Los Angeles, which began in August 2017. Azarenka then withdrew from remaining 2017 tournaments.

In January 2018 a tabloid news website reported that Azarenka had won an early round of the U.S. custody proceedings where a Los Angeles County judge ruled that McKeague and Azarenka's child custody case should not take place in Los Angeles County of their U.S. born son but in Belarus. In April 2018 Azarenka returned to the tour, competing in Europe in the Madrid Open, the Italian Open, and later the French Open.<ref>https://www.sport24.co.za/.../azarenka-back-in-europe-after-us-custody-battle-201804</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/01/15/victoria-azarenka-custody-war-tennis/?adid=TMZ_Search_Results|title=Tennis Star Victoria Azarenka Scores Huge Win In Nasty Custody War|work=TMZ|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref>

Azarenka defended the title at the [[2013 Australian Open|Australian Open]], beating Li Na in three sets in the championship match.<ref name="AusOpen2013">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/21211185 | title=Australian Open: Victoria Azarenka beats Li Na to defend title | publisher=BBC | date=26 January 2013 | accessdate=26 January 2013 | author=Newbery, Piers}}</ref>  Her [[2013 Australian Open – Women's Singles|passage to the final]] included a first round win against Monica Niculescu, a second round win against Eleni Daniilidou, a three set win against rising American star Jamie Hampton, a fourth round win against Elena Vesnina, a quarterfinal win against Svetlana Kuznetsova, and a semifinal win against [[Sloane Stephens]] where she took a controversial 10-minute medical timeout citing exaggerated injuries, blaming breathing difficulties and stress.<ref name="2013AusOpen-MedTimeout">{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/beyond-baseline/2013/01/24/victoria-azarenka-medical-timeout-australian-open|title=Victoria Azarenka blames medical timeout on breathing problems|author=Nguyen|first=Courtney|date=24 January 2013|website=Sports Illusterated|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref> Her next tournament was the [[2013 Qatar Total Open|Qatar Total Open]], where she was the defending champion. She advanced to the semifinals with easy wins over [[Romina Oprandi]], [[Christina McHale]], Sara Errani, and Agnieszka Radwańska. In the final, Azarenka faced Serena Williams and defeated her in three sets, successfully defending her title and beating Williams for the first time since 2009.<ref name="Doha2013"/>

In her next event at the WTA Premier Mandatory event [[2013 BNP Paribas Open|BNP Paribas Open]], Azarenka, the defending champion, opened well against two-time Indian Wells winner Daniela Hantuchová. Against 28th seed [[Kirsten Flipkens]], Azarenka dropped the first set and was three games from losing in the second set. Azarenka, however, won twelve straight points to clinch the second set and went on to win the third set easily. In the Round of 16, Azarenka defeated Urszula Radwańska. Azarenka was drawn to meet Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals, however Azarenka was forced to withdraw from the match and the tournament, citing a right ankle injury. As a result, despite her 17-match unbeaten start to the season, Azarenka lost her No. 2 ranking to eventual champion Maria Sharapova.

Even though Azarenka attended the Player's Party in Miami for the [[2013 Sony Open Tennis|Sony Open]], she withdrew from the tournament moments before her first match with American up-and-comer [[Madison Keys]], because she hadn't recovered fully from her right ankle injury. In her first tournament after injury, Azarenka lost to [[Ekaterina Makarova]] in the second round of the [[WTA Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid Open]] but successfully reached the final in the following tournament, the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] by defeating [[Julia Görges]], [[Ayumi Morita]], Sam Stosur, and Sara Errani, but lost to Serena Williams in the final. In the French Open, as the third seed, she reached the semifinal before being defeated by Maria Sharapova who ended the tournament as runner-up. It was, however, a huge improvement made on her weakest surface. She is making huge strides to become a better clay-court player.

Following the victory, Azarenka climbed 22 places in the world rankings to 27th place.<ref>{{Cite web|title=WTA Rankings Update 2020: Azarenka vaults back into Top 30|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/1797568/wta-rankings-update-2020-azarenka-vaults-back-into-top-30|access-date=2020-08-31|website=Women's Tennis Association|language=en}}</ref>

Azarenka was unseeded in singles at the [[2020 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], given that seedings were taken from the rankings the week prior to her big win. She easily defeated [[Barbara Haas]] in the first round, then defeated the fifth seed and world No. 11, her countrywoman [[Aryna Sabalenka]] in the second round. Azarenka then defeated Polish teenager [[Iga Świątek]] in the third round, before coming back from a set down to defeat the 20th seed [[Karolína Muchová]], advancing to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal since the [[2016 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2016 Australian Open]]. With [[Serena Williams]] and [[Tsvetana Pironkova]] also making the last eight, it marked the first time in Grand Slam history that three mothers advanced to the quarterfinals. She easily defeated [[Elise Mertens]] in the quarterfinals, and achieved her first ever Grand Slam victory over Serena Williams in three sets in the semifinals. She thus proceeded to a Grand Slam final for the first time since the [[2013 US Open - Women's Singles|2013 US Open]], where she lost to Osaka, despite leading by a set and a break. Despite the loss, Azarenka's ranking rose to No. 14, her highest ranking since January 2017.

Azarenka carried her good form into the clay court swing, which started the following week at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]], with victories over [[Venus Williams]] and reigning Australian Open champion [[Sofia Kenin]]. The win over Kenin was the tenth [[double bagel]] in Azarenka's career, and her first on [[Clay court|clay]] since 2011.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1306657270629978112|date=17 September 2020|user=tennis_gifs|title=Azarenka collects her tenth career double bagel and first on clay since 2011, per Tennis Abstract.}}</ref> After a third-round win due to [[Daria Kasatkina]]'s retirement, she was defeated by [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] in the quarterfinals. However, at a cold and grey [[French Open|Roland-Garros]], Azarenka was defeated in straight sets by [[Anna Karolína Schmiedlová|Anna Karolina Schmeidlova]] in the second round, having courted attention in the previous round for leaving the court mid-match after complaining to tournament staff about the playing conditions<ref>{{Cite web|title=Azarenka storms off court at Roland Garros|url=https://www.itv.com/frenchopen/articles/azarenka-storms-off-court-at-roland-garros|access-date=2020-10-18|website=ITV|language=en}}</ref>.

At the end of the season, Azarenka entered the [[J&T Banka Ostrava Open|Ostrava Open]] as the 4th seed in singles. She reached the finals, but was defeated by Sabalenka in two sets.<ref>https://www.wtatennis.com/news/1875146/sabalenka-seals-azarenka-for-ostrava-title</ref>

==Rivalries==
Throughout her career, Victoria Azarenka has established rivalries with other players on the WTA Tour. Her rivalries with [[Serena Williams]] and [[Maria Sharapova]]<ref>[http://www.espn.co.uk/tennis/sport/story/173925.html WTA big three one step away from a major rivalry] ESPN.co.uk</ref> are among the most significant on the WTA Tour, as all three players have met each other at least fifteen times.<ref name="SerenaH2H">{{cite web|url=http://tennis.matchstat.com/Compare/-241/-5416/-6586 |title=Head-to-Head stats Serena Williams vs. Victoria Azarenka at Matchstat.com |publisher=Tennis.matchstat.com }}</ref><ref name="SharapovaH2H">{{cite web|url=http://tennis.wettpoint.com/en/h2h/79427-101836.html |title=M.

Victoria Azarenka's most notable rivalry is against [[Serena Williams]]. They have met 23 times, including eleven times in Grand Slams, with Serena Williams leading their head-to-head 18–5, 10–1 in Grand Slams, and 5–4 in finals.<ref name="SerenaH2H"/> Their first meeting was at the [[2008 Australian Open]], with then-defending champion Williams winning in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-18/serena-stays-on-course-in-title-defence/1016674 |title=Serena stays on course in title defence |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 January 2008}}</ref> Their next meeting would also be at the Australian Open, in the fourth round in [[2009 Australian Open|2009]], and again Williams was victorious when the Belarusian was forced to retire due to illness, having won the first set but trailing 2–4 in the second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-26/azarenka-bows-out-hurt-williams-advances/2586810 |title=Azarenka bows out hurt, Serena advances |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 January 2009}}</ref> However, {{frac|2|1|2}} months later, Azarenka would achieve her first victory in the rivalry, defeating the American in straight sets in the final of the [[2009 Sony Ericsson Open – Women's Singles|Sony Ericsson Open]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wtatour/5111542/Victoria-Azarenka-the-big-noise-after-beating-Serena-Williams-to-win-Miami-title.html |title= Victoria Azarenka the big noise after beating Serena Williams to win Miami title |work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Mark Hodgkinson|date=5 April 2009|accessdate=6 July 2009 |location=London}}</ref> Williams later won a quarterfinal match between the pair at [[2009 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] on her way to winning that championship.

Once again the pair met at the Australian Open, in the [[2010 Australian Open – Women's Singles#Finals|2010 quarterfinals]]. Azarenka had won the first set and was leading in the second set before Williams came back to win the three-set match, once again on her way to winning the title for the second consecutive year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-01-27/serena-pulls-off-miracle-comeback/311102 |title=Serena pulls off miracle comeback |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 January 2010}}</ref> Her dominance continued with straight-sets victories at the [[2011 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]] and the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 2011, both times coming after Williams' ranking had plummeted to world No. 175 following [[2011 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/04/serena-williams-womens-rankings?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Serena Williams plummets to 14-year low in women's rankings|work= The Guardian|location=London|date=4 July 2011}}</ref>

Azarenka's third victory over Williams came in the final of the [[2013 Western & Southern Open|Western and Southern Open]]; again, a third set was required to decide the outcome, and on this occasion a final-set tiebreak proved to be the difference. However, in a rematch of [[2012 US Open (tennis)|the previous year's final]], Williams got her revenge, defeating Azarenka in the final of the [[2013 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], which, like the previous year, also required a third set. Azarenka then lost to Williams again in the championship match of the [[2014 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]] early in 2014; this defeat marked Azarenka's first at the tournament.<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2014/01/05/mixed-fortunes-for-the-williams-sisters-to-start-the-2014-season/ Mixed fortunes for the Williams sisters to start the 2014 season], ''The Roar'', 5 January 2014</ref>

The pair would not meet again until the [[2015 Mutua Madrid Open]] some 16 months later; Azarenka lost a third round match against Williams in three sets despite holding three match points on her own serve in the final set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-07/kyrgios-stuns-federer-in-madrid-second-round/6450816?section=sport|title=Nick Kyrgios stuns top seed Roger Federer at Madrid Masters to move to third round|publisher=ABC Grandstand Sport (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>
They then met in the third round of the 2015 French Open where Azarenka led by a set and a break before going on to lose 10 of the next 12 games.  In the quarterfinals of the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2015 Wimbledon Championships]], she once again was one set up on Williams, but proceeded to lose the match in three sets.

For their 21st meeting, they faced off in the final of the [[2016 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|2016 Indian Wells Open]]. Victoria earned her fourth win, becoming the first player to defeat Serena four times in a final.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-21/victoria-azarenka-stuns-serena-williams-to-win-indian-wells-wta/7262712</ref> This was followed by another meeting in the second round of [[2019 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] in 2019, which Serena won in two very tight sets. 

In 2020, a resurgent Azarenka recorded her first victory against Williams in a Grand Slam, winning in three sets in the [[U.S. Open|US Open]] semifinal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Azarenka ousts Serena, books Osaka US Open final clash|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/1821691/azarenka-ousts-serena-books-osaka-us-open-final-clash|access-date=2020-09-11|website=Women's Tennis Association|language=en}}</ref>

Despite the lopsided record (18-5 in Williams' favor), many have said that Azarenka is the only player with the ability to consistently challenge Serena.<ref>http://www.thenational.ae/sport/tennis/azarenkas-win-over-williams-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-womens-tennis-following-sharapova-scandal</ref>

===Azarenka vs. Bartoli===
Azarenka and [[Marion Bartoli]] met 12 times between 2007 and 2012. Azarenka led the head-to-head 9–3 overall and 1–0 in the Grand Slams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.wettpoint.com/en/h2h/101836-78856.html |title=V. Azarenka – M.

Azarenka dominated the early rivalry, winning the first six meetings between the pair, including in the second round of the [[2007 Australian Open]], the final of the [[2009 Brisbane International]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-10/teenage-azarenka-wins-brisbane-international/262260 |title=Teenage Azarenka wins Brisbane International |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 January 2009}}</ref> and all four matches that eventuated in 2010. The win in Brisbane marked Azarenka's first success in a WTA Tour final, having previously lost three finals. Bartoli got her first win over Azarenka in Eastbourne in 2011, winning after Azarenka retired with injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.wettpoint.com/en/games/971422.html |title=V. Azarenka – M.

The pair met three times in 2012, with Azarenka winning two of the matches. Bartoli's victory in the [[2012 Sony Ericsson Open|Miami]] quarterfinals was significant though, as it snapped Azarenka's 26-match winning streak to start the season. Bartoli won in straight sets to record what was at the time her third victory over a reigning world No. 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-03-29/azarenka27s-streak-snapped-by-bartoli/3920910 |title=Azarenka's streak snapped by Bartoli – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 March 2012}}</ref> Their last meeting was in the semi-finals of the [[2012 China Open (tennis)|China Open]] with Azarenka avenging the Miami loss on her way to winning the title.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/azarenka-beats-bartoli-set-china-open-final-against-132009832--spt.html |title=Azarenka beats Bartoli to set up China Open final against Sharapova |work=Yahoo!

One of women's tennis most prominent rivalries during the 2010s was the one between Azarenka and [[Maria Sharapova]]. They met 15 times between 2007 and 2015. The head-to-head finished at 7–8 overall in Sharapova's favor, but Azarenka led 2–1 in the Grand Slams and 5–1 in finals.<ref name="SharapovaH2H"/> Together, they reigned as the top two women in the world from January 2012 to January 2013, except for a brief period in July and August when [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] was the world No. 2 behind Azarenka.

Azarenka won their first meeting in 2007, in the second round of the [[2007 Kremlin Cup|Kremlin Cup]] in Moscow.<ref name="2007Kremlin2"/><ref name="2007Kremlin">{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/story/2007-10-11/j.php |title=Sharapova Stunned by Azarenka; Mauresmo Also Bounced at Kremlin Cup |publisher=Tennis-x.com }}</ref> Their first meeting in a WTA Tour final came at the [[2010 Bank of the West Classic]] in Stanford, which Azarenka won for her first (and fourth career) title that year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cronin |first=Matthew |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/01/us-tennis-women-stanford-idUSTRE67020H20100801 |title=Azarenka thrashes Sharapova to win in Stanford |agency=Reuters |date=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/tennis/08/02/asarenka.wins.final.sharapova/index.html |title=Sharapova thrashed in Stanford final |publisher=CNN | date=2 August 2010}}</ref> Azarenka also defeated Sharapova in the [[2011 Sony Ericsson Open – Women's Singles|Miami Masters]] final in 2011 to win her second title at that tournament.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tennis-X.com |url=http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2011-04-02/6706.php |title=Sharapova Shrieked-Down by Azarenka in Miami Final |publisher=Tennis-x.com }}</ref>

The rivalry between the two players started to intensify in [[2012 WTA Tour|2012]], with six meetings between the pair that year, four of them being in finals. Azarenka won four of the six meetings that year, three of them in finals. Their most famous meeting occurred early that year, in the final of the [[2012 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2012 Australian Open]]. This match had historical proportions as Azarenka would become the first player from her country to either win a Grand Slam singles title or become world No. 1, or Sharapova would win her second title at the tournament, having won in [[2008 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2008]]. Ultimately, Azarenka won the match, beating Sharapova in straight sets in one hour and twenty-two minutes and in doing so claimed the world No. 1 ranking for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Briggs |first=Simon |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/australianopen/9046222/Australian-Open-2012-Victoria-Azarenka-crowned-No1-after-victory-over-Maria-Sharapova.html |title=Australian Open 2012: Victoria Azarenka crowned No1 after victory over Maria Sharapova |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 January 2012}}</ref> Azarenka would defeat Sharapova in two further finals, at [[2012 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|Indian Wells]], in [[2012 China Open – Women's Singles|Beijing]] however Sharapova would prevail in the final of the [[2012 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]].

The pair's only meeting in 2013 did not come until the semifinals of the [[2013 French Open|French Open]], where Sharapova won in three sets. This marked the first time Sharapova had beaten Azarenka at a Grand Slam, and improved to 3–0 against her on clay. Sharapova won their next meeting in the third round of the [[2015 BNP Paribas Open]] in straight sets.<ref name="BNPPO2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/4568017/title/sharapova-wins-azarenka-blockbuster|title=SHARAPOVA WINS AZARENKA BLOCKBUSTER|publisher=Women's Tennis Association|date=16 March 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

Azarenka and [[Li Na]] met eleven times between 2008 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.wettpoint.com/en/h2h/101836-100240.html|title=V. Azarenka – N. Li Head to Head Game Statistics, Tennis Tournament Results – Tennis Statistics Wettpoint|work=wettpoint.com}}</ref> Azarenka led the head-to-head 6–5 overall, and 2–1 in championship matches (all of which reached a deciding set), but trailed 1–2 in Grand Slam matches.

Their first meeting was in the final of the [[2008 Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts]] tournament (which has since been renamed as the [[Brisbane International]]), which Li Na won in three sets after Azarenka had won the first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-05/li-storms-to-victory-in-gc-hardcourts-final/1003664|title=Li storms to victory in GC Hardcourts final|work=ABC News}}</ref> Azarenka's first victory over Li was in the third round of the [[2010 Rogers Cup]]. They met three times in 2011, two of which were at the Majors, with Li winning both times, before Azarenka won their third meeting at the [[2011 WTA Tour Championships]], en route to reaching the final.

They met a further three times in [[2012 WTA Tour|2012]], with Azarenka winning each time. They met in the final of the [[2012 Apia International Sydney|Sydney International]], where Azarenka won in three sets after breaking the defending champion Li at 4–3 in the decider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-13/azarenka-victorious-in-sydney-decider/3772550|title=Azarenka victorious in Sydney decider|work=ABC News}}</ref> Azarenka was also victorious in their meetings at [[2012 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]] and the [[2012 WTA Tour Championships|year-end championships]].

Their most notable meeting to date was in the final of the [[2013 Australian Open]]. Both players entered the championship match with one Grand Slam title each (Azarenka who the [[2012 Australian Open]], whilst Li won the [[2011 French Open]]), and in very good form, with Azarenka only dropping one set throughout her run and Li Na having not dropped a set and also having defeated two top four players ([[Agnieszka Radwańska]] and [[Maria Sharapova]]) en route. After Li Na won the first set, Azarenka stepped up her game as Li started to suffer multiple injuries, and eventually won in three sets to successfully defend her Australian Open title and become the first world No. 1 to win a Major since [[Serena Williams]] won [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon in 2010]].<ref name="AusOpen2013"/>

Azarenka lost the pair's last meeting in straight sets at the [[2013 WTA Tour Championships]], playing through a back injury and winning just three games in the process.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-26/li-na-defeats-victoria-azarenka-to-qualify-for-wta-championship/5047658?section=sport Li Na defeats Victoria Azarenka to qualify for WTA Championships semi-finals], ''ABC Grandstand Sport (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)'', 26 October 2013</ref>
