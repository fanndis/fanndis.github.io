'''Person of the Year''' (called '''Man of the Year''' or '''Woman of the Year''' until 1999)<ref>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Eliza|title=Inside the Love Story That Changed the Gay Marriage Battle|url=http://time.com/topic/person-of-the-year/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104526/http://time.com/topic/person-of-the-year/|archive-date=July 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> is an annual issue of the United States [[news magazine]] and [[web site]] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that features and profiles a person, a group, an idea, or an object that "for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year".<ref>{{cite book|title=Person of the Year: 75th Anniversary Celebration|edition=Special Collector's|location=New York|publisher=Time Books|year=2002|oclc=52817840}}</ref> TIME also has a reader's poll that has no effect on the selection, made solely by TIME editors.<ref>https://time.com/5747261/person-of-the-year-2019-reader-poll-results/</ref> In December 2020, ''TIME'' also launched its "'''Kid of the Year'''".

==Background==
The tradition of selecting a "Man of the Year" began in 1927, with ''Time'' editors contemplating the news makers of the years. The idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year of not having aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] on its cover following his historic [[trans-Atlantic flight]]. By the end of the year, it was decided that a cover story featuring Lindbergh as the Man of the Year would serve both purposes.<ref>''Time'' (2002), ''Person of the Year: 75th Anniversary Celebration'', p. 1.</ref>

==Selection==
===U.S. presidents===
Since the list began, every serving [[president of the United States]] has been a Man or Person of the Year at least once with the exceptions of [[Calvin Coolidge]] (in office at time of the first issue), [[Herbert Hoover]] (the subsequent U.S. president), and [[Gerald Ford]]. Most were named Man or Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office; the only one to be given the title before being elected is [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], in 1944 as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, eight years before his election. He subsequently received the title again in 1959, while in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have received the title three times, first as president-elect (1932) and later as the incumbent president (1934 and 1941).

=== Women ===
Prior to 1999, four women were granted the title as individuals: three as "Woman of the Year"—[[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] (1936), [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] (1952), and [[Corazon Aquino]] (1986)—and one as half of the "Man and Wife of the Year", [[Soong Mei-ling]] (1937).<ref name="Soong">{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019710_2019671,00.html |title=Mme Chiang Kai-Shek: 1937 |author=Joan Levenstein |access-date=December 7, 2016 |work=Time}}</ref> "American Women" were recognized as a group in 1975. Other classes of people recognized comprise both men and women, such as "[[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Freedom Fighters]]" (1956), "U.S. Scientists" (1960), "[[Baby boomer|The Inheritors]]" (1966), "[[Middle class|The Middle Americans]]" (1969), "The American Soldier" (2003), "[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]" (2006), "The Protester" (2011) represented on the cover by a woman, and "[[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola fighters]]" (2014). Although the title on the magazine remained "Man of The Year" for both the 1956 "Hungarian Freedom Fighter" and the 1966 "Twenty-five and Under" editions which both featured a woman standing behind a man, and "Men of the Year" on the 1960 "U.S. Scientists" edition which exclusively featured men on its cover. It was not until the 1969 edition on "The Middle Americans" did the title embrace "Man and Woman of the Year".

In 1999, the title was changed to Person of the Year.<ref>The first [http://www.time.com/time/coverspoy/ "Person" of the Year] (rather than "Man / Woman " of the Year) was [[Jeff Bezos]] of [[Amazon.com]].</ref> Women who have been selected for recognition after the renaming include "The Whistleblowers" ([[Cynthia Cooper (accountant)|Cynthia Cooper]], [[Coleen Rowley]], and [[Sherron Watkins]] in 2002), [[Melinda Gates]] (jointly with [[Bill Gates]] and [[Bono]], in 2005), [[Angela Merkel]] in 2015, "The Silence Breakers" in 2017 and [[Greta Thunberg]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/greta-thunberg-time-s-2019-person-year-n1099396 |title=Greta Thunberg is Time's 2019 Person of the Year|first=Safia Samee |last=Ali |first2=Elizabeth |last2=Chuck |work=[[nbcnews.com]] |date=11 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019 |publisher=[[NBC Universal]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://time.com/person-of-the-year-2019-greta-thunberg/ |title=Greta Thunberg: Time's Person of the Year 2019 |first=Charlotte |last=Alter |first2=Suyin |last2=Haynes |first3=Justin |last3=Worland |editor-first=Evgenia |editor-last=Arbugaeva |date=11 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019 |magazine=Time}}</ref>

In 2020, to celebrate [[International Women's Day]], TIME editors released 89 new Time covers, each showing women, in addition to the 11 already chosen, for alternate Person of the Year choices for the past century.<ref>{{Cite web|title=100 Women of the Year {{!}} Time|url=https://time.com/100-women-of-the-year/|access-date=2020-11-18|website=time.com}}</ref>

=== Special awards ===
In 1949, [[Winston Churchill]] was named "Man of the Half-Century", and the last issue of 1989 named [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as "Man of the Decade". The December 31, 1999 issue of ''Time'' named [[Albert Einstein]] the "[[Person of the Century]]". [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] were chosen as runners-up.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Golden|first=Frederic|title=Person of the Century: Albert Einstein|magazine=Time |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019694_2019586,00.html|date=January 3, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

=== Controversial choices ===
Despite the magazine's frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor, and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people.<ref>''Time'' (2002), ''Person of the Year: 75th Anniversary Celebration'', pp. 2, 79.</ref> However, ''Time'' magazine points out that controversial figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]] (1938), [[Joseph Stalin]] (1939 and 1942), [[Nikita Khrushchev]] (1957) and [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] (1979) have also been granted the title for their impacts.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Person of the Year: A Photo History – Notorious Leaders: Controversial Choices|magazine=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2019712_2019694_2019586,00.html|accessdate=September 27, 2013|date=December 16, 2006}}</ref>

As a result of the public backlash it received from the [[United States]] for naming Khomeini as Man of the Year in 1979, ''Time'' has since shied away from using figures who are controversial in the United States for commercial reasons, fearing reductions in sales or advertising revenue.<ref>''Time'' (2002), ''Person of the Year: 75th Anniversary Celebration'', p. 79.</ref>

''Time''{{'}}s Person of the Year 2001, immediately following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], was [[New York City]] mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]].<ref>{{cite news
| author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->
| title        = Giuliani named Time's Person of Year
| url          = http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/23/giuliani.time/
| work         = CNN
| date         = December 26, 2001
| access-date  = December 11, 2018
}}</ref> The stated rules of selection, the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest effect on the year's news, made [[Osama bin Laden]] the more likely choice that year. The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned ''Time's'' earlier decision to select Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as "Person of the Century". The article seemed to imply that Osama bin Laden ''was'' a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as Adolf Hitler was a stronger candidate than Albert Einstein. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most. According to ''Time'', Rudolph Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the September 11th attacks, and Albert Einstein selected for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder.

Another controversial choice was the 2006 selection of "[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]", representing most if not all people for advancing the [[information age]] by using the [[Internet]] (via e.g. [[blogs]], [[MySpace]], [[YouTube]], and [[Wikipedia]]).<ref name="you">{{cite news | author=Lev Grossman | title=You – Yes, You – Are Time's Person of the Year | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570810,00.html | work=Time | date=December 13, 2006 | accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref>

=== Withdrawn selections ===

In 1941, the fictional elephant [[Dumbo]] from the Disney movie of the same name was selected to be "Mammal of the Year", and a cover was created showing Dumbo in a formal portrait style. However, the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7 pre-empted the cover. The U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was named Man of the Year for a record third time, although Dumbo's Mammal of the Year profile still appeared on the inside pages of the magazine.<ref name="WDFM" />

Film-maker [[Michael Moore]] claims that director [[Mel Gibson]] cost him the opportunity to be Person of the Year alongside Gibson in 2004. Moore's controversial political documentary ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' became the highest-grossing documentary of all time the same year Gibson's ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' became a box-office success and also caused significant controversy. Moore said in an interview "I got a call right after the '04 election from an editor from ''Time'' Magazine. He said,' ''Time'' Magazine has picked you and Mel Gibson to be ''Time''{{'}}s Person of the Year to put on the cover, Right and Left, Mel and Mike. The only thing you have to do is pose for a picture with each other. And do an interview together.' I said 'OK.' They call Mel up, he agrees. They set the date and time in LA. I'm to fly there. He's flying from Australia. Something happens when he gets home... Next thing, Mel calls up and says, 'I'm not doing it. I've thought it over and it is not the right thing to do.' So they put Bush on the cover."<ref>{{cite web | title=Michael Moore Defends Cruise, Slags Gibson| url=http://reporter.blogs.com/risky/2006/09/michael_moore_d.html|work=Infectious Greed | date=September 16, 2006 | accessdate=November 29, 2013}}</ref>

On November 24, 2017, U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] posted on the social media network [[Twitter]] that ''Time'' editors had told him he would "probably" be named Person of the Year for a second time, conditional on an interview and [[photo shoot]] which he had refused. ''Time'' denied that they had made any such promises or conditions to Trump, who was named a [[runner-up]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Donald Trump: TIME Person of the Year Runner Up|url=http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-donald-trump-runner-up/|first=Molly|last=Ball|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=7 December 2017|magazine=Time}}</ref>

=== Online poll ===
''Time'' magazine also holds an online poll for the readers to vote for who they believe to be the ''Person of the Year''. While many mistakenly believe the winner of the poll to be the ''Person of the Year'', the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of ''Time''. In the first online poll held in 1998, wrestler and activist [[Mick Foley]] won with over 50% of the votes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mick Foley Cactus Jack Pro Wrestling Legend|url=http://www.mediamanint.com/profiles/foley.html|publisher=Media Man International|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Buechner|first1=M|title=Time Man of the Year Poll Roils Internet|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,17197,00.html|website=time.com|publisher=Time Digital|accessdate=April 15, 2015|date=December 21, 1998}}</ref> Foley was removed from the poll, and the title was given to [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ken Starr]], which led to outrage from the fans of Foley who mistakenly believed the winner of the poll would be the winner of the title.{{cn|date=December 2019}} In 2006, the poll winner was [[Hugo Chávez]], with 35% of the votes, but was not selected as Person of the Year.<ref>{{cite web | title=Chavez wins 'Person of the Year' poll ...
