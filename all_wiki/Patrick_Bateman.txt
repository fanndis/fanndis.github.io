He is a wealthy, [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] Wall Street [[investment banker]] who leads a secret life as a [[serial killer]]. Bateman has also briefly appeared in other Ellis novels and their film and theatrical adaptations.

==Biography and profile==
Bateman, at the beginning of ''American Psycho'', is 26 years old, works as a specialist in [[mergers and acquisitions]] at the fictional Wall Street investment firm of Pierce & Pierce (also Sherman McCoy's firm in ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]''<ref>{{cite news|first=Hermione|last=Hoby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/10/bonfire-of-vanities-tom-wolfe|title= The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=9 January 2010|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>) and lives at 55 West 81st Street, [[Upper West Side]] on the 11th floor of the American Gardens Building (where he is a neighbor of actor [[Tom Cruise]]). In his secret life, however, Bateman is a serial killer murdering a variety of people, from colleagues to the homeless to prostitutes. His crimes—including [[rape]], [[torture]], [[necrophilia]], and [[cannibalism]]—are described in graphic detail in the novel.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.academia.edu/349102/Examining_the_Personality_of_Patrick_Bateman_of_American_Psycho | title=Examining the Personality of Patrick Bateman of American Psycho | author=Chris Schaffer}}</ref>

Bateman comes from a wealthy family. His parents have a house on [[Long Island]], and he mentions a summer house in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]. His parents [[divorce]]d sometime earlier, while his mother became sick and now resides at a [[sanatorium]]. His father, who first appeared in Ellis's preceding novel ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'', grew up on an estate in [[Connecticut]], and now owns an apartment in the [[Carlyle Hotel]] in [[Manhattan]].  He is assumed to be dead as he is mentioned only in past tense during the novel.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lynsay|last=Smith|url=http://www.gothic.stir.ac.uk/blog/i-am-blameless-the-failure-of-the-father-in-american-psycho-part-2-of-2/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824135316/http://www.gothic.stir.ac.uk/blog/i-am-blameless-the-failure-of-the-father-in-american-psycho-part-2-of-2/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 24, 2018|title=‘I am blameless’: The Failure of the Father in American Psycho (Part 2 of 2)|website=

Bateman attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] for prep school.  He graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1984 and [[Harvard Business School]] two years later, and moved to [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.academia.edu/349102/Examining_the_Personality_of_Patrick_Bateman_of_American_Psycho | title=Examining the Personality of Patrick Bateman of American Psycho | author=Chris Schaffer}}</ref>

By the end of the novel, he believes he is about to be arrested for murdering a colleague named Paul Allen and leaves a message on his lawyer's answering machine confessing to his crimes. When he runs into his lawyer at a party, however, the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke, as he had met with Allen only days earlier. Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach and that he is trapped inside a pointless existence: "This is not an exit".<ref>{{cite book|first=Brett Easton|last=Ellis|authorlink=Brett Easton Ellis|title=American Psycho|url=https://archive.org/details/americanpsychono00elli|url-access=limited|publisher=Vintage|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/americanpsychono00elli/page/399 399]}}</ref>

==Personality==
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}
As written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of [[yuppie]] greed; rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and [[conspicuous consumption]]. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another; they often confuse him for other people as well. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo and [[home cinema|home theater]] sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Williams. He has a mistress on the side named Courtney Lawrence, a woman who is involved in his social circle,  and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life for whom he has anything approaching feelings is his secretary, Jean. He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as "Jean, my secretary who is in love with me" and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he "will probably end up married to someday".

Despite his affluence and high social status, Bateman is wracked by feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. He is deeply disliked by others as well - his friends mock him as the "boy next door"; his own lawyer refers to him as a "bloody ass-kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody"; and he is often dismissed as "yuppie trash" by people outside his social circle.

Bateman often expresses doubts regarding his own [[sanity]] and he has periodic attacks of [[psychosis]], during which he [[hallucination|hallucinates]]. It is left open to interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the acts he describes, or whether he is merely hallucinating them; he is, therefore, an [[unreliable narrator]]. In the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the story, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing all of his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman's acts open to audience interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan |url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors |work=Movieline |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>

Although Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion, he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage, panic or grief—being on the "verge of tears"—often over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations. In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he "just wants to be loved". He takes [[psychotropic]]s, like [[Xanax]], to control these emotions. He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance, equality and traditional moral values because he thinks it will make him more likeable, however he truly has no interest in any of the afore mentioned principles. Bateman compensates for his insecurities through obsessive vanity and [[personal grooming]], with unwavering attention to detail. He buys the most fashionable, expensive clothing and accessories possible (e.g., [[Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.|Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Alan Flusser]] and [[Valentino SpA|Valentino suits]], [[Oliver Peoples]] glasses and [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Louis Vuitton]] and [[Bottega Veneta]] leather goods) as a means of effecting some "control" over his otherwise chaotic life. Likewise, he categorizes people by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily "understood" in terms of labels and stereotypes. Bateman's apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste, with the latest music, food, and art.

Bateman kills more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Throughout the novel, he kills men, women, animals, and, in one instance, a child. Bateman murders women mostly for [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] sexual pleasure, often during or just after sex. He kills men because they anger or annoy him or make him feel inferior. In the case of the child, Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it, but found it unsatisfactory since the child's death would not affect as many people as an adult's would. Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes to his friends, co-workers, and even complete strangers ("I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane") just to see if they are actually listening to him. They either are not, or they think that he is joking.

==Outside ''American Psycho''==
Bateman made his first appearance in Ellis' 1987 novel ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (in which Sean, his brother, is a main character); no indication is given that he is a serial killer. Bateman also makes a short appearance in Ellis' 1998 novel ''[[Glamorama]]'', with "strange stains" on the lapel of his Armani suit.

Bateman also appeared in the ''American Psycho 2000'' e-mails, which were written as an advertisement campaign for the movie. Although they are often mistakenly credited to Ellis, they were actually written by one or more unnamed authors and approved by Ellis before being sent out. ''American Psycho 2000'' served as a sort of "e-quel" to the original novel. The e-mails take place in 2000, a little over a decade since the novel. Bateman is in psychotherapy with a Dr. M. He is also married to Jean, his former secretary. They have a son, Patrick Bateman Jr. (P.B.), who is eight years old. In the story, Bateman talks about therapy, trying to get a divorce from Jean, his renewed feelings about murder, and idolizing his son. In the end, it is revealed that the 'real' Bateman, who 'writes' the e-mails, is the owner of the company that produces the movie.

Bateman appeared in Ellis's 2005 novel ''[[Lunar Park]]'', in which the fictionalised Bret Easton Ellis confesses that writing ''American Psycho'' felt like channeling the words of a violent spirit rather than writing anything himself. This ghost—Bateman—haunts Ellis's home. A character also comes to Ellis's Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, and a copycat killer is seemingly patterning himself on Bateman. Toward the novel's end, Ellis writes the 'last' Bateman story as a way of confronting and controlling the character, as well as the issues Ellis created Bateman as a means of countering.  Bateman, for all intents and purposes, dies in a fire on a boat dock.

In the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', protagonist [[Dexter Morgan]], himself a serial killer, uses the alias "Dr. Patrick Bateman" to acquire [[Etorphine|M-99]] for the use of incapacitating his victims.

There is a recurring character in the video game ''[[Criminal Case (game)|Criminal Case]]'' named Christian Bateman (a combination of the names [[Christian Bale]] and Patrick Bateman) modeled after the character.

==In film and on stage==
Though [[Christian Bale]] had been the first choice for the part by both Ellis and Harron, the producers offered the part to [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Brad Pitt]]. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was set to play the character, but Ellis (as explained in the ''American Psycho'' DVD) decided he would appear too young, especially immediately after ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. In addition, his managers thought the role was "too violent" and could potentially hurt his career. Bateman was also portrayed by Dechen Thurman, a brother of [[Uma Thurman]], in the 2000 documentary ''This Is Not an Exit: The Fictional World of Bret Easton Ellis''. Michael Kremko played Bateman in the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', in which the character is killed by a would-be victim. Aside from the character appearing in the film, the sequel has no other connection to the previous film and has been denounced by Ellis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/21/bret-easton-ellis-speaks-out-on-the-american-psycho-sequel|title= Bret Easton Ellis Speaks Out on the American Psycho Sequel|publisher=ign.com |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>

Scenes with the character were shot for the 2002 [[The Rules of Attraction (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]''. Ellis revealed in an interview that director [[Roger Avary]] asked Bale to reprise the role, but Bale turned down the offer, and Avary asked Ellis himself to portray Bateman. Ellis refused, stating that he "thought it was such a terrible and gimmicky idea", and Avary eventually shot the scenes with [[Casper Van Dien]]. The scenes, however, were ultimately cut from the final version of the film.

In a 2009 interview with ''Black Book'', director [[Mary Harron]] said, "We talked about how [[Martian]]-like [the character] Patrick Bateman was, how he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave, and then one day [Christian] called me and he had been watching [[Tom Cruise]] on [[David Letterman]], and he just had this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and he was really taken with this energy."<ref>{{cite web|first=Helen|last=Weston |url=http://www.bbook.com/film/mary-harron-reveals-inspiration-behind-patrick-bateman/|title=Christian Bale's inspiration for 'American Psycho': Tom Cruise |work=[[BlackBook]]|publisher=McCarthy LLC|location=New York City|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>

==Chronology==
*October 1962: Patrick Bateman is born.<ref>The month can be narrowed down by passages where he briefly muses on what it means to be a [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], as well as wondering what he will receive for his birthday in October. The year is 1962, derived from the fact that the novel begins in April 1989 <!-- 1987 in the movie --> and Patrick mentions in the narration that he is 26 years old.</ref>

He has started his own brokerage firm and seems to be wealthier than he was in the original novel. His tastes are even more refined. His homicidal tendencies (or thoughts) seem to have cooled a little with the birth of his son and have mellowed as he has gotten older, but have not disappeared completely.
