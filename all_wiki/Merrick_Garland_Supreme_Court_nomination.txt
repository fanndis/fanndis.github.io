On March 16, 2016, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] nominated [[Merrick Garland]] for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to succeed [[Antonin Scalia]], who had died one month earlier. At the time of his nomination, Garland was the Chief Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]].

This vacancy arose during Obama's [[Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States#Nominations in the last year of a presidency|final year as president]]. Hours after Scalia's death was announced, Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] said he would consider any appointment by the sitting president to be null and void. He said the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the next president—to be elected later that year.<ref name="opposition">{{cite web|date=June 29, 2018|title=What Happened With Merrick Garland In 2016 And Why It Matters Now|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/06/29/624467256/what-happened-with-merrick-garland-in-2016-and-why-it-matters-now|access-date=September 21, 2020|website=npr.org}}</ref><ref name="mcconnell_on_supreme_court_nomination_2016_03_16">{{cite web |url=https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/remarks/mcconnell-on-supreme-court-nomination |title=McConnell On Supreme Court Nomination |date=March 16, 2016 |work=Official website of the Republican Leader of the U.S. Senate (Sen.

Scalia's death brought about an unusual, but not unprecedented, situation in which a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] president had the opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice while the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] controlled the [[United States Senate]]. Before 2016, such a situation had last arisen in 1895, when a Republican-led Senate confirmed Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]]'s nomination of [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]] to the Court in a [[voice vote]];<ref name="dsavage">{{cite news |last1=Savage |first1=David G. |title=Obama unlikely to alter Supreme Court ideology with Republican Senate |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-court-gop-20141109-story.html |access-date=March 12, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bomboy| first=Scott| date=August 13, 2014| title=The facts about Supreme Court nominations and Senate control| work=Constitution Daily| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-facts-about-supreme-court-nominations-and-senate-control/| publisher=National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| access-date=June 15, 2019}}</ref> conversely, in 1988 a Democratic-led Senate had confirmed Republican [[Ronald Reagan]]'s nomination of [[Anthony Kennedy]] and in 1991, a Senate held 57–43 by Democrats nevertheless confirmed [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination#Senate votes|Justice Clarence Thomas]].<ref name="KarMazzone" />{{rp|75–83}} Political commentators at the time widely recognized Scalia as one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the Court, and noted that—while many considered Merrick Garland a [[Centrism#United States|centrist]], and he had been called "essentially the model, neutral judge"<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-04-26|title=The Potential Nomination of Merrick Garland|url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2010/04/the-potential-nomination-of-merrick-garland/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=SCOTUSblog|language=en}}</ref>—a replacement less conservative than Scalia could have shifted the Court's ideological balance for many years into the future.

The 11 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican majority refused to conduct the hearings necessary to advance the vote to the Senate at large, and Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]], 293 days after it had been submitted to the Senate.<ref name="jbravin1" /> This marked the first time since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] that a nominee whose nomination had not been withdrawn had failed to receive consideration for an open seat on the Court.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trickey|first=Erick|title=The History of "Stolen" Supreme Court Seats|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-stolen-supreme-court-seats-180962589/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en}}</ref> Obama's successor, [[Donald Trump]] (a Republican), [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] Judge [[Neil Gorsuch]] to fill the vacancy on January 31, 2017, soon after [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|taking office]].<ref name="jbravin1" />

===Death of Antonin Scalia===
[[File:Antonin Scalia Official SCOTUS Portrait crop.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Antonin Scalia]]]]
On February 13, 2016, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Antonin Scalia]] died unexpectedly while at the [[Cibolo Creek Ranch]] in [[Shafter, Texas]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Alan |title=Justice Antonin Scalia, Who Led a Conservative Renaissance on the Supreme Court, Is Dead at 79 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/antonin-scalia-death.html |date=February 13, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-scalia-ranch-20160214-story.html|title=Scalia's last moments on a Texas ranch – quail hunting to being found in 'perfect repose'|date=February 14, 2016|access-date=February 18, 2016|first=Molly|last=Hennessy-Fiske|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> He was the second of three Supreme Court justices to die in office this century; the others were [[Associate Justice of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] in 2020, and [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] in 2005. Before him, the last [[incumbent]] justice to die was [[Robert H.

Scalia had been appointed associate justice by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in September 1986 to fill the vacancy caused by the elevation of William Rehnquist to chief justice, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. He went on to become a part of the court's [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] bloc, often supporting [[originalist]] and [[textualist]] positions on the interpretation of the constitution, being one of the judges against abortion rights for women and favouring conservative, republican right-wing ideology.<ref>{{citation |last=Toobin |first=Jeffrey |contribution=Lawyers, guns, and money |editor-last=Toobin |editor-first=Jeffrey |title=The oath: the Obama White House and the Supreme Court |pages=[https://archive.org/details/oathobamawhiteho00toob_0/page/111 111–112] |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0385527200 |postscript=. |title-link=The Oath: The Obama White House and The Supreme Court }} [http://www.randomhouse.com/highschool/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385527200 Details.]</ref> 

The vacancy on the Court created by Scalia's death came during a [[United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]] year, the seventh time since 1900 that this has happened.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/|title=Supreme Court vacancies in presidential election years|date=February 13, 2016|access-date=February 18, 2016|first=Amy|last=Howe|work=SCOTUSblog}}</ref> [[Appointments Clause|Article II, Section 2, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants [[plenary power]] to the president to nominate, and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], appoint justices to the Supreme Court.

===Thurmond rule debate {{Anchor|Biden rule}}===
Scalia's election-year death triggered a protracted political battle that did not end until 2017 after a new president had been [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]]. The Senate's Republican leadership was quick to assert that the vacancy should not be filled until after the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].<ref name="mcconnell_on_supreme_court_nomination_2016_03_16" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Results in key cases could change with Scalia's death |url=https://news.yahoo.com/results-key-cases-could-change-scalias-death-094801989--politics.html |website=Yahoo News |access-date=February 15, 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226052715/https://news.yahoo.com/results-key-cases-could-change-scalias-death-094801989--politics.html |archive-date=February 26, 2016 }}</ref> They cited a June 1992 speech by then-senator [[Joe Biden]], in which Biden argued that [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] should wait until after the election to appoint a replacement if a Supreme Court seat became vacant during the summer or should appoint a moderate acceptable to the then-Democratic Senate, as a precedent. Republicans later began to refer to this idea as the "Biden rule". Biden responded that his position was and remained that the president and Congress should "work together to overcome partisan differences" regarding judicial nominations.<ref>{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Julie Hirschfeld |date= February 22, 2016|title=Joe Biden Argued for Delaying Supreme Court Picks in 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/joe-biden-argued-for-delaying-supreme-court-picks-in-1992.html |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]  |access-date=November 22, 2016 }}</ref>

Democrats also countered that the U.S. Constitution obliged the president to nominate and obliged the Senate to give its advice and consent in a timely manner. Republicans argued in response that the Senate was fulfilling its obligation of advice and consent by saying that the next president should make the appointment. There were, however, 11 months left to President Obama's term at the time of Scalia's death, and the Democrats argued that no precedent existed for such a lengthy delay and that previous presidents had nominated individuals in election years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Barbara|title=One-third of all U.S. presidents appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/29/one-third-of-all-u-s-presidents-appointed-a-supreme-court-justice-in-an-election-year/|access-date=March 9, 2016|work=Washington Post}}</ref> Democrats also argued that even if such a precedent existed, President Obama's term had sufficient time remaining that such a precedent would not apply.

On February 23, the 11 Republican members of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] signed a letter to [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate majority leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]] stating their unprecedented intention to withhold consent on any nominee made by President Obama, and that no hearings would occur until after January 20, 2017, when the next president took office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2719115/Senate-SCOTUS-Letter.pdf|title=Letter to Mitch McConnell|publisher=United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|date=February 23, 2016|access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref> This position subsequently became known as the "McConnell rule".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/395696-the-mcconnell-rule-is-law-and-senate-democrats-should-sue-to-enforce-it|title=The 'McConnell Rule' is law, and Senate Democrats should sue to enforce it|author=Levy, Ken|website=The Hill|date=July 8, 2018}}</ref> That August, McConnell, who played an instrumental role in keeping [[Merrick Garland]] from filling Scalia's vacant seat, heralded the party's uncompromising intransigence by declaring to a crowd in Kentucky, "One of my proudest moments was when I looked at Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.{{'}}"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/8/10/1558769/-Supreme-Court-vacancy-watch-Day-179-Where-s-Mitch-McConnell|title=Supreme Court vacancy watch Day 179: Where's Mitch McConnell on Trump's 'Second Amendment people'?|last=McCarter|first=Joan|website=Daily Kos|date=August 10, 2016|access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://crooksandliars.com/2016/08/mitch-mcconnell-mitch-mcconnell-proud|title=Mitch McConnell: Proud Moment When I Told Obama 'You Will Not Fill This Supreme Court Vacancy'|author=Scarce|website=Crooks and Liars|date=August 9, 2016|access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/34561-2|title=Tea Party-Aligned Kentucky Gov May End 95-Year Democratic Reign|last=Roarty|first=Alex|website=Roll Call|date=August 6, 2016|access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>

===Scholars and lawyers urging Senate to consider a nominee===

In a letter sent to President Obama on March 3, 2016, a different group of predominantly progressive scholars of American history, politics, and the law wrote to President Obama to "express our dismay at the unprecedented breach of norms by the Senate majority in refusing to consider a nomination for the Supreme Court made by a president with eleven months to serve in the position."<ref name="ExpertsLetter">{{cite web |first=Tanya |last=Somanader |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/03/10/letter-experts-president-supreme-court-nominee |title=Letter from the Experts: The President's Supreme Court Nominee Deserves a Chance |date=March 10, 2016}} See also [https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/supreme_court_letter_to_the_president.pdf PDF version] of letter.</ref> The scholars wrote:
<blockquote>
It is technically in the power of the Senate to engage in aggressive denial on presidential nominations. But we believe that the Framers' construction of the process of nominations and confirmation to federal courts, including the Senate's power of "advice and consent," does not anticipate or countenance an obdurate refusal by the body to acknowledge or consider a president's nominee, especially to the highest court in the land. The refusal to hold hearings and deliberate on a nominee at this level is truly unprecedented and, in our view, dangerous ...

The Constitution gives the Senate every right to deny confirmation to a presidential nomination. But denial should come after the Senate deliberates over the nomination, which in contemporary times includes hearings in the Judiciary Committee, and full debate and votes on the Senate floor. Anything less than that, in our view, is a serious and, indeed, unprecedented breach of the Senate's best practices and noblest traditions for much of our nation's history.<ref name="ExpertsLetter"/>

On March 7, 2016, a group of 356 law professors and other legal scholars released a letter (organized through the progressive judicial advocacy group [[Alliance for Justice]]) to the Senate leadership of both parties urging them "to fulfill your constitutional duty to give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a prompt and fair hearing and a timely vote." The letter writers argued that Senate Republicans' announcement that they would refuse to consider any Obama nominee was a "preemptive abdication of duty" that "is contrary to the process the framers envisioned in [[Article II of the United States Constitution|Article II]], and threatens to diminish the integrity of our democratic institutions and the functioning of our constitutional government."<ref name="ALJLetter">[http://www.afj.org/press-room/press-releases/over-350-law-professors-urge-senators-to-fulfill-their-constitutional-duty Over 350 law professors urge senators to fulfill their constitutional duty], Alliance for Justice (March 7, 2016).

In March 2016, former [[Governor of Utah|Utah governor]] [[Jon Huntsman Jr.]], a Republican, and former [[Connecticut]] U.S. senator [[Joseph Lieberman]], an independent, both co-chairs of the problem-solving group [[No Labels]], wrote that "there is no modern precedent for the blockade that Senate Republicans have put in place. Even highly-contentious nomination battles in the past, including those over [[Robert Bork]] and Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], followed the normal process of hearings and an up-or-down vote. Leaving the current blockade in place could leave a seat on the Court vacant for the remainder of this term and perhaps the next as well, which could leave major cases in limbo until 2018. That is simply not acceptable. We cannot let today's crisis of leadership turn into a full-blown [[constitutional crisis]]."<ref name="HuntsmanLieberman">Jon Huntsman & Joseph Lieberman, [http://time.com/4271942/supreme-court-compromise/ The Republican SCOTUS Blockade Is 'Not Acceptable'], ''Time'' (March 25, 2016).</ref>

That same month, [[John Joseph Gibbons]] and [[Patricia Wald]], the former chief judges of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]], respectively, warned that the Senate's refusal to act on a Supreme Court nomination "would set a dangerous precedent, and invite attempts to extend it to other situations where the Executive and the Legislative branches are in political conflict with one another."

===Scholarly and legal counterarguments===
[[George Mason University]] law professor [[Ilya Somin]] argued the Constitution imposes no such duty upon the Senate to hold confirmation hearings and to give a nominee an up-or-down vote.<ref>{{cite news | author = Ilya Somin | title = The Constitution does not require the Senate to give judicial nominees an up or down vote | date = February 17, 2016 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/17/the-constitution-does-not-require-the-senate-to-give-judicial-nominees-an-up-or-down-vote/ | work = The Washington Post | access-date = March 21, 2016 | author-link = Ilya Somin }}</ref> [[Jonathan H.

Bernstein also noted that a Democratic-controlled Senate in 1960, in reaction to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s 1956 [[recess appointment]] of [[William J.

==Nomination==
===Potential candidates===
Prior to Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, media commentators speculated about [[Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates#Names mentioned as likely nominees|who might be nominated]] to fill the vacancy on the Court. A number of writers argued that the Senate Republicans would continue to block the confirmation process regardless of the nominee, and suggested that Obama may as well choose a candidate for political motives. For instance, [[Michael Tomasky]] suggested that a nomination of [[Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar]] may encourage [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]s to vote in the [[2016 United States presidential election|November 2016 election]] and "alter the presidential race dramatically as well."<ref name="GOPNightmare">{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/15/the-gop-s-worst-nightmare-scotus-nominee.html |access-date=February 17, 2016 |date=February 17, 2016 |last=Tomasky |first=Michael |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |title=The GOP's Worst Nightmare SCOTUS Nominee}}</ref> [[Tom Goldstein]], arguing that "[t]he nomination itself is part of the president's legacy, even if partisan politics prevents confirmation," recommended nominating a black woman to encourage black and female voters to participate in the election.<ref name="SCOTUSblogThoughts">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/continued-thoughts-on-the-next-nominee-and-impressions-of-judge-ketanji-brown-jackson/ |access-date=February 17, 2016 |date=February 17, 2016 |last=Goldstein |first=Tom |work=[[SCOTUSblog]] |title=Continued thoughts on the next nominee (and impressions of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson)}}</ref> Goldstein concluded that the most likely candidate of such description was [[Ketanji Brown Jackson]].<ref name="SCOTUSblogThoughts"/>

Other commentators suggested that Obama should compromise by selecting a centrist or even moderate conservative candidate. After analyzing voting trends for Supreme Court nominees since the confirmation of [[Hugo Black]] in 1937, political scientists Charles Cameron and Jonathan Kastellec explained that "even an ideological twin of Justice [[Stephen Breyer]]—the most moderate of the court's current liberals—would fail to get even a majority of votes in the current Senate".<ref name="HowNomineeCouldWin">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/17/how-an-obama-supreme-court-nominee-could-win-confirmation-in-the-senate/ |access-date=February 17, 2016 |date=February 17, 2016 |last1=Cameron |first1=Charles |last2=Kastellec |first2=Jonathan |work=[[The Washington Post]] |title=How an Obama Supreme Court nominee could win confirmation in the Senate}}</ref> Without naming potential nominees, Cameron and Kastellec concluded that the Senate would only approve "a highly qualified moderate."<ref name="HowNomineeCouldWin"/> In that vein, Senate Minority Leader [[Harry Reid]] suggested the nomination of Republican [[Governor of Nevada|Governor]] [[Brian Sandoval]].<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Liptak | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Raju | first2 = Manu | last3 = LoBianco | first3 = Tom | title = Obama offers Supreme Court hints; top Democrat suggests Republican governor | url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/24/politics/obama-supreme-court-nominee/ | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = February 24, 2016 | access-date = March 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1 = Martin |first1 = Jonathan |last2 = Healy |first2 = Patrick | title = Supreme Court Path Is Littered With Pitfalls, for President and G.O.P. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/us/politics/supreme-court-path-is-littered-with-pitfalls-for-president-and-gop.html | newspaper = The New York Times | date = February 16, 2016 | access-date = March 3, 2016}}</ref>  However, Sandoval soon withdrew his name from consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/182542/20160225/brian-sandoval-nevada-governor-withdraws-name-supreme-court-consideration-breaking.htm|title=Brian Sandoval, Nevada Governor, Withdraws Name From Supreme Court Consideration |work=Headlines & Global News}}</ref> Zachary A.

On March 16, 2016, President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], to fill the vacant seat on the Court.<ref name="NYTAnnouncementShear">{{cite news |last1= Shear |first1=Michael D. |last2=Harris |first2=Gardiner |date=March 16, 2016 |title=Obama Chooses Merrick Garland for Supreme Court |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/us/politics/obama-supreme-court-nominee.html?_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref> In a formal [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] ceremony, Obama, flanked by Garland and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], declared: "I have selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of America's sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency, modesty, integrity, even-handedness and excellence. Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their term; neither should a Senator."<ref name="NYTAnnouncementShear"/> He went on to say: "To suggest that someone as qualified and respected as Merrick Garland does not even deserve a hearing, let alone an up-or-down vote, to join an institution as important as our Supreme Court, when two-thirds of Americans believe otherwise—that would be unprecedented."<ref name="NYTAnnouncementShear"/> Garland then briefly spoke, stating that "fidelity to the Constitution and the law have been the cornerstone of my professional life" and promising to "continue on that course" if confirmed for the Supreme Court.<ref name="NYTAnnouncementShear"/>

The White House simultaneously released a biographical video of Garland, featuring old photographs of Garland and his family, an interview with the judge, and archival footage of him at the scene of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], which Garland investigated.<ref name="DavisVideo">Julie Hirschfeld Davis, [https://www.nytimes.com/live/obama-supreme-court-nomination/white-house-releases/ White House Releases Video of Garland], ''The New York Times'' (March 16, 2016).</ref> In the video, Garland states: "When I am standing with the President and he announces my nomination, I actually think it is going to feel a little bit like it is an [[out-of-body experience]]."<ref name="DavisVideo"/>

==Response to the nomination==
Immediately following the president's announcement of Garland, Senate Majority Leader, [[Mitch McConnell]], announced a firm refusal to consider nominees to the Supreme Court until the next presidential inauguration.  Citing what he called "the Biden Rule", McConnell argued that there should not be a nomination so close to the next presidential and congressional election, but rather that the nomination should await the outcome of that election (which was 8 months away, and 10 months to the next presidential and congressional [[inauguration]]s):<ref name="mcconnell_on_supreme_court_nomination_2016_03_16" /><ref name="what_every_republican_said_newshour_pbs_org" />

:"The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country, so of course the American people should have a say in the Court’s direction…The American people may well elect a President who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next President may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy.’<ref name="mcconnell_on_supreme_court_nomination_2016_03_16" />
...declaring:
:"The Senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the nominee the next President nominates, whoever that might be."<ref name="mcconnell_on_supreme_court_nomination_2016_03_16" />

Senator Orrin Hatch said: "I think well of Merrick Garland. I think he is a fine person.

Over 150,000 people signed a "[[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]]" petition posted in November 2016 on the White House website asking President Obama to independently appoint Garland to the Supreme Court, espousing the theory that the Senate had waived its advise and consent role. The petition received an official White House response, but the administration did not embrace the petitioners' point of view.<ref name="WashPo111816"/>

Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the [[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]], after languishing 293 days.<ref name=jbravin1>{{cite news | first = Jess | last = Bravin | author-link = Jess Bravin | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-obamas-supreme-court-nomination-of-merrick-garland-expires-1483463952 | title = President Obama's Supreme Court Nomination of Merrick Garland Expires | publisher = Wall Street Journal | date = January 3, 2017 | access-date = March 16, 2019}}</ref> [[Donald Trump]], Barack Obama's successor, consistently opposed the Garland nomination during the presidential campaign.<ref name="arappeport1">{{cite news|last1=Rappeport|first1=Alan|title=Donald Trump Rejects Garland Nomination|url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/obama-supreme-court-nomination/donald-trump-rejects-garland-nomination/|access-date=October 14, 2016|work=New York Times|date=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Soon after taking office, Trump [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Neil Gorsuch]] to fill the vacancy caused by Justice Scalia's death; he was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.

==Effect of vacancy on rulings==
Scalia's death left the court with eight judges for a majority of its [[2015 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States|2015 term]] and the beginning of its [[2016 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States|2016 term]], and the vacancy was the second-longest since 1900.<ref name="cingraham1"/> With the vacancy persisting for some time, the Court showed a reluctance to [[certiorari|accept new cases]].<ref name="Hurley"/> The Court's slow pace in accepting new cases reflected "an increased cautiousness considering the real possibility of 4–4 deadlocks on anything ideologically divisive".<ref name="Hurley">Lawrence Hurley, [https://www.yahoo.com/news/divided-u-supreme-court-cautious-taking-cases-215451631.html "Divided U.S. Supreme Court cautious about taking new cases"], Reuters (April 4, 2016).</ref> From the time of Scalia's death in late February 2016 until the first week of April 2017, the Court accepted only three cases, none likely to be controversial. By contrast, over the previous five years the Court took up an average of eight cases over the same period.<ref name="Hurley"/>

For cases that were not decided before his death, Justice Scalia's votes were not counted, with the cases decided by the remaining eight members of the Court.<ref name = "CloseCases">{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Tom |date=February 13, 2016 |title=What happens to this Term's close cases?

Citing [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|the Court's practices]] following the death of Justice [[Robert H.
