==Early life and education==

David Brock was born in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] and was adopted by Dorothea and Raymond Brock.<ref name="blind1">Stated in Brock's ''[[Blinded by the Right]]''</ref><ref>Lei, Richard.

Brock grew up in [[Wood-Ridge, New Jersey]], where he went to Our Lady of the Assumption School, and later attended [[Paramus Catholic High School]] in [[Paramus, New Jersey]]. During his sophomore year of high school, Brock's family moved to the [[Dallas, Texas]], area where Brock attended [[Newman Smith High School]]. Brock became editor of his high school newspaper, which he says he "fashioned into a crusading liberal weekly in the middle of the Reaganite Sunbelt".<ref>Brock, David.

Brock attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he worked as a reporter and editor for ''[[The Daily Californian]]'', the campus newspaper. Brock arrived at college as a liberal Democrat, but at Berkeley he was "repelled by the culture of doctrinaire leftism" and turned to the political right.<ref name=nation1214/> The turning point came with a column supporting the US invasion of Grenada that he wrote for ''The Daily Californian'' and that led to demands he resign from the newspaper staff. "I thought it was McCarthyism of the left," Brock later said. "I thought it was extremely intolerant."<ref name="nyt0295"/> He then founded a neoconservative weekly, the ''Berkeley Journal''.<ref name=nation1214/>

He graduated from Berkeley with a B.A. in history in 1985.

==Journalism career==

===Conservative journalism===

While he was at Berkeley, Brock contributed an op-ed to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' entitled "Combating Those Campus Marxists". It drew the attention of [[John Podhoretz]], who at the time was the editor of ''Insight'', a weekly newsmagazine published by ''[[The Washington Times]]''. Podhoretz flew Brock to Washington, D.C., for an interview and hired him as a writer of the weekly conservative news magazine ''[[Insight on the News]],'' a sister publication of ''The Washington Times'', a job Brock took up in 1986.<ref name=nation1214/>

After working at ''Insight'', Brock spent some time as a fellow at [[The Heritage Foundation]].<ref name=nation1214/>

===''The Real Anita Hill''===
{{Main|The Real Anita Hill}}

In March 1992, in a 17,000-word article for ''[[The American Spectator]]'', Brock challenged the claims of [[Anita Hill]], who had accused [[Clarence Thomas]] of sexual harassment. Shortly thereafter Brock became a full-time staff member at that publication. In 1993, Brock expanded his article into a book, ''The Real Anita Hill''. Brock's description of Hill in the book as "a bit nutty and a bit slutty" was widely quoted.<ref name=nation1214/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,167355,00.html|title=Smearing Anita Hill: A Writer Confesses|last=Carlson|first=Margaret|date=2001-07-09|work=Time|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

The book became a best-seller. It was later attacked in a book review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' by [[Jane Mayer]], a reporter for ''The New Yorker,'' and [[Jill Abramson]], who was at that time a reporter for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. The two later expanded their article into the book ''Strange Justice,'' which cast Anita Hill in a much more sympathetic light. It, too, was a best-seller. Brock replied to their book with a book review of his own in ''The American Spectator.''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/27/us/book-author-says-he-lied-his-attacks-anita-hill-bid-aid-justice-thomas.html|title=Book Author Says He Lied in His Attacks on Anita Hill in Bid to Aid Justice Thomas|last1=Kuczynski|first1=Alex|last2=Glaberson|first2=William|date=June 27, 2001|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> In that review, he asserted that Mayer and Abramson had no evidence to claim that Clarence Thomas was a habitual user of pornography. Later, in his book ''[[Blinded by the Right|Blinded By the Right]]'', he wrote, "When I wrote those words, I knew they were false. I put a lie in print."<ref>{{Harvnb|Brock|2002|p=246}}</ref>

===Troopergate===
{{main|Troopergate (Bill Clinton)}}

In a January 1994 ''The American Spectator'' story about [[Bill Clinton]]'s time as governor of [[Arkansas]], Brock, by then on staff at the magazine, made accusations that bred [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|Troopergate]].<ref name="cnnapology"/> Among other things, the story contained the first printed reference to [[Paula Jones]], referring to a woman named "Paula" who state troopers said offered to be Clinton's partner.<ref name="cnnapology"/> Jones called Brock's account of her encounter with Clinton "totally wrong", and she later sued Clinton for [[sexual harassment]], a case that became entangled in the [[Kenneth Starr|independent counsel]]'s investigation of the [[Whitewater controversy]], and set in motion a series of developments that led to the exposure of Clinton's affair with [[Monica Lewinsky]] and, ultimately, to Clinton's impeachment trial.<ref name=nation1214/> The story received an award later that year from [[Joseph Farah]]'s [[Western Journalism Center]], and was partially responsible for a rise in the magazine's circulation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rendall|first=Steve |title=The Real David Brock: A Right-Wing Hatchet Man |date=March 1, 1995 |work=[[Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting]] |url=http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/the-real-david-brock |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}</ref>

===''The Seduction of Hillary Rodham''===
{{main|The Seduction of Hillary Rodham}}

After the success of ''The Real Anita Hill'', [[Simon & Schuster]]'s then-conservative-focused [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] subsidiary paid Brock a large advance to write a book about [[Hillary Clinton]]. The expectation was that it would be a takedown in the style of his writings on Anita Hill and Bill Clinton. The project, however, took a different turn, and the resulting book, ''The Seduction of Hillary Rodham'', proved to be largely sympathetic to Mrs. Clinton. Given the large advance and tight one-year deadline by Free Press, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In ''Blinded by the Right'' (2002), Brock said that he had reached a turning point: he had thoroughly examined charges against the Clintons, could not find any evidence of wrongdoing and did not want to make any more misleading claims. Brock further said that his former friends in [[right-wing politics]] shunned him because ''Seduction'' did not adequately attack the Clintons. ''National Review'' proposed another theory: since "no liberal source in the world would talk to Brock", he could not collect the kind of information he was after. ''National Review'' also suggested that while writing the book, Brock had been "seduced" by [[Sidney Blumenthal]], a champion and friend of the Clinton circle.<ref name="natrev0601">{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Jonah |title=Brock’s Self-Borking |work=[[National Review]] |date=June 28, 2001 |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/204960/brocks-self-borking-jonah-goldberg |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D91039F937A15750C0A9649C8B63&pagewanted=all |last=Bruni |first=Frank |title=Sorry About That |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 24, 2002 |accessdate=March 11, 2009}}</ref>

When the book came out, it was widely criticized for not breaking any new ground. John Balzar, reviewing the book in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', called it "[e]xhaustive to the point of exhaustion" and "predictably critical but unexpectedly measured, at least in comparison to what Beltway gossips anticipated".<ref>{{cite news |first=John|last=Balzar |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-13/books/bk-53231_1_david-brock |title=The Seduction of Hillary Rodham |date=October 13, 1996 |at=And I Quote |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref> [[James B. Stewart]], reviewing the book in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that Brock had "tried to do his subject justice in the broadest sense" but added that "[a]t times he goes too far," often "echo[ing] her apologists" and "dismiss[ing] or rationaliz[ing] the sometimes powerful evidence that Hillary Rodham Clinton has lied...by invoking a relativism rooted in Republican precedents."<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=James B. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/13/books/innocence-betrayed.html |title=Innocence Betrayed |date=October 13, 1996 |at=Books |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

==Changing sides==

''[[The Nation]]'' has described Brock as a "conservative journalistic assassin turned progressive empire-builder"<ref name="nation1214"/> while ''[[National Review]]'' has called him a "right-wing assassin turned left-wing assassin"<ref name="natrev0315"/>  and ''[[Politico]]'' has profiled him as a "former right-wing journalist-turned-pro-Clinton crusader".<ref name="pol0915"/>

In July 1997, ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine published a confessional piece by Brock entitled "Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man" in which he recanted much of what he said in his two best-known ''American Spectator'' articles and criticized his own reporting methods.<ref name="ajr0595">{{cite magazine |last=Shepard |first=Alicia C. |date=May 1995 |title=Spectator's Sport |work=[[American Journalism Review]] |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1608 |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510193738/http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1608 |archive-date=May 10, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="esq0797">{{cite magazine |last=Brock|first=David |title=Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=July 1997 |url=http://classic.esquire.com/confessions-of-a-right-wing-hit-man |url-access=subscription}}</ref> Discouraged at the reaction his [[Hillary Clinton]] biography received, he said, "I ... want out. David Brock the Road Warrior of the Right is dead." Four months later, ''The American Spectator'' declined to renew his employment contract, under which he was being paid over $300,000 per year.

Writing again for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in April 1998, Brock apologized to Clinton for his [[muckraking]] journalism about Troopergate.<ref name="cnnapology"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Talk Today: David Brock |work=[[USA Today]] |date=March 22, 2002 |type=Text interview |url=http://cgi1.usatoday.com/mchat/20020319003/tscript.htm |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/highlight/david-brock-on-anita-hill-smear-campaign-i-regret-it/55f99b9b02a760c4ec0002b1 |title=David Brock On Anita Hill Smear Campaign: 'I Regret It' |first=Josh |last=Zepps |author-link=Josh Zepps |work=[[HuffPost Live]] |date=September 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924072935/http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/highlight/david-brock-on-anita-hill-smear-campaign-i-regret-it/55f99b9b02a760c4ec0002b1 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2001, Brock accused one of his former sources, Terry Wooten, of leaking [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] files for use in his book about Anita Hill. Brock defended his betrayal of a confidential source by saying, "I've concluded that what I was involved in wasn't [[journalism]], it was a political operation, and I was part of it.... So I don't think the normal rules of journalism would apply to what I was doing".<ref name=WPKurtz>{{cite web

=== ''Blinded by the Right'' ===
{{Main|Blinded by the Right}}

Brock's book ''Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative'' was published in 2002. In this book, an "outgrowth" of ''Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man'', Brock charted what the ''Daily Beast'' called his "remarkable metamorphosis to ardent acolyte from sworn enemy of Bill and Hillary Clinton."<ref name= "beast1115"/> Brock apologized for his attacks on the Clintons and Anita Hill and claimed that he had now risen above character assassination. He wrote that he had been "a mad dog, an emotional monster," "a whore for the cash," "a Jew in Hitler's army," and "a witting cog in the Republican sleaze machine," and asserted that he hadn't known "what good reporting was."<ref name= "beast1115"/>

Many critics responded with skepticism to Brock's claim to have reformed himself. The reviewer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that Brock "quotes the worst things critics said about him, and agrees with every word".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2002/03/17/turn-turn-turn/8d506873-a625-4bf6-9b06-1ffe99680fdd |title=Turn, Turn, Turn |first=Bruce|last=Bawer |date=March 17, 2002 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |at=Books |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref> [[Christopher Hitchens]], in ''[[The Nation]]'', called Brock's book "an exercise in self-love, disguised as an exercise in self-abnegation," and declared that Brock was failing to state the truth. These and other critics noted that Brock, while claiming to feel remorse for his attacks on the Clintons and professing to have put personal assaults behind him, now seemed as eager to go after targets on the right as he had once gone after targets on the left. Hitchens responded with disgust, for example, to Brock's "coarse attack" in the book on [[Juanita Broaddrick]], who had accused Bill Clinton of rape. Hitchens was particularly harsh, stating that Brock "inserts a completely gratuitous slander against a decent woman, all of whose independent assertions have survived meticulous fact-checking".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Real David Brock |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |author-link=Christopher Hitchens |date=May 9, 2002 |work=[[The Nation]] |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/real-david-brock |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

Many readers on the left, however, greeted the book with enthusiasm, and eagerly welcomed Brock. This was especially true of the Clintons. Shortly after the book's publication, Bill Clinton phoned Brock at home and praised it lavishly. Later, according to ''Politico'', "Brock was invited to the former president's [[Harlem]] office where he was shocked to discover Clinton had purchased dozens of copies — and stuffed them into a big cabinet". Clinton, it turned out, was mailing them to friends across the country.<ref name="pol0915">{{cite news |last1=Thrush |first1=Glenn |last2=Gold|first2=Hadas|author-link=Hadas Gold|title=David Brock: The New York Times has 'a special place in hell' |work=[[Politico]] |date=September 10, 2015 |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/david-brock-new-york-times-hell-213484 |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}</ref>  Clinton "insisted" that Brock contact his speaking agent and give talks around the country attacking conservatives.<ref name="nyt0915">{{cite news |last=Rosin|first=Hanna |title=David Brock's 'Killing the Messenger' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 21, 2015 |at=Books |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/books/review/david-brocks-killing-the-messenger.html |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> According to ''The Nation'', Democratic donors "loved Brock's conversion story, particularly since he'd been inside the machine they hoped to replicate."<ref name=nation1214/>  Brock's book is seen as having propelled him into a favorable position among the Democratic Party establishment.<ref name= "beast1115"/>

===''The Republican Noise Machine''===
{{Main|The Republican Noise Machine}}

Brock directly addressed the right-wing "machine" in his 2004 book, ''The Republican Noise Machine'', in which he detailed an alleged interconnected, concerted effort to raise the profile of conservative opinions in the press through false accusations of [[Media bias in the United States#Liberal bias|liberal media bias]], dishonest and highly [[partisan (political)|partisan]] columnists, partisan news organizations and academic studies, and other methods.

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' described it as a "blistering j'accuse" that, compared to ''Blinded by the Right'', was "a less gossipy and more systematic assault on the right-wing media juggernaut." Brock, according to ''PW'', depicted the mainstream media as being "cowed by spurious charges of 'liberal bias'" and as therefore having "abandoned their role as objective arbiters of truth in favor of an uncritical airing of partisan ideology in the name of 'balance.'" ''PW'' stated that Brock could not "be accused of nonpartisanship."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4000-4875-5 |date=May 18, 2004 |title=THE REPUBLICAN NOISE MACHINE: Right-Wing Media and How It Corrupts Democracy |at=Nonfiction Book Review |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

Also in 2004, he featured briefly in the [[BBC]] series ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', where he stated that the [[Arkansas Project]] engaged in political terrorism.

==Political operative career==

===Media Matters for America===
{{main|Media Matters for America}}

In 2004, Brock founded the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|progressive]] media watchdog group [[Media Matters for America]] (MMA) which describes itself as being “dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.”<ref name= "guard1114"/> Brock said that he founded the organization to combat the conservative journalism sector that he had once been a part of.

When Brock proposed the idea of Media Matters, Hillary Clinton invited him to the Clintons' Chappaqua home to pitch the idea to potential donors.<ref name="nyt0915"/> MMA, according to a 2015 article in ''The Daily Beast'', "operates from a posh Washington office space with a multi-million-dollar budget and nearly 100 employees."<ref name="beast1115"/>  In 2014, ''The Nation'' stated that "Brock, in partnership with fundraiser Mary Pat Bonner—often described as his secret weapon—has turned out to be unparalleled at maintaining rich liberals' loyalty and support." An insider told ''The Nation'' that Brock and Bonner "are probably the most effective major-individual-donor fundraising team ever assembled in the independent-expenditure progressive world."<ref name=nation1214/>

It was reported in June 2015 that when the [[House Select Committee on Benghazi]] questioned Sidney Blumenthal, committee members asked no fewer than 45 questions about Brock and Media Matters.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cramer |first=Ruby |title=David Brock Asks Benghazi Committee: Why So Interested In Me? |date=January 22, 2015 |work=[[BuzzFeed]] |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/david-brock-asks-benghazi-committee-why-so-interested-in-me |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref> The committee was reportedly interested in Sidney Blumenthal's paid work for Brock's nonprofits, and in the question of "whether Blumenthal and Brock did anything improper as they helped Clinton manage the political fallout from the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, while she was secretary of State."<ref name="lat0715"/>

Brock announced in 2010 that he was forming a [[Political action committee|Super PAC]], [[American Bridge 21st Century]], to help elect [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal Democrats]], starting with the [[2012 United States elections|2012 election cycle]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Ruggiero |first=Mark |title=Bridge to Somewhere: Democrats Launch Fundraising Super-PAC |date=January 14, 2011 |work=[[Campaigns & Elections]] |url=http://www.campaignsandelections.com/publications/campaign-election/2011/January-2011/Bridge-to-Somewhere-Democrats-Launch-Fundraising-Super-PAC |accessdate=June 25, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2011, Brock founded the PAC, which seeks "to track every utterance of every major GOP candidate." The ''Los Angeles Times'' described him as having "reinvented the art of opposition research." The group's work reportedly "did so much damage to Republicans in the 2012 elections" that they sought to replicate Brock's efforts.<ref name="lat0715"/>

In describing Brock's intentions for the [[super-PAC]], ''The New York Times'' referred to Brock as a "prominent Democratic political operative"<ref name="nytpac">{{cite news |last=Luo|first=Michael |title=Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P.

The group has more than 80 staffers.<ref name= "guard1114"/> It has researchers based in Washington, D.C., plus "a national network of professional trackers" who follow the moves and statements of every conceivable contender for the Republican nomination.<ref name=nation1214/> 
''The Nation'' has described American Bridge as "the natural next step" after MMA, explaining that "Brock took the Media Matters method—which involves monitoring virtually every word uttered by the right-wing media—and transferred it to the realm of Republican politicians."<ref name=nation1214/> Democratic operative [[Paul Begala]] told ''The Nation'' that in 2012 American Bridge "produced for us a 950-page book of every business deal of [[Mitt Romney]]'s career. We spent something like $65 million [2012 election], and I believe every single ad was in some ways informed by Brock's research."<ref name=nation1214/>

In 2019, the American Bridge PAC disclosed $250,000 in independent expenditures for anti-Trump advertisements, according to the filings posted to the FEC's website. Earlier in the year, the organisation announced it will launch a $50 million effort to "weaken" Trump in Midwest states for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. Brock's efforts against the Republican Party have been criticised and referred to as "useless" by Democratic operatives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freebeacon.com/politics/david-brock-pac-drops-2-million-into-anti-trump-ads/|title=David Brock PAC Drops $2 Million Into Anti-Trump Ads|last=Schoffstall|first=Joe|date=2019-12-17|website=Washington Free Beacon|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>

===Correct the Record===
{{main|Correct the Record}}

In late 2013 Brock founded [[Correct the Record]], described by ''The New York Times'' as Hillary Clinton's "own personal media watchdog," keeping track of all negative news surrounding her.<ref name="nyt0915"/>  Brock had first come up with the idea for the group that summer. "Having left the State Department," he said, "Clinton didn't have the kind of robust operation that one would have if one was holding public office. That's where I saw the need." The organization, whose staff "is crammed into a newsroom-style bullpen in the back corner of the offices of American Bridge 21st Century," "keeps constant watch for any conceivable attacks against her, and then aggressively beats them back before they take hold."<ref>{{cite news |last=Caldwell |first=Patrick |title=David Brock's army of 'nerd virgins' has Hillary's back |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=September 2014 |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/david-brock-hillary-clinton-correct-the-record |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

In September 2015, Brock and Correct the Record produced a piece on [[Bernie Sanders]], linking him to [[Hugo Chavez]] and British Labour Party leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]].<ref name= "beast1115"/>

===Priorities USA Action===
{{main|Priorities USA Action}}

In early 2014, Brock was named to the board of [[Priorities USA Action]] as the super PAC also announced its support for a possible [[Hillary Clinton]] presidential run in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last=Confessore |first=Nicholas |title=Biggest Liberal 'Super PAC' to Fund Possible Clinton Bid |date=January 23, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/us/politics/biggest-liberal-super-pac-to-fund-possible-clinton-bid.html |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> In February 2015, Brock abruptly resigned his position with the super PAC.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vogel |first=Kenneth P. |title=David Brock resigns from Hillary Clinton PAC |date=February 9, 2015 |work=[[Politico]] |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/david-brock-resigns-priorities-usa-action-115028.html |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}</ref> In his resignation letter, he accused Priorities officials of conducting "an orchestrated political hit job" against MMA and American Bridge. ''The New York Times'' had run an article questioning his groups' fundraising practices, and he charged that "current and former Priorities officials were behind this specious and malicious attack on the integrity of these critical organizations."<ref name= "natrev0315">{{cite news |last=Tuttle |first=Ian |title=Why David Brock Will Say Anything for the Clintons |date=March 6, 2015 |work=[[National Review]] |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/414985/why-david-brock-will-say-anything-clintons-ian-tuttle |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Confessore |first=Nicholas |title=The Secret World of a Well-Paid 'Donor Adviser' in Politics |date=February 5, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/us/in-invisible-world-of-political-donor-advisers-a-highly-visible-player.html |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=English |first=H.

===The American Democracy Legal Fund===

Brock also founded and runs the American Democracy Legal Fund, a nonprofit that has been accused of existing solely to create “a steady stream of lawsuits accusing Republicans of ethics and campaign finance violations.”<ref name="lat0715"/>

===American Independent Institute===
{{main|American Independent Institute}}

In 2014, Brock relaunched the American Independent News Network, formerly a network of progressive state-based reporting outlets, into the [[American Independent Institute]], a group which provides grants for liberal investigative journalism projects. Brock serves as the group's president.<ref>{{cite news |last=Byers|first=Dylan |title=David Brock to launch journalism institute |date=June 19, 2014 |work=[[Politico]] |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/06/david-brock-to-launch-journalism-institute-190746 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref> The Institute finances journalists "investigating rightwing activities."<ref name= "guard1114"/>  In 2014, it gave $320,000 in grants "to reporters investigating right-wing misdeeds."<ref name=nation1214/>

===CREW===
{{main|Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington}}

In 2014, Brock became the chairman of the [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] board of directors, in what was characterized as a more explicitly partisan stance for the organization.<ref>{{cite news |last=Singer |first=Paul |title=Ethics watchdog drops its non-partisan veneer |date=August 14, 2014 |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2014/08/14/ethics-watchdog-drops-its-non-partisan-veneer/81232064/ |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> Brock was elected as CREW's board president after laying out a broad plan to turn the organization into a more muscular and partisan organization. ''Politico'' described this as “a major power play that aligns liberal muscle more fully behind the Democratic Party — and Hillary Clinton” and said that Brock had set forth a plan "to turn the group into a more muscular — and likely partisan — attack dog."<ref name="vogel0814"/>

While CREW operates as a 501(c)3 nonprofit prohibited from engaging in partisan activity, Brock made clear he intends to create a more politically oriented arm registered under section [[501(c)4]], and also form a new overtly partisan watchdog group called The American Democracy Legal Fund registered under section 527, allowing it to engage in direct political activity. Along with Brock's election, consultant David Mercer and investor Wayne Jordan joined CREW's board of directors. When asked if CREW would still continue pursuing complaints against Democrats, Brock responded, "No party has a monopoly on corruption and at this early juncture, we are not making categorical statements about anything that we will and won't do. Having said that, our experience has been that the vast amount of violations of the public trust can be found on the conservative side of the aisle."<ref name=vogel0814>{{cite news |last=Vogel|first=Kenneth |title=David Brock expands empire |date=August 13, 2014 |work=[[Politico]] |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/david-brock-citizens-for-responsibility-and-ethics-in-washington-110003 |accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>

=== ''Killing the Messenger'' ===

In his 2015 book ''Killing the Messenger: The Right-Wing Plot to Derail Hillary Clinton and Hijack Your Government'', Brock described "how the Clintons quickly switched from prey to patrons, setting him on his current path as a fundraiser and progressive provocateur." In the book, Brock accused ''The New York Times'' of being a “megaphone for conservative propaganda” directed inordinately at Clinton.<ref name="pol0915"/> He was particularly critical of the ''Times's'' senior politics editor and former Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan. At the same time, in the words of ''Politico'', he depicted Bill and Hillary Clinton "as personal and political angels."<ref name="pol0915"/>

Calling the book a "trenchant j'accuse," ''Publishers Weekly'' said that parts of it "read like a fund-raising prospectus" for MMA but concluded that while "Brock's rhetorical venom and naked partisanship will alienate some readers ... his sharp-eyed reporting makes for a spirited challenge to business-as-usual political discourse."<ref>{{cite web |date=September 21, 2015 |title=Killing the Messenger: The Right-Wing Plot to Derail Hillary and Hijack Your Government |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |at=Nonfiction Book Review |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4555-3376-3 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref> ''The Daily Beast'' described the book as “partly a sanitized summary of Brock's already exhaustively-chronicled personal history, partly an attack on the journalism establishment, and partly a call to arms on behalf of his favorite presidential candidate.”<ref name= "beast1115"/>

Hanna Rosin wrote that it reads like "pages that bullet-point Hillary's accomplishments as secretary of state or the achievements of the Clinton Foundation." Rosin alleged that the book attempted to whitewash any criticisms surrounding the Clintons. Rosin stated: "So dogged is Brock's devotion to Hillary that it often gets in the way of his being credible, not to mention interesting."<ref name="nyt0915"/>

Responding to Brock's criticism of ''The New York Times'', Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the newspaper, told CNN: "David Brock is an opportunist and a partisan who specializes in personal attacks." Murphy complained that Brock's "partisanship has led him to lash out at some of our aggressive coverage of important political figures and it's unsurprising that he has now turned personal."<ref>{{cite news |title=David Brock's new book takes on GOP, New York Times |date=September 14, 2015 |last=Zeleny|first=Jeff |work=[[CNN]] |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/14/politics/david-brock-new-book-hillary-clinton/index.html |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

In October 2015, Brock gave a presentation at [[Georgetown University]] entitled "Is the Mainstream Media in Cahoots with Conservatives?".<ref>{{cite news |title=David Brock Takes on the Right-Wing Conspiracy |date=October 21, 2015 |last=El-Fakir |first=Alexander |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/print/blogs/david-brock-takes-right-wing-conspiracy_1049629.html |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

===Purchase of ''Blue Nation Review''===

In 2015, Brock formed an investment venture, True Blue Media, to purchase an 80 percent stake in ''Blue Nation Review'', an online news website. ''Blue Nation Review'' was later re-branded as ''[[Shareblue]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Grim|first1=Ryan |last2=Arana|first2=Gabriel |title=Sale Of Blue Nation Review Gives Hillary Clinton Camp Its Very Own Media Outlet |date=November 20, 2015 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-brock-blue-nation-review_us_564f0f3de4b0879a5b0a7bc5 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

===Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign===

The ''Los Angeles Times'' has described Brock as “integral to Hillary's run” for the presidency in 2016.<ref name="lat0715"/> Clinton adviser Paul Bagela commented: What kind of a movement would we be if we rejected converts? He saw the permanent intellectual and ideological infrastructure they have on the right and brought it to the left.”<ref name="lat0715"/> 

A March 6, 2015, article in ''National Review'' noted that while other “Democratic kingmakers” were “in retreat” in the wake of the news that Hillary Clinton had “used a private e-mail account on a private server to avoid public scrutiny while secretary of state,” Brock remained fiercely loyal.<ref name= "natrev0315"/>  Appearing on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe'' in 2015, Brock insisted that Clinton had violated no rules by using a private email server.<ref name="natrev0315"/>

It was reported on September 1, 2015, that a batch of Hillary Clinton's emails that had been made public included one from Brock entitled "Memo on Impeaching Clarence Thomas." In the memo, Brock discussed possible ways of trying to bring down the Supreme Court justice whose cause he had championed in ''The Real Anita Hill''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clinton Emails Show David Brock Floating Idea of Impeaching Clarence Thomas |date=September 1, 2015 |last=Scott |first=Shackford |work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] blog |url=https://reason.com/blog/2015/09/01/clinton-emails-show-david-brock-floating |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

''[[Politico]]'' reported in January 2016 that Brock was preparing a new advertisement that would call on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders "to release his medical records before the [[United States presidential election in Iowa, 2016|Iowa caucuses]] on Feb. 1." Brock was subjected to a storm of criticism for this plan, and only hours after Politico's report, Clinton campaign chairman [[John Podesta]] scolded Brock on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/clinton-surrogate-to-demand-sanders-release-medical-records-217880 |title=Clinton surrogate to demand Sanders release medical records |date=January 16, 2016 |last=Karni |first=Annie |work=[[Politico]] |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

Later in January, Brock responded to a Sanders campaign ad by telling the Associated Press: "From this ad, it seems black lives don't matter much to Bernie Sanders," Sanders aides responded by accusing Brock of "mudslinging." Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement: "Bernie Sanders, as everyone knows, has one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress. He doesn't need lectures on civil rights and racial issues from David Brock, the head of a Hillary Clinton Super Pac." Briggs added: "Twenty-five years ago it was Brock – a mud-slinging, right-wing extremist – who tried to destroy Anita Hill, a distinguished African American law professor. He later was forced to apologize for his lies about her. Today, he is lying about Sen Sanders. It's bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special-interest money in her Super Pacs. It is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock."<ref>{{cite news |title=Sanders smeared as communist sympathiser as Clinton allies sling mud |first=Dan|last=Roberts |date=January 22, 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/22/bernie-sanders-communist-sympathiser-hillary-clinton-us-election-2016?CMP=share_btn_tw |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

At a campaign event in Iowa in late January 2016, Bernie Sanders denied any plans to "bus in out-of-state college students to caucus for him," charging that this was a lie and attributing it to Brock.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sanders Says He'll Struggle to Win Iowa With Low Voter Turnout |date=January 28, 2016 |last1=McMahon|first1=Madeline |last2=Niquette|first2=Mark |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-28/sanders-says-he-ll-struggle-to-win-iowa-with-low-voter-turnout |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

It was reported on February 1, 2016, that Brock was still drawing a salary from American Bridge 21st Century, which was legally prohibited from coordinating with the Clinton campaign, while also drawing a salary from Correct the Record, which was "directly working with the Clinton campaign on Internet-based pushback against the controversies that have dogged her presidential bid." This situation was described as "pushing campaign finance boundaries," with experts saying that Brock had found loopholes to circumvent campaign finance restrictions. Robert Maguire of the [[Center for Responsive Politics]] suggested that Brock was "running a shadow campaign" via a network of groups that Maguire called "the Brocktopus."<ref>{{cite news |title=Experts: David Brock Pushing Campaign Finance Boundaries |date=February 1, 2016 |last=Markay |first=Lachlan |work=[[Washington Free Beacon]] |url=http://freebeacon.com/politics/experts-david-brock-pushing-campaign-finance-boundaries |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

On February 8, 2016, after the near-tie in the Iowa caucuses between Clinton and Sanders, Brock told ''Politico'' that "Senator Sanders is trying to live in the purity bubble, and it needs to be burst." He described Sanders's efforts to link Clinton to [[Wall Street]] as an "artful smear," and, in a reference to the Democratic National Committee's passing of data to the Sanders campaign the previous December, said that Clinton "would've been hounded out of the race if her staff had done what his did, in stealing data and misleading the press about it, then raising money off it." Clinton's campaign, Brock insisted, "has stayed remarkably positive in the face of a relentlessly negative campaign from Sanders." As for Sanders's platform, Brock maintained that "a unanimous chorus of serious progressive commentators ... find almost nothing of any substantive value in his so-called policies."<ref>{{cite news |title=Brock: Time for Bernie's 'purity bubble' to be burst |date=February 8, 2016 |last=Debenedetti |first=Gabriel |work=[[Politico]] |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/david-brock-bernie-sanders-218954 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

=== Activism to bring forth sexual assault allegations ===
''The New York Times'' reported in December 2017 that a group founded by Brock had spent $200,000 in an unsuccessful effort to bring forward accusations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/us/politics/sexual-harassment-politics-partisanship.html|title=Partisans, Wielding Money, Begin Seeking to Exploit Harassment Claims|last=Vogel|first=Kenneth P.|date=2017-12-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He was reportedly considering doing the same to congressional Republicans.<ref name=":0" />

==Personal life==
Brock was formerly the domestic partner of William Grey; [[Fox News]] reported that their relationship ended in a bitter, three-year-long legal battle in which "Brock and Grey traded angry accusations, ... replete with charges of blackmail, theft and financial malfeasance" related to a house in [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware]] that the two once shared.<ref name="Winter">{{cite news |last=Winter|first=Jana |title=Media Matters boss paid former partner $850G 'blackmail' settlement |date=February 27, 2012 |work=[[Fox News]] |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> The news channel further reported that Grey filed a lawsuit against Brock in January 2011, and Brock [[Countersuit|countersued]] Grey in March 2011.<ref name="Winter"/> The dispute was settled at the end of 2011 on confidential terms.<ref name="Winter"/> On March 22, 2017, Brock suffered a heart attack while at work at Media Matters headquarters; he was expected to fully recover.<ref>{{Cite news |title=David Brock, Media Matters founder and Clinton ally, suffers heart attack |date=March 22, 2017 |work=[[Fox News]] |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/22/david-brock-media-matters-founder-and-clinton-ally-suffers-heart-attack.html |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Vogel |first=Kenneth P.  |title=David Brock suffers heart attack |work=[[Politico]] |date=March 22, 2017 |url=https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/03/david-brock-heart-attack-236378 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Potential legal conflicts===

Brock's simultaneous involvement with Correct the Record, American Bridge, and Priorities USA Action raised legal questions, given that the first two groups work closely with Hillary Clinton's campaign while Priorities USA Action, the largest [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[super PAC]], is legally prohibited from doing so. Brock claimed to have stopped working directly with American Bridge, although its staffers continued to operate out of his office. Paul Ryan, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, considered complaining about Brock to the [[Federal Election Commission]] and Justice Department, charging that he was "creating new ways to undermine campaign regulation."<ref name="time0915">{{cite news |last=Sherer |first=Michael |title=Hillary Clinton's Bulldog Blazes New Campaign Finance Trails |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=September 10, 2015 |url=http://time.com/4028459/david-brock-hillary-clinton-media-matters |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

===Comments about Brock===

In 2001, [[Jonah Goldberg]] wrote in ''National Review'' that while Brock has been "hailed by liberals for 'coming clean,' they would never really trust him." He quoted reporter Jill Abramson as having said that "the problem with Brock's credibility" is that "once you admit you've knowingly written false things, how do you know when to believe what he writes?"<ref name= "natrev0601"/> Similarly, ''The Guardian'' referred in 2014 to "residual unease among some liberal operatives that Brock's conversion story fits into a pattern of opportunism and self-promotion rather than ideological transformation."<ref name= "guard1114">{{cite news |last=Helmore |first=Edward |title=Once the scourge of Democrats, former Republican plays tough for Hillary Clinton |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 29, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/29/david-brock-former-republican-hitman-hillary-clinton |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> Observing in 2015 that Brock had admitted to mudslinging before, ''The Daily Beast'' noted a difficulty in dispatching fears he would do it again.<ref name="beast1115"/>

Brock's claim that the Clintons have never committed any wrongdoing has received criticisms from many, including fellow Democrats, who have cited instances of abuse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hillary Clinton Doesn't Deserve a Free Pass From the Media |date=March 26, 2014 |first=Peter|last=Beinart |work=[[The Atlantic]] |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/hillary-clinton-doesnt-deserve-a-free-pass-from-the-media/359672 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}</ref>
