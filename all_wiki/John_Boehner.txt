== Early political career ==
From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of [[Union Township, Butler County, Ohio]].

In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent Congressman [[Buz Lukens]], who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. In a three-way Republican primary that included Boehner, Lukens, and former Congressman [[Tom Kindness]], Boehner won with 49 percent of the vote.<ref name="talberta">{{cite news |last1=Alberta |first1=Tim |title=John Boehner Unchained |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/29/john-boehner-trump-house-republican-party-retirement-profile-feature-215741 |accessdate=30 October 2017 |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=1 November 2017}}</ref> He then handily beat his Democratic opponent, [[Greg Jolivette]], in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1990|November election]].

=== Gang of Seven and ''Contract with America'' ===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the [[Gang of Seven]] which was involved in bringing media attention to the [[House banking scandal]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/us/politics/05boehner.html A Rabble-Rouser, Then and Now], ''The New York Times'', [[Carl Hulse]], July 4, 2009</ref> The group also [[Congressional Post Office scandal|investigated the Congressional Post Office]], leading to the indictment of Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]].<ref name="talberta"/> Later, he, along with [[Newt Gingrich]] and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the ''[[Contract with America]]'' in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the [[United States elections, 1994|1994 elections]] during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

=== Republican leadership ===
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference Chairman]], making him fourth-ranking House Republican behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]].<ref name="talberta"/> During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN |title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/lessonslearnedha0000ging/page/159 159–160] |url=https://archive.org/details/lessonslearnedha0000ging/page/159}}</ref>

After Republicans lost seats in the [[United States elections, 1998|1998 elections]], the House Republican leadership underwent a reorganization. Armey and DeLay kept their positions, but Gingrich was replaced by [[Dennis Hastert]], and Boehner lost his position as conference chairman to [[J.C. Watts]].<ref name="talberta"/>

=== Chairman of Committee on Education and Labor ===

Following the election of President [[George W. Bush]], Boehner was elected as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and the Workforce Committee]], serving from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]] and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite news |author=George F.

=== House Republican Leader ===
[[File:John Boehner portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|2006 portrait of Boehner]]
After Delay resigned as Majority Leader in 2005, Boehner, House Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]], and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], all sought to become Majority Leader.<ref name="talberta"/> Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]" process and rein in government spending. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as Majority Whip, the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call |accessdate=2006-02-04 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204102043/http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |archivedate=February 4, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref> due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]] of Puerto Rico to vote).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader. While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to [[Nancy Pelosi]].

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918155340/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df=mdy}}</ref> As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].

[[File:Speaker's Farewell.tif|thumb|300px|Speaker Boehner looks at the National Mall from the Speaker's balcony at the U.S. Capitol for one of the final times before leaving office]]
On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after [[Pope Francis]]' [[Pope Francis' visit to the United States|address to Congress the day before]], an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government.  Conservative opposition to funding [[Planned Parenthood]] as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the resignation.<ref name="resign1">{{cite news |title=John Boehner Will Resign From Congress |first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/us/boehner-will-resign-from-congress.html |date=September 25, 2015 |accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> Originally, House Majority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] of California had intended to run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite.

== Controversies ==
{{criticism section|date=June 2015}}

=== Connections to lobbyists ===
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from [[tobacco industry]] [[lobbyist]]s on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dana Milbank |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html |title=Boehner Makes His Political Comeback |work=The Washington Post |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> In a 1996 documentary by [[PBS]] called ''The People and the Power Game'', Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that's gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."<ref>{{citation |title='The Rachel Maddow Show' (transcript) |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39459613 |date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Boehner eventually led the effort to change House rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House floor.<ref>See [http://www.rules.house.gov/ruleprec/109th.pdf House Rule IV 7] at rules.house.gov. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829022048/http://www.rules.house.gov/ruleprec/109th.pdf |date=August 29, 2006}}</ref>

A September 2010 story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and that "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/us/politics/12boehner.html |title=A G.O.P.

=== Smithsonian ===
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] after he learned that it featured a video by [[David Wojnarowicz]], ''A Fire in My Belly'', that contained an image of a [[crucifix]] with ants crawling on it.

=== Hurricane Sandy relief bill ===
On January 1, 2013, after passing the [[fiscal cliff]] [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|deal]], Boehner adjourned the House without passing the $60 million [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill]]. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Chris Christie]] harshly criticized Boehner.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/chris-christie-slams-john-boehner-hurricane-sandy-presser-18120271 |title=Gov.

=== Challenged 2015 House Chair election ===
Many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were ready for a new [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] Chairman following the 2014 mid-term elections.

Boehner has been classified as a "hard-core conservative" by [[OnTheIssues]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.issues2000.org/OH/John_Boehner.htm |title=John Boehner on the Issues |publisher=Issues2000.org |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref> Although Boehner has a conservative voting record, when he was running for House leadership, religious conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "From [[illegal immigration]] to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021100842.html |title=Washington Post |date= February 12, 2006|accessdate=June 14, 2010 | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] friends" such as Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a [[Democrat Party (epithet)|Democrat Party]] with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-[[9/11]] world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in [[Iraq]]."

=== Financial crisis ===
[[File:President Obama & John Boehner debt ceiling negotiations.jpg|thumb|left|Speaker Boehner meets with President Obama at the White House during the 2011 debt ceiling increase negotiations]]
On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Ben Bernanke]], and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.<ref>[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/lawmakers-inside-advantage-trading "Lawmakers' inside advantage to trading"] ''Marketplace.''

Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President [[Barack Obama]], including the "[[cap and trade]]" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying "one dime" to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.<ref name="Wereschagin" /> He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |title=House GOP Economic Recovery Alternative Will Create 6.2 Million New American Jobs &#124; Republican Leader John Boehner |publisher=Republicanleader.house.gov |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608232152/http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}</ref> and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep.

Nothing to see here."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Budryk |first1=Zack |title=Boehner won't say whether he'd back Biden over Trump |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/453774-boehner-wont-say-whether-hed-back-biden-over-trump |accessdate=2020-08-22 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=2020-08-18}}</ref>

Boehner joined the board of tobacco company [[Reynolds American]] on September 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Egan |first=Matt |url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/09/15/investing/john-boehner-smoking-joins-tobacco-company/ |title=Heavy smoker John Boehner joins tobacco company's board |publisher=CNN Business |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}</ref>

In 2018 Boehner joined the board of [[Acreage Holdings]], a [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] corporation, to promote the [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical use of cannabis]] and advocate for [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|federal de-scheduling]] of the drug (a shift from his previous stance while in Congress).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gstalter |first1=Morgan |title=Boehner joins cannabis company board to push for medical use |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/382614-boehner-joins-board-of-cannabis-company-for-push-for-medical |website=The Hill |accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> In 2019, Boehner was named chair of the National Cannabis Roundtable, a cannabis lobbying organization.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tucker |first1=Randy |last2=Borchardt |first2=Jackie |title=John Boehner to chair new national cannabis lobbying group |url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2019/02/08/cannabis-former-house-speaker-john-boehner-chair-new-lobbying-group/2810644002/ |accessdate=March 5, 2019 |work=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
In reporting his pending retirement, ''[[Politico]]'' summarized his Speakership:
:Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] over the [[debt limit]], government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.<ref>Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, John Bresnahan and Lauren French, "Speaker John Boehner retiring from Congress at the end of October" [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/speaker-john-boehner-retiring-from-congress-at-the-end-of-october-214056#ixzz3mlVEHpBf ''Politico'' September 25, 2015]</ref>

Paul Kane in ''The Washington Post'' emphasizes how none of the "big deals" he sought were ever reached:
:Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.<ref>Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the 'big deal' he wanted" [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-nearly-five-years-boehner-could-never-land-the-big-deal-he-wanted/2015/09/25/6bf22bd2-63b3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html ''Washington Post'' Sept 25, 2015]</ref>

Furthermore, Kane argues, Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, "a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner's easygoing style did not fit."<ref>Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the 'big deal' he wanted"</ref>

== Personal life ==
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the [[Wetherington, Ohio|Wetherington]] section of [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester Township]]. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=James Rowley |date=October 28, 2010 |title=Boehner's Blue-Collar Roots Frame Possible Next Speaker's Views |journal=Business Week |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628225642/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011}}</ref>

On May 15, 2016, Boehner was awarded the [[Laetare Medal]], considered the highest honor for [[American Catholics]], by the [[University of Notre Dame]]. The medal was awarded in conjunction with [[Joe Biden]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=May 16 |first1=Religion News Service |title=Biden, Boehner receive high Catholic honor |url=https://newbostonpost.com/2016/05/16/biden-boehner-receive-high-catholic-honor/ |website=NewBostonPost |accessdate=31 July 2020 |date=16 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Joe Biden and John Boehner: Our Faith Inspires Political Compromise |url=https://time.com/4336490/joseph-biden-john-
