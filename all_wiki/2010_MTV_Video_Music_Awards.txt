==Controversy==

===will.i.am's blackface criticism===
Some viewers took offense to the producer/ rapper [[will.i.am]]'s outfit, especially the dark makeup, which, to some fans, was reminiscent of the antiquated, racially charged practice of [[blackface]]. After fans blasted the rapper online, he took to Twitter to defend the look as artistic expression and not an embrace of the controversial maquillage typically used to lampoon African-Americans. Will.i.am responded to the backlash on his Twitter stating "1st. just because I where all black including head mask as expression and emphasize my outfit, it shouldn't be looked at as racial," Will tweeted. "Let go of the past. there are far more important things 2 bark about. (Jobs, health, education) not a black man wearing all black everything." Will.i.am insisted the face paint was a harmless costume choice and that fans concerned with the image Will's look projected should focus on larger issues.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/09/13/2010-09-13_william_takes_to_twitter_to_defend_his_blackface_makeup_during_performance_on_mt.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Elliptical vs. treadmill: Which will give you the better workout? | first=Cristina | last=Everett | date=2010-09-13| accessdate= 13 September 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100915034834/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/09/13/2010-09-13_william_takes_to_twitter_to_defend_his_blackface_makeup_during_performance_on_mt.html| archivedate= 15 September 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>

===Lady Gaga's meat dress===
{{Main article|Lady Gaga's meat dress}}

While accepting her award for Video of the Year, presented by legendary singer and actress [[Cher]], Lady Gaga wore a [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|dress made entirely from cuts of raw meat]]. The dress bore a resemblance to an artwork, ''[[Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic]]'', created by Canadian artist [[Jana Sterbak]] in 1987.<ref>[http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/957 Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic – Collections – Walker Art Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221113917/http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/957 |date=2010-12-21 }}. Collections.walkerart.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-25.</ref> Along with the dress, her hat, shoes, and purse were all made from meat as well. [[PETA]] president Ingrid Newkirk issued a statement concerning the controversial outfit. After questioning whether the meat was real or not, Newkirk was quick to disparage Gaga saying, "Meat is the decomposing flesh of a tormented animal who didn't want to die, and after a few hours under the TV lights, it would smell like the rotting flesh it is and likely be crawling in maggots--not too attractive, really." [[Franc Fernandez]], the designer of the meat dress, said later in an interview with MTV, “...it's not a sticky meat. It's not a messy dress at all, surprisingly. [...] It's actually very clean meat, very sturdy and strong and doesn't run at all. [...] The meat dries out, rather than rotting. It becomes jerky.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Everything You Wanted To Know About Lady Gaga's VMA Meat Dress! |first=Sharon |last=Clott |publisher=[[MTV Networks]] |url=http://style.mtv.com/2010/09/13/2010-vmas-lady-gaga-meat-dress-real/ |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2010-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917015849/http://style.mtv.com/2010/09/13/2010-vmas-lady-gaga-meat-dress-real/ |archivedate=17 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gaga later explained to [[Ellen DeGeneres]] that the outfit exhibited her disapproval with the United States military's [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy and further clarified, "If we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. And I am not a piece of meat."<ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Richard|title=The Performance Identities of Lady Gaga|year=2012|publisher=McFarland and Company Inc. Publishers|page=112}}</ref>  She also commented on the outfit's nature, "...it is certainly no disrespect to anyone that is vegan or vegetarian. As you know, I am the most judgment-free human being on the earth." Afterwards, DeGeneres, who is a [[vegan]], jokingly gave Gaga a [[bikini]] and [[skirt]] made from [[lettuce]] and other various vegetables.<ref name="Newkirk">{{cite web| title= Lady Gaga's Meat Dress| first= Ingrid| last= Newkirk| publisher= [[PETA]]| url= http://blog.peta.org/archives/2010/09/lady_gaga_meat_dress.php| date= 2010-09-13| accessdate= 2010-09-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100915034058/http://blog.peta.org/archives/2010/09/lady_gaga_meat_dress.php| archivedate= 15 September 2010| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Vena"/>
