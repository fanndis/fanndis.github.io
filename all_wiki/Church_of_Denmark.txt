[[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] was [[Christianization of Scandinavia|introduced to Denmark]] in the 9th century by [[Ansgar]], [[Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]]. In the 10th century, King [[Harald Bluetooth]] became a Catholic and began organizing the church, and by the 11th century, Christianity was largely accepted throughout the country. Since the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]], the Church has been [[Evangelical Lutheran]], while retaining much of its pre-Reformation [[liturgy|liturgical]] traditions. 
The 1849 [[Constitution of Denmark]] designated the church "the Danish people's church" and mandates that the state support it as such.<ref>According to the [[Constitution of Denmark]] § 4, "the Evangelical-Lutheran Church is the Danish people's church and is supported as such by the State" ("den evangelisk-lutherske kirke er den danske folkekirke og understøttes som sådan af staten")</ref>

The Church of Denmark continues to maintain the [[historical episcopate]]. [[Theological]] authority is vested in [[bishop]]s: ten bishops in mainland Denmark and one in [[Greenland]], each overseeing a diocese. There is no archbishop; the [[Diocese of Copenhagen|Bishop of Copenhagen]] acts as a ''[[primus inter pares]]''.

==Organization==

[[File:Peter Skov-Jakobsen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Skov-Jakobsen]], current [[Bishop of Copenhagen]] since 2009]]

===Dioceses===
The Church of Denmark is organized in eleven [[diocese]]s, each led by a [[bishop]], including one for Greenland (the [[Faroe Islands]] was a twelfth diocese until 29 July 2007). There are no [[archbishop]]s; the most senior bishop (''[[primus inter pares]]'') is the [[Bishop of Copenhagen]], currently [[Peter Skov-Jakobsen]]. The further subdivision includes 111 [[deanery|deaneries]] and 2,200 [[parish]]es. There are about 2,400 ordained pastors (Danish: ''præst'').<ref>Role description and numbers (currently 2,400) for a ''præst'' are shown on the [http://www.lutheranchurch.dk/who-we-are/who-works-in-the-church/the-pastor/ official website] of the church.</ref>

===Parishes===
Each parish has a parochial council, elected by church members in four-year terms. The parochial council leads the practical business of the local church and decides employment of personnel, including the pastors, musicians, [[verger]], and [[sacristan]]. The pastor (Danish: ''præst'') is subordinate to the council, except in spiritual matters such as conducting [[church service]]s and [[pastoral care]]. Parishes in the same local area are grouped into Deaneries, with one priest serving as Rural Dean. Deaneries, parochial councils, and pastors are all subordinate to the bishop of the diocese.

====Voluntary congregations====
A special feature is the possibility of creating voluntary [[wikt:congregation|congregations]] (''valgmenighed'') within the Church. These account for a few percent of church members. They are [[voluntary association]]s, electing their own parochial council and parish pastor, whom they agree to pay from their own pockets. In return, they are exempt from [[church tax]]. The voluntary congregation and its pastor are subordinate to the bishop of the diocese, and members remain full members of the Church. Historically, when a parish was dominated by a conservative majority and priest, the liberal minority would often set up a voluntary congregation with their own priest - and vice versa. Today the voluntary congregations are often a solution for people who find the idea of a [[free church]] appealing, but wish to keep some bonds to the church.

====Parish optionality====
Another, less commonly used feature is parish optionality (''sognebåndsløsning'', literally "parish bond release"). If a Church member is dissatisfied with the particular pastor of his residence parish, he may choose to be served by another pastor who matches better with his Christian views, for example in a neighbouring parish.

|}

According to official statistics from January 2020, 74.3% of Danes are members of the Church of Denmark, 0.4 percent less than the previous year.<ref name="church stats"/> Membership rates vary from 56.9% in the [[Diocese of Copenhagen]] to 84.2% in the [[Diocese of Viborg]]. In recent decades, the percentage of Danes that are members of the church has been slowly declining, the most important reasons being immigration from non-Lutheran countries, withdrawal of some members, and a somewhat lower rate (59.5%) of Danish infants being christened.<ref>[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/kirkestatistik/daabstal/ Baptism statistics 1990 - 2017] Kirkeministeriet {{in lang|da}}</ref>

Any person who is [[baptised]] (usually [[infant baptism]]) into the Church of Denmark automatically becomes a member. Members may renounce their membership and later return if they wish. [[Excommunication]] is legally possible but an extraordinarily rare occurrence. Examples include declared [[Satanism|Satanists]]. A church member supporting [[reincarnation]] was excommunicated, but the [[Courts of Denmark#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] overturned the excommunication in 2005.

===Faith and church attendance===
According to the latest inquiry about 2.4% <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kirke-tro/kun-24-procent-g%C3%A5r-i-kirke-hver-uge|title=Kun 2,4 procent går i kirke hver uge|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref> of church members attend services every week, although on Christmas Eve more than a third of the population attend. However, the church is still widely used for traditional family ceremonies including [[infant baptism|christenings]] and [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmations]]. In the year 2017, 32.7% of [[wedding]]s<ref>[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/kirkestatistik/kirkelige-vielser-og-kirkelige-velsignelser/ Kirkelig vielse og kirkelig velsignelser af borgerligt viede] Kirkeministeriet {{in lang|da}}</ref><ref name="statistikbanken">[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920 Statistics Denmark] Statistikbanken.dk</ref> and 83.3% [[funeral]]s were performed in the Church of Denmark,<ref>[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/kirkestatistik/kirkelige-begravelser/ Kirkelige begravelser] Kirkeministeriet {{in lang|da}}</ref> and 70% of children in grade 7–8 were confirmed.<ref>[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/kirkestatistik/konfirmerede/ Confirmation statistics], Kirkeministeriet {{in lang|da}}</ref> The level of weekly [[church attendance]] is similar to that in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].

According to a 2009 [[opinion poll|poll]], 25% of Danes believe Jesus is the [[Son of God]], and 18% believe he is the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|saviour of the world]].<ref>Poll performed in December 2009 among 1114 Danes between ages 18 and 74, [http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/350709:Kirke---tro--Hver-fjerde-dansker-tror-paa-Jesus ''Hver fjerde dansker tror på Jesus''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225060504/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/350709:Kirke---tro--Hver-fjerde-dansker-tror-paa-Jesus |date=2009-12-25 }} (One in four Danes believe in Jesus), Kristeligt Dagblad, 23 December 2009 {{in lang|da}}</ref>

==Doctrine==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}
[[File:Alter og døbefont i Besser Kirke (Samsø Kommune).JPG|thumb|[[Altar]] and [[baptismal font]] in Besser Church, [[Samsø]]]]
The church is aimed at having a wide acceptance of [[theology|theological]] views, as long as they agree with the official symbolic books as stipulated in the [[Danish Code]] of 1683. These are:
* The [[Apostles' Creed]]
* The [[Nicene Creed]]
* The [[Athanasian Creed]]
* The [[Augsburg Confession]]
* [[Luther's Small Catechism]]

Revised versions of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] were authorised by the Queen in 1992. A revised [[Hymn]] Book was authorised in 2003. Both the [[Bible]] translations and the Hymn Book implied widespread public and theological debate.

Historically, there is a contrast between a liberal current inspired by [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] and more strict, [[pietism|pietist]] or [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Bible fundamentalist]] movements (such as [[Indre Mission]]). These tensions have sometimes threatened to divide the Church. ''Tidehverv'' is a minor fraction based on a strict Lutheranism and anti-modern, national-conservative views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tidehverv.dk/|title=Tidehvervs forside - Bladet udkom første gang okt. 1926|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Religion_og_mystik/Danske_folkekirke/Tidehvervsbev%C3%A6gelsen|title=Tidehvervsbevægelsen - Gyldendal - Den Store Danske|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref>

The Church of Denmark is member of the [[Porvoo Communion]] between Lutheran and Anglican Churches.

===Liturgy===
[[File:Konfirmander.jpg|thumb|Children preparing to be [[Confirmation|confirmed]] ]]
The Communion Service includes three readings from the [[Bible]]: a chapter from one of the [[Gospel]]s, from one of the [[Epistle]]s or another part of the [[New Testament]] and, since 1992, from the [[Old Testament]]. Texts are picked from an official list following the [[church year]]. Some [[liturgy|liturgical]] features have a fixed content but are free to the form. This accounts for the Common Prayer following the [[sermon]], where the priest is encouraged to mention the royal house. Some will simply mention "the Queen and all her House" whereas others will list all members of the royal house by name and title.

The [[sermon]], as in other Protestant churches, is a central part of the service. The priest takes a starting point in the text of that Sunday, but is free to form a personal message of it. At special occasions, even non-priests may be allowed to preach. [[Hymn]]s are also very central. In contrast to Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, Danish congregations sit while singing and stand while listening to Bible readings.

As in other Lutheran churches, the Church of Denmark recognizes only two [[sacraments]], [[Baptism]] and the [[Lord's Supper]]. These are usually included in the Communion Service. Formerly, individual or shared [[Confession (religion)|confession]] was a condition to receive the Lord's Supper. An official confession ritual still exists, but is now used very rarely. There are also official rituals for [[confirmation]], [[wedding]], blessing of a civil wedding and [[funeral]]s. [[Emergency baptism]] may be performed by any Christian if necessary, and later the child will then be "produced" in Church.

==Church and state==

[[File:RoskildeDomkirke-FacadeVest.jpg|thumb|[[Roskilde Cathedral]] has been the burial place of Danish royalty since the 15th century. In 1995 it became a [[World Heritage Site]].]]
[[File:Holte Kirke 2005.jpg|thumb|A historical picture of the parish church in [[Holte]]]]
As supreme authority of the Church of Denmark, the monarch must be a member (article 6 of the Constitution). This applies to the royal princes and princesses as well, but does not apply to their spouses. Traditionally, though, every foreigner who has become a member of the royal family has converted or become a member of the church; as a result, the [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Prince Consort Henrik]] converted from [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] before marrying the [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen]] in 1968, and [[Mary Elizabeth Donaldson|Mary Donaldson]] also converted from [[Presbyterianism]] before marrying [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederik]] in 2004.

===Freedom of religion===
With the [[Reformation in Denmark]] in 1536, [[Lutheran Christianity]] was established as the state religion. For the next century, in a time when [[religious war]]s swept Europe, harsh persecution of other faiths followed ([[Lutheran orthodoxy]]). Exceptions were granted only to foreign diplomats. For at least a period in the 16th century, small circles of clandestine Catholicism prevailed. From 1683, Roman Catholic, [[Reformed Christianity|Reformed]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations were allowed in the new town of Fredericia, the latter two also in Copenhagen. Non-Lutherans were also allowed in [[Friedrichstadt]] and on [[Nordstrand (Amt)|Nordstrand]] in [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Slesvig]] and in [[Glückstadt]] in [[Holstein]]. With the [[Danmarks Riges Grundlov|constitution]] of 1849, [[freedom of religion]] was introduced in Denmark, but Lutheranism remained the state church.

====Recognised and approved religions====
A religious community does not need any state approval in order to enjoy the freedom of religion granted by the constitution. However, state-approved congregations (''godkendte trossamfund'') enjoy several privileges. They may conduct legal [[weddings]], establish own [[cemetery|cemeteries]], get [[residence permit]]s for foreign priests, are exempt from [[corporate tax|corporate]] and [[property tax]], may apply for means from the [[Dansk Tipstjeneste|state lottery fund]], and members may [[tax-deduction|tax-deduct]] membership fees and presents to the congregation.

Additionally, those congregations recognised by royal decree before 1970 (''anerkendte trossamfund'') may name and baptize children with legal effect, keep their own church registers and transcribe certificates on the basis of such registers.<ref name= FoR />

This legal distinction between "recognised" and "approved" communities remains, but is mainly a historical one. Communities recognised before 1970 includes only eight well-established Christian communities as well as one Jewish community. From 1970 until the 1990s only a few more Christian congregations were approved, but since 1998, a much more liberal practice has ensued. Since then, a board of independent experts decide about approval of new religious communities. The board includes professors of law, religious studies and theology and works under the Ministry of Justice, deliberately separate from the Ministry of Ecclesiastical affairs. It merely investigates whether the organisation fulfills basic definitions, such as having a doctrine, creed and cult, in order to be called a congregation of faith. In 2003, the approval of the [[Neopaganism in Scandinavia|Forn Sed]] religion caused some public debate.

===Lack of central authority===
The Church is in practice barred from having official positions in political or other matters, since it has no central bodies that could define such stances: nor a spiritual leader (such as an [[archbishop]]), nor a central assembly or [[synod]]. Bishops have the last say on doctrinal questions within their respective dioceses. The Queen (in practice the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs) and Parliament are the central bodies, but they usually keep to administrative matters and abstain from interfering with spiritual questions. [[Church law]]s are rarely changed, and, when it happens, only administrative matters are affected.

Firstly, these principles are generally believed to ensure a non-sectarian, tolerant church where parishioners and priests enjoy a high degree of freedom to practise their own interpretation of Lutheran Christianity. Secondly, many Danish politicians and theologians claim that only this church-state-model will ensure the division of politics and religion, since the Church cannot interfere with political matters or even claim to speak with one voice on behalf of its members. They frequently discourage the term [[state church]] and argue it is, as its name states, the "people's church".

Article 66 of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] stipulates a [[Church Ordinance|church ordinance]] shall be laid down by law. This promissory clause dates back from the first Constitution of 1849 but was never put into practice. It was feared that splits could occur if a central authority were created.

In very few cases have politicians deviated from their traditional hands-off course in church doctrinal matters. Where they have done so, it has been with the declared aim of preventing a possible split in the church. ''See the issues of [[#Female clergy|Female clergy]] and [[#Same-sex marriage|Same-sex marriage]] above.''

===Civil registration===
The Church of Denmark conducts [[civil registration]] of [[childbirth|birth]]s, [[death]]s, [[change of name]] etc. ([[vital records]]). The keeping of such ''kirkebøger'' ("[[Parish register|church books]]") is a centuries-long tradition, dating from when the parish rectors were the only government representatives in rural areas. In 2002-03 the traditional church records were replaced by a new national electronic registration system called ''Personregistrering''. After protests in 2005, the Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs [[Bertel Haarder]] announced that people who for various reasons did not want to send their registration forms (e.g. births and namings) to the local church office could now send their forms to a central office located in [[Nykøbing Falster]].

In 2010 parents' duty to report the birth of their child was abolished. Instead, it was decided that in the future it was the task of the [[midwive]]s to report all births in Denmark (only when a midwife isn't present at the birth of a child are the parents still obliged to report the birth of the child).

From 1 December 2014 all applications should be submitted in digital form whenever possible.

===Economic support===
Article 4 in the [[Constitution of Denmark]] stipulates that "The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State."<ref name="constitution" /> On the other hand, article 68 ensures that citizens are not obliged to pay personal contributions to any religion other than their own.<ref name="constitution" /> It has been questioned how these two principles can co-exist. Non-members do not pay [[church tax]], but an additional state subsidiary accounts for 12% of the Church's income. This means every citizen, even a non-member, contributes with an average of 130 [[Danish kroner|kroner]] annually (US$23). In addition, the bishops are high-ranking officials whose salary is fully paid by the state. In return, certain public tasks are carried out by the Church, such as conducting [[vital record]]s registries and managing [[graveyard]]s which are open to all denominations.

===Separation of church and state===
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] was an outspoken advocate of separation of church and state<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Assiter|editor-first1=Alison|title=Kierkegaard and the Political|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub.|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443843850|page=81}}</ref>]]
While the debate about [[separation of church and state]] emerges occasionally in Denmark, the current arrangement is supported by most political parties. It has been challenged for decades by the left wing and by [[atheism|atheists]]; more recently also by some ideological [[liberalism|liberals]] and some members of [[free church]]es.

Proponents for a separation ([[disestablishment]]) argue the state church violates [[freedom of religion|equality of religions]] and the principle of the [[secular state]]. Proponents for the current system argue that membership is voluntary, that the existence of a state church has ancient historical roots, and that the church fulfils certain administrative tasks for the state. They also argue it would be difficult to decide whether church-owned real estate should be handed over to the state or not. The former possessions of the Catholic Church were ceded to the Crown at the [[Reformation in Denmark|reformation in 1536]].

According to a [[Opinion poll|poll]] conducted by the [[free daily]] [[MetroXpress]] in April 2007, 52% wished to split church and state, 30% were against, and 18% undecided. Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs [[Bertel Haarder]], spoke out against a split: ''"Church and state will be separated when more than half of the population are no longer members. [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] said so, and I support that."'' The opposition [[Social Democrats]] also argued against a split, but said there should be more equality between denominations, possibly by a state subsidiary paid to other approved religious communities as well.<ref>[http://metroxpress.dk/dk/article/2007/04/04/10/1005-52/index.xml?print=1 ''Danes want to split church from state''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212709/http://metroxpress.dk/dk/article/2007/04/04/10/1005-52/index.xml?print=1 |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[MetroXpress]], 2007-04-04 {{in lang|da}}</ref> Immigrant groups and the [[islam|Muslim]] society are divided on the issue, as some think official Christianity is preferable to a purely secular state.

Pure equality of religions exists only in a minority of [[Western Europe]]an countries. Besides Denmark, only the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]], [[England]] and [[Greece]] have official [[state church]]es, while [[Scotland]] has an officially recognised "national church" that is not connected to the state. [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[Austria]] have official ties to Catholicism ([[concordat]]), but these ties do not extend to Catholicism being recognised as the state religion in these countries. Further there are varying degrees of public funding of the church in [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] in most cantons of [[Switzerland]], and in the [[Alsace-Moselle]] region of [[France]].

==Controversial issues==
{{See also|Homosexuality and Lutheranism}}

=== Female clergy ===
The [[ordination of women]], having been discussed within the church since the 1920s, has been allowed since 1948, despite some rather strong early resistance from the clergy. The then Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs was contacted by a parochial council who wished to employ a female priest. He decided there was no legal obstacle to that.<ref>[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/124512:Kirke---tro--Praester-imod-vielser-af-homoseksuelle-i-kirken ''Priests against marriage of homosexuals in church''], [[Kristeligt Dagblad]], 14 January 2004
</ref> The first woman to become a bishop was instituted in 1995. Today two thirds of theology students are women, and the clergy is expected to have a female majority in the near future.

Among a small conservative minority, resistance to women ordained as clergy remains. In 2007 the [[Diocese of Viborg|Bishop of Viborg]], known as a moderate conservative, revealed that he had given special consideration to priests who were known to be against ordained women. He had organised [[ordination]] ceremonies in such a way that new priests who so wished could avoid shaking hands with, or receiving the laying on of hands from, women ordained as priests. According to the bishop, this had happened twice in the 100 ordinations he had performed. The matter became headline news amidst a debate about [[Islamic fundamentalism|Muslim fundamentalists]] who refuse to shake hands with members of the opposite sex. The Minister for Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, [[Bertel Haarder]], said he would discuss the matter with the bishops, but also stated that tolerance for various views should be respected. In contrast, the Minister for Employment, [[Claus Hjort Frederiksen]], thought that the priests in question should be dismissed, as public employees are obliged to shake hands with anyone.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/indland/article311649.ece ''Minister for Employment: Fire the Discriminating Priests''], [[Politiken]], 2007-05-24 {{in lang|da}}</ref>

===Same-sex marriage===
{{Further|Same-sex marriage in Denmark}}
A 2011 poll of the Danish public found that 75.8% of Danes approve of same-sex marriages being performed in the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/51600-majority-allow-gay-church-marriages.html|title=The Post - The Copenhagen Post – Danish news in english|access-date=20 June 2015}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

According to a 2011 survey of 1137 priests, 62% of them supported same-sex marriage in the Church on the same basis as for heterosexuals, while 28% were against. A map of the results hints at the traditional west-east division, with a conservative wing being dominant in central [[West Jutland]] (the former [[Ringkjøbing Amt]]) and on [[Bornholm]], but liberal priests dominating in most other cities.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2011/11/23/143426.htm ''Måling: Hver fjerde præst er imod homovielser'' (Poll: one of four priests against gay marriages)], [[Danmarks Radio]], 23 November 2011 (in Danish, with map)</ref>

In 2004, a poll among pastors said 60% were against church marriage of same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/124512:Kirke---tro--Praester-imod-vielser-af-homoseksuelle-i-kirken|title=Præster imod vielser af homoseksuelle i kirken|trans-title=Pastors against marriage of homosexuals in church|newspaper=[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]|date={{date|14-01-2004|dmy}} }}</ref>

====Early position of the church====
Since Denmark approved [[Recognition of gay unions in Denmark|same-sex civil unions]] ([[registered partnership]]) in 1989, the question of [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|church blessing ceremonies]] for such unions emerged. After an enquiry from the [[Danish National Association of Gays and Lesbians]] in 1993, bishops set up a commission to reach a stance on the matter.

An early stance on registered partnerships was reached in 1997. Bishops maintained that the ceremony of marriage was God's framework for the relation between a man and a woman, but this view of marriage was not affected by the fact that some people chose to live in a responsible community with a person of the same sex, approved by society, i.e. a registered partnership. The bishops disapproved of institutionalising new rituals, but couples who wished a non-ritualised marking in church of their registered partnership should be obliged. In such cases, it would be up to the rector to decide, and he should seek advice from his bishop.<ref>[http://www.lbl.dk/homopolitik/reg-partnerskab/biskoppernes-udtalelse-oktober-1997.html Declaration of Bishops on same-sex unions, 1997] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911085654/http://www.lbl.dk/homopolitik/reg-partnerskab/biskoppernes-udtalelse-oktober-1997.html |date=2007-09-11 }} {{in lang|da}}</ref>

At this time, many churches chose to bless registered partnerships, however this blessing was distinguished from a legal ceremony, which was performed by a mayor or another municipal official.<ref>[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/139657:Kirke---tro--Biskop-ind-i-sag-om-velsignelser-af-homoseksuelle ''Bishop enters case about blessings of homosexuals''], [[Kristeligt Dagblad]], 4 August 2003 {{in lang|da}}</ref>

====Same-sex marriages accepted====
On 15 June 2012 the Church of Denmark made the decision to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies and not merely bless them; therefore Denmark now recognises [[same-sex marriages]]. In early 2012 [[Minister for Gender Equality (Denmark)|Minister for Equality]], [[Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Denmark|Ecclesiastical Affairs]] and [[Minister for Nordic Cooperation (Denmark)|Nordic Cooperation]], [[Manu Sareen]] introduced a bill approving same-sex marriage, which was passed in parliament in June 2012.<ref>[http://digitaljournal.com/article/313312 Denmark moves to legalize same-sex marriage], Digital Journal, 24 October 2011</ref> A wedding ritual with liturgy has been developed and presented to parliament by the eleven bishops who are in favor of same-sex marriages being performed in church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/you-may-now-kiss-groom|title=You may now kiss the groom|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616173833/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/you-may-now-kiss-groom|archive-date=16 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Manu Sareen and a majority of bishops initially proposed the ritual would not declare the same-sex couple 'spouses', but 'life partners' (''livsfæller'', a Danish [[neologism]]), but the minister later changed his mind on this detail. Two conservative organisations within the church, [[The Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark|Inner Mission]] and [[Luthersk Mission|Lutheran Mission]], as well as one of the twelve bishops, maintain their protests against same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE1655373/43-vrede-praester-udfordrer-biskopperne/|title=43 vrede præster udfordrer biskopperne|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref> It will be up to each individual priest to decide whether he or she will conduct marriages of same-sex couples. The first same-sex couple was married on Friday 15 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE1657651/endelig-fik-steen-og-stig-kirkens-ord/|title=Endelig fik Steen og Stig kirkens ord|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref>

The process towards the official recognition of same sex marriage in the Church of Denmark began on 8 February 1973, when 'Provo Priest,' [[Harald Søbye]], performed a wedding of a male couple, although not legally recognised, on a suggestion from a journalist at the newspaper [[Ekstra Bladet]], which announced it as 'The World's First Gay Wedding'. On 25 February 1973, Harald Søbye performed another wedding, this time of a female couple, in a television programme. The state prosecutor investigated the cases, but concluded that the priest's use of his vestment was not illegal. Søbye had been retired in 1964 for political activism, but remained an ordained priest within the church. During the next 15 years, Søbye performed approximately 210 blessings or weddings of same-sex couples.<ref>[[:da:Harald Søbye]]</ref>

When Denmark introduced [[registered partnerships]] in 1989, the issue of [[same-sex marriage]] for some years received little attention. Church blessings of these partnerships slowly gained ground (see above). Later, the possibility of registered partnership, or same-sex marriage, performed by the church came under discussion. The issue was brought up in an unusual way by Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] in 2004, who said he would approve of such a change, although he claimed to speak as a private person on this issue, not as prime minister.

Views among proponents vary whether such a ceremony should be called 'marriage' or merely '[[registered partnership]]' ''(registreret partnerskab)'', as the present same-sex civil union is called. Most likely, clergy would be allowed to decide for themselves whether to perform same-sex marriages or not, similar to the right to deny remarriage of divorced persons (a policy employed by a conservative minority of priests).

====Constitutionality====
A further controversy is that this new practice may be against the Danish constitution; §4 of the Danish constitution states: "''The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, as such, it shall be supported by the State.''"<ref name="constitution">{{cite web|title=Denmark's Constitution of 1953|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Denmark_1953.pdf?lang=en|publisher=Constitute Project|access-date=25 April 2016}}</ref>

§4 not only establish "Folkekirken" as the state church, but also gives certain boundaries as to what the state church is. It is forced to follow the Lutheran doctrines and if, as some critics claim,<ref>http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/417323:Debat--DEBAT--Grundloven-goer-det-umuligt</ref> the Lutheran doctrines explicitly state that [[homosexuality]] is a [[sin]] then it is a violation of the constitution to allow gay marriages in the state church.

===Gay clergy===
Gay and lesbian clergy exist, and this is generally considered a strictly personal issue. Parish councils are central in selecting and employing new priests, including interviews with candidates. Once employed, parish priests are [[public servant]]s and cannot be discharged except for [[neglect of duties]], which will finally be the bishop's decision.

In 2011 a female priest serving two small island parishes was fired after controversies with the parish council of [[Agersø]], while the neighbouring [[Omø]] supported her. She claimed to have been ousted because of her sexuality, but the parish council rejected this accusation and mentioned 'cooperation problems' as the cause. Twenty years ago she had come out as [[lesbian]] and a practitioner of [[sadomasochism]] in a Swedish TV programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xeppl0_asa-sjoberg_lifestyle|title=dailymotion|work=Dailymotion|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/444153:Kirke---tro--Fyret-praest--Min-seksualitet-gav-problemer?articleid=444153 ''Fyret præst: Min seksualitet gav problemer'' (Fired priest: My sexuality gave problems)], [[Kristeligt Dagblad]], 15 December 2011 (in Danish, with map)</ref>

In 2009 a parish priest in [[Tingbjerg]], a Copenhagen suburb, moved away from the parish to a secret address after assaults against his [[vicarage]], his car and the parish church. The vicarage was put up for sale. According to [[Avisen.dk]], local youths claimed they harassed him because he was openly homosexual, among other reasons.<ref>[http://www.avisen.dk/tingbjerg-praest-mobbes-for-at-vaere-homo_116027.aspx ''Tingbjerg-præst mobbes for at være homo'' (Tingbjerg priest harassed for being gay)], [[Avisen.dk]], 15 October 2009 (in Danish)</ref> The priest himself denied this was the issue, but rather claimed the assaults were part of a general tendency in the 'crumbling district', and intensified after he spoke out in public about the local youth crime.<ref>[http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/342545:Kirke---tro--Tingbjerg-praest--Man-er-overladt-til-sig-selv?all=1 ''Tingbjerg-præst: Man er overladt til sig selv'' (Tingbjerg priest: You are left to yourself)], [[Kristeligt Dagblad]], 17 October 2009 (in Danish)</ref> A Sunday service held a few weeks later was attended by several prominent guests supporting the priest, including Prime Minister [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]], [[Education Minister of Denmark|Minister for Education]] and [[Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs of Denmark|Ecclesiastical Affairs]] [[Bertel Haarder]], and photographer [[Jacob Holdt]].<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2009/10/25/114829.htm ''Politiker-støtte til chikaneret præst i Tingbjerg'' (Politicians support harassed priest in Tingbjerg)], [[Politiken]], 25 October 2009</ref>
Tingbjerg is a single-plan [[public housing]] area, marked by [[gang violence]] and [[youth crime]], and the most criminal district of Copenhagen.<ref>[politiken.dk/indland/ECE816952/praest-paa-flugt-fra-tingbjerg-folk-er-bange/ ''Præst på flugt fra Tingbjerg: »Folk er bange«'' (Priest escaping Tingbjerg: 'People are afraid')], [[Politiken]], 25 October 2009</ref>

===Declaration ''Dominus Iesus''===
In 2000, the Church of Denmark's [[ecumenical]] department publicly criticized the Roman Catholic declaration ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', which controversially used the term "[[ecclesial community]]" to refer to Protestant denominations, including Lutheran churches. The Church of Denmark argued that there is a destructive effect on ecumenical relations if one church deprives another of the right to be called a [[Christian Church|Church]] and that it is just as destructive as if one Christian denies another Christian the right to be called a Christian.<ref>[http://www.interchurch.dk/dok/703dom-iesus-eng.htm To the Roman Catholic Church in Denmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114115959/http://www.interchurch.dk/dok/703dom-iesus-eng.htm |date=2009-01-14 }}</ref>
