'''Executive Order 13769''', titled '''Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States''', politically labeled as a '''Muslim Ban'''<ref name="Muslim ban">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41382585 US expands travel ban to include N Korea], [[BBC]] "Mr Trump's original ban was highly controversial, as it affected six majority-Muslim countries, and was widely labelled a 'Muslim ban'."</ref> by detractors <!-- DO NOT remove references to "muslim ban" without first discussing on talk page, thank you. --> or a '''travel ban''' by supporters, was an [[Executive Order (United States)|executive order]] by [[United States]] President [[Donald Trump]]. Except for the extent to which it was blocked by various courts, it was in effect from January 27, 2017, until March 6, 2017, when it was superseded by [[Executive Order 13780]]. Executive Order 13769 lowered the number of refugees to be admitted into the United States in 2017 to 50,000, suspended the [[United States Refugee Admissions Program|U.S. Refugee Admissions Program]] (USRAP) for 120 days, suspended the entry of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]] indefinitely, directed some [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet secretaries]] to suspend entry of those whose countries do not meet adjudication standards under [[Immigration and Nationality Act|U.S. immigration law]] for 90 days, and included exceptions on a case-by-case basis. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) lists these countries as [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]].<ref name="auto">Executive Order 13769 of January 27, 2017: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.

The signing of the Executive Order provoked widespread [[Reactions to Executive Order 13769|condemnation and protests]] and resulted in [[legal challenges to the Trump travel ban|legal intervention against the enforcement of the order]] with some calling it a "Muslim ban" because President Trump had previously called for temporarily banning Muslims from entering America soon after the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack]] (a call he reiterated after the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]] six months later{{Citation needed|reason=Not in source or in referenced article. Contentious, especially without source.|date=January 2020}}), and because all of the affected countries had a Muslim majority.<ref name="Muslim ban" /> A nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] (TRO) was issued on February 3, 2017 in the case ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', which was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] on February 9, 2017. Consequently, the Department of Homeland Security stopped enforcing portions of the order and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] re-validated visas that had been previously revoked. Later, other orders (Executive Order 13780 and [[Presidential Proclamation 9645]]) were signed by President Trump and superseded Executive Order 13769. On June 26, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the third Executive Order (Presidential Proclamation 9645) and its accompanying travel ban in a [[Trump v. Hawaii|5–4 decision]], with the majority opinion being written by Chief Justice John Roberts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump's Travel Ban Is Upheld by Supreme Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html |first1=Adam |last1=Liptak |first2=Michael D. |last2=Shear|date=June 26, 2018 |work=New York Times |access-date=June 26, 2018}}</ref>

Key provisions of executive orders 13769 and 13780 cite to paragraph (f) of [[Title 8 of the United States Code]] § 1182, which discusses inadmissible aliens. Paragraph (f) states: 
<blockquote>Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.{{efn |{{USCSub |8 |1182 |f}}}}</blockquote>

The act that underlies this, known as the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (a.k.a. the McCarran–Walter Act)]], was amended by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (a.k.a. the Hart−Celler Act)]], which included a provision stating

<blockquote>No person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.{{efn |{{USCSub |8 |1152 |a}}}}</blockquote>

The language in the INA of 1965 is among the reasons District of Maryland [[Theodore D. Chuang|Judge Chuang]] issued a temporary restraining order blocking Section 2(c) of Executive Order 13780.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/court-rules-president-violated-1965-law-executive-order|first=David|last=Bier|publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |date=March 17, 2017|title=Court Rules the President Violated the 1965 Law with Executive Order}}</ref>

===Restrictions by Obama administration===
In 1986, the [[Visa Waiver Program]] was initiated by President Ronald Reagan, allowing alien nationals of select countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa, in return for reciprocal treatment of U.S. nationals. By 2016, the program had been extended to 38 countries.<ref name="CBPVWPinfo">{{cite web|title=Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/visa-waiver-program-improvement-and-terrorist-travel-prevention-act-faq|website=U.S. Customs and Border Protection|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref> In 2015, Congress passed a [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016|Consolidated Appropriations Act]] to fund the government, and Obama signed the bill into law. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, which was previously passed by the House of Representatives as H.R. 158, was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act as Division O, Title II, Section 203.

On July 15, Pence, who as governor of Indiana attempted to suspend settlement of Syrian refugees to the state but was prevented from doing so by the courts, said that decision was based on the fall 2015 FBI assessment that there is risk associated with bringing in refugees. Pence cited the [[Bowling Green massacre#Terrorism-related arrests in Bowling Green|infiltration of Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green Kentucky who were arrested in 2011 for attempting to provide weapons to ISIS]] and Obama's suspension of the Iraqi refugee program in response as precedent for a U.S. President's "temporarily suspend[ing] immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States".<ref>{{cite interview|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/07/15/mike-pence-explains-why-is-running-with-donald-trump/|first=Mike|last=Pence |author-link=Mike Pence |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=July 15, 2016|title=Mike Pence explains why he is running with Donald Trump|interviewer=Sean Hannity}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-kentucky-us-dozens-terrorists-country-refugees/story?id=20931131|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=November 20, 2013|title=US May Have Let 'Dozens' of Terrorists Into Country As Refugees|first1=James Gordon|last1=Meek|first2=Cindy|last2=Galli|first3=Brian|last3=Ross |author3-link=Brian Ross (journalist)}}</ref>

In a speech on August 4 to a Maine audience Trump called for stopping the practice of admitting refugees from among the most dangerous places in the world; Trump specifically opposed Somali immigration to Minnesota and Maine, describing the Somali refugee program, which has resettled tens of thousands of refugees in the U.S., as creating "a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for Islamic terror groups". In Minnesota 10 men of Somali or [[Oromo people|Oromo]] family backgrounds were charged with conspiring to travel to the Middle East to join ISIS and 20 young men traveled to Somalia to join a terror group in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/08/05/trump-takes-aim-at-somalis|title=In speech, Trump targets Somalis in Minnesota, Maine|first=Peter|last=Cox|date=August 5, 2016|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News}}</ref><ref name="portlandme_speech">{{cite speech|time=14:41|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLWZCX8nBG8|title=Donald Trump speech in Portland Maine|first=Donald|last=Trump|date=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Trump went on to list alleged terrorist plots by immigrants from Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria, along with incidents of alleged terrorism plots or acts by immigrants from countries not among the seven specified by the eventual executive order such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Uzbekistan, and Morocco.<ref name=portlandme_speech />

===Green-card holders===
There was some early confusion about the status of green-card holders (i.e., lawful [[permanent residence (United States)|permanent residents]]). According to the lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota, dated February 3, the government had changed its position five times to date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf|title=C17-00141-JLR-- State of Washington and State of Minnesota v.

=== Dual citizens ===
There was similar confusion about whether the order affected dual citizens of a banned country and a non-banned country. The State Department said that the order did not affect U.S. citizens who also hold citizenship of one of the seven banned countries. On January 28, the State Department stated that other travelers with dual nationality of one of these countries—for example, an Iranian who also holds a Canadian passport—would not be permitted to enter. However, the [[International Air Transport Association]] told their airlines that dual nationals who hold a passport from a non-banned country would be allowed in.<ref name="cnn_dual">{{cite news|last=Merica|first=Dan|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-green-card-dual-citizens|title=How Trump's travel ban affects green card holders and dual citizens|publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref>

Section 4 orders development of a uniform screening procedure as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits; components of the screening procedure are suggested but not determined.<ref name="auto" /> Section 1 ("Purpose") requires screening to identify those who would "place violent ideologies higher than American law" or "oppress Americans of any ... gender or sexual orientation".<ref name="auto" /> The only suggested component of the uniform screening procedure in section 4 that specifically mentions a potential entrant's mindset is "a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States".<ref name="auto" /> Trump's August 15 speech proposed an ideological test for all immigrants to screen out people who might harbor violent or oppressive attitudes toward women or gays.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/14/politics/donald-trump-isis-fight/|date=August 15, 2016|title=Trump proposes values test for would-be immigrants in fiery ISIS speech|publisher=[[CNN]] }}</ref> In response, immigration expert [[Stephen Yale-Loehr]] suggested that an ideological test could involve screening immigration applicants' social media pages as part of a routine background check.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/trump-immigration-plan-us-constitution|title=Trump's 'deeply un-American' stance on immigration prompts legal concerns|first=Lauren|last=Gambino|date=August 17, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref> The Trump administration has formally proposed adding optional collection of social media account information for visa applicants from China affecting approximately 3.6 million people annually.<ref>Federal Register Notice and Request for Comments of February 21, 2017: Agency Information Collection Activities: Electronic Visa Update System.

===Deleted provision regarding safe zones in Syria===
{{Further|Safe zone (Syria)}}
A leaked prior draft of the order (published by ''The Washington Post'' before the order went into effect) would have ordered that "the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, is directed within 90 days of the date of this order to produce a plan to provide safe areas in Syria and in the surrounding region in which Syrian nationals displaced from their homeland can await firm settlement, such as repatriation or potential third-country resettlement."<ref>{{cite news |title=Draft executive order would begin 'extreme vetting' of immigrants and visitors to the U.S.|date=January 25, 2017|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/draft-executive-order-would-begin-extreme-vetting-of-immigrants-and-visitors-to-the-us/2017/01/25/17a27424-e328-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Read the draft of the executive order on immigration and refugees|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-the-draft-of-the-executive-order-on-immigration-and-refugees/2289|access-date=February 14, 2017}}</ref> This provision was omitted from the final order.<ref name="auto"/> [[Rex Tillerson]], Trump's secretary of state, had not yet taken office at the time the executive order went into effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/30/chuck-schumer-wants-delay-rex-tillerson-vote-possi|date=February 1, 2017|title=Chuck Schumer wants delay on Rex Tillerson vote, possibly other nominees, after executive order|first=Sherfinski|last=David|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] }}</ref>

During and after his campaign Trump proposed establishing safe zones in Syria as an alternative to Syrian refugees' immigration to the U.S. In the past "safe zones" have been interpreted as establishing, among other things, no-fly zones over Syria. During the Obama administration [[Turkey]] encouraged the U.S. to establish safe zones; the Obama administration was concerned about the potential for pulling the U.S. into a war with Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-syria-safezones-idUSKBN1592O8|title=Trump says he will order 'safe zones' for Syria|date=January 25, 2017}}</ref>

In the first weeks of Trump's presidency Turkey renewed its call for safe zones and proposed a new plan for them, the Trump administration has spoken with several other Sunni Arab States regarding safe zones, and Russia has asked for clarification regarding any Trump administration plan regarding safe zones. The UN High Commissioner on Refugees and [[Bashar Assad]] have dismissed safe zones as unworkable.

==Impact==
===Terrorism===
Trump's stated reason for issuing the executive order was to prevent terrorism.<ref name="SalamaCaldwell">Vivian Salama & Alicia A. Caldwell, [http://bigstory.ap.org/article/39f1f8e4ceed4a30a4570f693291c866/dhs-intel-report-disputes-threat-posed-travel-ban-nations AP Exclusive: DHS report disputes threat from banned nations], Associated Press (February 24, 2017).</ref> An internal report compiled by the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] Intelligence and Analysis Unit, however, concluded that people from the seven nations affected by the travel ban pose no increased terror risk.<ref name="Nixon">Ron Nixon, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/us/politics/travel-ban-nations-terror-risk.html People From 7 Travel-Ban Nations Pose No Increased Terror Risk, Report Says], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (February 25, 2017).</ref> The report found that "country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity" and that few individuals from the seven affected countries access the U.S. in any case, since the State Department grants a small number of visas to citizens of those countries."<ref name="SalamaCaldwell"/><ref name="Nixon"/> The report found that of 82 people determined to have inspired by a [[foreign terrorist organization]] "to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were U.S. citizens born in the United States," while the rest came from a group of 26 countries, only two of which were among the seven nations included in the ban.<ref name="SalamaCaldwell"/> White House and DHS officials downplayed the significance of the report, saying it was only a draft.<ref name="Nixon"/>

''The New York Times'' reported that "for an action aimed at terrorism, the order appeared to garner little or no support among experts and former officials of every political stripe with experience in the field."<ref name="Shane">[[Scott Shane]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/politics/a-sweeping-order-unlikely-to-reduce-terrorist-threat.html "Immigration Ban Is Unlikely to Reduce Terrorist Threat, Experts Say"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (January 28, 2017).</ref> Experts on terrorism, such as [[Charles Kurzman]] of the [[University of North Carolina]], [[Brian Michael Jenkins]] of the [[RAND Corporation]], and [[Daniel Benjamin]] of [[Dartmouth College]], formerly the State Department's top counterterrorism official. Benjamin said that the order was unlikely to reduce the terrorist threat, and "many experts believe the order's unintended consequences will make the threat worse."<ref name="Shane"/> Kurzman noted that since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, no one has been killed in the U.S. in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from the seven affected countries.<ref name="Shane"/> Jenkins explained that of the 147 Jihadist plots and attacks since 9/11, 105 were perpetrated by U.S. citizens and 20 involved legal permanent residents. "In other words, 85 percent of the terrorists lived in the U.S. a long time before carrying out an attack—they were radicalized within the nation's borders."<ref name="Jenkins">{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Brian Michael |author-link=Brian Michael Jenkins |title=Why a Travel Restriction Won't Stop Terrorism at Home|url=http://www.rand.org/blog/2017/02/why-a-travel-restriction-wont-stop-terrorism-at-home.html|website=The RAND Blog|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]] |access-date=March 22, 2017|date=February 10, 2017 }}</ref> Jenkins went on to say: "Had this temporary prohibition been in effect since 9/11, how many lives would have been saved Not one."<ref name="Jenkins"/> While Jenkins conceded that there were two individuals whose entry would have been prevented had the ban been in place since 9/11, both were in the country for years prior to engaging in terrorist related activities. According to Jenkins, the "... failure to identify these individuals before they entered the United States is not a flaw in the vetting process; it is our inability to predict human behavior years into the future."<ref name="Jenkins"/>

According to ''The New York Times'' reporter [[Scott Shane]], the seven countries in the executive order had a "random quality"; the list excluded [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Egypt]] (where many jihadist groups were founded) and [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] (where extremism has a long history, and which have "produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States").<ref name="Shane"/> Benjamin stated that the order might be counterproductive in terms of counterterrorism cooperation and feeding into "the jihadist narrative" of a West at war with Islam.<ref name="Shane"/> [[Jonathan Schanzer]] of the conservative [[Foundation for the Defense of Democracies]] said that "The order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise," and did not appear to be tied to any effort to improve vetting or other procedures.<ref name="Shane"/>

A 2018 paper by scholars at the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University found that Trump's refugee ban (which caused a 66% reduction in refugee resettlement) had no impact on crime rates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://immigrationlab.org/working-paper-series/halting-refugee-resettlement-reduce-crime-evidence-united-states-refugee-ban/|title=Does Halting Refugee Resettlement Reduce Crime?

Shortly after the enactment of the executive order, at 4:42&nbsp;pm on January 27, border officials across the country began enforcing the new rules.

===Travelers and patients===
According to [[Trita Parsi]], the president of the [[National Iranian American Council]], the order distressed citizens of the affected countries including those holding valid green cards and valid visas. Those outside the U.S. fear that they will not be allowed in, while those already in the country fear that they will not be able to leave, even temporarily, because they would not be able to return.<ref name="nyt_iran_reaction">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/world/middleeast/trump-visa-muslim-ban.html|title=In Iran, Shock and Bewilderment Over Trump Visa Crackdown|first1=Thomas|last1=Erdbrink|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Gettleman |author2-link=Jeffrey Gettleman |date=January 27, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 28, 2017}}</ref>

Some sources have stated that the executive order, if upheld, is likely to contribute to a doctor shortage in the United States, disproportionately affecting rural areas and underprovided specialties.<ref name=":11">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/health/trump-travel-ban-doctors.html|title=Trump's Travel Ban, Aimed at Terrorists, Has Blocked Doctors|last=McNeil Jr|first=Donald G. |author-link=Donald McNeil Jr. |date=February 6, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref> According to an analysis by a [[Harvard Medical School]] group of professors, research analysts and physicians, the executive order is likely to reduce the number of physicians in the United States as approximately 5% of the foreign-trained physicians in the United States were trained in the seven countries targeted by the executive order. These doctors are disproportionately likely to practice medicine in rural, underserved regions and specialties facing a large shortage of practitioners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-immigration-order-could-make-it-harder-to-find-a-psychiatrist-or-pediatrician|title=Trump's Immigration Order Could Make It Harder To Find A Psychiatrist Or Pediatrician|last=Jena|first=Anupam B. |author2=Andrew Olenski |author3=Daniel M.

=== Impact on education ===

Many universities were impacted by the issuance of the travel ban. One example is Bennington College. Since nearly twenty percent of students are from around the world, some students were not allowed to return. Even students who planned to attend this college in the future were unable to.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marikosilver/2018/07/07/travel-ban-hurts-u-s-college-students-too/|title=Travel Ban Hurts U.S. College Students Too|last=Silver|first=Mariko|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> Universities like New York University, updated its students on each iteration of the travel ban to keep students educated on what they can do if they are affected by the order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/students-affected-january-2017-executive-order.html|title=Students Affected by Travel Ban Executive Order|date=June 26, 2018|website=New York University}}</ref> Many university administrators believe that due to President Trump's view on immigration, students abroad have become reluctant to study in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/international-enrollment-drop.html|title=As Flow of Foreign Students Wanes, U.S. Universities Feel the Sting|last=Saul|first=Stephanie|date=January 2, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 1, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Students that have the F1 visa are put at risk with this executive order. Since F1 visas only allow these visa holders one-entry into the United States, this executive order may not allow these individuals to come back if they decide to leave the country for a school break. Due to the ban, the students on F1 visas may not be able to see their families for several years especially if their parents cannot enter the United States as a result of the ban.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-decision-uphold-travel-ban-anxiety-uncertainty/story?id=56326492|title=Supreme Court travel ban ruling causes fear for international students: Advocates|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref>

Following Trump's announcement of the order, the topic began to trend on social media. Hashtags such as #MuslimBan, #TravelBan and #BanTrumpFromUK emerged.

=== #RefugeeCaravan ===
The refugee caravan was the several thousands of migrants that traveled a long way to the US-Mexico border trying to enter America. About 7,000 migrants have reached the border and are staying in shelters. President Trump has labeled this caravan as "an invasion." It was also reported that many Mexican citizens saw the migrants as an invasion as well, where marches were organized against the undocumented migrants being in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-interest-the-caravan-invasion-has-apparently-waned|title=Trump's interest in the caravan 'invasion' has apparently waned|date=November 9, 2018|website=MSNBC|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2018/11/19/669193788/shouting-mexico-first-hundreds-in-tijuana-march-against-migrant-caravan|title=Shouting 'Mexico First', Hundreds In Tijuana March Against Migrant Caravan|website=NPR|access-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref>

<nowiki>#</nowiki>RefugeeCaravan sparked awareness of what these immigrants were going through in their journey to the United States. Although this movement did not directly spark from the executive order, it is a movement that followed the events of the travel ban. The movements that emerged from this executive order and from #RefugeeCaravan were started from the same foundational belief that all people should not have to be restricted into entering the United States. Tweets updated followers of the movement on who which asylum seekers were granted entry into the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/migrant-caravan-asylum.html|title=A Refugee Caravan is Hoping for Asylum in the U.S. How Are These Cases Decided?|last=Jordan|first=Miriam|date=April 30, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 1, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Legal challenges to the order were brought almost immediately after its issuance. From January 28 to 31 almost 50 cases were filed in federal courts. The courts, in turn, granted temporary relief, including a nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] (TRO) that bars the enforcement of major parts of the executive order. The TRO specifically blocks the executive branch from enforcing provisions of the executive order that (1) suspend entry into the U.S. for people from seven countries for 90 days and (2) place limitations on the acceptance of refugees, including "any action that prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities."<ref name="LiptakStands">{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Where Trump's Travel Ban Stands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trumps-travel-ban.html|access-date=March 13, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 6, 2017|page=A10}}</ref> The TRO also allows "people from the seven countries who had been authorized to travel, along with vetted refugees from all nations, to enter the country." The Trump administration appealed the TRO.<ref name="LiptakStands"/> According to the DHS inspector general, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers then violated the court orders by continuing to prevent some foreign passengers from boarding flights bound for the United States.<ref name=NYT20january18/><ref name=IGreport/>  DHS officials contest the DHS inspector general's finding that the court orders were violated.<ref name=NYT20january18/><ref name=IGreport/>

The plaintiffs challenging the order argue that it contravenes the [[United States Constitution]], federal [[statute]]s, or both. The parties challenging the executive order include both private individuals (some of whom were blocked from entering the U.S. or detained following the executive order's issuance) and the states of Washington and Minnesota, represented by their [[state attorneys general]]. Other organizations such as the ACLU also challenged the order in court. Additionally, fifteen Democratic state attorneys general released a joint statement calling the executive order "unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful", and that "[w]e'll work together to fight it".<ref>[[Edward Isaac Dovere]], [http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-immigration-attorneys-general-234338 Democratic state attorneys general vow action against refugee order], ''[[Politico]]'' (January 29, 2017).</ref><ref>Official Twitter account of New York State Attorney General Eric T.

In response to the lawsuits the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement on January 29 that it would continue to enforce the executive order and that "prohibited travel will remain prohibited". On the same day a White House spokesperson said that the rulings did not undercut the executive order. On January 30 Acting Attorney General [[Sally Yates]], an Obama administration holdover pending the confirmation of Trump's nominee barred the Justice Department from defending the executive order in court; She said she felt the order's effects were not in keeping "with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right".<ref name="wsj 1/30">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/acting-attorney-general-orders-justice-dept-not-to-defend-trumps-travel-ban-1485819447|title=Acting Attorney General Orders Justice Dept.

Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed a late dissent on March 17, 2017 to the 9th Cir. opinion in ''Washington v. Trump'' arguing against the State of Washington's Establishment Clause claims on grounds that Trump's speech during the campaign was political protected by the [[First Amendment]]. (Even though the 9th Circuit had declined to address that issue in reaching its ruling on ''Washington v. Trump'' and U.S. courts do not typically rule on issues that are not before them, Kozinski argued it was ok for him to address the issue because the district judge in Hawaii had cited the 9th Circuit opinion in reaching its Establishment Clause ruling.)<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/03/the_9th_circuit_s_alex_kozinski_defends_trump_s_travel_ban_on_first_amendment.html|first=Richard|last=Hasen|title=Does the First Amendment Protect Trump's Travel Ban?|date=March 20, 2017|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/03/17/17-35105_Amd_Order.pdf|date=March 17, 2017|title= No. 2:17-cv-00141 Amended Order}}</ref>
