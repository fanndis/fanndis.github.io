''Helsinki Times'' has had partnerships with ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[CNN]], [[Reuters]], [[Inter Press Service]], and other prominent international media outlets. Columns and articles from these media had been published in ''Helsinki Times'' regularly and some of them advertised their sites and services in ''Helsinki Times''.

During that partnership, which lasted from 2014 to 2016, in addition to its original columns and articles, some articles from the Finnish paper were translated and published in English on the website of ''Helsinki Times''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/8349-helsingin-sanomat-and-helsinki-times-to-cooperate.html|title=Helsingin Sanomat and Helsinki Times to cooperate|work=Helsinki Times|accessdate=14 August 2014}}<br>{{cite news|title=Helsingin Sanomat ja Helsinki Times yhteistyöhön|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/Helsingin+Sanomat+ja+Helsinki+Times+yhteisty%C3%B6h%C3%B6n/a1384327761315|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat|date=14 November 2013|language=Finnish}}</ref>
