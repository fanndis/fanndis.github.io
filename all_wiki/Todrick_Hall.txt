Hall feels his tenacious work ethic comes from the lack of opportunities he had in the entertainment industry as a Black gay man; it also fueled his desire to be a creator and help open the door for other performers, especially minorities.<ref name=":18" /> When he was seventeen, Hall embarked on a project to mount, and hopefully tour, a musical version of the hit 1939 film [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']] but he could not afford the performing rights.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":15">{{Cite web|agency=Associated Press|date=2010-02-22|title='American Idol' finalist Todrick Hall in hot water over failed kids' musical production|url=https://www.cleveland.com/tv/2010/02/american_idol_finalist_todrick.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-06|website=|language=en}}</ref> He envisioned a project that opened up the performance arts to children as he had been as a child.<ref name=":16" /> He learned that the children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', that the movie was based on, was in the [[public domain]].<ref name=":14" /> Hall reimagined the book's story for a modern setting and added characters to his musical, ''Oz, The Musical'', including a sassy [[doo-wop]] trio of girls who act as the narrator.<ref name=":14" /> Area children auditioned for the musical; a hundred were cast as the majority of the actors presenting the dozen new songs in a range of genres from country to hip hop and rock.<ref name=":14" /> The first shows were local, and the children loved them, a Dallas banker stepped in to be the financial backer for the projects.<ref name=":15" /> They mounted a small tour in Texas which lost money but as the director Hall was not responsible for any shortcomings, although he felt responsible.<ref name=":15" /> A larger national tour was mounted, with the leads played by celebrity [[tweens]] including [[Aundrea Fimbres]], [[Orlando Brown (actor)|Orlando Brown]], [[Ryne Sanborn]], [[Ryan Knowles]], and [[Vonzell Solomon]], the show toured through 2010.<ref name=":14" /><ref name=":172">{{Cite web|title=American Idol Semi-Finalist Todrick Hall Back on Broadway in Memphis|url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/153312/american-idol-semi-finalist-todrick-hall-back-on-broadway-in-memphis/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=Broadway.com|language=en}}</ref>
