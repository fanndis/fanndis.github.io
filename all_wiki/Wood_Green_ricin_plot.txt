The '''Wood Green ricin plot''' was an alleged [[bioterrorism]] plot to attack the [[London Underground]] with [[ricin]] poison.

Within two days, the Biological Weapon Identification Group at the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] in [[Porton Down]] were sure that there was no trace of ricin on any of the articles that were found. This fact was initially misreported to other government departments as well as to the public, who only became aware of this in 2005.<ref name="globsec">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/nsn/nsn-050411.htm|title=UK Terror Trial Finds No Terror: Not guilty of conspiracy to poison London with ricin|date=11 April 2005|first=George|last=Smith|accessdate=17 October 2006|publisher=Globalsecurity.org}}</ref> Reporting restrictions were in place before the public's perceptions could be corrected.<ref name="bbcsum">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4433499.stm|date=13 April 2005|title=Questions over ricin conspiracy|first=Chris|last=Summers|accessdate=17 October 2006 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=bbc-20051021>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4441903.stm|date=13 April 2005|title=Terror trial had blanket news ban|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref>

The only subsequent conviction was of [[Kamel Bourgass]], sentenced to 17 years imprisonment for conspiring "together with other persons unknown to commit public nuisance by the use of poisons and/or explosives to cause disruption, fear or injury" on the basis of five pages of his hand-written notes on how to make ricin, [[cyanide]] and [[botulinum]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/alqaida/story/0,,1585130,00.html|date=14 April 2005|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|work=The Guardian |location=UK|title=The ricin ring that never was|accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref> Bourgass had already been sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for the [[Murder of Stephen Oake|murder of detective Stephen Oake]], whom he stabbed to death during his arrest in [[Manchester]].

The fact that no ricin had been found was known to some government departments very early on, but this information was not revealed to the public until after Bourgass's trial two years later, although in the interim it was cited as evidence for further [[Terrorism Acts|terrorism laws]], as well as featuring in US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]]'s [[United Nations Security Council and the Iraq War|5 February 2003 speech to the UN]] to build the case for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], as part of the alleged [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] global terrorist network. As late as February 2006, Chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] described it as a significant terrorism plot spanning 26 countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4708816.stm|date=13 February 2006|title=Full text of Gordon Brown's speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London|author=Gordon Brown|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref>

==Trials==
On 30 June 2004, Kamel Bourgass was convicted for the [[Murder of Stephen Oake|murder of DC Stephen Oake]] during his arrest and was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 22 years. During periods of his imprisonment, Bourgass has been placed in segregation after he was accused by prison authorities of involvement in attacks on other prisoners and attempts to force other inmates to convert to Islam.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12502772 Terrorists Bourgass and Hussain denied court challenge]</ref>

The trials of five defendants, including Bourgass, for conspiracy to commit murder and as part of a ricin plot, began in September and lasted until 8 April 2005. Bourgass alone was convicted and sentenced to 17 years for conspiring to cause a public nuisance by "plotting to spread ricin and other poisons on the UK's streets".<ref name="bbctrial">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4433709.stm|date=13 April 2005|title=Killer jailed over poison plot|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref> Mouloud Sihali and David Khalef are convicted of possessing false passports.<ref name="bbctimeline">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4433459.stm|date=13 April 2005|title=The ricin case timeline|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref>

On 12 April 2005 the jury was dismissed after failing to reach a verdict on the charge of conspiring to commit murder, and a second trial of four further defendants was abandoned before it started.<ref name="bbctrial"/>

There had been a blanket ban on the media reporting on anything involving the Bourgass case for two years until the trial had ended.<ref name=bbc-20051021 /> In October 2005, [[Eliza Manningham-Buller, Baroness Manningham-Buller|Eliza Manningham-Buller]], the [[Director General of MI5]], revealed that the evidence which uncovered the so-called ricin plot came from Mohamed Meguerba, a man who jumped bail and fled to Algeria where he was detained and probably subjected to torture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4363254.stm|date=21 October 2005|title=MI5's 'torture' evidence revealed|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref>

==Criticisms==
On 13 April 2005, Jon Silverman, a legal affairs correspondent for the BBC wrote:
<blockquote>
[I]s this case... notable for the way in which criminal investigations are shamelessly exploited for political purposes by governments in the UK and United States, whether to justify the invasion of Iraq or the introduction of new legislation to restrict civil liberties?

A key unexplained issue is why the Porton Down laboratory, which analysed the material and equipment seized from a flat in Wood Green, said that a residue of ricin had been found when it had not.<ref>{{cite news|date=13 April 2005|title=Comment: Questions unanswered|first=Jon|last=Silverman| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4442479.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 October 2006}}</ref>
</blockquote>

On 11 April 2005, George Smith, of GlobalSecurity.org summed up:
<blockquote>
It is no longer a surprise when one finds that many claims from the alleged best of American government intelligence in the war on terror are bogus. It is still dismaying, though, to see intelligence derived from materials submitted in the alleged trial of the "UK poison cell" that is so patently rotten. Who was informing Colin Powell on the nonsense before his date with the UN Security Council?

There was no UK poison cell linked to al Qaida or Muhamad al Zarqawi. There was no ricin with which to poison London, only notes and 22 [[castor oil plant|castor seeds]] . There was no one who even knew how to purify ricin.<ref name="globsec"/>
</blockquote>

On 17 August 2006, [[Craig Murray]] summed up on ''[[CounterPunch]]'':
<blockquote>
I spoke at the annual Stop the War conference a couple of months ago [and] referred to the famous ricin plot... It was alleged that a flat in North London inhabited by Muslims was a "Ricin" factory, manufacturing the deadly toxin which could kill "hundreds of thousands of people". Police tipped off the authorities that traces of ricin had been discovered. In the end, all those accused were found not guilty by the court. The "traces of ricin" were revealed to be the atmospheric norm.

The "intelligence" on that plot had been extracted under torture in Algeria. Another police tip-off to the media was that the intelligence said that the ricin had been stored in plastic jars, and they had indeed found plastic jars containing a suspicious substance. It turned out the containers in question were two Brylcreem tubs. What was in them? In the first, paper clips. In the second, Brylcreem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/murray08182006.html |date=17 August 2006 |title=The Hair Gel Terror Hype&nbsp;— Hitting a Nerve |first=Craig |last=Murray |publisher=Counterpunch |accessdate=18 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929132806/http://www.counterpunch.org/murray08182006.html |archivedate=29 September 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The Wood Green conspiracy allegations were also depicted critically in the 2007 documentary ''[[Taking Liberties (film)|Taking Liberties]]''.
