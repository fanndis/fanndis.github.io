'''''Bethenny''''' is an American [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated television]] [[talk show]] that was hosted by [[Bethenny Frankel]], who also served as co-producer and creator with [[Ellen DeGeneres]]. The series debuted as a summer test run on June 11, 2012 on six stations owned by [[Fox Television Stations]]. It premiered nationwide across the United States and Canada starting on September 9, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title='Bethenny', Bethenny Frankel's Talk Show, to Premiere in National Syndication September 9|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/05/03/bethenny-bethenny-frankels-talk-show-to-premiere-in-national-syndication-september-9/180948/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724121152/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/05/03/bethenny-bethenny-frankels-talk-show-to-premiere-in-national-syndication-september-9/180948/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 24, 2013|publisher=TV by the Numbers|date=May 3, 2013}}</ref>

==Production==
The idea to bring Frankel to talk television had been in the planning stages in 2011, but disagreements over the series' concept and failure to clear the show in major television markets resulted in the project being shelved that November.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harnick|first=Chris|title=Bethenny Frankel's Talk Show Fails to Find Syndicated Home|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/11/28/bethenny-frankel-talk-show/|work=The Huffington Post|date=November 28, 2011}}</ref> In January 2012, however, the project was revived when the Fox Stations group approached [[Warner Bros. Television]] about testing the show out as a summer replacement for some of the syndicated programs that were cancelled or had ended production.<ref>{{cite web|last=Albiniak|first=Paige|title=''Bethenny'' to Air in Summer Test on Fox|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/479542-Exclusive_NATPE_2012_Bethenny_to_Air_in_Summer_Test_on_Fox.php|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=January 24, 2012}}</ref>

The summer test showed promising results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Downey|first=Kevin|title=Syndicated ''Bethenny'' Off To Strong Start|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/60070/syndicated-bethenny-off-to-strong-start|work=TVNewsCheck|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref> Warner Bros. Television announced that once the show finished its six-week test run, it would put the show on hiatus and syndicate it nationally in fall 2013. On July 6, 2012, Warner Bros. Television announced ''Bethenny'' was cleared by the entire Fox Television Stations Group, well ahead of its September 2013 launch.<ref>{{cite web|last=Downey|first=Kevin|title=Fox Stations Set To Give OK To ''Bethenny''|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/60611/fox-stations-set-to-give-ok-to-bethenny|work=TVNewsCheck|date=July 6, 2012}}</ref> In some markets, the show was used to replace the cancelled ''[[Anderson Live]]'', which was also distributed by Warner Bros. Television.

In Canada, the show airs on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CTV 2|CTV Two]], with air times varying by market to allow for [[Simultaneous substitution|simsubbing]].

On February 14, 2014, ''Bethenny'' was cancelled due to a loss of [[Affiliate marketing|affiliate]] clearances to [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution|NBC Universal Domestic Television Distribution]]'s upcoming ''[[The Meredith Vieira Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Bethenny Frankel's Talk Show Cancelled|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/02/bethenny-frankel-talk-show-cancelled/|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=February 14, 2014|date=February 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bethenny Frankel's Talk Show Cancelled|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bethenny-frankels-talk-show-canceled-680367|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=February 14, 2014|author=Alex Ben Block|date=February 14, 2014}}</ref> Despite the "final show" airing in May 2014, new episodes continued to air until July 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Bethenny'' - Episode Guide for Season 1|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/bethenny/episodes/SH015634330000|work=Zap2it|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}</ref>

==Ratings==

Though the series did not place first in ratings since its September 2013 relaunch, the show opened with a 0.9 rating.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Soft Start For 'Bethenny' As 'Ellen' Tops All Syndicated Talk Show Premieres|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/09/soft-start-for-bethenny-as-ellen-tops-all-syndicated-talk-show-premieres/|work=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref> ''Bethenny'' averaged a 0.9 household rating, ranking No.14 among talk shows above only ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[The Test (TV series)|The Test]]'', and ''[[The Trisha Goddard Show|Trisha]]'', all of whom were also cancelled in May 2014 along with ''Bethenny''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Aguilera|first=Leanne|title=Bethenny Frankel's Talk Show Canceled After One Season|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/511098/bethenny-frankel-s-talk-show-canceled-after-one-season|work=E!
