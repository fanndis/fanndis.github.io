The '''Young Republican National Federation''', commonly referred to as the '''Young Republicans''' or '''YRNF''', is a [[527 organization]] for members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party of the United States]] between the ages of 18 and 40.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.njyrf.com/teen-republicans/|title=Teen Republicans|website=NJYRF|access-date=2016-09-24}}</ref> It has both a national organization and chapters in individual [[U.S. state|states]]. 

Although frequently confused, the YRNF is independent from the [[College Republican National Committee|College Republicans]].

Young Republican Clubs are both social and political in nature. Many of them sponsor various social events and [[social network|networking]] events for members. In addition, Young Republican Clubs assist Republican political candidates and causes.

== History ==
Although Young Republican organizations existed as early as 1856 with the founding of [[The New York Young Republican Club]]<ref>https://nyyrc.com/history/</ref>, the Young Republican National Federation was formed by [[George H. Olmsted]] at the urging of [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Guernsey|first=JoAnn Bren|title=Hillary Rodham Clinton : secretary of state|year=2010|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-7613-5122-1|page=20}}</ref> The YRNF was officially founded in 1931.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Howard R.|last2=Sabato|first2=Larry J.|title=Encyclopedia of American political parties and elections|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-379E2mFmYC&q=Young&pg=PA266|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-5875-4|page=497|edition=Updated}}</ref>

== Organizational structure ==
The YRNF has limited control over its state federations. A few states, including Montana and the District of Columbia, act as both a state and local chapter, while a majority of states, including Texas and California, grant strong autonomy to individual clubs. Some federations include a regional chair to handle issues of clubs in the same city or plan larger events in a particular part of the state.

State Federations elect a chair, treasurer, secretary, national committee man and national committee woman. Depending on the state, vice-chair, immediate past chair, or other directors are also elected to form the executive committee.

Voting rights at state meetings are giving to each member of the executive committee, as well as regional chairs and club presidents. The state chair, national committee man, and national committee woman serve on the national governing board and elect a national chair, co-chair, treasurer, secretary, assistants, and others.

Most clubs are allowed to form after having a small group of active members, those who pay club dues and are under 41 years of age, and by having the club pay a fee to its state governing body on an annual basis.

Presently, the National Federation does not collect dues from either its state federations or its club members, raising money only through attendance at national events and from private donations. The YRNF is an auxiliary of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. YRNF owns the trademark to the term "Young Republican" and the YRNF logo.

== National Convention of Young Republicans ==
Conventions are held every two years. The 2019 Young Republican National Convention was in Omaha, Nebraska where Rick Loughery was unanimously elected Chairman for the 2019–2021 term. The 2017 Young Republican National Convention was held in Annapolis, Maryland. The 2015 Young Republican National Convention was held in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The 2013 Young Republican National Convention was held in [[Mobile, Alabama]].  The 2011 Convention was held in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  The 2021 Young Republican National Convention is slated for [[Indianapolis, Indiana]].
