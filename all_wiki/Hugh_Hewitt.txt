Amid the Trump-Ukraine scandal, which led to the impeachment of President Trump, Hewitt floated a conspiracy theory that the whistleblower complaint that set off the scandal was by a whistleblower who was trying to divert attention from his own involvement in a "Clintons-Obama-Biden collusion debacle".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/gop-divided-by-whistleblower-complaint-on-trump-and-ukraine.html|title=GOP Divided Over How Enthusiastically to Cover for Trump's Corruption on Ukraine|last=Levitz|first=Eric|date=2019-09-26|website=Intelligencer|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/09/trump-and-his-right-wing-allies-are-losing-their-minds-over-the-whistleblower-complaint/|title=Trump and his right-wing allies are losing their minds over the whistleblower complaint|last=Spinelli|first=Dan|website=Mother Jones|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> He penned an op-ed about the impeachment inquiry titled, "Impeachment-minded Democrats, welcome to Al Capone’s vault.

===CNN Debate===
Hewitt was booed during a [[CNN]] debate in 2015 for his controversial questioning of presidential candidate [[Ben Carson]]. He asked whether Carson was capable of ordering "ruthless" military strikes that could kill thousands of innocent children.<ref name="time-debate-ref">{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4150910/republican-debate-ben-carson-isis/|title=Audience Boos as Ben Carson Asked About Bombing Children|website=Time}}</ref> Following Carson's initial answer to the question, Hewitt asked Carson to confirm whether he was, in fact, "OK with the death of thousands of innocent children and civilians." The audience subsequently booed Hewitt.<ref name="time-debate-ref" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/live-from-the-venetian/2015/12/hugh-hewitt-ben-carson-innocent-children-war-216820|title=Hugh Hewitt booed after pressing Ben Carson|first=Hadas|last=Gold|work=Politico}}</ref>
