==History==
DocuSign was founded in 2003 by Court Lorenzini, Tom Gonser and Eric Ranft. Tom Gonser came up with the idea when he was at NetUpdate, a company he founded in 1998 and where he served as CEO. Through its history, NetUpdate had acquired several companies, including an e-signature start-up in Seattle called DocuTouch that had been funded by Timberline Venture Partners, Bill Kallman and Jeff Tung with $4M. Timberline invested another $1 M in the merger into Netupdate.<ref name="DocGon">[http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/411921/Online+Signatures+DocuTouch+Introduces+DocuSign.htm Online Signatures: DocuTouch Introduces DocuSign] ''Internet News'' July 11, 2000</ref><ref name="NetUp">[http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/dailybriefing/2001_162/-394526-1.html?zkPrintable=true NetUpdate Buys DocuTouch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108045716/http://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/dailybriefing/2001_162/-394526-1.html?zkPrintable=true |date=2014-01-08 }} ''National Mortgage News'' August 22, 2001</ref> DocuTouch held patents on Web-based digital signatures and collaboration. With internal support from Gonser, Lorenzini negotiated the purchase of certain DocuTouch assets from NetUpdate and started DocuSign. Gonser then left the NetUpdate Board to focus on DocuSign full-time.

The firm began sales in 2005 when zipForm, now zipLogix, integrated DocuSign into its virtual real estate forms. Mock trials featuring licensed attorneys and real judges highlighted the admissibility of DocuSign contracts in court based on encrypted audit logs of signature events as well as the impossibility of changing contracts.<ref name="Mock">[http://www.docusign.com/blog/2009/07/10/work-smarter-with-a-tool-your-mom-can-use/ Work Smarter with a Tool Your Mom Can Use] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707210947/http://www.docusign.com/blog/2009/07/10/work-smarter-with-a-tool-your-mom-can-use/ |date=July 7, 2012 }} Bui, An ''DocuSign'' July 10, 2009</ref>
