'''Tampax''' (a [[portmanteau]] of tampon and pack) is a brand of [[tampon]] currently owned by [[Procter & Gamble]] and sold in over 100 countries. 

The brand and product were created by Dr. [[Earle Haas]], who filed a patent in the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/06/history-of-the-tampon/394334/|title=The Tampon: A History|last=Fetters|first=Story by Ashley|date=2015-06-01|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2019-11-27|issn=1072-7825}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/124929-the-history-of-the-tampon-because-they-havent-always-been-for-periods|title=The Bizarre History Of The Tampon|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> The original product was designed from the start as flushable and [[biodegradeable]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In 1937, Tampax worked with the [[McCann Erickson]] agency for its marketing campaigns and in 1949 Tampax appeared in more than 50 magazines. From 1930s to 1940s Tampax chose sportswomen as their brand ambassadors.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-7kAgAAQBAJ&q=tampax|title=Qualifying Times: Points of Change in U.S. Women's Sport|last=Schultz|first=Jaime|date=2014-03-15|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252095962|language=en}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], Tampax produced wound dressings for the military. 

Tampax conducted medical studies in 1945 to prove the safety of tampons.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njfQfrMr31EC&q=history+of+tampons&pg=PA142|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|last1=Delaney|first1=Janice|last2=Lupton|first2=Mary Jane|last3=Toth|first3=Emily|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252014529|language=en}}</ref>
