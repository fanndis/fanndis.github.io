On 16 September 2010, Farron stood for the position of President of the Liberal Democrats following [[Rosalind Scott, Baroness Scott of Needham Market|Baroness Scott]]'s decision not to seek re-election. He won the election with 53% of the vote, beating fellow candidate [[Susan Kramer]] on 47%.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11750362 |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Tim Farron elected as Lib Dem president |accessdate=13 November 2010 |date=13 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114044648/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11750362 |archive-date=14 November 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In March 2012, Farron was one of three MPs who signed a letter sent to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]], criticising their recent decision to stop the Christian group "Healing on the Streets of Bath" from making explicit claims that prayer can heal. The letter called for the ASA to provide indisputable scientific evidence that faith healing did not work; Farron subsequently admitted that the letter was not "well-worded" and that he should not have signed it "as it was written".<ref>{{Cite news | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/29/tim-farron-prayer-can-heal-letter-was-a-mistake_n_1387187.html | work= [[Huffington Post]] UK | title= Tim Farron: 'Prayer Can Heal' Letter Was A Mistake | accessdate= 30 March 2012 | date= 29 March 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331222728/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/29/tim-farron-prayer-can-heal-letter-was-a-mistake_n_1387187.html | archive-date= 31 March 2012 | url-status= live | df= dmy-all }}</ref>
