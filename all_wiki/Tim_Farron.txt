In March 2012, Farron was one of three MPs who signed a letter sent to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]], criticising their recent decision to stop the Christian group "Healing on the Streets of Bath" from making explicit claims that prayer can heal. The letter called for the ASA to provide indisputable scientific evidence that faith healing did not work; Farron subsequently admitted that the letter was not "well-worded" and that he should not have signed it "as it was written".<ref>{{Cite news | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/29/tim-farron-prayer-can-heal-letter-was-a-mistake_n_1387187.html | work= [[Huffington Post]] UK | title= Tim Farron: 'Prayer Can Heal' Letter Was A Mistake | accessdate= 30 March 2012 | date= 29 March 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331222728/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/29/tim-farron-prayer-can-heal-letter-was-a-mistake_n_1387187.html | archive-date= 31 March 2012 | url-status= live | df= dmy-all }}</ref>
