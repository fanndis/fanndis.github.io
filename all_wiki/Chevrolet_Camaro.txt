== Background ==
Before any official announcement, reports began running during April 1965 within the automotive press that [[Chevrolet]] was preparing a competitor to the [[Ford Mustang]], code-named ''Panther''.<ref name="PantherDied">{{cite web |url=https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/The_Day_the_Panther_Died |title=The Day the Panther Died |last=Settlemire |first=Scott |work=GM Heritage Center |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715205006/https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/The_Day_the_Panther_Died |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On June 21, 1966, around 200 automotive journalists received a telegram from General Motors stating, "...please save noon of June 28 for important SEPAW meeting. Hope you can be on hand to help scratch a cat. Details will follow...(signed) John L. Cutter&nbsp;– Chevrolet public relations&nbsp;– SEPAW secretary." The following day, the same journalists received another General Motors telegram stating, "Society for the Eradication of Panthers from the Automotive World will hold first and last meeting on June 28...(signed) John L. Cutter&nbsp;– Chevrolet public relations SEPAW secretary." These telegrams puzzled automotive journalists.<ref name="PantherDied"/>

On June 28, 1966, General Motors held a live press conference in Detroit's Statler-Hilton Hotel. It was the first time that [[conference call|14 cities were connected in real-time for a press conference via telephone lines]].<ref name="PantherDied"/> Chevrolet general manager [[Pete Estes]] started the news conference stating that all attendees of the conference were charter members of the ''Society for the Elimination of Panthers from the Automotive World'' and that this would be the first and last meeting of ''SEPAW''. Estes then announced a new car line, project designation ''XP-836'', with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter ''C'' such as the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]], [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]], [[Chevrolet Nova|Chevy II]], and [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]. He claimed the name, ''suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner'' and that ''to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... go.'' The ''Camaro'' name was then unveiled.<ref name="PantherDied"/> Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, ''what is a Camaro?'' and were told it was ''a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147864031 |title=Top 10: Muscle cars |last=Biggs |first=Henry |date=February 3, 2006 |publisher=MSN Cars UK |quote=When asked, Chevrolet sales executives claimed a Camaro was a: 'a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs'. |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723022033/http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147864031 |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}</ref>

According to the book ''The Complete Book of Camaro: Every Model Since 1967'', the name ''Camaro'' was conceived by Chevrolet merchandising manager Bob Lund and General Motors vice president Ed Rollett, while they were reading the book ''Heath's French and English Dictionary'' by James Boïelle and by de V. Payen-Payne printed in 1936. In the book ''The Complete Book of Camaro'', it states that Mr. Lund and Mr. Rollett found the word ''camaro'' in the French-English dictionary was [[slang]], to mean ''friend, pal, or comrade''. The article further repeated Estes's statement of what the word ''camaro'' was meant to imply, that the car's name "suggests the comradeship of good friends, as a personal car should be to its owner".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Book of Camaro: Every Model Since 1967 |last=Newhardt |first=David |year=2013 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0-7603-3961-9 |page=26}}</ref> In fact, the actual French word that has that meaning is "camarade," from which the English word "comrade" is derived,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comrade|title=Comrade - Definition of comrade|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref> and not "camaro"; "camaro" is not a recognized word in the French language.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.larousse.fr/ |title=Larousse |author=Éditions Larousse|work=larousse.fr |accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref>

The Camaro was first shown at a press preview in Detroit on September 12, 1966, and later in Los Angeles, on September 19, 1966. Public introduction of the new model was on September 26, 1966.<ref>{{cite book|page= 4 |title=The Camaro White Book, 1967-2002 |first=Mike |last= Antonick |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7603-1879-9}}</ref> The Camaro officially went on sale in dealerships on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 [[model year]].<ref>Antonick, p. 21.}</ref>

== First generation (1967–1969) ==
{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)}}
[[File:'67 Chevrolet Camaro (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '12).JPG|thumb|[[Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)|First-generation Camaro]] ]]

The first-generation Camaro debuted in September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 on a new rear-wheel drive [[GM F platform|GM F-body platform]] and was available as a two-door [[coupé]] or [[convertible]] with 2+2 seating, and a choice of {{convert|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[inline-6]] or {{convert|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}, {{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|396|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the [[Ford Mustang]], Chevrolet executives realized that their compact sporty car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]], would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its rear-engine design, as well as declining sales, partly due to the negative publicity from [[Ralph Nader]]'s book, ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]''. Therefore, the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as the Mustang and Chevy II Nova. In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro lasted until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro [[Fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaro|fifth-generation Camaro]].

The first-generation offered a standard, ''Super Sport'', and ''Rally Sport'' editions. In 1967, the Z/28 model was added featuring stripes on the hood and trunk, styled rally road wheels, and a {{convert|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. In the Rally Sport edition, it was more the style of the car itself. Placed with the hideaway headlights, wing windows, and the more rounded out rear fender. Once they brought out the 1968 year they introduced the use of side marker lights. The 1968 Camaro eliminated the [[Quarter glass|vent windows]] as were standard on the doors for 1967.

== Second generation (1970–1981) ==
{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)}}
[[File:1971 Camaro SS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Second-generation Camaro]] (1971 SS model shown)]]

Introduced in February 1970, the second-generation Camaro was produced through the 1981 model year, with cosmetic changes made in 1974 and 1978 model years. The car was heavily restyled and became somewhat larger and wider with the new styling. Still based on the [[GM F platform|F-body platform]], the new Camaro was similar to its predecessor, with a unibody structure, front subframe, an A-arm front suspension, and leaf springs to control the solid rear axle. The 1980 and 1981 Z28 models included an air induction hood scoop with an intake door that opened under full throttle.  The RS SS package was dropped in 1972 and reintroduced in 1996.

''Road & Track'' included the 1971 SS350 as one of the 10 best cars in the world in August 1971.

== Third generation (1982–1992) ==
{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)}}
[[File:Chevrolet Camaro Z28 (10065927676).jpg|thumb|right|[[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Third-generation Camaro]] (1983 Z/28-E model shown)]]

The third-generation Camaro was produced from 1981 (for the 1982 model year) to 1992. These were the first Camaros to offer modern fuel injection, [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] 700R4 four-speed [[automatic transmission]]s, five-speed [[manual transmission]]s, 14,15- or 16-inch wheels, a standard OHV [[GM Iron Duke engine#Tech IV|4-cylinder]] engine,<ref>Antonick, p. 86.</ref> and [[hatchback]] bodies. The cars were nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg|0}} lighter than the second generation model.

The [[International Race of Champions|IROC]]-Z was introduced in 1985 and continued through 1990. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) Regulations required a CHMSL (Center High Mounted Stop Lamp) starting with the 1986 model year. For 1986, the new brake light was located on the exterior of the upper center area of the back hatch glass. Additionally, the 2.5&nbsp;L Iron Duke pushrod 4-cylinder engine was dropped, and all base models now came with the 2.8&nbsp;L V6 (OHV). For 1987 and later, the CHMSL was either mounted inside the upper hatch glass, or integrated into a rear spoiler (if equipped). In 1985, the {{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} small block V8 was available with [[indirect injection]] called "tuned port injection" (TPI). In 1987 the L98 {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine became a regular option on the IROC-Z, paired with an automatic transmission only. The convertible body style returned in 1987 (absent since 1969) and all came with a special ''"20th Anniversary Commemorative Edition''" leather map pocket. 1992 offered a ''"25th Anniversary Heritage Package"'' that included stripes and a unique spoiler plaque. Beginning in 1988, the 1LE performance package was introduced, optional on street models, and for showroom stock racing in the U.S. and Canada. The [[Chevrolet Camaro B4C|B4C]] or "police" package was made available beginning in 1991. This created a Z28 in more subtle RS styling.

{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (fourth generation)}}
[[File:1997 Camaro Z28.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chevrolet Camaro (fourth generation)|Fourth-generation Camaro]] (1997 Z/28 model shown)]]

The fourth-generation Camaro debuted in 1993 on an updated [[GM F platform|F-body platform]]. It retained the same characteristics since its introduction in 1967: a coupé body style with 2+2 seating (with an optional [[T-top]] roof) or [[convertible]] (reintroduced in 1994), rear-wheel drive, pushrod 6-cylinder and [[V8 engine|V8]] engines. The standard powerplant from 1993 to 1995 was a 3.4&nbsp;L V6, then a 3.8&nbsp;L V6 was introduced in 1995. A [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT1|350 MPFI (LT1) Small Block V-8 engine]], which was introduced in the Corvette in 1992, was standard in the Z28. Optional equipment included all-speed traction control and a new six-speed T-56 manual transmission; the 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission was standard on the Z28, yet optional on the V6 models which came with a 5-speed manual as standard. Anti-lock brakes were standard equipment on all Camaros. A limited quantity of the SS version (1996-1997) came with the 330 HP [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT4|LT4]] small block engine from the Corvette, although most were equipped with the 275&nbsp;hp LT1. The 1997 model year included a revised interior, and the 1998 models included exterior styling changes, and a switch to GM's aluminum block [[GM LS1 engine|LS1]] used in the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5|Corvette C5]]. In 1998, the 5.7&nbsp;L LS1 was the first all-aluminum engine offered in a Camaro since the 1969 ZL-1 and carried a 305-horsepower rating.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.classicchevrolets.com/chevy-camaro-1993-2002/ |title=Chevy Camaro 1993 to 2002 |work=Chevrolet History |publisher=Classicchevrolets.com |date=May 26, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref> The SS versions (1998-2002) received slightly improved exhaust and intake systems, bigger wheels and tires, a slightly revised suspension for improved handling and grip while retaining ride comfort, an arc-shaped rear wing for downforce, and different gearing ratios for faster acceleration, over the Z28 models. Chevrolet offered a 35th-anniversary edition for the 2002 model year. Production of the F-Body platform was discontinued due to slowing sales, a deteriorating market for sports coupés, and plant overcapacity, but an entirely new platform went on sale in 2009. The B4C Special Service Package for police agencies was carried over from the 3rd generation & sold between 1993 and 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/533524/posts |title=GM to Discontinue Camaro, Firebird |first=Ed |last=Garsten |agency=Associated Press |date= September 27, 2001 |newspaper=Free Republic |location=Fresno, CA |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hotrod.com/articles/0409phr-2007-chevrolet-camaro/ |title= Rising from the Ashes |date=July 29, 2004 |last=Hunkins |first=Johnny |work=Hot Rod Network |quote= Publicly, GM blamed slow sales, a deteriorated sports coupé market, and plant overcapacity. |accessdate=October 21, 2016}}</ref>

In addition to the original 2012 Camaro LS model. Chevrolet has manufactured the 2LS model. The 2LS model uses a slightly different rear axle ratio than the original LS. Having a 2.92 rear axle ratio increased fuel economy to about 19/30 miles per gallon. The 2012 model allowed drivers to reach 7200 rpm which higher than before for the V6; delivering an overall boost in the power and performance of the car. Almost all 2LS models have been released with various styles of a rear spoiler on the back as well. The 2LS was made for a better fuel mileage than the Camaro LS.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/buy/2012-Chevrolet-Camaro-2LS__2dr_Coupe/expert-review/|title=2012 Chevrolet Camaro New Car Test Drive|website=Autoblog|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref>

Convertibles had the same options as the coupé (engines, RS, SS, etc.). The Camaro convertible added an aluminium brace over the engine assembly, and under the transmission. Due to the [[2011 Fukushima earthquake]], certain pigments were not available to make certain colors.

In November 2011, the export version (excluding the Japanese version) of the Camaro was introduced after a two-year delay. The delay was due to the unexpected domestic demand. The export version included different [[Taillamps|tail lamps]] with integrated reverse and amber turn signal lamps, larger external rearview mirrors with integrated side turn signal repeaters, a rear bumper without reverse light inserts, and other changes as to comply with ECE regulations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.camaroz28.com/2011-export-camaro-details-differences/ |title= 2011 Export Camaro Details & Differences |publisher= camaroz28.com |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref>

The Camaro was one of the vehicles in the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]]-sanctioned [[Trans-Am Series]]. Chevrolet worked with [[Roger Penske]] to operate their unofficially factory-backed Trans Am team, winning the title in 1968 and 1969 with [[Mark Donohue]]. [[Jim Hall (race car driver)|Jim Hall]]'s Chaparral team replaced Penske for the 1970 season. Warren Agor of Rochester, NY, was the series' leading Camaro privateer, his orange #13's o, 1993, 1994, and 1998.

There was also another SCCA Trans-Am Series Camaro that was not popular because of racing but because of its body modifications. This Camaro, number 13, had been built and driven by Henry “Smokey” Yunick. Smokey Yunick was a car builder who worked to reduce the weight of his cars by acid-dipping body parts and installing thinner safety glass.

Camaro-styled cars also race in the [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], with all Chevrolet teams having used the body since 2013.

The Penske/Donohue Camaros also had the front sheet metal dropped, all four fenders widened, windshield laid back, front sub-frame “Z’d” to lower the car, the floor pan moved up and even the drip-rails were moved closer to the body. This Camaro had always kept its stock look and had a 302 engine that was able to produce 482 horsepower. One part that had come out of his testing was the Edelbrock Cross-Manifold. To this day the Smokey Yunick 1968 Camaro is owned by Vic Edelbrock Jr.

[[Bob Jane]] won both the [[1971 Australian Touring Car Championship|1971]] and [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]] [[Australian Touring Car Championship]]s at the wheel of a Camaro.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/a/australiantouringcarchampionship.php |title= Australian Touring Car Championship |publisher=Cars and Racing Stuff |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref>

The Camaro was the official car of and used in the [[International Race of Champions]] starting in 1975 and lasting for 12 years until 1989. It was the first American car of the series succeeding the [[Porsche Carrera|Porsche Carrera RSR]].

Camaros are a favorite in [[drag racing]], having won many championships, and can be currently found in several series from the [[National Hot Rod Association]], [[International Hot Rod Association]], and [[United States Hot Rod Association]]. [[Road racing]] Camaros can currently be found in the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s American Sedan series. They have also been the vehicle used in the Swedish [[Camaro Cup]] series since 1975.

The Camaro was the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car in 1967, 1969, 1982, 1993, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2016. The Camaro also paced races at Daytona, Watkins Glen, Mosport in Canada, and Charlotte Motor Speedway.

The Camaro was also a regular in the [[IMSA GT Series]].

The fifth-generation Camaro took to the tracks in 2010 in the GT class of the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand Am]] Road Racing Championship. Stevenson Motorsports announced that it was seeking to run a two-car team of [[Pratt & Miller]] built cars, based on the same spaceframe as the Pontiac GXP-R.<ref>Interview with John Stevenson, Speed TV Grand Am Montreal 200 broadcast, August 29, 2009</ref> The team also competed with Camaros in the Grand Sports class of the Grand-Am's Continental Tire Challenge.<ref>{{cite press release |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=Stevenson Motorsports |url= http://cdn.motosnap.com/DealerImages/Website_1193/111308%20Stevenson%20Camaro%20KONI%20Press%20Release.pdf |title= Stevenson Motorsports to Race a Brand New Chevrolet Camaro in the Grand-Am KONI Challenge Series |accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref>

The Camaro ZL1 was introduced in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] in 2018, replacing the discontinued [[Holden Commodore (VF)|Chevrolet SS]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Crossman|first=Matt|url=http://autoweek.com/article/nascar-sprint-cup/camaro-zl1-chevys-pick-2018-monster-energy-nascar-cup-series-car|title=Camaro ZL1 is Chevy's pick for 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series car|publisher=Autoweek |date=August 10, 2017|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}</ref> On February 18, 2018, [[Austin Dillon]] won the [[2018 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] in the ZL1's debut.
