Australian ''[[Rolling Stone Australia|Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s reviewer, Darren Levin, rated it at four out-of five stars and explained, "'Do you want it back?' she asks the man she was supposed to marry, before devoting an entire verse to the awkward practicalities of an engagement gone sour. This man is not metaphorical, and neither is the marriage. Each song, says Washington, is connected to a real-life event – from the frank confession of infidelity on the raw ballad 'Begin Again' to 'Get Happy', where she falls in love over Eighties New Wave textures... On [this album], she's both fearless and direct."<ref name="Levin">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161207171310/http://rollingstoneaus.com/reviews/post/megan-washington-there-there/542/ | url = http://rollingstoneaus.com/reviews/post/megan-washington-there-there/542/ | title = Album Review: Megan Washington – ''There There'' | last = Levin | first = Darren | work = [[Rolling Stone Australia|Rolling Stone]] | archivedate = 7 December 2016 | date = 10 September 2014 | accessdate = 1 March 2019 }}</ref>

It provided singles, "Who Are You" (February 2014), "Limitless" (May) and "My Heart Is a Wheel" (September); a music video was created for the latter. She explained that "My Heart Is a Wheel" was inspired by [[Kanye West]]'s "Runaway". Co-producer Dixon told the media that the album is her, "saying ... 'This happened and it's my fault.'

Washington had a brief domestic relationship with Tim Rogers (of [[You Am I]]).<ref name="Zuel">{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/dream-turns-into-fog-of-sleeplessness-20120105-1pmo2.html | title = Megan Washington ''Insomnia'' Interview | last = Zuel | first = Bernard | work = The Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Fairfax Media | date = 6 January 2012 | accessdate = 2 September 2012 }}</ref> However, "[it] ended before they made ''The Boy Castaways''."<ref name="Shedden">{{cite web | url = https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/music/singer-megan-washington-teams-up-with-ex-on-big-screen/news-story/aa91cb8c58a7dbf92cb745fade1866a0 | title = Singer Megan Washington teams up with ex on big screen | last1 = Shedden | first1 = Iain | last2 = music writer | work = [[The Australian]] | date = 18 July 2013 | accessdate = 26 February 2019 }}</ref> She described how, "He's a great performer and I guess whatever history we share I've never been able to see him work, so it was amazing to see how good he is."<ref name="Shedden"/> She also reflected on her acting aspirations, "I had always acted through high school and at uni, and there was a time when I thought that was what I wanted to do, but then I got bitten by the jazz bug and here we are."<ref name="Shedden"/>

After the release of her debut album, Washington relocated to [[Brooklyn]], New York City, in August 2011, which fulfilled a long-held goal. However, she recounted in 2014 that she was "dreadfully unhappy there", as she was unable to find any "meaning" in the constant "partying and drinking" that she engaged in and conceded "I would have been dreadfully unhappy" regardless of location at that time.<ref name="Jan">{{cite news|author1=Janine Israel|title=Megan Washington: I'm happy to throw myself on the fire of creativity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/sep/12/megan-washington-im-happy-to-throw-myself-on-the-fire-of-creativity|accessdate=13 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=12 September 2014}}</ref> She explained that she no longer sought therapy through her music, due to a relationship with a "good therapist": "My art doesn't have to play that role any more and probably my next record will be a disco record about trying to find a car park."<ref name="Jan" />

In 2017 Washington announced her marriage to Nick Waterman, and the couple have a child.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/central-sydney/megan-washington-looks-to-the-future-as-she-debuts-fourth-album-with-sydney-symphony-orchestra-at-opera-house/news-story/65464723ee96a88ef319e623823273f4|title=I want people to really feel this music|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en}}</ref>
