==Career==
===1991–2006: Career in Sweden===
RedOne was born as Nadir Khayat in [[Tetouan]], Morocco. In an interview, he said he was the ninth and youngest child in his family.<ref>https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=redone+interview&view=detail&mid=A1D440653CCA99681700A1D440653CCA99681700&FORM=VIRE</ref> In 1991, he immigrated to [[Sweden]] when he was 19,<ref name=globalpost>{{cite news |url= http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/morocco/110929/morocco-redone-lady-gaga-jlo-jennifer-lopez-music |author= Aida Alami |title= Hollyworld: Meet Morocco's starmaker |work= Global Post|date= 30 September 2011 |accessdate= 15 August 2013}}</ref> to pursue a career as a musician.<ref name=emusic/><ref name="hitquarters.com"/> In an interview with HitQuarters website, he said his moving to Sweden was because, "there was so much good music coming from there" mentioning [[ABBA]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], and [[Roxette]] as among the most influential to him.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

Originally, he pursued his musical ambitions in Sweden by singing and playing guitar in various local rock bands{{which|date=April 2015}} for about four years from 1991 to 1995. He also acquired [[Swedish nationality law|Swedish citizenship]] by naturalization.

In 1995, he changed directions by opting to produce and write songs for other artists.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Instrumental in helping him make this transition was [[Rami Yacoub]], another fellow ex-rock musician.<ref name="Interview with Rami">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/2009/August10_0_0_1.html|last=Bouwman |first=Kimbel |title=Interview with Rami Yacoub quote |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref> Yacoub, a Palestinian-Swedish songwriter/producer already enjoyed considerable success and was a well-established producer. Inviting RedOne to work with him in the studio, he taught RedOne about "programming and how the software works" and the pair co-wrote a number of songs together.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> During this period of cooperation, RedOne worked with the successful Swedish girl band Popsie writing their songs "Funky" and "Joyful Life" co-written and co-produced by Yacoub and RedOne (and where RedOne was credited on Popsie's 1998 self-titled album as songwriter and producer Nadir K). He chose the alias 'RedOne', a pseudonym of the name of a friend of his, Redouan.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Redouan introduced Rami to Max Martin, Yacoub was asked some time later to join [[Cheiron Studios]]<ref name="Interview with Rami"/> and the two parted company with Yacoub working extensively with huge names like [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Westlife]] and [[Céline Dion]], amongst others.

RedOne then moved on to produce various Swedish and European [[pop music|pop]] acts. In 2001–2002, he co-produced [[A-Teens|A*Teens]], originally an [[ABBA]] teen tribute band that already had a huge hit with ''[[The ABBA Generation]]''. RedOne co-produced two of their follow-up albums, ''[[Teen Spirit (album)|Teen Spirit]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Pop 'Til You Drop]]'' in 2002 with some original songs like "...to the Music", "Slam" co-written with Flame, Hortlund, and J. Boogie and "Singled Out" co-written with [[AJ Junior]], Dhani, Sara, [[Savan Kotecha]], and ShawnDark in a bid to launch them as "more than just a cover band".

After years of struggling, RedOne finally began to achieve recognition for his work in 2005. He wrote two songs for [[Daniel Lindström]]'s self-titled chart-topping album, "[[Break Free (song)|Break Free]]" and "My Love Won't Let You Down". RedOne then had his first number one on [[Sverigetopplistan]] with [[Darin Zanyar]]'s "[[Step Up (Darin song)|Step Up]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Darin- Step Up (Song)|url=http://www.swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Darin&titel=Step+Up&cat=s|publisher=swedishcharts.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> The song, co-written by RedOne, Darin, and RedOne's frequent collaborator [[Bilal Hajji]], won them a [[Grammis|Swedish Grammy]] and "Scandinavian Song of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|title=WMC 2011 Schedule Panelist: RedOne|url=http://www.wintermusicconference.com/events/schedule/2011/panelist/160643/+RedOne.html|publisher=[[Winter Music Conference]]|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> He went on to co-produce Darin's two albums ''[[The Anthem (album)|The Anthem]]'' and self-titled album ''[[Darin (album)|Darin]]'' alongside well-known producers like [[Ghost (production team)|Ghost]], [[Jörgen Elofsson]], [[Arnthor Birgisson]] and George Samuelson.

RedOne had crossover success with the Canadian singer and [[Juno Award]] [[Carl Henry (singer)|Carl Henry]] with hits "I Wish" and "Little Mama".<ref>{{cite web|last=Montgomery-Spencer|first=Jeunesse|title=Carl Henry [Interview]|url=http://www.hiphopcanada.com/2009/09/interview-carl-henry/|publisher=HipHopCanada.com|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> In the ensuing period, he went on to produce a number of Swedish and European pop acts. These included the Dutch pop band [[Ch!pz]] (2005), two songs Cariño Mio and [[Wanna Play]] by the Mexican teen group [[RBD]] for the album [[Rebels (album)|Rebels]] (2006), American [[Christina Milian]] in a remix of her track "L.O.V.E." as "L.O.V.E. (RedOne remix)" from her album ''[[Best Of (Christina Milian album)|Best Of]]'', the Dutch singer [[EliZe]] in "[[Itsy Bitsy Spider (EliZe song)|Itsy Bitsy Spider]]" and Swedish ''Idol'' contestant and popular singer [[Ola Svensson]] in "Cops Come Knocking" and "Go Go Sweden", the latter in support of the [[Swedish national football team]], all in 2006. In 2005, he also worked with pop singer [[Britney Spears]] and songwriter [[Michelle Bell]] on a track titled "Money Love and Happiness",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=7867755&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212203819/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=7867755&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 December 2015|title=Money Love and Happiness (Legal Title)|publisher=BMI|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=431190099&search_in=i&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=25&start=1|title=ASCAP ACE – Money Love and Happiness|publisher=ASCAP|accessdate=27 November 2010}}</ref> but the track remained [[List of unreleased Britney Spears songs|unreleased]] until 2012, when Bell leaked the track in full online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muumuse.com/2012/04/daily-b-songwriter-michelle-bell-leaks-money-love-happiness-talks-lost-original-doll-album.html/|title=Daily B: Songwriter Michelle Bell Leaks "Money Love & Happiness," Talks Lost 'Original Doll' Album|last=Stern|first=Bradley|publisher=Muumuse.com|date=5 April 2012|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref>

===2006–2009: International breakthrough and move to the United States===
[[File:Lady Gaga BTW Ball Antwerp 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Gaga and RedOne produced songs such as "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]", "[[Bad Romance]]" and "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" during their partnership.]]

In 2006, RedOne produced the single "Bamboo" that was named an "Official Melody" for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. "Bamboo" was featured for the branding and promotion of the event during television broadcasts and advertising campaigns, branded cross-promotions, and as a part of the World Cup Official Music Program, gaining him much audio exposure.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334843 |title=World Cup Gets A Kick Out of RedOne's 'Bamboo' |publisher=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] |date=13 June 2006 |accessdate=15 October 2008}}</ref> In addition, [[FIFA|The Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) made him the main producer and songwriter for the 2006 World Cup Official Music Program.<ref name="BMI"/>

RedOne also produced a "mash-up" remix of [[Shakira]]'s "[[Hips Don't Lie]]" featuring [[Wyclef Jean]] and RedOne's "Bamboo." The remix was performed by Shakira and Wyclef Jean at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup's Final]] in Berlin to an estimated worldwide television audience of more than 1.2 billion.<ref name="BMI"/>

Although "Bamboo" helped establish him as a notable producer in the global marketplace,<ref name="BMI"/> RedOne himself claimed that the song didn't have the impact he thought it would, saying: "It was a good thing for me as a personal achievement but in terms of business or attracting labels to get more work, it didn't have a big impact, especially not in the US. It opened a few doors that closed quickly after."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_RedOne_Interview.html|last=Bouwman |first=Kimbel |title=Interview With RedOne|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> It was then that he decided to move to the United States with the aim of breaking his career there.

In 2007, RedOne decided to move to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] with his wife for better career opportunities, believing this to be his "now or never opportunity".<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Initially the move proved unsuccessful; he struggled to secure even a single production and lost all of his money in the process.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Penniless and sleeping on an air mattress with his wife, he was ready to move back to Sweden. He says in an interview with ''Global Post'': "I was really depressed, I told my wife, 'We gotta go back'. She said we should borrow money and try for a few more months and then really give up if nothing good happens".<ref name=globalpost/>

His American breakthrough came when he met with [[Epic Records]] to present a song for [[Kat DeLuna]], on an upcoming debut album of hers. RedOne started playing songs in front of the marketing team and label president [[Charlie Walk]]. After playing the song "[[Whine Up]]", RedOne says, "Walk interrupted me and said, "Stop, you're a genius!" I couldn't believe it. We spent the rest of the time playing music and dancing, it was surreal".<ref name=globalpost/> A subsequent meeting led to RedOne being given a [[Jennifer Lopez]] song to [[remix]] followed by a couple of demos for [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]. RedOne was also entrusted the production role on Kat DeLuna's debut album ''[[9 Lives (Kat DeLuna album)|9 Lives]]''.<ref name=globalpost/><ref name="hitquarters.com"/><ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Brandon_Creed_Interview.html|last=Bouwman |first=Kimbel |title=Interview with Brandon Creed |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref>

As 2007 came to a close, Alan Melina and Laurent Besencon, of New Heights Entertainment, the management company for Lady Gaga and RedOne, introduced the two of them.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Together, they wrote a song titled, "Boys, Boys, Boys", which was intended as a spin-off of [[Mötley Crüe]]'s "[[Girls, Girls, Girls (Mötley Crüe song)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]",<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/info/lady_gaga |title=Lady GaGa Profile |accessdate=20 February 2009 |last=Reporter |first=Staff |magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]] }}</ref> and produced hits that became hugely popular including "Just Dance", "Bad Romance" and "Poker Face".

===2010–present: Continued success and RedOne Records===
RedOne penned many of the songs sung by [[Alexey Vorobyov]] (also known as Alex Sparrow), who represented Russia in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|Eurovision Song Contest of 2011]] and eventually recruited the singer to his record label.<ref>{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|title=Sparrow, Pokerface writer have a go for Russia|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=27723&_t=sparrow_pokerface_writer_have_a_go_for_russia|publisher=Eurovision|date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

But now I find myself wanting to get back to singing and playing, and friends like Enrique have encouraged me to do so. I want to be an artist in a new way, rather than the traditional one. I’m going to do it the RedOne way, which is creating different sounds with different people, doing the records I want to do". On 15 May 2018, Social Media Sensation Saad Abid helped RedOne Support Morocco's bid for the [[Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid|2026 FIFA World Cup]] unter the #Maymkench2026.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2018/05/246293/maymkench2026-saad-abid-gad-elmaleh-morocco-2026/|title=#Maymkench2026 : Saad Abid Scores Gad Elmaleh's Support for Morocco 2026}}</ref>
