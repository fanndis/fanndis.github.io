Keller worked in the ''Times'' [[Moscow]] bureau from 1986 to 1991, eventually as bureau chief, spanning the [[Cold War (1985–91)|final years of the Cold War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. For his reporting during 1988 he won a [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name=pulitzer/>

C31</ref> and served in the following capacities:<ref name=NYT>[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/opinion/KELLER-BIO.html "Columnist Biography: Bill Keller"]. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 2013-11-02.

He won the [[Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting]] citing his "resourceful and detailed coverage of events in the U.S.S.R." during 1988.<ref name=pulitzer>[https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/bill-keller "Bill Keller"]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-11-01.</ref> That is, in the [[Soviet Union]] during the year it established its [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]], the last year before the [[revolutions of 1989]] in Central and Eastern Europe.

===2003 Invasion of Iraq===

Keller was a leading supporter of the 2003 [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]], explaining his backing for military action in his article 'The I-Can't-Believe-I'm-A-Hawk Club'.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50914F6395F0C7B8CDDAB0894DB404482 |newspaper=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller | title=The I-Can't-Believe-I'm-a-Hawk Club | date=February 8, 2003}}</ref> Two days after the invasion, Keller wrote the column 'Why Colin Powell Should Go',<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0915F634550C718EDDAA0894DB404482 |newspaper=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller | title=Why Colin Powell Should Go | date=March 22, 2003}}</ref> arguing for US Secretary of State's resignation because his strategy of diplomacy at the UN had failed. In contrast, Keller was much more sympathetic to Deputy Defence Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]], describing him as the 'Sunshine Warrior'.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D13FE3C540C718EDDA00894DA404482 |newspaper=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller | title=The Sunshine Warrior | date=September 22, 2002}}</ref>

===Judith Miller===

Keller spoke on July 6, 2005 in defense of [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and her refusal to give up documents relating to the [[Valerie Plame]] case.

===NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program===

Keller was reported to have refused to answer questions from ''The Times'' [[ombudsman|public editor]], [[Byron Calame]], on the timing of the December 16, 2005 article on the [[classified information|classified]] [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) [[NSA electronic surveillance program|Terrorist Surveillance Program]].  Keller's delay of the paper's reporting about NSA overreach until after Bush's close reelection was controversial.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://nymag.com/news/media/20334/ | title = The United States of America vs. Bill Keller | first = Joe | last = Hagan | journal = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date = September 18, 2006 }}</ref>  ''The Times's'' series of articles on this topic won a [[Pulitzer Prize]].  The source of the disclosure of this NSA program was investigated by the [[United States Justice Department]]. The NSA program itself was reviewed by the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] as to whether it sidesteps the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]], and after ''The Times'' articles, the Administration changed its procedures, allowing for more safeguards and more Congressional and judicial oversight.

Keller discussed the deliberations behind the Times' decision to publish the story in a July 5, 2006 PBS interview with Jeffrey Brown that included a discussion of the issues involved with former National Security Agency Director Admiral Bobby Ray Inman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/july-dec06/nytimes_07-05.html|title=Online NewsHour: Debate &#124; Newspaper Criticized for Leaks &#124; July 5, 2006 &#124; PBS<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref>

===Catholic Church sex abuse crisis===

Keller widely reported on the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] and flatly put the blame on [[John Paul II]] himself : "The uncomfortable and largely unspoken truth is that the current turmoil in the Roman Catholic Church is not just a sad footnote to the life of a beloved figure. This is a crisis of the pope's making."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5DB153DF937A35756C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=NYT article|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref>

===SWIFT===

Keller and ''The Times'' also published a story on another classified program to monitor terrorist-related financial transactions through the [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]]-based [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT) on June 23, 2006.  Many commentators,<ref>[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjE4ODFmMmI3ZmM5ZGE4ZDQxNmY1ODA5YTQ3NzkxZWQ The Media’s War Against the War Continues - Andrew C.

King]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-paper26jun26,1,2766639.story?coll=la-news-politics-national&track=crosspromo |title=Congressman Wants N.Y.

In an attempt to respond to criticism stemming from the disclosure of the classified [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]], the NSA program's official name, Keller stated in a published letter<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/business/media/25keller-letter.html/partner/rssnyt?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all |title=Letter From Bill Keller on The Times's Banking Records Report |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2006-06-25 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}</ref> that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] himself had acknowledged as early as September 2001 that efforts were underway "to identify and investigate the financial infrastructure of the international terrorist networks" and "to follow the money as a trail to the terrorists."  In an [[Op-ed]] column in ''The Times'', Keller, together with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editor [[Dean Baquet]] wrote that "Our job, especially in times like these, is to bring our readers information that will enable them to judge how well their elected leaders are fighting on their behalf and at what price."  Keller's critics, including [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[John W. Snow]], responded to Keller's letter by pointing out that there is a vast difference between stating general intentions to track terrorist finances and the exact means employed to achieve those goals. But, as Keller wrote, this was the same Secretary Snow who invited a group of reporters to a 6-day trip on a military aircraft "to show off the department's efforts to track terrorist financing."

==Nelson Mandela==

Keller wrote a 128-page juvenile biography of [[Nelson Mandela]] published by Kingfisher Books in 2008, ''Tree Shaker: the story of Nelson Mandela''.<ref>[http://lccn.loc.gov/2007003559 "Tree shaker: the story of Nelson Mandela"]. Library of Congress Catalog Record. Retrieved 2013-11-02.</ref><!--perhaps a first US edition, likely co-published in London and Boston-->He had served as the ''Times'' bureau chief in [[Johannesburg]] from April 1992 to May 1995<ref name=NYT/>—spanning the end of [[apartheid in South Africa]] and election of Mandela's [[African National Congress]] as the governing party in 1994.

Keller's wife since 1999, [[Emma Gilbey Keller|Emma Gilbey]], wrote a full biography of [[Winnie Mandela]] published in 1993, ''The Lady: The Life and Times of Winnie Mandela'' (Jonathan Cape).<ref name=emma/>

==KellerGate==
In January 2014, two articles by Keller and his wife about cancer blogger [[Lisa Bonchek Adams]] generated substantial controversy about the nature of social media, digital journalism and terminal illness.  The incident came to be known in social media as KellerGate.<ref name=KellerGate>{{cite web|url=https://thlibrary.wordpress.com/2014/01/20/kellergate-hashtags-of-the-week-hotw-week-of-january-20-2014|title = #Kellergate, Hashtags of the Week|date = January 20, 2014}}</ref>

On January 8, 2014, Keller's wife Emma had written an article about Lisa Adams in [[The Guardian]] about whether people with terminal illness should be so public on social media. She wrote "Should there be boundaries in this kind of experience? Is there such a thing as TMI? Are her tweets a grim equivalent of deathbed selfies? Why am I so obsessed?" The article was subsequently retracted by the editor, in part due to complaints by Adams and her family that the article "completely misrepresented the nature of her illness and her reasons for tweeting, was riddled with inaccuracies, and quoted from a private direct message to Keller through Twitter published without permission."<ref name="Emma-retracted">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/16/why-article-lisa-bonchek-adams-removed|title = Why an article on Lisa Bonchek Adams was removed from the Guardian site|last = Elliott|first = Chris|date = January 16, 2014}}</ref>

A week later, Bill Keller published his own article about Lisa Adams called "Heroic Measures," this time questioning whether Lisa's efforts to prolong her life were worth the effort and cost, and suggesting those who "accept their inevitable fate with grace and courage" should be worthy of equal praise.<ref name="Heroic-Measures">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/opinion/keller-heroic-measures.html|title=Heroic Measures|work=The New York Times|last = Keller| first = Bill |date = January 13, 2014}}</ref>

The article ignited a backlash in many media channels.  Articles appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'' ("Bill Keller Bullies Cancer Patient"),<ref name=NationBully>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/no-shame-bill-keller-bullies-cancer-patient/|title=No Shame: Bill Keller Bullies Cancer Patient|first=Greg|last=Mitchell|date=January 13, 2014}}</ref> and ''[[The New Yorker]]''<ref name=NewYorkerTweetingCancer>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/tweeting-cancer|title=Tweeting Cancer|work=The New Yorker |first=Meghan|last=O'Rourke|date=January 13, 2014}}</ref> among dozens of others.

The Times' public editor, Margaret Sullivan responded to the criticism in a public column.<ref name="KellerGateResponse">{{cite web|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/readers-lash-out-about-bill-kellers-column-on-a-woman-with-cancer/?_r=0|title=Readers Lash Out About Bill Keller's Column on a Woman With Cancer|first=Margaret|last=Sullivan|date=January 13, 2014|work=The New York Times}}</ref> The response included Keller's responses defending the column. Sullivan wrote that it is not her practice to comment on whether she agrees with columnists, but did cite "issues here of tone and sensitivity." She also pointed out factual inaccuracies which were subsequently corrected.

==The Marshall Project==

[[The Marshall Project]] is a nonprofit nonpartisan online journalism organization covering [[crime in the United States|criminal justice in the United States]]. The project was originally conceived by former hedge fund manager, filmmaker and journalist [[Neil Barsky]], who announced it in his byline in an unrelated ''New York Times'' article in November 2013.<ref name=deblasio>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/chill-out-1-percenters.html|title = Chill Out, 1 Percenters|last = Barsky|first = Neil|date = November 15, 2013|accessdate = May 8, 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="capital-in-depth">{{cite web|url = http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/magazine/2014/07/8548087/marshall-projects-charmed-launch|title = The Marshall Project's charmed launch|last = Pompeo|first = Joe|date = July 1, 2014|accessdate = May 7, 2015|publisher = [[Capital New York]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002429/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/magazine/2014/07/8548087/marshall-projects-charmed-launch|archive-date = March 4, 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> In February 2014, ''The New York Times'' reported that Keller was going to work for the Marshall Project.<ref name="capital-in-depth"/><ref name="keller-leaves-nyt">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/business/media/bill-keller-former-editor-of-the-times-is-leaving-for-news-nonprofit.html?_r=0|title = Bill Keller, Former Editor of The Times, Is Leaving for News Nonprofit|last = Somaiya|first = Ravi|date = February 9, 2014|accessdate = May 8, 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref> The Marshall Project formally launched in November 2014<ref name="capital-launch">{{cite web|url = http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/10/8555216/marshall-project-launch-november|title = The Marshall Project to launch in November|date = October 23, 2014|accessdate = May 7, 2015|publisher = [[Capital New York]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001608/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/10/8555216/marshall-project-launch-november|archive-date = March 4, 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> and as of 2017, Keller is still working and leading the editorial efforts there.
