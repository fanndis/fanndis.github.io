{{Main|Name of the Czech Republic}}
The traditional English name "Bohemia" derives from Latin "Boiohaemum", which means "home of the [[Boii]]" ([[Gauls|Gallic]] tribe). The current English name comes from the [[Polish language|Polish]] ethnonym associated with the area, which ultimately comes from the Czech word ''Čech''.<ref name="CollinsDictionary">{{cite web|title=Czech definition and meaning|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/czech|website=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]]|accessdate=19 November 2012|quote="'''C19: from Polish, from Czech ''Čech'''''"|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234347/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/czech|archive-date=16 January 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="American Heritage Dictionary">{{cite web|title=Czech|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Czech|website=[[American Heritage Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|accessdate=24 January 2018|quote="'''[Polish, from Czech ''Čech''.]'''"}}</ref><ref name="OxfordDictionary">{{cite web|title=Czech - Definition in English|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/czech|website=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=11 April 2018|quote="'''Origin  Polish spelling of Czech ''Čech''.'''"|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412000947/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/czech|archive-date=12 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The name comes from the Slavic tribe ({{lang-cs|Češi, Čechové}}) and, according to legend, their leader [[Lech, Čech, and Rus|Čech]], who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on [[Říp Mountain]].

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:CzechRepublic-geographic map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map]]
The Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes [[48th parallel north|48°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]] and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

[[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkonoše]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sněžka]] at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder]] River ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).

Water from the Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|sp=us|adj=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Western European broadleaf forests]], [[Central European mixed forests]], Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.

There are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is [[Krkonoše National Park]] ([[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]]), and the others are [[Šumava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyjí National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].

The three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly some countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond with the river basins of the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).

=== Climate ===
[[File:Czech Republic Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of the Czech Republic
{{legend|#3dc6fa|[[Humid continental climate]]}}
{{legend|#63fd32|[[Oceanic climate]]}}
{{legend|#007e7e|[[Subarctic climate]]}}
]]

The Czech Republic mostly has a temperate [[oceanic climate]], with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is due to the landlocked geographical position.<ref>R. Tolasz, ''Climate Atlas of the Czech Republic'', Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, Prague, 2007. {{ISBN|80-244-1626-3}}, graphs 1.5 and 1.6</ref>

Temperatures vary depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[Bílý Potok (Liberec District)|Bílý Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another factor is the distribution of the mountains.

At the highest peak of [[Sněžka]] ({{convert|1603|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, Prague, has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.

The coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is [[snow]] in the mountains and sometimes in the cities and lowlands. During March, April, and May, the temperature usually increases, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary during the day. Spring is also characterized by higher water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.

The warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about {{convert|20|-|30|C-change|F-change}} higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.

Autumn generally begins in September, which is still warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous]] trees begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.

Most [[rain]] falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least {{convert|0.1|mm|abbr=on}} of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated rainfall (days with more than {{convert|10|mm|abbr=on}} per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).<ref>R.

It seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] effected a compromise with Hungary only.

In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the [[Velvet Revolution]].

Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatisation]]s, with the intention of creating a [[market economy]]. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognized by the World Bank as a "developed country",<ref name="worldbank06" /> and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of "Very High Human Development".<ref name="hdi09">{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2009 |work=UNDP.org |accessdate=25 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122115116/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |archive-date=22 November 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

From 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the [[Schengen Area]]. Until 2017, either the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] or [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|liberal-conservatives]] led the government of the Czech Republic.

The Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]]. The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') is bicameral, with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] ({{lang-cs|Poslanecká sněmovna}}) (200 members) and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] ({{lang-cs|Senát}}) (81 members).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psp.cz/en/docs/laws/constitution.html |title=The Constitution of the Czech Republic – Article 16 |publisher=Czech Republic |accessdate=8 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903213530/http://www.psp.cz/en/docs/laws/constitution.html |archive-date=3 September 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Member of Parliament#Czech Republic|members of the Chamber of Deputies]] are elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]], with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia. The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat [[electoral district|constituencies]] by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. This arrangement is modeled on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff.

The president is a formal head of state with limited and specific powers, who appoints the prime minister, as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. From 1993 until 2012, the [[President of the Czech Republic]] was selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms (2x [[Václav Havel]], 2x [[Václav Klaus]]). Since 2013 the presidential election is direct.<ref>{{cite news|title=Klaus signs Czech direct presidential election implementing law|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/tema/zpravy/klaus-signs-czech-direct-presidential-election-implementing-law/823441|publisher=Czech Press Agency|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234425/http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/tema/zpravy/klaus-signs-czech-direct-presidential-election-implementing-law/823441|archive-date=16 January 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{See also|Regions of the Czech Republic|List of districts of the Czech Republic}}
Since 2000, the Czech Republic has been divided into [[Regions of the Czech Republic|thirteen regions]] ([[Czech language|Czech]]: [[wikt:en:kraj#Czech|''kraje'', singular ''kraj'']]) and the capital city of [[Prague]]. Every region has its own elected regional assembly and a regional governor. In Prague, the assembly and presidential powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.

The older seventy-six [[List of districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three "statutory cities" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046|title=The death of the districts|accessdate=13 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131346/http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046|archive-date=15 February 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Energy ===
{{Main|Energy in the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Nuclear.power.plant.Dukovany.jpg|thumb|[[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station]]]]
Production of Czech electricity exceeds consumption by about 10 [[Kilowatt hour|TWh]] per year, which are exported. [[Nuclear power]] presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6 percent from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is [[Temelín Nuclear Power Station]], another [[nuclear power plant]] is in [[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station|Dukovany]].

The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. Natural gas is procured from Russian [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from Norwegian companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine, Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost double electricity consumption.

Christianization in the 9th and 10th centuries introduced [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. After the [[Bohemian Reformation]], most Czechs became [[Hussites|followers]] of [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chelčický]] and other regional [[Protestant Reformers]]. [[Taborites]] and [[Utraquists]] were [[Hussite]] groups. During the [[Hussite Wars]], Utraquists sided with the Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist—Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] by the [[Catholic Church]] while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the [[Reformation]], some Bohemians went with the [[Lutheranism|teachings of Martin Luther]], especially [[Sudeten Germans]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly [[anti-Catholic]] stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions were revived. After the [[Habsburgs]] regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism—even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing [[secularization]]. Protestantism never recovered after the [[Counter-Reformation]] was introduced by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] in 1620.

According to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% was Catholic, 0.8% was [[Protestant]] (0.5% [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren|Czech Brethren]] and 0.4% [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Hussite]]),<ref>The [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] contains mixed Protestant, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and national elements. Classifying it as either one is disputable.

[[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]] is the treasure of prehistoric art. [[Theodoric of Prague]] was a painter in the Gothic era who decorated the castle Karlstejn. In the Baroque era, there were [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], [[Jan Kupecký]], [[Karel Škréta]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] or [[Petr Brandl]], sculptors [[Matthias Braun]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]]. In the first half of the 19th century, [[Josef Mánes]] joined the romantic movement. In the second half of the 19th century had the main say the so-called "National Theatre generation": sculptor [[Josef Václav Myslbek]] and painters [[Mikoláš Aleš]], [[Václav Brožík]], [[Vojtěch Hynais]] or [[Julius Mařák]]. At the end of the century came a wave of [[Art Nouveau]]. Alfons Mucha became the main representative. He is known for [[Art Nouveau]] posters and his cycle of 20 large canvases named [[the Slav Epic]], which depicts the history of Czechs and other [[Slavs]].

{{As of|2012}}, [[the Slav Epic]] can be seen in the Veletržní Palace of the [[National Gallery in Prague]], which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic. [[Max Švabinský]] was another Art nouveau painter. The 20th century brought avant-garde revolution. In the Czech lands mainly expressionist and cubist: [[Josef Čapek]], [[Emil Filla]], [[Bohumil Kubišta]], [[Jan Zrzavý]]. Surrealism emerged particularly in the work of [[Toyen]], [[Josef Šíma]] and [[Karel Teige]]. In the world, however, he pushed mainly [[František Kupka]], a pioneer of abstract painting. As illustrators and cartoonists in the first half of the 20th century gained fame [[Josef Lada]], [[Zdeněk Burian]] or [[Emil Orlík]]. Art photography has become a new field ([[František Drtikol]], [[Josef Sudek]], later [[Jan Saudek]] or [[Josef Koudelka]]).

The Czech Republic is known for its individually made, mouth blown and decorated [[Bohemian glass]].

The earliest preserved stone buildings in Bohemia and Moravia date back to the time of the [[Christianization]] in the 9th and 10th century. Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. During the 13th century it was replaced by the [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. In the 14th century Emperor Charles IV invited to his court in Prague architects from France and Germany, [[Matthias of Arras]] and [[Peter Parler]]. During the Middle Ages, some fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as some monasteries.

The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be mixed with Renaissance elements. An example of the pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the [[Queen Anne's Summer Palace]], which was situated in the garden of [[Prague Castle]]. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving an influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious châteaux with arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens.<ref name=architecture>{{cite web|title=History of Czech Architecture|url=http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|website=eu2009.cz|publisher=Czech Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=20 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015211407/http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.<ref name=czecharchitecture>{{cite web|title=The History of Architecture|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|website=www.czech.cz|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212429/http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia.<ref name=kotalik>{{cite book|last=Kotalík|first=Jiří|title=Architektura barokní|year=2002|publisher=Správa Pražského hradu a DaDa|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-86161-38-9|page=13|edition=Deset století architektury|language=cs}}</ref>

In the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity – the ''Baroque Gothic style'', a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles.<ref name=architecture />

During the 19th century stands the [[Revival architecture|revival architectural styles]]. Some churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed buildings in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] styles. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the new art style appeared in the Czech lands – [[Art Nouveau]].

Bohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the [[Cubism]] of painting and sculpture into architecture.

Between World Wars I and II, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style.<ref name=architecture />

After World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became Soviet influenced. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement known as the ''[[Brussels style]] came up'' in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. [[Brutalism]] dominated in the 1970s and 1980s.

The Czech Republic is not shying away from the more modern trends of international architecture.<ref name=architecture />

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Czech literature}}The literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in [[Latin]] and German or even [[Old Church Slavonic]]. [[Franz Kafka]], who—while bilingual in Czech and German{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164–210}}—wrote his works (''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'') in German.

In the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of the German [[Minnesang]] and courtly literature. The Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century.

[[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translations]] played a role in the development of Czech literature. The oldest Czech translation of the [[Psalms]] originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488. The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593. The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.

Czech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages; the Hussite period; the [[Renaissance humanism]]; the Baroque period ; the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century, modern literature in second half of the 19th century; the avant-garde of the interwar period; the years under Communism; and the Czech Republic.

The antiwar comedy novel ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'' is the most translated Czech book in history.

The international literary award the [[Franz Kafka Prize]] is awarded in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franzkafka-soc.cz/cena-franze-kafky/|title=Společnost Franze Kafky – Cena Franze Kafky|website=www.franzkafka-soc.cz|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113073540/http://www.franzkafka-soc.cz/cena-franze-kafky|archive-date=13 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Czech literature and culture played a role on at least two occasions when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqNKzuQ1N70C&q=Czech+culture+and+literature+in+political+activity&pg=PP9|title=The Struggle for the Soul of the Nation: Czech Culture and the Rise of Communism|last=Abrams|first=Bradley F.|date=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3024-9|language=en}}</ref>

The roots of Czech theatre can be found in the Middle Ages, especially in cultural life of [[gothic period]]. In the 19th century, the theatre played a role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century it became a part of the modern European theatre art. Original Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s. This project called [[Laterna magika]], resulting in productions that combined theater, dance and film in a poetic manner, considered the first [[multimedia art]] project in international context.

A drama is [[Karel Čapek]]'s play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', which introduced the word "[[robot]]".
