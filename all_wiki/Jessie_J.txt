Give me something to draw or an outfit to pick for someone, or hair, make-up, acting, write a song, I'm fine with it, but anything to do with sums – it was never my thing."

Despite people thinking that her first notoriety was through YouTube, Jessie was signed for four years before her first video was posted.
Jessie first came to the attention of Lava Records when her publisher at Sony/ATV, Rich Christina, sent Lava president [[Jason Flom]] a link to her MySpace page, which the record executive loved.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_FlomJ.html |title=Interview with Jason Flom |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2011}}</ref> After seeing an impressive US showcase, Lava, along with several other labels, was keen to sign the artist but progress was hampered by her management's insistence on, what Flom called, a "crazy deal", and their refusal to let Jessie speak to any labels directly.<ref name="hitquarters"/> Despite this, Senior Director of A&R at Lava, Harinder Rana, made surreptitious efforts to meet Jessie on her own in winter of 2008. Later in the year a change in management to Sarah Stennett and Nadia Khan of Crown Music allowed record deal negotiations to take place. Jessie eventually signed with Lava as part of a joint venture with Universal Republic.<ref name="hitquarters"/>

Originally, she wrote the song with [[Rihanna]] in mind because "[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]" was released at the time, partly inspiring the song.

Music critic Matthew Perpetua of [[Pitchfork Media]] compared her to her peers [[Adele]] and [[Amy Winehouse]], but suggested she was missing something: "Whereas Adele and Winehouse also have powerhouse voices, they fit into clear aesthetic niches and invest their songs with depth and humanity. Jessie J doesn't have even a fraction of their restraint." Perpetua added: "Her idea of showcasing her gift is to shoot for a blaring [[melisma]] on "Mamma Knows Best" that makes [[Christina Aguilera]] seem as subtle as [[Joni Mitchell]] by comparison."<ref>{{cite web|last=Perpetua |first=Matthew |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15246-who-you-are/ |title=Jessie J: Who You Are &#124; Album Reviews |work=Pitchfork Media |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>

Ailbhe Malone of the music magazine ''[[NME]]'' also recognised Cornish's "undeniably potent voice".

===Health===
In early 2011, Jessie J suffered a [[panic attack]] on stage after she was forced to perform in the dark. "I did a gig recently and had a panic attack on stage," she said. "The night was called 'Black Out' and I had to perform in the dark. I asked them to turn on the lights and they didn't. I was onstage in pitch black and, because I couldn't see anything, I started to panic. It was awful."<ref name=BBC2011>{{cite web|last=Copsey|first=Robert|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a305418/jessie-j-suffers-on-stage-panic-attack.html|title= Jessie J suffers on stage panic attack|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref>
