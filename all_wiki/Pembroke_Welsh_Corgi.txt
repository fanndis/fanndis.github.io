The '''Pembroke Welsh Corgi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|ɡ|i}}; [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for "dwarf dog") is a [[cattle]] [[herding dog]] [[dog breed|breed]] that originated in [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]].<ref name="WelshCorgis"/> It is one of two breeds known as a [[Welsh Corgi]].

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'', which states that the breed is considered an excellent working dog.
According to the American Kennel Club, Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 13th most popular breed of dog in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/ |title=MOST POPULAR DOG BREEDS IN AMERICA |accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Pembroke Welsh Corgi.jpg|thumb|Pembroke Welsh Corgi]]

===Appearance===
The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears that are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The breed standard indicates that the ears should be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be "fox-like" in shape and appearance. Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the [[Cardigan Welsh Corgi]] by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg.<ref name="Beauchamp1999">{{cite book|author=Richard G. Beauchamp|title=Welsh Corgis: Pembroke and Cardigan: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Grooming, Behavior, and Training|url=https://archive.org/details/welshcorgispembr00beau|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-7641-0557-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/welshcorgispembr00beau/page/15 15]}}</ref> The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a "fairy saddle", somewhat lighter markings on each side of the [[withers]] caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth.<ref name="DVM2009">{{cite book|author=Debra M.

Breed faults exist; some which may acknowledge genetic health conditions such as "fluffies" which are corgis with very long coats,<ref>{{cite book|last=Eldredge|first=Debra M|title=Pembroke Welsh Corgi: Your Happy Healthy Pet, with DVD|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-44364-4|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-PgLOoHM8kC&q=Pembroke+Welsh+Corgi+fluffies&pg=PA17}}</ref> and "bluies," which have a dilute colour (red coats present with a bluish cast).<ref name="Beauchamp2010">{{cite book|author=Richard G.

While some outlying Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with their tail naturally short or missing, the majority often have their tails [[Docking (dog)|docked]] between 2–5 days old due to historical tradition or to conform to the Breed Standard.<ref>[http://www.pwcca.org/standard_of_perfection.html PWCCA Standard of Perfection]</ref> Artificial docking was needed for the dog to do its job as a herding dog in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} A non-herding, "companion" dog was considered a luxury under tax law and attracted a tax, so to demonstrate that their dogs were herding dogs, owners had to ensure the dogs had docked or bobbed tails.

The AKC Standard states tails should be docked no longer than {{Convert|2|in|cm|0}}. In many countries, docking has been deemed illegal.<ref name="Lambert">{{cite book|author=Cathy Lambert|title=Getting to Know Poodles: A Guide to Choosing and Owning a Poodle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AA_BR9ISq8C&pg=PA15|publisher=Animalinfo Publications|isbn=978-1-921537-06-6|page=15}}</ref>

===Temperament===
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are very affectionate, love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs are easy to train and are ranked as the eleventh most [[Dog intelligence|intelligent dog]] in Stanley Coren's ''The Intelligence of Dogs''. Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark only as needed. Most Pembrokes will seek the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets.  It is important to socialize this breed with other animals, adults, and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behaviour or aggression later in life. Due to their herding instinct, they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside fenced areas. The herding instinct will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owners' ankles.<ref name="akc.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/pembroke_welsh_corgi/index.cfm |title=Get to know the Pembroke Welsh Corgi |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>

==Health==
[[File:PembrokeCorgiAgility wb.jpg|thumb|Pembroke leaving teeter-totter during a [[dog agility]] competition.]]
Pembrokes have an average [[life expectancy]] of 12–15 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 |title=2004 Purebred Dog Health Survey |publisher=The Kennel Club |accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Dog Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4654-2116-6|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWLyAAAAQBAJ&q=Pembroke+Welsh+Corgi+life+expectancy+years&pg=PA59}}</ref>
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are [[achondroplastic]], meaning they are a "true dwarf" breed. As such, their stature and build can lead to certain non-inherited health conditions, but genetic issues should also be considered. Commonly, Pembrokes can suffer from [[monorchidism]], [[Von Willebrand's disease]], [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[Canine degenerative myelopathy|degenerative myelopathy]]  (DM), and inherited eye problems such as [[progressive retinal atrophy]].  [[Genetic testing]] is available for Pembroke Welsh Corgis to avoid these issues and enhance the genetic health pool.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pembrokecorgi.org/genetics_health.html |title=From the Genetics Committee of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America, Inc. |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>
Pembrokes are also prone to [[obesity]] given a robust appetite, characteristic of herding group breeds.<ref name="Burton2011">{{cite book|author=E. Hywel Burton|title=Pembroke Welsh Corgi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNQJBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT116|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Kennel Club Books|isbn=978-1-59378-890-2|page=116}}</ref>

==History==
The Pembroke Welsh Corgi lineage has been traced back as far as 1107 AD.<ref name="WelshCorgis">{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill C.|title=Welsh Corgis|date=2010|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-61613-641-3|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMbUoWHTgQkC&q=Pembroke+Welsh+Corgi+1107&pg=PA6}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/pembroke_welsh_corgi/history.cfm |title=Pembroke Welsh Corgi - HISTORY |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref> It is said that Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they traveled to reside in Wales. Ancient lore states that two children were running through a forest and stumbled upon the funeral of a fairy. The mourning fairies gave the two children two small corgi puppies and the children took them home, thus giving the breed popularity. Stories also state that Corgis played the role of war horses for fairies before they became herding dogs for humans. At the base of the haunches of Corgis, there is a line of slightly rougher fur that ancient Welsh lore states is the saddle line from fairy warriors. 

Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain.<ref name="Eldredge2009"/> The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in [[Carmarthen]], [[Carmarthenshire]].<ref name="Eldredge2009" /> It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later.<ref name="Eldredge2009" /> Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding.<ref name="Eldredge2009" /> Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were initially categorized together under the single heading of Welsh Corgis before the two breeds were recognized as separate and distinct in 1934.<ref name="Eldredge2009" />
[[File:Corgi Puppy.jpg|thumb|Pembroke Welsh Corgi around 3 months old]]
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the [[United States]] and rank 20th (24th) in [[American Kennel Club]] registrations,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |publisher=American Kennel Club |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |accessdate=17 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207063213/http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm |archive-date=7 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as of 2015 (2012). However, corgis are now listed as a "vulnerable" breed in the United Kingdom; the decline has been said to be due to a 2007 ban on tail-docking (the practice of cutting off the animal's tail) in the U.K., as well as the lack of breeders in the U.K.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/corgis-now-vulnerable-breed-britain/story?id=28832662|title=Dog Gone! Why You're Seeing Fewer Corgis|date=2015-02-09|website=ABC News|access-date=2016-10-08}}</ref> In 2009, the corgi was added to The Kennel Club's "At Watch" list of British breeds when annual registrations numbered between 300 and 450.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/press-releases/2018/april/corgis-and-the-queen-celebrating-the-breed-that-the-queen-made-popular/|title=Corgis and the Queen: Celebrating the breed that the Queen made popular|website=www.thekennelclub.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref> In 2014, the breed was put on the Club's "Vulnerable Native Breeds" list when registrations dropped under 300.<ref name=":0" /> In 2018, the breed came off the "At-Risk" list with 456 puppies registered in December 2017.<ref name=":0" /> The Kennel Club has credited the renewed interest in the breed to the popular [[Netflix]] television series, ''[[The Crown (TV series)|The Crown]]''.<ref name=":0" /> The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has also appeared in the American television ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' as the pet dog of [[List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters|Captain Raymond Holt]] and [[List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters|Kevin M. Cozner]] and is shown to be extremely loyal.  A Corgi with human-level intelligence is one of the 5 main characters in the TV show ''[[List_of_Cowboy_Bebop_characters#Ein|Cowboy Bebop]]''.

==Activities==
Pembroke Welsh Corgis can compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[herding]] events. [[Herding]] instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests.<ref name="Hartnagle-Taylor and Ty Taylor">{{cite book|first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010|title=Stockdog Savvy|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn=978-1-57779-106-5}}</ref> Corgis, despite their dwarfism giving the illusion of small slow legs, can reach up to 25 mph if they are healthy and fit. This is because Corgis tend to use more upper body strength to run than most dogs, giving them enhanced abilities with such activities as agility and herding and racing.

==Queen Elizabeth's Corgis==
{{main|Queen Elizabeth's corgis}}
At a young age, the Queen's passion for this breed started when her father, King George VI, brought home their first royal corgi who was later named “Dookie”.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.animalwised.com/what-are-the-queen-s-corgis-called-all-about-elizabeth-ii-s-dogs-1177.html|title=What Are the Queen's Corgis Called? All About Elizabeth II's Dogs|work=animalwised.com|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en-US}}</ref> The Queen ceased breeding corgis around 2012 so as not to leave any behind after she dies; her last corgi, Willow, died 18 April 2018. 

On April 3 2019, the film ''[[The Queen's Corgi]]'' was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5244572/queen-elizabeth-last-corgi-dog-willow-died/|title=The Queen's Last Corgi Is Dead and the Internet Is Inconsolable|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}</ref>
