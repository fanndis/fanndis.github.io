'''Lying in state''' is the tradition in which the body of a dead [[official]] is placed in a state building, either outside or inside a [[coffin]], to allow the public to pay their respects. It traditionally takes place in the principal government building of a country, state, or city. While the practice differs among countries, a viewing in a location other than the principal government building may be referred to as [[lying in repose]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mdw.army.mil/reagan/General/lying_in_state.html| title=State Funeral for Former President Ronald Reagan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611215010/http://www.mdw.army.mil/reagan/General/lying_in_state.html| archive-date=11 June 2007| website=Military District of Washington| url-status=dead| accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref>

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], official lying in state is a part of a [[state funeral]], an honor generally reserved for former [[Governor General of Canada|Governors General]] and former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Ministers]]. It is held in the [[Centre Block]] of [[Parliament Hill]], in the national capital, [[Ottawa]], Ontario. Ex-governors general lie in state in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate Chamber]] while former prime ministers lie in the Hall of Honour. During the period of lying in state, the caskets are flanked at each corner by a [[Guard of honour]], composed of four members drawn from the [[Canadian Forces]] and [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], as well as members of the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] for former governors general, and guards from the parliamentary security forces for former prime ministers. Guards stand at each corner with heads bowed and weapons inverted (resting on Arms reversed) with their backs turned towards the casket.

Provinces may also mount state funerals and have a lying in state for a distinguished former resident. For instance, [[Maurice Richard]], nationally known hockey player, was given a state funeral by the province of [[Quebec]] when he died in 2000; his coffin lay in state at the [[Bell Centre|Molson Centre]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rocket-to-get-state-funeral-1.252774| work=CBC News| title=Rocket to get state funeral| date=28 May 2000| accessdate=30 July 2020}}</ref> This process was repeated for fellow [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens]] player [[Jean Béliveau]] in December 2014.

Upon his death in October 2012, 24th [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]] and former member of [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] [[Lincoln Alexander]] received only the second provincial state funeral in the province.<ref>{{cite news| title=Former Ontario lieutenant-governor Lincoln Alexander remembered at state funeral| first=Linda| last=Nguyen| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/former-ontario-lieutenant-governor-lincoln-alexander-remembered-at-state-funeral/article4678657/| newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]| location=[[Toronto]]| date=26 October 2012| agency=[[The Canadian Press]]| accessdate=6 August 2020}}</ref> Ontario staged its first state funeral in October 1982 for former [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[John Robarts]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Lincoln Alexander's funeral in Hamilton Ontario| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vxk36KwfJo| date=23 February 2018| first=Shawn| last=Jeffords| newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]| via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

On 2 July 2019, [[Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan]] [[W. Thomas Molloy]] died. He was installed as the 22nd Lieutenant Governor on 21 March 2018, and approximately a year later, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. His state funeral service was held at [[Merlis Belsher Place]] on the campus of the [[University of Saskatchewan]].  Malloy had earlier served as Chancellor of the university. Members of the public were able to sign books of condolence at the [[Saskatchewan Legislative Building]] and [[Government House (Saskatchewan)|Government House]] in Regina and city hall in [[Saskatoon]].

[[Premier of Saskatchewan|Premier]] [[Scott Moe]] stated that flags in the province would fly at half-mast until sunset on the day of Malloy's funeral, which was later scheduled for July 13. During the service, a detail of [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] guarded the casket and following, members of 15 Wing Moose Jaw from the Royal Canadian Air Force flew over Merlis Belsher Place.<ref>{{cite news| title=State memorial service held for Tom Molloy, Saskatchewan's 22nd lieutenant governor| first=Alexa| last=Lawlor| date=14 July 2019| url=https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/state-memorial-service-held-for-tom-molloy-saskatchewans-22nd-lieutenant-governor/| newspaper=[[The StarPhoenix|Saskatoon StarPhoenix]]| accessdate=6 August 2020}}</ref> 

[[Jocelyne Roy-Vienneau]], [[Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick]], died 2 August 2019, after holding office since 23 October 2014.

Municipalities may offer civic funerals to prominent deceased current or former politicians.

==North Korea==
In [[North Korea]], the body of the late leader [[Kim Jong-il]] was displayed in a glass coffin surrounded with red flowers at the [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun|Kumsusan Memorial Palace]] in [[Pyongyang]] prior to his funeral, which began and ended at the palace. An honor guard armed with AK-47s was present. Jong-il's father [[Kim Il-sung]], the founding president, is on display elsewhere in the palace.<ref>{{cite web| title=Kim's body on show in North Korea amid mass mourning |url=https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/kims-body-on-show-in-north-korea-amid-mass-mourning-1.954152| date=20 December 2011| newspaper=[[Gulf News]]| accessdate=30 July 2020 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731035524/https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/kims-body-on-show-in-north-korea-amid-mass-mourning-1.954152 |archivedate=30 July 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Russia==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
In [[Russia]], during the time of the [[Soviet Union]] (1917–1991), the [[state funeral]]s of the most senior political and military leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin#Death and funeral: 1923–1924|Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin#Death, funeral and aftermath: 1953|Joseph Stalin]], [[Leonid Brezhnev#Last years and death|Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov#Death and funeral|Yuri Andropov]], and [[Konstantin Chernenko#Death and legacy|Konstantin Chernenko]] all followed the same basic outline. They took place in Moscow, beginning with a public lying in state of the deceased in the [[House of the Unions]], and ending with an interment at [[Red Square]].

For the lying in state at the [[House of the Unions]], the coffin would be placed on display in the Column Hall, which would be decorated by flowers, numerous [[red flag (politics)|red flags]] and other [[communist symbolism|communist symbols]]. The mourners, which usually would be brought in by the thousands, shuffled up a marble staircase beneath chandeliers draped in black gauze. On the stage at the left side of the Column Hall, a full orchestra in black tailcoats played classical music. The deceased's [[embalmed]] body, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and a tie, was displayed in an open coffin on a [[catafalque]] banked with carnations, red roses and tulips, facing the queue of mourners. A small [[guard of honour]] would be in attendance in the background. At the right side of the hall, seats were placed for guests of honour, with the front row reserved for the dead leader's family.

On the day of the funeral, a military funeral parade would take place during which the coffin would be conveyed from the House of the Unions to Red Square where burial would take place. Lenin and Stalin were placed inside the [[Lenin Mausoleum]], while Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko were interred in individual graves in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]].

==Singapore==
At [[state funeral]]s in [[Singapore]], the national flag is put on the coffin. The vigil guard may be deployed during the public lying in state of the deceased person at [[Parliament House, Singapore|Parliament House]]. The deployment of the vigil guard is the highest form of respect accorded by the nation to the deceased. Similar to British traditions, the vigil guard is composed of groups of five [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]s from the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) and [[Singapore Police Force]] (SPF) who stand guard around the clock in shifts of 30 minutes. Four of the five officers stand facing outward at each of the four corners of the casket, while the fifth and most senior stands in front and faces inward. Their heads are bowed and their ceremonial swords are inverted.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Cheong| first1=Danson| title=An honour to stand vigil for Mr Lee Kuan Yew| url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/an-honour-to-stand-vigil-for-mr-lee-kuan-yew| newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]| location=Singapore| accessdate=21 March 2016| date=4 April 2015}}</ref>

==South Africa==
{{Main|Death and state funeral of Nelson Mandela}}
[[Nelson Mandela]] was the first democratically elected president to lie in state in [[South Africa]]. The event took place at the [[Union Buildings]], the same site where he was inaugurated as the [[President of South Africa]] on May 10, 1994. The body of Mandela was lying in State for three days, starting on Wednesday, 11 December 2013 and ending Friday, 13 December. The body was viewed by thousands of South Africans before it was airlifted to [[Qunu]] in the Eastern Cape where Mandela was buried on 15 December 2013.

[[File:The Lying-in-State of His Late Majesty Edward VII in Westminster Hall LCCN2014688197.tif|thumb|right|The lying-in-state of King [[Edward VII]] in Westminster Hall, May 1910.]]
In [[State funeral|state and ceremonial]] funerals in the [[United Kingdom]], the lying-in-state takes place in [[Westminster Hall]]. The coffin is placed on a [[catafalque]] and is guarded, around the clock, by detachments, each of four men, from the following units:
* [[Sovereign's Bodyguard]]
** [[Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms|Her Majesty's Bodyguard of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]]
** [[Yeomen of the Guard|The Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard]]
** [[Royal Company of Archers|The Royal Company of Archers, The Queen's Bodyguard for Scotland]]
* [[Household Cavalry]]
** [[Life Guards (Britain)|The Life Guards]]
** [[The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons)]]
* [[Foot Guards]]
** [[Grenadier Guards]]
** [[Coldstream Guards]]
** [[Scots Guards]]
** [[Irish Guards]]
** [[Welsh Guards]]

Each unit mans the guard for a total of six hours, with each detachment standing post for twenty minutes. The four men stand at each corner with heads bowed and weapons inverted; their backs are turned towards the coffin.

On two occasions, the [[Vigil of the Princes|guard]] has been mounted by four male members of the [[Royal Family]]. At the lying in state of [[George V|King George V]] in 1936, the guard was mounted by his four sons [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]], the [[George VI|Duke of York]] (George VI), the [[Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] and the [[George, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]]. For [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]'s lying-in-state in 2002, the guard was mounted by her four grandsons, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]], the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl of Wessex]], and [[David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley|Viscount Linley]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Grandsons hold vigil as public files past| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/09/queenmother.monarchy2| date=9 April 2002| first=Stephen| last=Bates| newspaper=[[The Guardian]]| location=London}}</ref>

The first British monarch to lie-in-state at Westminster Hall was King [[Edward VII]] in 1910, apparently inspired by [[William Gladstone]] who had lain-in-state in the hall in 1898.<ref>{{cite book |last=Range |first=Matthias |date=2016 |title=British Royal and State Funerals: Music and Ceremonial since Elizabeth I  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kn1FDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#q=gladstone's |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |page=277 |isbn=978-1783270927}}</ref>

[[File:Reagan's casket lies in state June 9 '04 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|President [[Ronald Reagan]] lies in state at the United States Capitol rotunda, June 2004.]]
Lying in state in the [[United States]] is the rare honor either authorized by a congressional resolution or approved by the congressional leadership, when permission is granted by survivors, to a deceased member of government (or former member) whereby his or her remains are placed in the [[United States Capitol rotunda|rotunda]] of the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] for public viewing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/lying-state-honor |title=Lying in State or in Honor |publisher=US Architect of the Capitol (AOC) |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref> The casket is guarded by members of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]]. By regulation and custom, only [[President of the United States|Presidents]], military commanders, Justices of the Supreme Court, and [[Member of Congress|members of Congress]] are granted the honor of lying in state. 

[[File:Rosa Parks lying in state.jpg|thumb|The casket of Rosa Parks at the U.S. Capitol rotunda]]

It differs from [[lying in honor]] in that individuals lying in state have five guards of honor, representing the five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, while individuals lying in honor have the [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] as civilian guards of honor. Four Americans have lain in honor, beginning in 1998.<ref name=WYFF>{{cite news |url=https://www.wyff4.com/article/lying-in-state-versus-lying-in-honor/18659120|title=Lying in State Versus Lying in Honor |first=Carla |last=Field |publisher=[[WYFF]] |location= Greenville, SC |accessdate=27 July 2020 |archivedate=3 July 2018 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180703091143/http://www.wyff4.com/article/lying-in-state-versus-lying-in-honor/18659120|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Rosa Parks]] was the first woman to lie in honor in the United States Capitol.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-24|title=Those Who Have Lain in State or in Honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda|url=https://www.aoc.gov/what-we-do/programs-ceremonies/lying-in-state-honor#:~:text=No%20resolution.,in%20the%20U.S.%20Capitol%20Rotunda.&text=Parks%20is%20best%20known%20as%20a%20civil%20rights%20pioneer.&text=in%20Detroit%2C%20Michigan.-,Authority%20for%20use%20of%20the%20Rotunda%20granted%20by%20Senate%20Concurrent,agreed%20to%20October%2029%2C%202005|website=Architect of the Capitol|language=en-US}}</ref>

Except for Presidents and former Presidents, the honor is not automatic. Not all those entitled to the honor have it accepted by their survivors. The first leader to receive this honor was [[Henry Clay]], former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], when he died in 1852. Since then, the honor has been extended to 36 people, including 12 Presidents, and four Unknown Soldiers, representing U.S. service members who have died without their remains being identified. [[Harry Truman]], [[Richard Nixon]] and their families declined services at the Capitol.<ref>{{cite news| title=From George Washington to George H.W.

===States and cities===
Some U.S. states and cities extend similar honors. For example, in the state of Hawaii, eight people have lain in state at the [[Hawaii State Capitol]], among which include famous Hawaiian singer [[Israel Kamakawiwoʻole]] upon his death in 1997, U.S. Senator [[Hiram Fong]], in 2004, and [[Daniel Inouye]], President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate and Senator from Hawaii, in 2012.<ref>{{cite news| title=Lying in state a rare and treasured honor in Hawaii| url=https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38226655/lying-in-state-a-rare-and-treasured-honor-in-hawaii/#:~:text=S.%20Sen.%20Daniel%20Inouye%20was%20memorialized%20with%20lying,Honor%20recipient%20and%2050-year%20veteran%20of%20the%20| date=18 May 2018| work=[[KHNL]] News}}</ref>

After his death in July 2020, U.S. Representative [[John Lewis (civil rights leader)|John Lewis]] received similar honors from his home state of Georgia and also was the first African American member of Congress to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Because of his role in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] during the [[civil rights movement]], Lewis also lay in state for one day in the [[Alabama State Capitol|Alabama Capitol]] in Montgomery.<ref>{{cite news| title= Late Rep.

==Vatican City==
[[File:Giovanni Paolo II 0013.JPG|thumb|[[Pope John Paul II]]'s body lying in state.]]

A deceased [[pope]] customarily lies in state in the chapel of the [[Apostolic Palace]] where members of the Papal household and Vatican officials may pay respects. Then, after a Mass of Visitation, the body is moved to [[St. Peter's Basilica]], where it remains until the celebration of a [[Requiem Mass]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/gpII/documents/sodano-suffragio-jp-ii_20050403_en.html |title=Eucharistic Concelebration for the Repose of the Soul of Pope John Paul II: Homily of Card.

==Coptic Patriarchate==
The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] has a tradition of mummifying the deceased pope and placing his body on his throne to enable church followers to have a farewell look at him for a short period of time.
