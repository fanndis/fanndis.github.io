'''Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals''' ('''DACA''') is a [[Immigration to the United States|United States immigration policy]] that allows some individuals with unlawful presence in the United States after being brought to the country as children to receive a renewable two-year period of [[deferred action]] from [[deportation]] and become eligible for a [[Employment authorization document|work permit]] in the U.S. To be eligible for the program, recipients cannot have felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records. Unlike the proposed [[DREAM Act]], DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Young|title=To Dream or Not to Dream: A Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act|journal=Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy|date=Fall 2006|volume=16|issue=1|pages=8, 9|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&context=cjlpp|access-date=February 12, 2018|ref=CornJournal |quote=The DREAM Act is a bipartisan Congressional effort to allow certain undocumented students who were brought into the U.S. as a child the opportunity to attend college and eventually to become permanent residents and citizens of the United States.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is the DREAM Act and who are DREAMers?|url=https://www.lawlogix.com/what-is-the-dream-act-and-who-are-dreamers/|website=LawLogix|publisher=Hyland|access-date=January 23, 2018|date=July 9, 2013}}</ref> The policy, an [[Presidential memorandum|executive branch memorandum]], was announced by President [[Barack Obama]] on June 15, 2012. [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) began accepting applications for the program on August 15, 2012.

In November 2014, President Obama announced his intention to [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans|expand DACA to cover additional undocumented immigrants]]. Multiple states immediately sued to prevent the expansion, which was ultimately [[United States v. Texas|blocked by an evenly divided Supreme Court]]. Under President Trump, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] rescinded the expansion in June 2017, while it continued to review the existence of DACA as a whole. In September 2017, the [[Trump Administration]] announced a plan to phase out DACA, triggering multiple lawsuits challenging this action. The government deferred implementation of this plan for six months to allow Congress time to pass the DREAM Act or some other legislative protection for undocumented immigrants. Congress failed to act and the time extension expired on March 5, 2018, but three separate [[United States district court|district court]]s ordered an injunction preventing the phase-out of the DACA by this date, on the likelihood that the rescinding was [[arbitrary and capricious]] under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA). Separately, district court judge [[Andrew Hanen]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|Southern District of Texas]] ruled that DACA is likely unconstitutional, but he let the program remain in place as litigation proceeds.<ref name=":18">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/08/31/643814735/texas-judge-says-daca-is-probably-illegal-but-leaves-it-in-place|title=Texas Judge Says DACA Is Probably Illegal, But Leaves It In Place|work=NPR.org|access-date=September 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":19">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-txsd-1_18-cv-00068/pdf/USCOURTS-txsd-1_18-cv-00068-0.pdf|title=Texas v.

In the June 2020 case [[Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California|''Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California'']], the Supreme Court, ruling on the three injunctions blocking the rescission of the DACA, affirmed that the reasoning given for the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, but did not rule on the merits of the DACA itself nor prevented the government from issuing a new rescission with better rationale.<ref name="CNNJune2020"/> [[NAACP]] President [[Derrick Johnson (activist)|Derrick Johnson]] responded to the Supreme Court ruling in statement, saying "For far too long, the voices of the undocumented DACA recipients from the African Diaspora were silenced.

==Background==
The policy was created after acknowledgment that "Dreamer" young people had been largely raised in the United States, and this was seen as a way to remove immigration enforcement attention from "low priority" individuals with good behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stottlemyre|first=Scott|year=2015|title=Strict Scrutiny for Undocumented Childhood Arrivals|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jgrj18&div=13&id=&page=|journal=The Journal of Gender, Race, and Justice|volume=18|issue=1|pages=289+}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2017-09-05/trump-ends-daca-program/print/|title=Trump Ends DACA Program|last=Tuma|first=Mary|date=September 5, 2017|work=Austin Chronicle|access-date=September 15, 2017}}</ref> "Dreamers" get their name from the [[DREAM Act]], a bill that aimed to grant legal status to young immigrants residing in the U.S. unlawfully after being brought in by their parents. The undocumented immigrant young population was rapidly increasing; approximately 65,000 undocumented immigrant students graduate from U.S. high schools on a yearly basis.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Angela Adams |author2=Kerry S.

The DREAM Act bill, which would have provided a pathway to permanent residency for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States upon meeting certain qualifications, was considered by Congress in 2007. It failed to overcome a bipartisan filibuster in the Senate.<ref name=":10">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/politics/dream-act-daca-trump-congress-dreamers.html|title=After 16 Futile Years, Congress Will Try Again to Legalize 'Dreamers'|last1=Alcindor|first1=Yamiche|date=September 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 6, 2017|last2=Stolberg|first2=Sheryl Gay|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> It was considered again in 2011.

== Establishment ==
President [[Barack Obama]] announced this policy with a speech in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] of the [[White House]] on June 15, 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-president-immigration|title=Remarks by the President on Immigration|date=June 15, 2012|newspaper=whitehouse.gov|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref> The date was chosen as the 30th anniversary of ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision barring public schools from charging undocumented immigrant children tuition. The policy was officially established by a memorandum from the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] titled "Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf |title=Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children|last=Napolitano|first=Janet|date=June 15, 2012 |work=Department of Homeland Security|access-date=September 15, 2017}}</ref> This policy allowed certain immigrants to escape deportation and obtain work permits for a period of two years—renewable upon good behavior. To apply, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, must have come to the U.S. when they were younger than 16, and must have lived in the U.S. since 2007. In August 2012, the [[Pew Research Center]] estimated that up to 1.7 million people were eligible.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url = https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2012/08/14/up-to-1-7-million-unauthorized-immigrant-youth-may-benefit-from-new-deportation-rules/|title = Up to 1.7 Million Unauthorized Immigrant Youth May Benefit from New Deportation Rules|date=August 14, 2012 |access-date=November 21, 2014|publisher = [[Pew Research Center]]|last = Jeffrey S.

DACA was formally initiated by a policy memorandum sent from [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Janet Napolitano]] to the heads of [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS), and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE). The memo formally directed them to exercise their [[enforcement discretion]] on behalf of individuals who met the requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf|title = Exercising prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals who came to the United States as children |date=June 15, 2012 |access-date=November 21, 2014 |publisher=[[United States Department of Homeland Security]] |last=Napolitano |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Napolitano}}</ref>

To apply for DACA, eligible individuals must pay a $495 application fee, submit several forms, and produce documents showing they meet the requirements. They do not need [[legal representation]].

===Eligibility===
To be eligible, recipients must be present in the United States unlawfully after being brought in as children before their 16th birthday and prior to June 2007, be currently in school, a high school graduate or be honorably discharged from the military, be under the age of 31 {{as of|2012|June|15|lc=y|df=US}}, and not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three other misdemeanors, or otherwise pose a threat to national security. The program does not currently provide permanent lawful status or a path to [[Citizenship of the United States|citizenship]], nor does it provide eligibility for federal welfare or student aid.<ref name="uscis" /><ref name=":3" />

In August 2012, the [[Migration Policy Institute]] estimated that as many as 1.76 million people could be eligible for DACA. Of those, 28% were under 15 and would have to wait until reaching that age to apply. In addition, roughly 20% did not meet any of the education criteria, but could become eligible by enrolling in a program before submitting their application. 74% of the eligible population was born in [[Mexico]] or [[Central America]]. Smaller proportions came from [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]] (11%), [[Asia]] (9%), and the rest of the world (6%).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/DACA-deferred-action-DREAMers | title=Relief from Deportation: Demographic Profile of the DREAMers Potentially Eligible under the Deferred Action Policy | publisher=[[Migration Policy Institute]] | date=August 2012 | access-date=November 21, 2014 | author=Jeanne Batalova and Michelle Mittelstadt}}</ref><ref name="uscis">{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca|title=Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)|publisher=[[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|access-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref>

To qualify for DACA, applicants must meet the following major requirements, although meeting them does not guarantee approval:
* Have unlawful presence in United States after entering the country before their 16th birthday
* Have lived continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007
* Were under age 31 on June 15, 2012 (born on June 16, 1981 or after)
* Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making their request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS
* Had no lawful status on June 15, 2012
* Have completed [[high school]] or a [[General Educational Development|GED]], have been [[Honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] from the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]], or are enrolled in school
* Have not been convicted of a [[felony]] or serious [[misdemeanor]]s, or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety

To show proof of qualification (verify these requirements), applicants must submit three forms; I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; and I-765WS Worksheet, as well as supporting documentation.<ref name="uscis"/>

=== Travel eligibility ===

Until September 5, 2017, DACA recipients who wished to travel outside the United States could apply to do so by submitting a request for [[Advance Parole]] and paying an additional fee. 

If approved, the DACA recipient could travel outside the United States and re-enter the United States with a grant of parole, making that individual potentially eligible for [[adjustment of status]] to [[green card|Lawful Permanent Resident]] after marrying a United States citizen.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/nyregion/a-passport-stamp-gives-dreamers-hope-as-the-trump-era-looms.html |last=Robbins |first=Liz |title=A Passport Stamp Gives Dreamers Hope as the Trump Era Looms |date=January 18, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref>

The application submitted to request Advance Parole was Form I-131 Application Type D*, with a fee of $575.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/i-131|title=Application for Travel Document|newspaper=USCIS|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref> 

Advance Parole could be requested for travel abroad for:
* Educational purposes, such as studying abroad;
* Employment purposes, such as overseas positions, interviews, training, or meetings with clients; or
* Humanitarian purposes, such as travel for medical reasons, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit a sick relative.
Travel for leisure is not a valid purpose.<ref name=":2" />

=== Renewals ===
USCIS released the process for DACA renewals in June 2014 and directed applicants to file their documents during a 30-day window starting 150 days before the expiration of their previous DACA status. Renewing requires an additional $495 fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2014/07/08-daca-renewals-ramp-up-svajlenka-singer|title=DACA renewals ramp up|last=Nicole Prchal Svajlenka and Audrey Singer|date=July 8, 2014|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|access-date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

{{as of|2016|June|}}, there had been 606,264 renewal cases, with 526,288 approved, 4,703 denied and 75,205 renewals pending.<ref name=":1" />

=== Expansion ===
In November 2014, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] announced [[Immigration reform#Obama's executive actions of November 2014|changes to DACA]] which would expand it to include undocumented immigrants who entered the country prior to 2010, eliminate the requirement that applicants be younger than 31 years old, and lengthen the renewable deferral period to two years. The Pew Research Center estimated that this would increase the number of eligible people by about 330,000;<ref name="pewresearch1" /> in December 2014, Texas and 25 other states, all with Republican governors, sued in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] asking the court to enjoin implementation of both the DACA expansion and [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans]] (a similar program).<ref name="zargham1"/><ref name="nytimes1"/><ref name="texasattorneygeneral1"/> In February 2015, Judge [[Andrew S. Hanen]] issued a preliminary [[injunction]] blocking the expansion from going into effect while the case, ''[[United States v. Texas|Texas v. United States]]'', proceeded.<ref name="nytimes2"/><ref name="uclalawreview58"/> After progressing through the court system, the appeals court ruled 2–1 in favor of enjoining the DACA expansion. When the Obama administration appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], Justice Antonin Scalia's untimely death left an 8 justice court, which then ruled equally divided (4–4) for and against the injunction. Procedural rules of the Court in the case of a tie would mean that no opinion would be written, no precedent would be set by the Supreme Court in the case, and that the appellate court's ruling would stand.<ref name="NYTJune24"/>

Fact-checkers note that, on a large scale or in the long run, there is no reason to believe that DACA recipients have a major deleterious effect on American workers' employment chances; to the contrary, some economists say that DACA benefits the overall U.S. economy.<ref name=":11" /><ref name=":9"/><ref name=":12" /><ref name=":24">{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/new-york/statements/2017/sep/10/louise-slaughter/would-trumps-decision-daca-hurt-new-yorks-economy/|title=What's the economic impact of ending DACA?|work=@politifact|access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":15">{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/09/08/dacas-end-would-hurt-economy-hiring/638835001/|title=DACA's end would hurt economy, hiring|work=USA Today|access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref> Economists have warned that ending DACA could adversely affect the U.S. economy, and that "most economists see immigration generally as an ''economic boon''."<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":15" /> Almost all economists reject [[Jeff Sessions]]' claim that DACA "denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens."<ref name=":12" /> Sessions' claim is rooted in what economists call the "[[lump of labour fallacy|lump of labor fallacy]]" (i.e., the idea that there is a limit to amount of work force available in any economy).<ref name=":11" /><ref>{{Cite web|author=Tracy Jan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/06/white-house-claims-dreamers-take-jobs-away-from-blacks-and-hispanics-heres-the-truth/|title=Analysis: White House claims 'dreamers' take jobs away from blacks and Hispanics.

A 2016 study in the ''[[Journal of Public Economics]]'' found that DACA increased [[labor force participation]] and decreased the unemployment rate for DACA-eligible immigrants. DACA also increased the income of undocumented immigrants in the bottom of the income distribution.<ref name=":3" /> The study estimates that DACA moved 50,000 to 75,000 unauthorized immigrants into employment.<ref name=":3" /> According to [[University of California, Davis]] economist [[Giovanni Peri]], DACA consequently "increases consumption and overall demand for U.S. services, products, and jobs where the DACA recipients live and spend.

According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economist Pia Orrenius, due to their risk of deportation, it is likely that previously DACA-protected individuals would slip into the shadow economy or take low-profile jobs that pay less.<ref name=":15" />

A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that DACA likely led to greater productivity by increasing the college attendance and employment of DACA-eligible individuals.<ref name=":17">{{Cite journal|last1=Kuka|first1=Elira|last2=Shenhav|first2=Na'ama|last3=Shih|first3=Kevin|date=2020|title=Do Human Capital Decisions Respond to the Returns to Education?

=== Education ===
Research has shown mixed findings for DACA on education outcomes. A 2016 study in the ''Journal of Public Economics'' found that DACA had no significant effect on the likelihood of attending school.<ref name=":3" /> The study only found "suggestive evidence that DACA pushed over 25,000 DACA-eligible individuals into obtaining their GED certificate in order to be eligible for DACA."<ref name=":3" /> However, research by Roberto G. Gonzales, professor of education at Harvard University, showed that DACA led to increased educational attainment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/9/2/16244380/daca-benefits-trump-undocumented-immigrants-jobs|title=DACA's beneficiaries landed good jobs, enrolled in college, and contributed to society|work=Vox|access-date=September 17, 2017}}</ref> A 2018 [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] paper found that DACA led to greater high school attainment and college attendance for DACA-eligible individuals.<ref name=":17" />

A 2016 study in the ''[[Journal of Population Economics]]'' found that DACA "reduced the probability of school enrollment of eligible higher-educated individuals, as well as some evidence that it increased the employment likelihood of men, in particular. Together, these findings suggest that a lack of authorization may lead individuals to enroll in school when working is not a viable option."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Amuedo-Dorantes|first1=Catalina|last2=Antman|first2=Francisca|date=January 1, 2017 |title=Schooling and labor market effects of temporary authorization: evidence from DACA|journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=30|issue=1|pages=339–73|doi=10.1007/s00148-016-0606-z|pmid=28690364|pmc=5497855|issn=0933-1433}}</ref>

The effects of the rescinding and subsequent reimplementation of DACA has affected college students dramatically. The primary effects are psychological and educational in nature. The first way it does so is the general stress that comes with having an uncertain legal status: 70.9% of DACA recipients strongly agreed with the statement "they worry about the future of the program".<ref name=":02">{{cite journal | last1 = Enriquez | first1 = Laura E. | display-authors = etal | year = 2018| title = Deconstructing Immigrant Illegality: A Mixed-Methods Investigation of Stress and Health Among Undocumented College Students | journal = Race & Social Problems | volume =  10| issue = 3| pages =  193–208| doi = 10.1007/s12552-018-9242-4 | s2cid = 149978763 }}</ref> Many recipients have spoken about how their DACA status gives them anxiety because of fear for the unknown.<ref name=":02" /> This can then affect their education because individuals take that uncertainty and apply it to how much effort they should be putting into their schoolwork. The possible threat of deportation at any moment causes many DACA students reduce the amount of time they spend doing coursework, and some even drop out in favor of earning money at a job. A 2018 study showed the compound effect of being at a four-year university vs. a community college with 7.3% increase in dropout rates.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hsin | first1 = Amy | last2 = Ortega | first2 = Francesc | year = 2018| title = The Effects of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on the Educational Outcomes of Undocumented Students | journal = Demography | volume =  55| issue = 4| pages =  1487–1506| doi = 10.1007/s13524-018-0691-6 | pmid = 29943352 | hdl = 10419/173988 | s2cid = 49409188 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> Not only does this status make individuals less likely to finish their undergraduate degree, but it can also stop students from pursuing a graduate degree, especially in terms of funding.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Muñoz | first1 = Susana M. | last2 = Vigil | first2 = Darsella | year = 2018| title = Interrogating Racist Nativist Microaggressions and Campus Climate: How Undocumented and DACA College Students Experience Institutional Legal Violence in Colorado | journal = Journal of Diversity in Higher Education | volume =  11| issue = 4| pages =  451–466| doi = 10.1037/dhe0000078 | s2cid = 150285491 }}</ref>

The psychological effects of this status also becomes a barrier for DACA students in their college experience, largely because of the uncertainty that the status carries. Many reported high rates of extreme stress and anxiety as compared to their documented counterparts.<ref name=":02" /> Also, the internalizing of the label "illegal" made it so that these individuals saw themselves as less human. In certain cases this meant more instances of self-harm and even suicide in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gonzales | first1 = R.

Almost a year later, Judge [[Reed O'Connor]] from the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction to decide on what essentially was a dispute between federal employees and their employer, the U.S. government.<ref name="llorente-fn-2012">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/01/judge-dismisses-immigration-agents-lawsuit-against-obama-program-to-suspend.html |title=Judge Dismisses ICE Agents' Lawsuit Challenging Obama's Deferred Action |publisher=[[Fox News]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Llorente |date=August 1, 2013 }}</ref> Nonetheless, in his decision to dismiss the case, the judge reiterated his view that DACA was inherently unlawful.<ref name="llorente-fn-2012" /> The plaintiffs then filed an appeal but the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] upheld the dismissal on procedural grounds.

The first challenge against the DACA expansions was filed by Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]] of [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], in November 2014. In the lawsuit, Arpaio claimed that DACA and its expansions were "unconstitutional, arbitrary and capricious, and invalid under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] as, in effect, regulations that have been promulgated without the requisite opportunity for public notice and comment."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/08/16/sherriff-arpaio-lacks-standing-to-challenge-obama-immigration-initiatives/|title=Sheriff Arpaio lacks standing to challenge Obama immigration initiatives |first=Jonathan |last=Adler |date=August 16, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] }}</ref> The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] promptly dismissed the lawsuit ruling that Arpaio did not have [[standing (law)|standing]].

Regardless of the outcome of the preliminary injunction, legal opinions on the lawfulness of DACA are divided. In ''[[United States v.

State-level government officials are also divided on the issue. Those that support DACA claim that the government does not have the resources to target all undocumented immigrants and that the policy thus helps federal agencies in exerting prosecutorial discretion—that is, [[selective enforcement|in enforcing the law selectively]] by focusing limited resources on criminal immigrants rather than on non-criminal ones such as those eligible for DACA.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/27/us/politics/dreamers-trump-lawsuit.html |title='Dreamer' Plan That Aided 800,000 Immigrants Is Threatened |first=Miriam |last=Jordan |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 27, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://theweek.com/articles/723056/obamas-original-sin-daca |title=Obama's original sin on DACA |first=Edward |last=Morrissey |date=September 7, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Week]] }}</ref> Those that oppose the policy, however, claim that states would be forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on health care, education, law enforcement, and other public benefits associated with the immigrants receiving relief.<ref name="masters-cfr-2016" /> For instance, DACA opponents claim that Texas could assume up to $500 million in administrative costs for issuing new driver's licenses.<ref name="masters-cfr-2016" />

Grimm]] to issue orders on July 17, 2020 that required DHS to restore the DACA program to its pre-rescission status, prior to September 2017, as the first court to make this requirement to the DHS following the SCOTUS decision. This order includes accepting new applicants as it has pre-September 2017, a step that DHS had not done since the rescinding order had been issued.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2020/07/17/892413311/federal-court-orders-trump-administration-to-accept-new-daca-applications | title=  Federal Court Orders Trump Administration To Accept New DACA Applications | first = Joel | last = Rose| date = July 17, 2020 | access-date = July 17, 2020 | work = [[NPR]] }}</ref>

On July 28, 2020, the Administration tried to get around the court rulings by having DHS issue a new memo to supersede previous DACA memos.

===Proposed legislative responses to the DACA repeal===

=== ''Trump v. NAACP'' ===

In June 2020, in [[Trump v. NAACP (DACA)|''Trump v. NAACP'' (DACA)]] the Supreme Court, [[Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California|ruling on the three injunctions blocking the rescission of the DACA]], affirmed that the current reasoning given for the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, but did not rule on the merits of the DACA itself nor prevented the government from issuing a new rescission with better rationale.<ref name = CNNJune2020/> [[NAACP]] President Derrick Johnson responded to the Supreme Court ruling in statement, saying "For far too long, the voices of the undocumented DACA recipients from the African Diaspora were silenced. There is no democratic dream for anyone if we don’t allow our DREAMers to fully participate. This is a tremendous victory for America. Today’s Supreme Court ruling in our favor is an incredible victory for justice, in the spirit of the NAACP’s groundbreaking Supreme Court victory in Brown v Board of Education."<ref name="NAACPapplauds"/>

''[[GQ]]'' magazine reported that under NAACP President/CEO Derrick Johnson's leadership, "the nation’s foremost and oldest civil rights organization landed a huge win in its Supreme Court case — Trump v. NAACP — that prevents Donald Trump’s administration from rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for young immigrants." Johnson added, "It’s a huge victory for us."<ref name="GQ"/>

On June 25, 2020, ''The Hill'' reported that the [[NAACP]] "successfully convinced the Supreme Court to rule against Trump. Its decision to defend DACA, [NAACP President Derrick Johnson] said, came in part because of the organization’s traditional role of being a voice for Black communities, including immigrants. “DACA, oftentimes people seem to think of the Latinx community, when in fact it was far more reaching than that,” Johnson said."<ref>{{cite web |last=Bernal |first=Rafael |title=The Hill interview: NAACP president puts Trump DACA actions alongside Dred Scott decision |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/news/504428-the-hill-interview-naacp-president-puts-trump-daca-actions-alongside-dred-scott |website=The Hill |access-date=25 June 2020 |date=June 25, 2020}}</ref>

''The Washington Post'' reported that "Trump has often seemed ambivalent about DACA recipients — lauding them at some points and declaring they are “no angels” at others — but his administration has tried since September 2017 to end the program. It was implemented as an executive action by Obama in 2012 after a failed congressional attempt at comprehensive immigration reform."<ref>{{cite web |last=Barnes |first=Robert |title=Supreme Court blocks Trump's bid to end DACA, a win for undocumented 'dreamers' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-against-trump-administration-attempt-to-end-daca-a-win-for-undocumented-immigrants-brought-to-us-as-children/2020/06/18/4f0b6c74-b163-11ea-8758-bfd1d045525a_story.html |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=25 June 2020}}</ref>

Justice Roberts wrote in an opinion that "the dispute before the court is not whether DHS may rescind DACA. All parties agree that it may.

==DACA under Biden==
President-elect [[Joe Biden]] has indicated he will reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and DACA beneficiaries intend to hold him to his promise. "If promises were made to us and we're not seeing that progress, we've never been afraid to go show up in someone's office and say, 'Hey, I thought you were on our side,'” said Kassandra Aleman, 26, a deputy training director for the Texas Democratic Party and a DACA recipient.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Acevedo |first1=Nicole |title=Dreamers laud Biden's win — but remain vigilant about his DACA, immigration promises |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/dreamers-laud-biden-s-win-remain-vigilant-his-daca-immigration-n1247411 |access-date=November 15, 2020 |work=NBC News |date=November 12, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>
