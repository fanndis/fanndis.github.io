In the [[music industry]], a '''reissue''' (also '''re-release''', '''repackage''' or '''re-edition''') is the release of an [[album]] or [[Single (music)|single]] which has been released at least once before, sometimes with alterations or additions.

==Reasons for reissue==

===New audio formats===

Recordings originally released in an audio format that has become technologically or commercially obsolete are reissued in new formats. For example, thousands of original [[vinyl record|vinyl]] albums have been reissued on [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CDs]] since introduction of that format in the early 1980s. More recently, many albums originally released on CD or earlier formats have been reissued on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] or [[DVD-Audio]].

===Budget records===

Beginning with [[Pickwick Records]], which acquired the rights to reissue many of [[Capitol Records]]' non-current albums at a low price in venues other than record stores, several record companies started "budget" or "[[drugstore records]]" subsidiaries to sell their deleted items at lower prices.

===New ownership===

When one record label buys out another record label or acquires an individual recording artist's back catalogue, their albums are often reissued on the purchasing label. For example, [[Polydor Records]] reissued many of [[James Brown]]'s albums which were originally released on his former label, [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]. King Records had itself previously reissued albums and [[Single (music)|single]]s by Brown that were originally recorded for its subsidiary label, [[Federal Records]].

===Strong or weak sales===

Recordings are reissued to meet continuing [[demand]] for an album that continues to be popular after its original release. In other cases, albums are reissued to create interest in and hopefully revive the sales of a release which has sold poorly. For example, the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] label [[Roadrunner Records]] is notorious for reissuing their artist's works' only months after releasing the original album. According to US music magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reissues target "casual consumers who hadn't picked up the album when it was originally released, as well as obsessives who need to own every song in an artist's catalog."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6304512/beyonce-platinum-edition-box-set-essay?facebook_20141104 |title=Beyonce's Platinum Edition: Feeling a Twinge of Disappointment About The False Rumors |first=Jason |last=Lipshutz |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location=New York |date=November 4, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref>

In the late 2000s to early 2010s, reissues of studio albums with expanded track listings were common, with the new music often being released as stand-alone [[Extended play|EP]]s. In October 2010, a ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article regarding the trend noted reissues and post-album EPs as "the next step in extending albums' shelf lives, following the "deluxe" editions that populated stores during the past few holiday seasons—add a few tracks to the back end of an album and release one of them to radio, slap on a new coat of paint, and—voila!—a stocking stuffer is born."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/10/kesha-lady-gaga-taylor-swift-new-companion-albums|title=With Ke$ha, Gaga, and Taylor Swift, It’s All About the Art of the Tease|website=Vanity Fair|date=20 October 2010|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref> Examples of such releases include [[Lady Gaga]]'s ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) following her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), and [[Kesha]]'s ''[[Cannibal (EP)|Cannibal]]'' (2010) following her debut album ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010).

===Special, Limited and Commemorative Editions===

Some recordings are reissued to celebrate their popularity, influence, or an [[anniversary]] of the artist or the recording.

===Track controversy and revisionism===

Some recordings are reissued soon after their original release because one of the tracks was seen in a negative light. "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]" by [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]] was one such example.

Some recordings are [[remix]]ed and reissued in an effort to erase prior band member's contributions.  Two such examples were [[Ozzy Osbourne]]’s ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' and ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/ozzy_osbourne_classic_album_reissues_due_in_may.html|title=Ozzy Osbourne: Classic Album Reissues Due In May|website=www.ultimate-guitar.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/former-ozzy-osbourne-bandmate-bob-daisley-dishes-dirt-on-last-years-ozzy-reissues/|title=Former Ozzy Osbourne Bandmate Bob Daisley Dishes Dirt on Last Year's Ozzy Reissues|first=Amy|last=Sciarretto|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref> British girl group [[Sugababes]] reissued two of their studio albums in a similar manner; ''[[Taller in More Ways]]'' following [[Mutya Buena]]'s replacement with [[Amelle Berrabah]], and ''[[Sweet 7]]'' after [[Keisha Buchanan]]'s replacement with [[Jade Ewen]]. "[[Do What U Want]]" by Lady Gaga featuring [[R. Kelly]] was removed from all streaming and online versions and new vinyl and CD pressings of Gaga's third studio album ''[[Artpop]]'' in light of the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.

=== Sequel ===
Some reissued albums were released for making sequel of the promotion project. This is different to special or limited album, where both special and limited album were released for certain event like Christmas or group's anniversary. An example is ''Funky Town'' by [[T-ara]], where this repackage album was released as the sequel of their previous EP, ''[[Black Eyes (EP)|Black Eyes]]''. The album was released for their drama video project where the video was released as the sequel of their previous drama video, ''Cry Cry'' from the previous EP. Another example is ''[[Twicecoaster: Lane 2]]'' by [[Twice (group)|Twice]]. The repackage album is the sequel of their previous EP, ''[[Twicecoaster: Lane 1]]''

==Alterations==
Common additions to reissued albums include:

* Audio [[Audio mastering|remastering]]
* Inclusion of [[bonus track]]s or [[multimedia]] content
* New [[liner notes]]
* New [[album art]] or [[packaging]]
* Modifiers in the title such as "[[Special Edition]]" or "Expanded Version"

==Reissues and certification==
For the purposes of quantifying sales, an album's original and subsequent releases are counted together. For example, if an album sold 300,000 of its original release and 700,000 in subsequent reissues, it would be entitled to [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] certification. However, the musical contents of the original disc must remain the same on a reissue for it to count towards certification.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Reissue labels==
Some [[record label]]s specialize in reissuing recordings originally released on other labels. Three of the biggest reissue labels are [[Rhino Records]], [[Hip-O Records]], and [[Legacy Recordings]]. Each of these companies reissues material from the labels of a major music [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]: [[Warner Music Group]], [[Universal Music Group]], and [[Sony BMG]], respectively. [[Collectables Records]] is another prolific reissue label that [[license]]s recordings from other labels.
