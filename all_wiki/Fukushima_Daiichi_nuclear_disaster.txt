The {{Nihongo|'''Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster'''|福島第一原子力発電所事故|[[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima Dai-ichi]] ''({{Audio|福島第一.ogg|pronunciation|lang=ja|help=no}})'' genshiryoku hatsudensho jiko}} was a 2011 [[nuclear accident]] at the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Ōkuma, Fukushima|Ōkuma]], [[Fukushima Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The event was caused by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. It was the most severe nuclear accident since the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, and the only other accident to receive a Level 7 event classification on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].<ref>[http://in.ibtimes.com/articles/132391/20110409/japan-nuclear-crisis-radiation.htm "Analysis: A month on, Japan nuclear crisis still scarring"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815080111/http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/132391/20110409/japan-nuclear-crisis-radiation.htm |date=15 August 2012}} ''International Business Times'' (Australia). 9 April 2011, retrieved 12 April 2011</ref>

The accident was started by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] on Friday, 11 March 2011.<ref name=":182"/> On detecting the earthquake, the active reactors [[scram|automatically shut down]] their normal power-generating [[fission reaction]]s. Because of these shut downs and other electrical grid supply problems, the reactors' electricity supplies failed, and their emergency diesel generators automatically started. Critically, these were required to provide electrical power to the pumps that circulated coolant through the reactors' cores. This continued circulation is vital in order to remove residual [[decay heat]], which continues to be produced after fission has ceased.<ref name=w>{{cite book |page=84 | title=Warnings: Finding Cassandras to stop catastrophe |author1=Richard A. Clarke | author2=R.P. Eddy | publisher=Harper Collins | year=2017}}</ref> However, the earthquake had also generated a 14 m high tsunami that arrived shortly afterwards and swept over the plant's seawall and then flooded the lower parts of reactors 1–4. This caused the failure of the emergency generators and loss of power to the circulating pumps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02japan.html|title=Report Finds Japan Underestimated Tsunami Danger|last=Fackler|first=Martin|date=1 June 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> The resultant [[loss-of-coolant accident|loss of reactor core cooling]] led to three [[nuclear meltdown]]s, three [[hydrogen explosion]]s, and the release of [[radioactive contamination]] in Units 1, 2 and 3 between 12 and 15 March. The [[spent fuel pool]] of previously shut-down Reactor 4 increased in temperature on 15 March due to decay heat from newly added spent [[nuclear fuel|fuel rods]], but did not boil down sufficiently to expose the fuel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsmillerdesign.com/FukushimaPapers/Fukuchima_AREVA.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226171624/http://www.jsmillerdesign.com/FukushimaPapers/Fukuchima_AREVA.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 February 2017|date=26 February 2017}}</ref>

In the days after the accident, radiation released to the atmosphere forced the government to declare an ever-larger evacuation zone around the plant, culminating in an evacuation zone with a 20 km radius.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/asia/02japan.html|title=Life in Limbo for Japanese Near Damaged Nuclear Plant|author1=Martin Fackler|author2=Matthew L.

Large amounts of water contaminated with radioactive isotopes were released into the [[Pacific Ocean]] during and after the disaster. Michio Aoyama, a professor of radioisotope geoscience at the Institute of Environmental Radioactivity, has estimated that 18,000 [[terabecquerel]] (TBq) of radioactive [[caesium]] 137 were released into the Pacific during the accident, and in 2013, 30 [[gigabecquerel]] (GBq) of caesium 137 were still flowing into the ocean every day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/world/asia/with-a-plants-tainted-water-still-flowing-no-end-to-environmental-fears.html|title=With a Plant's Tainted Water Still Flowing, No End to Environmental Fears|author1=Martin Fackler|author2=Hiroko Tabuchi|date=24 October 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> The plant's operator has since built new walls along the coast and also created a 1.5 km long "ice wall" of frozen earth to stop the flow of contaminated water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/science/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant-cleanup-ice-wall.html|title=Japan's $320 Million Gamble at Fukushima: an Underground Ice Wall|last=Fackler|first=Martin|date=29 August 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>

On 5 July 2012, the [[National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission]] (NAIIC) found that the causes of the accident had been foreseeable, and that the plant operator, [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO), had failed to meet basic safety requirements such as risk assessment, preparing for containing collateral damage, and developing [[emergency evacuation|evacuation plans]]. At a meeting in Vienna three months after the disaster, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] faulted lax oversight by the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]], saying the ministry faced an inherent conflict of interest as the government agency in charge of both regulating and promoting the nuclear power industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/world/asia/22japan.html|title=Japan Plans to Unlink Nuclear Agency From Government|last=Fackler|first=Martin|date=21 June 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> On 12 October 2012, TEPCO admitted for the first time that it had failed to take necessary measures for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.<ref name="NYT20121012"/><ref name="Fukushima operator must learn from mistakes, new adviser says"/><ref name="Yamaguchi20121012"/><ref name="CNN20121012"/>

===Background===
The [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] comprised six separate [[boiling water reactor]]s originally designed by [[General Electric]] (GE) and maintained by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). At the time of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]] on 11 March 2011, Reactors [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant#Nuclear disaster of March 2011|4, 5, and 6]] were [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shut down]] in preparation for [[Refueling and overhaul|re-fueling]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12745186 |title= Reactor breach worsens prospects |work=BBC Online |date=15 March 2011 |access-date=23 March 2011}}</ref> However, their [[spent fuel pool]]s still required cooling.<ref name="web.archive.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/press/?p=1463|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607091828/http://www.iaea.org/press/?p=1463|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 June 2011|title=Japanese Earthquake Update (19 March 2011, 4:30 UTC) : IAEA Alert Log: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident|date=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20170226171624/http://www.jsmillerdesign.com/FukushimaPapers/Fukuchima_AREVA.pdf Accident Progression.</ref>

===Initial effects of earthquake===
The 9.0 [[moment magnitude scale|M<sub>W</sub>]] earthquake occurred at 14:46 on Friday, 11 March 2011, with the [[epicenter]] near [[Honshu]], the largest island of Japan.<ref name="Earthquake.usgs.gov"/> It produced maximum ground [[g-force]]s of 0.56, 0.52, 0.56 at units 2, 3, and 5 respectively. This exceeded the seismic reactor design tolerances of 0.45, 0.45, and 0.46&nbsp;g for continued operation, but the seismic values were within the design tolerances at units 1, 4, and 6.<ref name=WWN24/>

When the earthquake struck, units 1, 2, and 3 were operating, but units 4, 5, and 6 had been shut down for a scheduled inspection.<ref name=tepco0401/><ref name="tepco12a"/> Immediately after the earthquake, the electricity-producing Reactors 1, 2, and 3 automatically shut down their sustained [[fission reaction]]s by inserting [[control rod]]s in a safety procedure referred to as a [[SCRAM]], which ends the reactors' normal running conditions, by closing down the fission reaction in a controlled manner. As the reactors were now unable to generate power to run their own coolant pumps, emergency diesel generators came online, as designed, to power electronics and coolant systems. These operated normally until the tsunami destroyed the generators for Reactors 1–5. The two generators cooling Reactor 6 were undamaged and were sufficient to be pressed into service to cool the neighboring Reactor 5 along with their own reactor, averting the overheating issues the other reactors suffered.<ref name="web.archive.org"/>

===Arrival of tsunami===

===Disabling of emergency generators===
The waves flooded the basements of the power plant's turbine buildings and disabled the emergency [[diesel generators]]<ref name="NISASummary060411"/><ref name=nytimesWilson/><ref name="WNN"/> at approximately 15:41.<ref name=tepco11b/><ref name="japantimes35"/> TEPCO then notified authorities of a "first-level emergency".<ref name="tepco11a"/> The switching stations that provided power from the three backup generators located higher on the hillside failed when the building that housed them flooded.<ref name="wsj1107"/> All [[Alternating current|AC power]] was lost to units 1–4. All [[DC power]] was lost on Units 1 and 2 due to flooding, while some DC power from batteries remained available on Unit 3. Steam-driven pumps provided cooling water to reactors 2 and 3 and prevented their [[fuel rod]]s from overheating, as the rods continued to generate [[decay heat]] after fission had ceased. Eventually these pumps stopped working, and the reactors began to overheat. The lack of cooling water eventually led to [[nuclear meltdown|meltdowns]] in Reactors 1, 2, and 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1134/ML11347A454.pdf|title=Special Report on the Nuclear Accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station|access-date=2020-10-08|publisher=[[Institute of Nuclear Power Operations]]|year=2011|page=3}}</ref>

Further batteries and mobile generators were dispatched to the site, but were delayed by poor road conditions; the first arrived at 21:00 11 March,<ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/><ref name="Japan Earthquake Update (2210 CET)"/> almost six hours after the tsunami struck. Unsuccessful attempts were made to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps.

===Hydrogen explosions===
As workers struggled to supply power to the reactors' coolant systems and restore power to their [[control room]]s, three [[hydrogen explosion|hydrogen-air]] chemical explosions occurred, the first in Unit 1 on 12 March, and the last in Unit 4, on 15 March.<ref name="oecd-nea.org"/><ref name="IAEA15March"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235552/http://www.hyer.eu/news/regional-news/hydrogen-in-nuclear-accidents-what-is-the-role-of-the-gas-in-fukushima|url-status = dead|title=Hydrogen explosions Fukushima nuclear plant: what happened?|archive-date=2 December 2013}}</ref> It is estimated that the [[zirconium alloy#Oxidation of zirconium by steam|oxidation of zirconium by steam]] in Reactors 1–3 produced {{convert|800-1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of hydrogen gas each.

The amount of damage sustained by the [[nuclear reactor core|reactor cores]] during the accident, and the location of molten nuclear fuel ("[[corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]]") within the [[containment building]]s, is unknown; TEPCO has revised its estimates several times.<ref name="phys"/> On 16 March 2011, TEPCO estimated that 70% of the fuel in Unit 1 had melted and 33% in Unit 2, and that Unit 3's core might also be damaged.<ref name="scientificamerican"/> As of 2015 it can be assumed that most fuel melted through the reactor pressure vessel (RPV), commonly known as the "reactor core", and is resting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel (PCV), having been stopped by the PCV concrete.<ref name="fukushima-diary"/><ref name="fukudiary201408"/><ref name="fukuleaks13608"/><ref name="fukuleaks13619"/> In July 2017 a remotely controlled robot filmed for the first time apparently melted fuel, just below the reactor pressure vessel of Unit 3.<ref name=jt-20170721>{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/21/national/fukushima-robot-finds-potential-fuel-debris-hanging-like-icicles-reactor-3/ |title=Fukushima robot finds potential fuel debris hanging like icicles in reactor 3 |agency=Bloomberg |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=21 July 2017 |access-date=23 July 2017}}</ref>

TEPCO released further estimates of the state and location of the fuel in a November 2011 report.<ref name="tepco6"/> The report concluded that the Unit 1 RPV was damaged during the disaster and that "significant amounts" of molten fuel had fallen into the bottom of the PCV. The erosion of the concrete of the PCV by the molten fuel after the core meltdown was estimated to stop at approx. {{convert|0.7|m||sp=us|abbr=on}} in depth, while the thickness of the containment is {{convert|7.6|m||sp=us|abbr=on}} thick. Gas sampling carried out before the report detected no signs of an ongoing reaction of the fuel with the concrete of the PCV and all the fuel in Unit 1 was estimated to be "well cooled down, including the fuel dropped on the bottom of the reactor". Fuel in Units 2 and 3 had melted, however less than in Unit 1, and fuel was presumed to be still in the RPV, with no significant amounts of fuel fallen to the bottom of the PCV.{{update inline|date=February 2017}} The report further suggested that "there is a range in the evaluation results" from "all fuel in the RPV (none fuel fallen to the PCV)" in Unit 2 and Unit 3, to "most fuel in the RPV (some fuel in PCV)". For Unit 2 and Unit 3 it was estimated that the "fuel is cooled sufficiently". According to the report, the greater damage in Unit 1 (when compared to the other two units) was due to the longer time that no cooling water was injected in Unit 1. This resulted in much more [[decay heat]] accumulating, as for about 1 day there was no water injection for Unit 1, while Unit 2 and Unit 3 had only a quarter of a day without water injection.<ref name="tepco6"/>

In November 2013, Mari Yamaguchi reported for Associated Press that there are computer simulations that suggest that "the melted fuel in Unit 1, whose core damage was the most extensive, has breached the bottom of the primary containment vessel and even partially eaten into its concrete foundation, coming within about {{Convert|30|cm|ft|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} of leaking into the ground" – a Kyoto University nuclear engineer said with regard to these estimates: "We just can't be sure until we actually see the inside of the reactors."<ref name="phys"/>

According to a December 2013 report, TEPCO estimated for Unit 1 that "the decay heat must have decreased enough, the molten fuel can be assumed to remain in PCV (primary containment vessel)".<ref name="fukushima-diary"/>

In August 2014, TEPCO released a new revised estimate that Reactor 3 had a complete melt through in the initial phase of the accident.

In February 2015, TEPCO started the [[muon tomography|muon scanning]] process for Units 1, 2, and 3.<ref>[http://fukushima-diary.com/2015/01/tepco-start-scanning-inside-reactor-1-early-february-using-muon/ TEPCO to start "scanning" inside of Reactor 1 in early February by using muon] – Fukushima Diary</ref><ref>[http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=14380 Muon Scans Begin At Fukushima Daiichi] – SimplyInfo</ref> With this scanning setup it will be possible to determine the approximate amount and location of the remaining nuclear fuel within the RPV, but not the amount and resting place of the corium in the PCV. In March 2015 TEPCO released the result of the muon scan for Unit 1 which showed that no fuel was visible in the RPV, which would suggest that most if not all of the molten fuel had dropped onto the bottom of the PCV – this will change the plan for the removal of the fuel from Unit 1.<ref>[http://www.fukuleaks.org/web/?p=14602 Muon Scan Finds No Fuel In Fukushima Unit 1 Reactor Vessel] – SimplyInfo</ref><ref>[http://fukushima-diary.com/2015/03/irid-saw-no-fuel-or-water-remaining-in-reactor-core-of-reactor-1/ IRID saw no fuel or water remaining in reactor core of Reactor 1] – Fukushima Diary</ref>

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant consisted of six GE [[light water reactor|light water]] [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWRs) with a combined power of 4.7 gigawatts, making it one of the world's 25 largest [[list of nuclear power stations|nuclear power stations]]. It was the first GE-designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO). Reactor 1 was a 439 [[MWe#Electrical and thermal watts|MWe]] type (BWR-3) reactor constructed in July 1967, and commenced operation on 26 March 1971.<ref name="Fukushima Daiichi Information Screen"/> It was designed to withstand an earthquake with a [[peak ground acceleration]] of 0.18 [[g-force|g]] ({{Convert|1.4|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}) and a [[response spectrum]] based on the [[1952 Kern County earthquake]].<ref name="brady"/> Reactors 2 and 3 were both 784 MWe type BWR-4s. Reactor 2 commenced operation in July 1974, and Reactor 3 in March 1976. The earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 0.42&nbsp;g ({{Convert|4.12|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}) to 0.46&nbsp;g ({{Convert|4.52|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}).<ref name="WWN24"/><ref name="tepco0401"/> After the [[1978 Miyagi earthquake]], when the [[ground acceleration]] reached 0.125&nbsp;g ({{Convert|1.22|m/s2||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=comma}}) for 30&nbsp;seconds, no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was found.<ref name="brady"/> Units 1–5 have a [[Containment building#Boiling water reactors|Mark-1 type]] (light bulb [[torus]]) [[containment building|containment structure]]; unit 6 has Mark 2-type (over/under) containment structure.<ref name="brady"/> In September 2010, Reactor 3 was partially fueled by [[MOX fuel|mixed-oxides (MOX)]].<ref name="ns"/>

===Cooling===
[[File:Bwr-rpv.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|Diagram of the [[boiling water reactor safety systems|cooling systems of a BWR]]]]

{{See also|Decay heat#Power reactors in shutdown|Nuclear reactor safety system}}

Nuclear reactors generate electricity by using the heat of the [[nuclear fission|fission reaction]] to produce steam, which drives turbines that generate electricity. When the reactor stops operating, the [[radioactive decay]] of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat ([[decay heat]]) for a time, and so requires continued cooling.<ref name="Meltdown101"/><ref name="Explainer: What caused the incident at Fukushima-Daiichi"/> This decay heat amounts to approximately 6.5% of the amount produced by fission at first,<ref name="Meltdown101"/> then decreases over several days before reaching [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] levels.<ref name="DOE fundamentals handbook – Decay heat, Nuclear physics and reactor theory"/> Afterwards, spent fuel rods typically require several years in a [[spent fuel pool]] before they can be safely transferred to [[dry cask storage]] vessels.<ref name="What if it happened here?"/> The decay heat in the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had the capacity to boil about {{Convert|70|t||sp=us}} of water per day.<ref name="More on spent fuel pools at Fukushima"/>

In the reactor core, high-pressure systems cycle water between the reactor pressure vessel and [[heat exchanger]]s. These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the [[essential service water system]], using water pumped out to sea or an onsite [[cooling tower]].<ref name="pcsr-09-06-29"/> Units 2 and 3 had steam turbine-driven [[boiling water reactor safety systems|emergency core cooling systems]] that could be directly operated by steam produced by decay heat and that could inject water directly into the reactor.<ref name="Why has it become impossible for Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station to cool reactor core?"/> Some electrical power was needed to operate valves and monitoring systems.

Unit 1 had a different, entirely passive cooling system, the Isolation Condenser (IC). It consisted of a series of pipes run from the reactor core to the inside of a large tank of water. When the valves were opened, steam flowed upward to the IC, where the cool water in the tank condenses the steam back to water that runs under gravity back to the reactor core. For unknown reasons, Unit 1's IC was operated only intermittently during the emergency. However, during a 25 March 2014 presentation to the TVA, Takeyuki Inagaki explained that the IC was being operated intermittently to maintain reactor vessel level and to prevent the core from cooling too quickly, which can increase reactor power. As the tsunami engulfed the station, the IC valves were closed and could not be reopened automatically due to the loss of electrical power, but could have been opened manually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfb.ca/film/meltdown_doc|title=Meltdown}}</ref> On 16 April 2011, TEPCO declared that cooling systems for Units 1–4 were beyond repair.<ref name="washingtonpost"/>

===Backup generators===
When a reactor is not producing electricity, its cooling pumps can be powered by other reactor units, the grid, diesel generators, or batteries.<ref name="nytimes2"/><ref name="Regulatory effectiveness of the station blackout rule"/>

Two emergency diesel generators were available for each of Units 1–5 and three for Unit 6.<ref name="NISASummary060411"/>

In the late 1990s, three additional backup generators for Units 2 and 4 were placed in new buildings located higher on the hillside, to comply with new regulatory requirements. All six units were given access to these generators, but the switching stations that sent power from these backup generators to the reactors' cooling systems for Units 1 through 5 were still in the poorly protected turbine buildings. The switching station for Unit 6 was protected inside the only GE Mark II reactor building and continued to function.<ref name="wsj1107"/> All three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami. If the switching stations had been moved to inside the reactor buildings or to other flood-proof locations, power would have been provided by these generators to the reactors' cooling systems.<ref name="wsj1107"/>

The reactor's emergency diesel generators and DC batteries, crucial components in powering cooling systems after a power loss, were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings, in accordance with GE's specifications. Mid-level GE engineers expressed concerns, relayed to TEPCO, that this left them vulnerable to flooding.<ref name="japantimes1"/>

The Fukushima reactors were not designed for such a large tsunami,<ref name="japantimes12"/><ref name="tsunami"/> nor had the reactors been modified when concerns were raised in Japan and by the IAEA.<ref name="wl"/>

[[Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant]] was also struck by the tsunami. However, it had incorporated design changes that improved its resistance to flooding, reducing flood damage. Generators and related electrical distribution equipment were located in the watertight reactor building, so that power from the electricity grid was being used by midnight.<ref name="tepco"/> Seawater pumps for cooling were protected from flooding, and although 3 of 4 initially failed, they were restored to operation.<ref name="asahi"/>

===Central fuel storage areas===
Used fuel assemblies taken from reactors are initially stored for at least 18 months in the pools adjacent to their reactors. They can then be transferred to the central fuel storage pond.<ref name=IAEAtsunami1/> Fukushima I's storage area contains 6375 fuel assemblies. After further cooling, fuel can be transferred to dry cask storage, which has shown no signs of abnormalities.<ref name="world-nuclear-news.org"/>

===Zircaloy===
Many of the internal components and fuel assembly cladding are made from [[zircaloy]] because it does not absorb neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately {{convert|300|C|F}}, zircaloy is inert. However, above {{convert|1200|C|F|abbr=out|sp=us}}, [[zirconium]] metal can react exothermically with water to form free [[hydrogen]] gas.<ref name="The Japanese Nuclear Emergency – Sydney Technical Presentation"/> The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction.<ref name="interaction"/> In addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Belle |first1=Jack |title=Uranium dioxide:properties and nuclear applications}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=P. |title=Chemical Interaction Between Uranium Oxide and Zircaloy-4 in the Temperature Range Between 900 and 1500°C}}</ref> This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of [[boron carbide]] with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/23312009.2015.1049111 | volume=1 | title=An introduction to serious nuclear accident chemistry | year=2015 | journal=Cogent Chemistry | first1 = Mark Russell | last1 = St. John Foreman| s2cid=44589893 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Analysis of the response==
{{See also|Investigations into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}
One analysis, in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, stated that Government agencies and TEPCO were unprepared for the "cascading nuclear disaster" and the tsunami that "began the nuclear disaster could and should have been anticipated and that ambiguity about the roles of public and private institutions in such a crisis was a factor in the poor response at Fukushima".<ref name="bas111"/> In March 2012, Prime Minister [[Yoshihiko Noda]] said that the government shared the blame for the Fukushima disaster, saying that officials had been blinded by a false belief in the country's "technological infallibility", and were taken in by a "safety myth". Noda said "Everybody must share the pain of responsibility."<ref name="Japanese Prime Minister Says Government Shares Blame for Nuclear Disaster"/>

According to [[Naoto Kan]], Japan's prime minister during the tsunami, the country was unprepared for the disaster, and nuclear power plants should not have been built so close to the ocean.<ref name=kan12/> Kan acknowledged flaws in authorities' handling of the crisis, including poor communication and coordination between nuclear regulators, utility officials, and the government. He said the disaster "laid bare a host of an even bigger man-made vulnerabilities in Japan's nuclear industry and regulation, from inadequate safety guidelines to crisis management, all of which he said need to be overhauled."<ref name="kan12"/>

Physicist and environmentalist [[Amory Lovins]] said that Japan's "rigid bureaucratic structures, reluctance to send bad news upwards, need to save face, weak development of policy alternatives, eagerness to preserve nuclear power's public acceptance, and politically fragile government, along with TEPCO's very hierarchical management culture, also contributed to the way the accident unfolded. Moreover, the information Japanese people receive about nuclear energy and its alternatives has long been tightly controlled by both TEPCO and the government."<ref name="Amory Lovins 2011"/>

===Poor communication and delays===
The Japanese government did not keep records of key meetings during the crisis.<ref name="Japan did not keep records of nuclear disaster meetings"/> Data from the [[radiation monitoring in Japan#SPEEDI Network|SPEEDI network]] were emailed to the prefectural government, but not shared with others. Emails from NISA to Fukushima, covering 12 March 11:54&nbsp;PM to 16 March 9&nbsp;AM and holding vital information for evacuation and health advisories, went unread and were deleted. The data was not used because the disaster countermeasure office regarded the data as "useless because the predicted amount of released radiation is unrealistic."<ref name="Fukushima Pref. deleted 5 days of radiation dispersion data just after meltdowns"/> On 14 March 2011 TEPCO officials were instructed not to use the phrase "core meltdown" at press conferences.<ref name="nei-20160624">{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newstepco-concealed-core-meltdowns-during-fukushima-accident-4931915 |title=Tepco concealed core meltdowns during Fukushima accident |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=24 June 2016 |access-date=25 June 2016}}</ref>

On the evening of 15 March, Prime Minister Kan called Seiki Soramoto, who used to design nuclear plants for Toshiba, to ask for his help in managing the escalating crisis. Soramoto formed an impromptu advisory group, which included his former professor at the University of Tokyo, Toshiso Kosako, a top Japanese expert on radiation measurement. Mr. Kosako, who studied the Soviet response to the Chernobyl crisis, said he was stunned at how little the leaders in the prime minister's office knew about the resources available to them. He quickly advised the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, to use SPEEDI, which used measurements of radioactive releases, as well as weather and topographical data, to predict where radioactive materials could travel after being released into the atmosphere.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/world/asia/09japan.html|title=Japan Held Nuclear Data, Leaving Evacuees in Peril|last1=Onishi|first1=Norimitsu|last2=Fackler|first2=Martin|date=8 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=24 September 2018}}</ref>

The [[Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company]]'s interim report stated that Japan's response was flawed by "poor communication and delays in releasing data on dangerous radiation leaks at the facility". The report blamed Japan's central government as well as TEPCO, "depicting a scene of harried officials incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks following the disaster".<ref name=yotaro2011/> The report said poor planning worsened the disaster response, noting that authorities had "grossly underestimated tsunami risks" that followed the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The {{Convert|12.1|m||sp=us|adj=on}} high tsunami that struck the plant was double the height of the highest wave predicted by officials. The erroneous assumption that the plant's cooling system would function after the tsunami worsened the disaster. "Plant workers had no clear instructions on how to respond to such a disaster, causing miscommunication, especially when the disaster destroyed backup generators."<ref name="yotaro2011"/>

In February 2012, the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation described how Japan's response was hindered by a loss of trust between the major actors: Prime Minister Kan, TEPCO's Tokyo headquarters and the plant manager. The report said that these conflicts "produced confused flows of sometimes contradictory information".<ref name="nytimes1"/><ref name="Kan hero, or irate meddler?"/> According to the report, Kan delayed the cooling of the reactors by questioning the choice of seawater instead of fresh water, accusing him of micromanaging response efforts and appointing a small, closed, decision-making staff. The report stated that the Japanese government was slow to accept assistance from U.S. nuclear experts.<ref name="Panel lays bare Fukushima recipe for disaster"/>

A 2012 report in ''[[The Economist]]'' said: "The operating company was poorly regulated and did not know what was going on. The operators made mistakes. The representatives of the safety inspectorate fled. Some of the equipment failed. The establishment repeatedly played down the risks and suppressed information about the movement of the radioactive plume, so some people were evacuated from more lightly to more heavily contaminated places."<ref name="Blow-ups happen: Nuclear plants can be kept safe only by constantly worrying about their dangers"/>

From 17 to 19 March 2011, US military aircraft measured radiation within a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} radius of the site. The data recorded 125 micro[[sievert]]s per hour of radiation as far as {{convert|25|km|mi|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} northwest of the plant. The US provided detailed maps to the Japanese [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] (METI) on 18 March and to the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) two days later, but officials did not act on the information.<ref name="Japan sat on U.S. radiation maps showing immediate fallout from nuke crisis"/>

The data were not forwarded to the prime minister's office or the [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] (NSC), nor were they used to direct the evacuation. Because a substantial portion of radioactive materials reached ground to the northwest, residents evacuated in this direction were unnecessarily exposed to radiation. According to NSC chief Tetsuya Yamamoto, "It was very regrettable that we didn't share and utilize the information." Itaru Watanabe, an official of the Science and Technology Policy Bureau of the technology ministry, said it was appropriate for the United States, not Japan, to release the data.<ref name="Japan failed to use U.S. radiation data gathered after nuke crisis"/>

Data on the dispersal of radioactive materials were provided to the U.S. forces by the Japanese Ministry for Science a few days after 11 March; however, the data was not shared publicly until the Americans published their map on 23 March, at which point Japan published fallout maps compiled from ground measurements and SPEEDI the same day.<ref name="Earthquake report 447"/> According to Watanabe's testimony before the Diet, the US military was given access to the data "to seek support from them" on how to deal with the nuclear disaster. Although SPEEDI's effectiveness was limited by not knowing the amounts released in the disaster, and thus was considered "unreliable", it was still able to forecast dispersal routes and could have been used to help local governments designate more appropriate evacuation routes.<ref>The Japan Times (17 January 2012) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/01/18/national/u-s-forces-given-speedi-data-early/#.VxWY1EeWkgU U.S. forces given SPEEDI data early]</ref>

On 19 June 2012, science minister Hirofumi Hirano stated that his "job was only to measure radiation levels on land" and that the government would study whether disclosure could have helped in the evacuation efforts.<ref name="Earthquake report 447"/>

On 28 June 2012, [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] officials apologized to mayor Yuko Endo of Kawauchi Village for NISA having failed to release the American-produced radiation maps in the first days after the meltdowns. All residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a no-entry zone. According to a Japanese government panel, authorities had shown no respect for the lives and dignity of village people. One NISA official apologized for the failure and added that the panel had stressed the importance of disclosure; however, the mayor said that the information would have prevented the evacuation into highly polluted areas, and that apologies a year too late had no meaning.<ref>JIAF (29 June 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1340954689P.pdf Earthequake-report 455: NISA "sorry" for withholding US radiation maps]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In June 2016, it was revealed that TEPCO officials had been instructed on 14 March 2011 not to describe the reactor damage using the word "meltdown". Officials at that time were aware that 25–55% of the fuel had been damaged, and the threshold for which the term "meltdown" became appropriate (5%) had been greatly exceeded. TEPCO President Naomi Hirose told the media: "I would say it was a cover-up... It’s extremely regrettable.”<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/06/21/japanese-utility-admits-to-coverup-during-fukushima-nuclear-meltdown.html|title=Japanese utility admits to 'coverup' during Fukushima nuclear meltdown|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|access-date=1 July 2016}}</ref>

==Prior safety concerns==
===1967: Layout of the emergency-cooling system===
[[File:Fukushima 1 Power Plant control room.jpg|thumb|The Fukushima No.1 reactor control room in 1999]]

In 1967, when the plant was built, TEPCO levelled the sea coast to make it easier to bring in equipment. This put the new plant at {{Convert|10|m||sp=us}} above sea level, rather than the original {{Convert|30|m||sp=us}}.<ref name=w/>

On 27 February 2012, the [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]] ordered TEPCO to report its reasoning for changing the piping layout for the emergency cooling system.

The original plans separated the piping systems for two reactors in the isolation condenser from each other. However, the application for approval of the construction plan showed the two piping systems connected outside the reactor. The changes were not noted, in violation of regulations.<ref name="mainichi1"/>

After the tsunami, the isolation condenser should have taken over the function of the cooling pumps, by condensing the steam from the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor. However, the condenser did not function properly and TEPCO could not confirm whether a valve was opened.

===1991: Backup generator of Reactor 1 flooded===
On 30 October 1991, one of two backup generators of Reactor 1 failed, after flooding in the reactor's basement. Seawater used for cooling leaked into the turbine building from a corroded pipe at 20 cubic meters per hour, as reported by former employees in December 2011. An engineer was quoted as saying that he informed his superiors of the possibility that a tsunami could damage the generators. TEPCO installed doors to prevent water from leaking into the generator rooms.

The [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission]] stated that it would revise its safety guidelines and would require the installation of additional power sources. On 29 December 2011, TEPCO admitted all these facts: its report mentioned that the room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables, but the power supply was not cut off by the flooding, and the reactor was stopped for one day. One of the two power sources was completely submerged, but its drive mechanism had remained unaffected.<ref name="nhk1991"/>

===2000: Tsunami study ignored===
An in-house TEPCO report in 2000 recommended safety measures against seawater flooding, based on the potential of a 50-foot tsunami. TEPCO leadership said the study's technological validity "could not be verified." After the tsunami a TEPCO report said that the risks discussed in the 2000 report had not been announced because "announcing information about uncertain risks would create anxiety."<ref name=w />

===2008: Tsunami study ignored===
In 2007, TEPCO set up a department to supervise its nuclear facilities. Until June 2011, its chairman was [[Masao Yoshida (nuclear engineer)|Masao Yoshida]], the Fukushima Daiichi chief. A 2008 in-house study identified an immediate need to better protect the facility from flooding by seawater. This study mentioned the possibility of tsunami-waves up to {{convert|10.2|m||sp=us}}. Headquarters officials insisted that such a risk was unrealistic and did not take the prediction seriously.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20181020/p2a/00m/0na/018000c|title=Putting tsunami countermeasures on hold at Fukushima nuke plant|date=20 October 2018|newspaper=The Mainichi Shimbun}}</ref><ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"/>{{Verify source|date=July 2013}}

Warnings by government committees, such as one in the Cabinet Office in 2004, that tsunamis taller than the maximum of {{convert|5.6|m||sp=us}} forecast by TEPCO and government officials were possible, were also ignored.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/world/asia/critics-say-japan-ignored-warnings-of-nuclear-disaster.html|title=Nuclear Disaster in Japan Was Avoidable, Critics Contend|last=Fackler|first=Martin|date=9 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=24 September 2018}}</ref>

===Vulnerability to earthquakes===
Japan, like the rest of the [[Ring of Fire|Pacific Rim]], is in an active [[seismic zone]], prone to earthquakes.

A seismologist named Katsuhiko Ishibashi wrote a 1994 book titled ''A Seismologist Warns'' criticizing lax building codes, which became a best seller when an [[Great_Hanshin_earthquake|earthquake in Kobe]] killed thousands shortly after its publication. In 1997 he coined the term "nuclear earthquake disaster", and in 1995 wrote an article for the ''International Herald Tribune'' warning of a cascade of events much like the Fukushima disaster.<ref name=w />

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) had expressed concern about the ability of Japan's nuclear plants to withstand earthquakes. At a 2008 meeting of the [[G8|G8's]] Nuclear Safety and Security Group in Tokyo, an IAEA expert warned that a strong earthquake with a [[Richter magnitude scale#Richter magnitudes|magnitude]] above {{nowrap|7.0}} could pose a "serious problem" for Japan's nuclear power stations.<ref name="IAEA warned Japan over nuclear quake risk: WikiLeaks"/> The region had experienced three earthquakes of magnitude greater than 8, including the [[869 Sanriku earthquake]], the [[1896 Sanriku earthquake]], and the [[1933 Sanriku earthquake]].

Radioactive material was released from the containment vessels for several reasons: deliberate venting to reduce gas pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and uncontrolled events. Concerns about the possibility of a large scale release led to a {{convert|20|km||sp=us|adj=on}} exclusion zone around the power plant and recommendations that people within the surrounding {{Convert|20-30|km||abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} zone stay indoors. Later, the UK, France, and some other countries told their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo, in response to fears of spreading contamination.<ref name="Aus2"/> In 2015, the tap water contamination was still higher in Tokyo compared to other cities in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplyinfo.org/?p=14751 |title=Fukushima Radiation Found In Tap Water Around Japan|first=N.

Between 21 March and mid-July, around 27&nbsp;PBq of caesium-137 (about {{Convert|8.4|kg||abbr=on|sp=us|disp=or}}) entered the ocean, with about 82&nbsp;percent having flowed into the sea before 8 April.<ref name="IRSN-Oct-2011"/> However, the Fukushima coast has some of the world's strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the [[Pacific Ocean]], thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentrations in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above the normal concentrations prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.<ref name="Fukushima-derived radionuclides in the ocean and biota off Japan"/>

Researchers at the [[University of Tokyo]]'s Underwater Technology Research Center towed detectors behind boats to map hot spots on the ocean floor off Fukushima. Blair Thornton, an associate professor the university, said in 2013 that radiation levels remained hundreds of times as high as in other areas of the sea floor, suggesting ongoing contamination (at the time) from the plant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/world/asia/with-a-plants-tainted-water-still-flowing-no-end-to-environmental-fears.html |title=With a Plant's Tainted Water Still Flowing, No End to Environmental Fears|last1=Fackler|first1=Martin |last2=Tabuchi|first2=Hiroko |date=24 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=24 September 2018}}</ref>

A monitoring system operated by the [[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO) tracked the spread of radioactivity on a global scale. Radioactive isotopes were picked up by over 40 monitoring stations.<ref name="CTBTO to Share Data with IAEA and WHO"/>

On 12 March, radioactive releases first reached a CTBTO monitoring station in Takasaki, Japan, around {{Convert|200|km||abbr=on|sp=us|adj=on}} away. The radioactive isotopes appeared in eastern Russia on 14 March and the west coast of the United States two days later. By day 15, traces of radioactivity were detectable all across the northern hemisphere. Within one month, radioactive particles were noted by CTBTO stations in the southern hemisphere.<ref name="Fukushima-Related Measurements by the CTBTO"/><ref name="CTBTO Trakcs Fukushima's Radioactive Release"/>

On 24 August 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) of Japan published the results of its recalculation of the total amount of radioactive materials released into the air during the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The total amounts released between 11 March and 5 April were revised downwards to 130&nbsp;PBq ([[becquerel#Prefixes|petabecquerels]], 3.5 mega[[Curie (unit)|curie]]s) for iodine-131 and 11&nbsp;PBq for caesium-137, which is about 11% of Chernobyl emissions. Earlier estimations were 150&nbsp;PBq and 12&nbsp;PBq.<ref name="jaif"/><ref name="nisa-ines-2011-04-12"/>

In 2011, scientists working for the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Kyoto University and other institutes, recalculated the amount of radioactive material released into the ocean: between late March through April they found a total of 15&nbsp;PBq for the combined amount of iodine-131 and caesium-137, more than triple the 4.72&nbsp;PBq estimated by TEPCO. The company had calculated only the direct releases into the sea. The new calculations incorporated the portion of airborne radioactive substances that entered the ocean as rain.<ref name="jaif8"/>

In the first half of September 2011, TEPCO estimated the radioactivity release at some 200&nbsp;MBq (megabecquerels, 5.4 milli[[Curie (unit)|curie]]s) per hour. This was approximately one four-millionth that of March.<ref name="jaif9"/>

According to the [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety]], between 21 March and mid-July around 27&nbsp;PBq of caesium-137 entered the ocean, about 82&nbsp;percent before 8 April. This emission represents the most important individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed. The Fukushima coast has one of the world's strongest currents ([[Kuroshio Current]]). It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil. The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as [[strontium-90]] or [[plutonium]], has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast.<ref name="Synthèse actualisée des connaissances relatives à l'impact sur le milieu marin des rejets radioactifs du site nucléaire accidenté de Fukushima Dai-ichi"/>

Migratory [[pelagic fish|pelagic species]] are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean.

As of March 2012, no cases of radiation-related ailments had been reported. Experts cautioned that data was insufficient to allow conclusions on health impacts. Michiaki Kai, professor of radiation protection at [[Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences]], stated, "If the current radiation dose estimates are correct, (cancer-related deaths) likely won't increase."<ref name="japantimes112"/>

In May 2012, TEPCO released their estimate of cumulative radioactivity releases. An estimated 538.1&nbsp;PBq of iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 was released. 520&nbsp;PBq was released into the atmosphere between 12–31 March 2011 and 18.1&nbsp;PBq into the ocean from 26 March – 30 September 2011. A total of 511&nbsp;PBq of iodine-131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean, 13.5&nbsp;PBq of caesium-134 and 13.6&nbsp;PBq of caesium-137.<ref name="TEPCO Press Release"/> TEPCO reported that at least 900&nbsp;PBq had been released "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone".<ref name="Kevin Krolicki"/><ref name="english.kyodonews.jp"/>

In 2012 researchers from the Institute of Problems in the Safe Development of Nuclear Energy, Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia concluded that "on March 15, 2011, ~400 PBq iodine, ~100 PBq caesium, and ~400 PBq inert gases entered the atmosphere" on that day alone.<ref name="radionuclide"/>

In August 2012, researchers found that 10,000 nearby residents had been exposed to less than 1 [[millisievert]] of radiation, significantly less than Chernobyl residents.<ref name="washingtonpost13"/>

As of October 2012, radioactivity was still leaking into the ocean. Fishing in the waters around the site was still prohibited, and the levels of radioactive <sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs in the fish caught were not lower than immediately after the disaster.<ref name="sciencemag480"/>

On 26 October 2012, TEPCO admitted that it could not stop radioactive material entering the ocean, although emission rates had stabilized. Undetected leaks could not be ruled out, because the reactor basements remained flooded. The company was building a 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site and the ocean, reaching {{Convert|30|m||sp=us}} below ground, but it would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two [[greenling]] were caught close to shore.

===Contamination in the eastern Pacific===
In March 2014, numerous news sources, including [[NBC]],<ref name="nbcnews"/> began predicting that the radioactive underwater [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] traveling through the Pacific Ocean would reach the western seaboard of the [[continental United States]]. The common story was that the amount of radioactivity would be harmless and temporary once it arrived. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] measured caesium-134 at points in the Pacific Ocean and models were cited in predictions by several government agencies to announce that the radiation would not be a health hazard for North American residents. Groups, including [[Beyond Nuclear]] and the Tillamook Estuaries Partnership, challenged these predictions on the basis of continued isotope releases after 2011, leading to a demand for more recent and comprehensive measurements as the radioactivity made its way east. These measurements were taken by a cooperative group of organizations under the guidance of a marine chemist with the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], and revealed that total radiation levels, of which only a fraction bore the fingerprint of Fukushima, were not high enough to pose any direct risk to human life and in fact were far less than [[Environmental Protection Agency]] guidelines or several other sources of radiation exposure deemed safe.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Science|last=Sherwood|first=Courtney |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/asiapacific/2014/11/fukushima-radiation-nears-california-coast-judged-harmless |title=Fukushima radiation nears California coast, judged harmless|date=11 November 2014}}</ref> Integrated Fukushima Ocean Radionuclide Monitoring project (InFORM) also failed to show any significant amount of radiation<ref name=":0">{{cite web |title= British Columbia {{!}} Home|url= http://fukushimainform.ca/category/peer-reviewed/location/british-columbia/ |website=Fukushimainform.ca|access-date= 2 November 2015}}</ref> and as a result its authors received [[death threats]] from supporters of a Fukushima-induced "wave of cancer deaths across North America" theory.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Canadian researcher targeted by hate campaign over Fukushima findings|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/canadian-researcher-targeted-by-hate-campaign-over-fukushima-findings/article27060613/ |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date= 2 November 2015}}</ref>

==Event rating==
{{Main|Accident rating of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}
[[File:Fukushima7.png|thumb|Comparison of radiation levels for different nuclear events]]

The incident was rated 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] (INES).<ref name="en20110412-4"/> This scale runs from 0, indicating an abnormal situation with no safety consequences, to 7, indicating an accident causing widespread contamination with serious health and environmental effects. Prior to Fukushima, the Chernobyl disaster was the only level 7 event on record, while the [[Three Mile Island accident]] was rated as level 5.

A 2012 analysis of the intermediate and long-lived radioactivity released found about 10–20% of that released from the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name="nature1"/><ref name="iaeaf120411"/> Approximately 15&nbsp;[[Bq|PBq]] of [[caesium-137]] was released,<ref name="tepco2"/> compared with approximately 85&nbsp;PBq of caesium-137 at Chernobyl,<ref name="oecd-nea1"/> indicating the release of {{convert|26.5|kg||sp=us}} of caesium-137.

Unlike Chernobyl, all Japanese reactors were in concrete containment vessels, which limited the release of [[strontium-90]], [[americium-241]], and [[plutonium]], which were among the [[radioisotope]]s released by the earlier incident.<ref name="nature1"/><ref name="oecd-nea1"/>

500&nbsp;PBq of [[iodine-131]] was released,<ref name="tepco2"/> compared to approximately 1,760&nbsp;PBq at Chernobyl.<ref name="oecd-nea1"/> Iodine-131 has a [[half-life]] of 8.02 days, decaying into a stable nuclide. After ten half lives (80.2 days), 99.9% has decayed to [[xenon-131]], a stable isotope.<ref name="terrapub"/>

On 5 July 2012, the [[National Diet|Japanese National Diet]]-appointed [[#NAIIC|Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission]] (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese Diet.<ref name="National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission"/> The Commission found the nuclear disaster was "manmade", that the direct causes of the accident were all foreseeable prior to 11 March 2011. The report also found that the Fukushima [[Dai-ichi|Daiichi]] Nuclear Power Plant was incapable of withstanding the earthquake and tsunami. TEPCO, the regulatory bodies ([[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] and NSC) and the government body promoting the nuclear power industry (METI), all failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements&nbsp;– such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release.

===Contaminated water===
A frozen soil barrier was constructed in an attempt to prevent further contamination of seeping groundwater by [[corium (nuclear reactor)|melted-down nuclear fuel]],<ref name="spectrum5"/> but in July 2016 TEPCO revealed that the ice wall had failed to stop groundwater from flowing in and mixing with highly radioactive water inside the wrecked reactor buildings, adding that "its ultimate goal has been to 'curtail' groundwater inflow, not halt it".<ref name=":2">{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/20/national/first-tepco-admits-ice-wall-cant-stop-fukushima-no-1-groundwater/|title=In first, Tepco admits ice wall can't stop Fukushima No. 1 groundwater|last=Otake|first=Tomoko|date=20 July 2016|newspaper=The Japan Times Online|access-date=12 February 2017|issn=0447-5763}}</ref> By 2019, the ice wall had reduced the inflow of groundwater from 440 cubic meters per day in 2014 to 100 cubic meters per day, while contaminated water generation decreased from 540 cubic meters per day in 2014 to 170 cubic meters per day.<ref name=WNNwater>{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Fukushima-decommissioning-moves-forward |title=Fukushima decommissioning moves forward |date=17 September 2019 |website=World Nuclear News |access-date=18 September 2019 }}</ref>

As of October 2019, 1.17 million cubic meters of contaminated water was stored in the plant area. The water is being treated by a purification system that can remove [[radionuclide]]s, except [[tritium]], to a level that Japanese regulations allow to be discharged to the sea. As of December 2019, 28% of the water had been purified to the required level, while the remaining 72% needed additional purification. However, tritium cannot be separated from the water. As of October 2019, the total amount of tritium in the water was about 856 [[terabecquerel]]s, and the average tritium concentration was about 0.73 megabecquerels per liter. A committee set up by the Japanese Government concluded that the purified water should be released to the sea or evaporated to the atmosphere. The committee calculated that discharging all the water to the sea in one year would cause a radiation dose of 0.81 [[microsievert]]s to the local people, whereas evaporation would cause 1.2 microsieverts. For comparison, Japanese people get 2100 microsieverts per year from [[natural radiation]].<ref name="ALPScommittee">{{cite web |title=The subcommittee on handling of the ALPS treated water report |url=https://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/pdf/20200210_alps.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry |access-date=10 April 2020 |pages=12,16,17,33,34 |date=10 February 2020}}</ref> [[IAEA]] considers that the dose calculation method is appropriate.

===Thyroid screening program===
The World Health Organization stated that a 2013 [[thyroid]] ultrasound screening program was, due to the [[screening (medicine)|screening effect]], likely to lead to an increase in recorded thyroid cases due to early detection of non-[[symptomatic]] disease cases.{{sfn|WHO|2013|pp=87–88}} The overwhelming majority of thyroid growths are benign growths that will never cause symptoms, illness, or death, even if nothing is ever done about the growth. [[Autopsy]] studies on people who died from other causes show that more than one third of adults technically have a thyroid growth/cancer.<ref name="Welch"/> As a precedent, in 1999 in [[South Korea]], the introduction of advanced [[ultrasound]] thyroid examinations resulted in an explosion in the rate of [[benign]] thyroid cancers being detected and needless surgeries occurring.<ref name="fukushimainform.ca">{{cite web|url=https://fukushimainform.ca/2016/03/06/screening-effect-examining-thyroid-cancers-found-in-fukushima-children/|title=Screening effect?

According to the Tenth Report of the Fukushima Prefecture Health Management Survey released in February 2013, more than 40% of children screened around Fukushima prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid nodules or cysts.

In October 2015, 137 children from the Fukushima Prefecture were described as either being diagnosed with or showing signs of developing thyroid cancer. The study's lead author Toshihide Tsuda from [[Okayama University]] stated that the increased detection could not be accounted for by attributing it to the [[screening (medicine)|screening effect]]. He described the screening results to be "20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected."<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title= Experts link higher incidence of children's cancer to Fukushima radiation|url= http://www.sciencealert.com/experts-link-higher-incidence-of-children-s-cancer-to-fukushima-radiation|website=Sciencealert.com|access-date= 15 January 2016}}</ref> By the end of 2015, the number had increased to 166 children.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160307/p2a/00m/0na/022000c|title=Experts divided on causes of high thyroid cancer rates among Fukushima children – The Mainichi|language=en-US|access-date=6 July 2016|newspaper=[[Mainichi Daily News]]|date=7 March 2016}}</ref>

However, despite his paper being widely reported by the media,<ref name="fukushimainform.ca"/> an undermining error, according to teams of other epidemiologists who point out Tsuda's remarks are fatally wrong, is that Tsuda did an [[apples and oranges]] comparison by comparing the Fukushima surveys, which uses advanced ultrasound devices that detect otherwise unnoticeable thyroid growths, with data from traditional non-advanced clinical examinations, to arrive at his "20 to 50 times what would be expected" conclusion. In the critical words of epidemiologist Richard Wakeford, “It is inappropriate to compare the data from the Fukushima screening program with cancer registry data from the rest of Japan where there is, in general, no such large-scale screening,”. Wakeford's criticism was one of seven other author's letters that were published criticizing Tsuda's paper.<ref name="fukushimainform.ca"/> According to Takamura, another epidemiologist, who examined the results of small scale advanced ultrasound tests on Japanese children not near Fukushima, "The prevalence of thyroid cancer [using the same detection technology] does not differ meaningfully from that in Fukushima Prefecture,”.<ref name="fukushimainform.ca"/>

In 2016 Ohira et al. conducted a study cross-comparing thyroid cancer patients from Fukushima prefecture evacuees with rates of Thyroid cancer in from those outside of the evacuation zone. Ohira et al. found that "The duration between accident and thyroid examination was not associated with thyroid cancer prevalence. There were no significant associations between individual external doses and prevalence of thyroid cancer. External radiation dose was not associated with thyroid cancer prevalence among Fukushima children within the first 4 years after the nuclear accident.."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ohira|first=Tetsuya |display-authors=etal |date=August 2016|title=Comparison of childhood thyroid cancer prevalence among 3 areas based on external radiation dose after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident|pmc=5008539|journal=Medicine|volume=95|issue=35|pages=e4472 PubMed|pmid=27583855|doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000004472}}</ref>

A 2018 publication by Yamashita et al. also concluded that Thyroid cancer rate differences can be attributed to the screening effect. They noted that the mean age of the patients at the time of the accident was 10–15 years, while no cases were found in children from the ages of 0-5 who would have been most susceptible. Yamashita et al. thus conclude that "In any case, the individual prognosis cannot be accurately determined at the time of FNAC at present. It is therefore urgent to search not only for intraoperative and postoperative prognostic factors but also for predictive prognostic factors at the FNAC/preoperative stage."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yamashita|first=Shunichi|display-authors=etal|date=1 January 2018|title=Lessons from Fukushima: Latest Findings of Thyroid Cancer After the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant Accident|journal=Thyroid|volume=28|issue=1|pages=11–22 PubMed|doi=10.1089/thy.2017.0283|pmid=28954584|pmc=5770131}}</ref>

A 2019 investigation by Yamamoto et al. evaluated the first and the second screening rounds separately as well as combined covering 184 confirmed cancer cases in 1.080 million observed person years subject to additional radiation exposure due to the nuclear accidents. The authors concluded "A significant association between the external effective dose-rate and the thyroid cancer detection rate exists: detection rate ratio (DRR) per μSv/h 1.065 (1.013, 1.119). Restricting the analysis to the 53 municipalities that received less than 2 μSv/h, and which represent 176 of the total 184 cancer cases, the association appears to be considerably stronger: DRR per μSv/h 1.555 (1.096, 2.206). The average radiation dose-rates in the 59 municipalities of the Fukushima prefecture in June 2011 and the corresponding thyroid cancer detection rates in the period October 2011 to March 2016 show statistically significant relationships. This corroborates previous studies providing evidence for a causal relation between nuclear accidents and the subsequent occurrence of thyroid cancer."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scherb|first=Yamaoto|display-authors=etal|date=1 September 2019|title=Association between the detection rate of thyroid cancer and the external radiation dose-rate after the nuclear power plant accidents in Fukushima, Japan|journal= Medicine|volume=98|issue=37|pages=e17165 PubMed|doi=10.1097/md.0000000000017165|pmid=31517868|pmc=6750239}}</ref>

{{Main|Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl nuclear accidents}}
[[File:Anti-Atom-Demo Berlin Potsdamer Platz 2011-03-26.jpg|thumb|Protest against nuclear power in [[Berlin]], Germany, March 2011]]
Radiation deaths at Chernobyl were also statistically undetectable. Only 0.1% of the 110,645 Ukrainian cleanup workers, included in a 20-year study out of over 500,000 former Soviet clean up workers, had as of 2012 developed leukemia, although not all cases resulted from the accident.<ref name="Brumfiel"/><ref name="Zablotska"/>

Data from Chernobyl showed that there was a steady but sharp increase in thyroid cancer rates following the disaster in 1986, but whether this data can be directly compared to Fukushima is yet to be determined.<ref name="hormones.gr"/>

Chernobyl thyroid cancer incidence rates did not begin to increase above the prior baseline value of about 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year until 1989 to 1991, 3–5 years after the incident in both adolescent and child age groups.<ref name="hormones.gr"/> The rate reached its highest point so far, of about 11 cases per 100,000 in the decade of the 2000s, approximately 14 years after the accident.<ref name="hormones.gr"/> From 1989 to 2005, an excess of 4,000 children and adolescent cases of thyroid cancer were observed. Nine of these had died as of 2005, a 99% survival rate.<ref name="Chernobyl: the true scale of the accident. 20 Years Later a UN Report Provides Definitive Answers and Ways to Repair Lives"/>

===Effects on evacuees===
In the former [[Soviet Union]], many patients with negligible radioactive exposure after the Chernobyl disaster displayed extreme anxiety about radiation exposure. They developed many [[psychosomatic]] problems, including [[radiophobia]] along with an increase in [[fatalism|fatalistic]] [[alcoholism]]. As Japanese health and radiation specialist Shunichi Yamashita noted:<ref name="spie78"/>
{{Quote|We know from Chernobyl that the [[psychological]] consequences are enormous. Life expectancy of the evacuees dropped from 65 to 58 years – not because of cancer, but because of [[depression (mood)|depression]], alcoholism, and [[suicide]]. Relocation is not easy, the [[stress (psychological)|stress]] is very big. We must not only track those problems, but also treat them. Otherwise people will feel they are just guinea pigs in our research.<ref name=spie78/>}}

A survey by the [[Iitate, Fukushima|Iitate]] local government obtained responses from approximately 1,743 evacuees within the evacuation zone. The survey showed that many residents are experiencing growing frustration, instability, and an inability to return to their earlier lives. Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating, while 39.9% reported feeling more irritated compared to before the disaster.<ref name="main2012"/>
<blockquote>
Summarizing all responses to questions related to evacuees' current family status, one-third of all surveyed families live apart from their children, while 50.1% live away from other family members (including elderly parents) with whom they lived before the disaster. The survey also showed that 34.7% of the evacuees have suffered salary cuts of 50% or more since the outbreak of the nuclear disaster. A total of 36.8% reported a lack of sleep, while 17.9% reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated.<ref name=main2012/>
</blockquote>

Stress often manifests in physical ailments, including behavioral changes such as poor dietary choices, lack of exercise, and sleep deprivation. Survivors, including some who lost homes, villages, and family members, were found likely to face mental health and physical challenges. Much of the stress came from lack of information and from relocation.<ref name="Japan's Post-Fukushima Earthquake Health Woes Go Beyond Radiation Effects"/>

In a 2017 [[risk analysis]], relying on the metric of [[Years of potential life lost|potential months of life lost]], it determined that unlike Chernobyl, "relocation was unjustified for the 160,000 people relocated after Fukushima", when the potential future deaths from exposure to radiation around Fukushima, would have been much less, if the alternative of the [[shelter in place]] protocol had instead been deployed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171120085453.htm|title=Homes should not be abandoned after a big nuclear accident, study suggests}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=P.J|title=J-value assessment of relocation measures following the nuclear power plant accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi|journal=Process Safety and Environmental Protection|volume=112|pages=16–49|date=November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.psep.2017.03.012|doi-access=free}}</ref>

By March 2012, one year after the disaster, all but two of Japan's nuclear reactors had been shut down; some had been damaged by the quake and tsunami. Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments, which all decided against reopening them. According to ''[[The Japan Times]]'', the disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight. "By shattering the government's long-pitched safety myth about nuclear power, the crisis dramatically raised public awareness about energy use and sparked strong [[anti-nuclear]] sentiment".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the disaster and called for a reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power. It also omitted a section on nuclear power expansion that was in the previous year's policy review.<ref name="Nuclear Promotion Dropped in Japan Energy Policy After Fukushima"/>

The nuclear plant closest to the [[epicenter]] of the earthquake, the [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant]], successfully withstood the cataclysm. [[Reuters]] said it may serve as a "trump card" for the nuclear lobby, providing evidence that it is possible for a correctly designed and operated nuclear facility to withstand such a cataclysm.<ref name="reuters15"/>

The loss of 30% of the country's generating capacity led to much greater reliance on [[liquified natural gas]] and [[coal]].<ref name="Fukushima Starts Long Road To Recovery"/> Unusual conservation measures were undertaken.

Many political activists have called for a phase-out of nuclear power in Japan, including [[Amory Lovins]], who claimed, "Japan is poor in ''fuels'', but is the richest of all major industrial countries in renewable ''energy'' that can meet the entire long-term energy needs of an energy-efficient Japan, at lower cost and risk than current plans.

Sovacool]] asserted that Japan could have exploited instead its [[renewable energy]] base.

In contrast, others have said that the zero mortality rate from the Fukushima incident confirms their opinion that [[nuclear fission]] is the only viable option available to replace [[fossil fuels]].

In September 2011, [[Mycle Schneider]] said that the disaster can be understood as a unique chance "to get it right" on [[energy policy]]. "Germany – with its nuclear phase-out decision based on a [[renewable energy in Germany|renewable energy]] program – and Japan – having suffered a painful shock but possessing unique technical capacities and societal discipline – can be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift toward a truly sustainable, low-carbon and nuclear-free energy policy."<ref name="Fukushima crisis: Can Japan be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift?"/>

On the other hand, climate and energy scientists [[James Hansen]], [[Ken Caldeira]], [[Kerry Emanuel]], and [[Tom Wigley]] released an open letter calling on world leaders to support development of safer nuclear power systems, stating "There is no credible path to climate stabilization that does not include a substantial role for nuclear power." <ref name="Top climate change scientists' letter to policy influencers"/> In December 2014, an open letter from 75 climate and energy scientists on the website of Australian pro-nuclear advocate [[Barry Brook (scientist)|Barry Brook]] asserted "nuclear power has lowest impact on wildlife and ecosystems – which is what we need given the dire state of the world’s biodiversity."<ref name="It’s time for environmentalists to give nuclear a fair go"/> Brook's advocacy for nuclear power has been challenged by opponents of nuclear industries, including environmentalist [[Jim Green (activist)|Jim Green]] of [[Friends of the Earth Australia|Friends of the Earth]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://newmatilda.com/2012/03/12/nuclear-power-isnt-green-bullet|title = Nuclear power isn't a green bullet|last = Green|first = Jim|date = 12 March 2012|access-date = 9 February 2015|publisher = [[NewMatilda.com]]}}</ref> Brook has described the [[Australian Greens]] political party (SA Branch) and [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] as "sad" and "increasingly irrelevant" after they expressed their opposition to nuclear industrial development.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://bravenewclimate.com/2015/02/08/south-australia-announces-royal-commission-into-nuclear-energy/|title = South Australia announces Royal Commission into Nuclear Energy|date = 8 February 2015|access-date = 10 February 2015|website = Brave New Climate|last = Brook|first = Barry}}</ref>

{{As of|2011|09}}, Japan planned to build a pilot offshore [[floating wind turbine|floating wind farm]], with six 2 MW turbines, off the [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima coast]].<ref name="bb20110916"/> The first became operational in November 2013.<ref name="smh"/> After the evaluation phase is complete in 2016, "Japan plans to build as many as 80 floating wind turbines off Fukushima by 2020."<ref name=bb20110916/> In 2012, [[Prime Minister Kan]] said the disaster made it clear to him that "Japan needs to dramatically reduce its dependence on nuclear power, which supplied 30% of its electricity before the crisis, and has turned him into a believer of renewable energy".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Sales of solar panels in Japan rose 30.7% to 1,296 MW in 2011, helped by a government scheme to promote renewable energy. [[Canadian Solar]] received financing for its plans to build a factory in Japan with capacity of 150 MW, scheduled to begin production in 2014.<ref name="Canadian Solar Signs Loan Agreement For Japan Development"/>

As of September 2012, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that "Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda acknowledged that the vast majority of Japanese support the zero option on nuclear power",<ref name="In wake of Fukushima disaster, Japan to end nuclear power by 2030s"/> and Prime Minister Noda and the Japanese government announced plans to make the country nuclear-free by the 2030s. They announced the end to construction of nuclear power plants and a 40-year limit on existing nuclear plants. Nuclear plant restarts must meet safety standards of the new independent regulatory authority.

On 16 December 2012, Japan held its [[2012 Japanese election|general election]]. The [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) had a clear victory, with [[Shinzō Abe]] as the new [[prime minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]. Abe supported nuclear power, saying that leaving the plants closed was costing the country 4 trillion yen per year in higher costs.<ref name="asahi16"/> The comment came after [[Junichiro Koizumi]], who chose Abe to succeed him as premier, made a recent statement to urge the government to take a stance against using nuclear power.<ref name="houseofjapan"/> A survey on local mayors by the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] newspaper in January 2013 found that most of them from cities hosting nuclear plants would agree to restarting the reactors, provided the government could guarantee their safety.<ref name="Most Japan cities hosting nuclear plants OK restart: survey"/> More than 30,000 people marched on 2 June 2013, in Tokyo against restarting nuclear power plants. Marchers had gathered more than 8 million petition signatures opposing nuclear power.<ref name="60,000 protest Japan's plan to restart nuclear power plants"/>

In October 2013, it was reported that TEPCO and eight other Japanese power companies were paying approximately 3.6 trillion [[yen]] (37 billion [[dollars]]) more in combined imported fossil fuel costs compared to 2010, before the accident, to make up for the missing power.<ref name="Japan's Fuel Costs May Rise to 7.5 Trillion Yen, Meti Estimates"/>

From 2016 to 2018 the nation fired up at least eight new [[coal power plant]]s. Plans for an additional 36 coal stations over the next decade are the biggest planned coal power expansion in any developed nation. The new national energy plan that would have coal provide 26% of Japan's electricity in 2030, presents the abandoning of a previous goal of reducing coal's share to 10%. The coal revival is seen as having alarming implications for air pollution and Japan's ability to meet its pledges to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bucking global trends, Japan again embraces coal power|first=Dennis|last=Normile|date=4 May 2018|journal=Science|volume=360|issue=6388|pages=476–77|doi=10.1126/science.360.6388.476|pmid=29724935|bibcode=2018Sci...360..476N}}</ref>

===Equipment, facility, and operational changes===
A number of [[nuclear reactor safety system]] lessons emerged from the incident. The most obvious was that in tsunami-prone areas, a power station's [[sea wall]] must be adequately tall and robust.<ref name=":182"/> At the [[Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant]], closer to the epicenter of 11 March earthquake and tsunami,<ref name="reuters.com"/> the sea wall was {{Convert|14|m||sp=us}} tall and successfully withstood the tsunami, preventing serious damage and radioactivity releases.<ref name="iaea"/><ref name="www17"/>

Nuclear power station operators around the world began to install [[Passive autocatalytic recombiner|Passive Autocatalytic hydrogen Recombiners]] ("PARs"), which do not require electricity to operate.<ref name="world-nuclear-news"/><ref name="business-standard"/><ref name="nuclear-engineering-journal"/> PARs work much like the [[catalytic converter]] on the exhaust of a car to turn potentially explosive gases such as hydrogen into water. Had such devices been positioned at the top of Fukushima I's reactor buildings, where hydrogen gas collected, the explosions would not have occurred and the releases of radioactive isotopes would arguably have been much less.<ref name="spectrum 24hr"/>

Unpowered filtering systems on [[containment building]] vent lines, known as [[Filtered Containment Venting System]]s (FCVS), can safely catch radioactive materials and thereby allow reactor core depressurization, with steam and hydrogen venting with minimal radioactivity emissions.<ref name="spectrum 24hr"/><ref name="Nuclear chief: U.S. plants safer after Japan crisis. 10 March 2013"/> Filtration using an external water tank system is the most common established system in European countries, with the water tank positioned outside the [[containment building]].<ref name="Vents and Filtering Strategies Come to Forefront in Fukushima Response Nuclear Energy Insight.

For [[generation II reactor]]s located in flood or tsunami prone areas, a 3+ day supply of back-up batteries has become an informal industry standard.<ref name="power-eng"/><ref name="businesswire"/> Another change is to harden the location of back-up diesel generator rooms with water-tight, blast-resistant doors and [[heat sink]]s, similar to those used by [[nuclear submarine]]s.<ref name="spectrum 24hr"/> The oldest operating nuclear power station in the world, [[Beznau Nuclear Power Plant|Beznau]], which has been operating since 1969, has a 'Notstand' hardened building designed to support all of its systems independently for 72&nbsp;hours in the event of an earthquake or severe flooding. This system was built prior to Fukushima Daiichi.<ref name="woody"/><ref name="A PRA Practioner Looks at the Fukushima Daiichi Accident"/>

Upon a [[power outage|station blackout]], similar to the one that occurred after Fukushima's back-up battery supply was exhausted,<ref name="2012 20th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering and the ASME 2012 Power Conference"/> many constructed [[Generation III reactor]]s adopt the principle of [[passive nuclear safety]]. They take advantage of [[convection]] (hot water tends to rise) and [[gravity]] (water tends to fall) to ensure an adequate supply of cooling water to handle the [[decay heat]], without the use of pumps.<ref name="power-engiii"/><ref name="Nuclear Science and Techniques 24 (2013) 040601 Study on the long-term passive cooling extension of AP1000 reactor"/>

As the crisis unfolded, the Japanese government sent a request for robots developed by the U.S. military. The robots went into the plants and took pictures to help assess the situation, but they couldn't perform the full range of tasks usually carried out by human workers.<ref name="swissre"/> The Fukushima disaster illustrated that robots lacked sufficient dexterity and robustness to perform critical tasks. In response to this shortcoming, a series of competitions were hosted by [[DARPA]] to accelerate the development of [[humanoid robot]]s that could supplement relief efforts.<ref name="robots">{{cite news |author1     = Seiji Iwata |author2     = Ryuichi Kanari |date        = 26 May 2011 |title       = Japanese robots long gone before Fukushima accident |url         = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201105260215 |newspaper   = [[Asahi Shimbun]] |access-date  = 27 August 2014 |url-status = dead|archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903061944/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201105260215 |archive-date = 3 September 2014 |df          = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DARPA Robotics Challenge|url=http://www.theroboticschallenge.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428005028/http://www.darparoboticschallenge.org/|archive-date=28 April 2016 |website=DRC |publisher=DARPA |access-date=27 April 2016 |url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Reactions==
===Japan===
{{Main|Japanese reaction to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster}}
[[File:Towns evacuated around Fukushima on April 11th, 2011.png|thumb|Japan towns, villages, and cities in and around the Daiichi nuclear plant exclusion zone. The {{Convert|20 and 30|km||abbr=on|sp=us}} areas had evacuation and [[shelter in place]] orders, and additional administrative districts that had an evacuation order are highlighted.

More accurate maps are available.<ref name="Areas to which evacuation orders have been issued" /><ref name="Designating and Rearranging the Areas of Evacuation (pg 7)"/>]]

Japanese authorities later admitted to lax standards and poor oversight.<ref name="reuters2011"/> They took fire for their handling of the emergency and engaged in a pattern of withholding and denying damaging information.<ref name=reuters2011/><ref name="japantimes11"/><ref name=nytaug/><ref name=bellaug/> Authorities allegedly{{dubious|date=June 2015}} wanted to "limit the size of costly and disruptive evacuations in land-scarce Japan and to avoid public questioning of the politically powerful nuclear industry". Public anger emerged over what many saw as "an official campaign to play down the scope of the accident and the potential health risks".<ref name="nytaug"/><ref name="bellaug"/><ref name="ibtimes18"/>

In many cases, the Japanese government's reaction was judged to be less than adequate by many in Japan, especially those who were living in the region. Decontamination equipment was slow to be made available and then slow to be utilized. As late as June 2011, even rainfall continued to cause fear and uncertainty in eastern Japan because of its possibility of washing radioactivity from the sky back to earth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

To assuage fears, the government enacted an order to [[radioactive contamination#Decontamination|decontaminate]] over a hundred areas where the level of additional radiation was greater than one [[millisievert]] per year. This is a much lower threshold than is necessary for protecting health. The government also sought to address the lack of education on the effects of radiation and the extent to which the average person was exposed.<ref name="international"/>

Previously a proponent of building more reactors, Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] took an increasingly [[anti-nuclear]] stance following the disaster. In May 2011, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] closed over earthquake and tsunami concerns, and said he would freeze building plans. In July 2011, Kan said, "Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy".<ref name="Japan Premier Wants Shift Away From Nuclear Power"/> In October 2013, he said that if the worst-case scenario had been realized, 50 million people within a {{Convert|250|km||sp=us|adj=on}} radius would have had to evacuate.<ref name="Encountering the Fukushima Daiichi Accident"/>

On 22 August 2011, a government spokesman mentioned the possibility that some areas around the plant "could stay for some decades a forbidden zone". According to Yomiuri Shimbun the Japanese government was planning to buy some properties from civilians to store waste and materials that had become radioactive after the accidents.<ref name="www19"/><ref name="guardian"/> Chiaki Takahashi, Japan's foreign minister, criticized foreign media reports as excessive. He added that he could "understand the concerns of foreign countries over recent developments at the nuclear plant, including the [[radioactive contamination]] of seawater".<ref name="jaif_45"/>

Due to frustration with TEPCO and the Japanese government "providing differing, confusing, and at times contradictory, information on critical health issues"<ref name="aljazeera"/> a citizen's group called "[[Safecast (organization)|Safecast]]" recorded detailed radiation level data in Japan.<ref name="safecast"/><ref name="Volunteers Crowdsource Radiation Monitoring to Map Potential Risk on Every Street in Japan"/> The Japanese government "does not consider nongovernment readings to be authentic". The group uses off-the-shelf [[Geiger counter]] equipment. A simple [[Geiger counter]] is a [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] meter and not a dose rate meter. The response differs too much between different radioisotopes to permit a simple GM tube for dose rate measurements when more than one radioisotope is present. A thin metal shield is needed around a GM tube to provide energy compensation to enable it to be used for dose rate measurements. For gamma emitters either an ionization chamber, a gamma spectrometer or an energy compensated GM tube are required. Members of the Air Monitoring station facility at the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the [[University of Berkeley]], California have tested many environmental samples in Northern California.<ref name="berkeley"/>

The international reaction to the disaster was diverse and widespread. Many inter-governmental agencies immediately offered help, often on an ad hoc basis. Responders included IAEA, [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the Preparatory Commission for the [[Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization]].<ref name="14 March 2011"/>

In May 2011, UK chief inspector of nuclear installations Mike Weightman traveled to Japan as the lead of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expert mission. The main finding of this mission, as reported to the IAEA ministerial conference that month, was that risks associated with tsunamis in several sites in Japan had been underestimated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grimes|first1=Robin|title=The UK Response to Fukushima and Anglo-Japanese Relations|journal=Science & Diplomacy|date=16 June 2014|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2014/uk-response-fukushima-and-anglo-japanese-relations}}</ref>

In September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster "caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power".<ref name="IAEA sees slow nuclear growth post Japan"/><ref name="lesechos"/> Following the disaster, it was reported in ''The Economist'' that the IAEA halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.<ref name="economist-20110428"/>

In the aftermath, Germany accelerated plans to close its [[nuclear power]] reactors and decided to phase the rest out by 2022<ref name="Merkel se despide de lo nuclear y anuncia una revolución en renovables"/> (see also [[Nuclear power in Germany]]). Italy held a national referendum, in which 94 percent voted against the government's plan to build new nuclear power plants.<ref name="Italy nuclear: Berlusconi accepts referendum blow"/> In France, President Hollande announced the intention of the government to reduce nuclear usage by one third. So far, however, the government has only earmarked one power station for closure – the aging plant at Fessenheim on the German border – which prompted some to question the government's commitment to Hollande's promise. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is on record as saying that Fessenheim will be the only nuclear power station to close. On a visit to China in December 2014 he reassured his audience that nuclear energy was a "sector of the future" and would continue to contribute "at least 50%" of France's electricity output.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25674581|title=France struggles to cut down on nuclear power|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=12 June 2015|date=11 January 2014|last1=Broomby|first1=Rob}}</ref> Another member of Hollande's Socialist Party, the MP [[Christian Bataille]], said that Hollande announced the nuclear curb to secure the backing of his Green coalition partners in parliament.<ref name="France struggles to cut down on nuclear power"/>

Nuclear power plans were not abandoned in Malaysia, the Philippines, Kuwait, and Bahrain, or radically changed, as in Taiwan. China suspended its nuclear development program briefly, but restarted it shortly afterwards. The initial plan had been to increase the nuclear contribution from 2 to 4 percent of electricity by 2020, with an escalating program after that. [[Renewable energy]] supplies 17 percent of China's electricity, 16% of which is [[hydroelectricity]]. China plans to triple its nuclear energy output to 2020, and triple it again between 2020 and 2030.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/country-profiles/countries-a-f/china--nuclear-power/|title=China Nuclear Power – Chinese Nuclear Energy|access-date=12 June 2015}}</ref>

===Investigations===
Three investigations into the Fukushima disaster showed the man-made nature of the catastrophe and its roots in [[regulatory capture]] associated with a "network of corruption, collusion, and nepotism."<ref name="After Fukushima: A Survey of Corruption in the Global Nuclear Power Industry"/><ref name=king12/> A New York Times report alleged that the Japanese nuclear regulatory system consistently sided with, and promoted, the nuclear industry based on the concept of [[amakudari]] ('descent from heaven'), in which senior regulators accepted high paying jobs at companies they once oversaw. <ref name="nytimes23"/>

In August 2011, several top energy officials were fired by the Japanese government; affected positions included the Vice-minister for [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|Economy, Trade and Industry]]; the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy.<ref name="Japan to fire 3 top nuclear officials – CNN"/>

====NAIIC====
{{Main|National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission}}
The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) was the first independent investigation commission by the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]] in the 66-year history of Japan's constitutional government.

Fukushima "cannot be regarded as a natural disaster," the NAIIC panel's chairman, Tokyo University professor emeritus [[Kiyoshi Kurokawa]], wrote in the inquiry report. "It was a profoundly man-made disaster – that could and should have been foreseen and prevented. And its effects could have been mitigated by a more effective human response."<ref name="Bloomberg20120705"/> "Governments, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power [TEPCO] lacked a sense of responsibility to protect people's lives and society," the Commission said. "They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents.<ref name="AlJaz20120705"/>

The Commission recognized that the affected residents were still struggling and facing grave concerns, including the "health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment".

====Investigation Committee====
{{Main|Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company}}
The purpose of the [[Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company|Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations]] (ICANPS) was to identify the disaster's causes and propose policies designed to minimize the damage and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.<ref name="Official website of the Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company"/> The 10 member, government-appointed panel included scholars, journalists, lawyers, and engineers.<ref name="AlJaz20120723"/><ref name="NTI20120723"/> It was supported by public prosecutors and government experts.<ref name="WSJ20120723"/> and released its final, 448-page<ref name="BBW20120723"/> investigation report on 23 July 2012.<ref name="Asahi20120723"/><ref name="CNN20120723"/>

The panel's report faulted an inadequate legal system for nuclear crisis management, a crisis-command disarray caused by the government and TEPCO, and possible excess meddling on the part of the Prime Minister's office in the crisis' early stage.<ref name="JapanTimes20120724"/> The panel concluded that a culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management led to the nuclear disaster.<ref name="AlJaz20120723"/>

The density is 160,000 times that of the legal limit for release into the ocean, and it is about 1,000 times that of the highest density in the groundwater that had been measured so far (5,100 Bq/L). TEPCO didn't disclose the result of measurement of strontium alone, as the company believed there was a possibility that the result of measurement was wrong. As to this particular sample, TEPCO had announced on July last year that the sample had contained 900,000 Bq/L of all-beta including strontium. On February 6, TEPCO explained that they had "underestimated all of the results of high-density all-beta, which exceeded the upper limit of measurement." This particular sample may contain about 10 million Bq/L of all-beta, according to TEPCO. The company recently switched to a different method of analysis that uses diluted samples when the density of radioactive materials is high.}}</ref>
