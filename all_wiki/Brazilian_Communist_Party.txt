The '''Brazilian Communist Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Comunista Brasileiro}}), originally '''Communist Party of Brazil''' (''Partido Comunista do Brazil''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uniaoreconstrucaocomunista.blogspot.com/2013/08/desenvolvimento-da-luta-revolucionaria-exige-nova-postura-dos-comunistas.html|title=URC: "O desenvolvimento da luta revolucionária exige uma nova postura dos comunistas"|date=9 August 2013|publisher=}}</ref> is a [[political party]] in [[Brazil]] founded in 1922 which makes the disputed claim of being the oldest political party still active in the nation. It played an important role in the country's 20th-century history despite the relatively small number of members.[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1975/no076/newsinger.htm] A factional dispute led to the formation of [[Communist Party of Brazil|PCdoB]] (Communist Party of Brazil) in the 1960s, though both communist parties were united in opposition to the [[Brazilian military government]] that ruled from 1964 to 1985. But with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall]] of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]] of [[communism]] circa 1990, the party lost power and international support. An internal coup in 1992 divided the party and formed a new party, called [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]], using the former identification number of the PCB, 23. This party has since moved towards the centre and now goes by the name [[Cidadania]].

The youth wing of PCB is known as Young Communist Union.

==History==
===Foundation===
The '''Brazilian Communist Party''' (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Partido Comunista Brasileiro''), abbreviated as the '''PCB''', was founded on March 25, 1922 in the [[city]] of [[Niterói]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. On that day, nine representatives of [[communism|communist]] groups from the cities of [[São Paulo]], [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], [[Cruzeiro, São Paulo|Cruzeiro]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Recife]], [[Niterói]], [[Juiz de Fora]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] met and approved the party's statutes and the twenty-one conditions for entering the [[Communist International]], though the PCB was not recognized by the Comintern in its first years due to its eclectic ideological roots. The meeting ended with all seventy-three members of the party singing [[The Internationale|L'Internationale]] (quietly, to avoid being overheard).

===Early years===
The PCB's first years were marked by an effort to encourage socialist thinking in [[Brazil]]. There had been moderate socialist parties, newspapers and congresses, but much unlike the strong social-democratic parties that existed in many European countries. The radical anti-[[capitalism|capitalist]] thinking had been dominated by [[Anarchism in Brazil|anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists]], who also dominated the [[labour movement]], such as in the case of the [[Anarchism in Brazil|1917 anarchist actions]] in São Paulo. Inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], a group of former anarchist militants who were disappointed in the lack of unity and force of the movement, turned communist and started the PCB. At the same time, some other figures from Brazil's early labour- and socialist movements became inspired by forms of military and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[populism]], like the [[Tenente revolts|tenentes]], that eventually led to the [[Getúlio Vargas|Vargas]]-revolution of 1930.

During the first years, the party was declared illegal by the [[Federal government of Brazil|government]]. On May 1, 1925, during the party's Second Congress, its weekly [[newspaper]] ''A Classe Operária'' (''The Working Class'') was announced, with five thousand copies being sold on the factories. This number grew to nine hundred copies by the ninth edition, but the [[police]] shut the newspaper down shortly after the twelfth edition was published. The paper reappeared in 1928, after the Third Congress was held.

By 1930, after being recognized by the Communist International and with its [[Socialist Youth (Brazil)|Socialist Youth]] division formed, the PCB had nearly eleven hundred members. This marks the beginning of a long period of submission to, initially the [[Communist International|Third International]], and, after its dissolution, to the political leadership of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. This [[decade]] also marked two cycles on the party's history: one of increasing influence, until 1935, and one of decline, until 1942. Both cycles are comprehensible when seen in the context of the [[Getúlio Vargas|Vargas]] era.

===Reorganization and growth===
On 1943, during the so-called ''Mantiqueira Conference'', the party secretly met in the small [[city]] of Engenheiro Passos, Rio de Janeiro, and in an open [[Letter (message)|letter]] to Vargas decided to support a [[declaration of war]] on the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. At the same time, [[Luís Carlos Prestes]] was elected to the party's [[presidency]]. On 1945, after Vargas's [[dictatorship]] ended, the PCB became legal once again. By 1947, it had nearly two hundred thousand members. In the 1947 legislative election, it received 480 thousand votes or about 9% of total votes cast. However, this period of official tolerance did not last long, as President [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra|Dutra]] denounced the PCB as "internationalist, and therefore not committed to Brazil's own interests" in 1948, an action supported by the [[United States|American]] government.

In the 1950s, as the party was driven underground, it began supporting major workers' [[Strike action|strikes]] around Brazil. However, this did not prevent the beginning of internal clashes between different factions within the PCB. This became more evident after the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]'s [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Congress]], when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced [[Joseph Stalin]]'s policies. The factionalization of the party accelerated after a new Manifesto was passed in 1958, proposing new ways of achieving communist goals. This Manifesto linked the establishment of [[socialism]] to the broadening of democracy. Some of its top leaders, dissatisfied with the new Soviet line, quit the PCB and formed a new party, [[Communist Party of Brazil]] (''Partido Comunista do Brasil'' - PCdoB) in 1962.

In the mid-1960s the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] estimated the number of organized communists in Brazil to around 31,000.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]'', in The [[American Political Science Review]], Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 122.</ref>

===Military rule years===
With this new orientation, the PCB grew in size and exercised a much greater role in the Brazilian left. However, the alliance forged with the other parties did not survive the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]]. PCB did play an important role against the dictatorship, by organizing the workers movement and participating in efforts to unite the opposition in its demands for democratic reforms. At that point in time the communists were a fraction of the democratic opposition front, the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB). It refused, for example, to engage in armed struggle, differently from other left wing organizations that decided to follow that path. The clandestine operations and the political disputes regarding the strategies to resist the military regime led to many important leaders leaving the party, while many others died in the hands of the military regime. To the end of the dictatorship, while the Communist Party in Brazil was involved in several internal clashes, the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]] (Partido dos Trabalhadores) was founded. Its creation was the project of a series of left wing groups independent from the PCB ([[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], communist dissidents, ex-[[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], sectors of the Catholic Left, independent unionists and intellectuals). It was structured as an alternative to Communist-led unionism in Brazil. Forswearing the Popular Front strategy adopted by the PCB, the PT chose instead to take a more radical stance against the military regime and gained a strong presence in between high skilled workers and middle-class intellectuals. The growth of the PT accelerated the fragmentation process inside the PCB leading ultimately to a big split.

===Crisis and formation of the PPS===
After the 1979 amnesty, the PCB's leaders began to restructure the party. The 1982 Congress confirmed its democratic agenda, declaring the PCB "a party of the masses, linking socialist goals to true democracy, which will be constructed based on the values of [[Political freedom|freedom]]". Once again, internal clashes developed in the party, as it was passing through a process of renewal while its influence in society declined. The fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] was also a strong blow to the party, turning the renewal process into one where [[Marxism]] began to be abandoned by party leaders. This crisis reached its high point in January 1992.

A group led by the then-President [[Roberto Freire (politician)|Roberto Freire]] called its 10th Congress despite a Congressional resolution which had been passed a year earlier that the party would not call a congress for that year and that determined that the party would be kept. Nevertheless, Freire managed to organize it and allow people who were not members of the party to vote.  That congress voted to dissolve the PCB and refound it as the [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]] (''Partido Popular Socialista'' - PPS), in a way similar to what had transpired in Italy.

However a small group, led by Ivan Pinheiro, questioning the legality of the 10th Congress, decided to keep the party [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]].

===Refoundation and reorganization===
After the dissolution of the PCB, decided by the 10th Congress, the Central Committee minority that was opposed to this action organized an "Extraordinary Reorganization Conference", where it decided to rebuild the party with the maintaining of its identity and by reviewing the path that it had followed in the precedent years. The party then started a battle in order to gain the rights to use the name Brazilian Communist Party and the acronym PCB (which was contested by the members of the PPS) and to legalize the party. In 1996, the PCB would be officially registered.

The Party has realized four congresses since then: the 10th (1993), 11th (1996), 12th (2000) and the 13th (2006). It remains small, in spite of some recent growth during the government of [[Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]] and the crisis of [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]] (it should be noticed that the main result of this process was the [[Socialism and Liberty Party]]). Although competing in elections and participating in wider electoral fronts, its electoral results were insignificant.

In 2006, the PCB agreed on a nationwide alliance with two other left-wing parties, [[Socialism and Liberty Party|PSOL]] and [[United Socialist Workers' Party|PSTU]]. Putting aside some significant ideological differences, the three parties built a common agenda to try to break the polarity between presidential candidates [[Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]] ([[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]]) and [[Geraldo Alckmin]] ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]]). The coalition also extended to gubernatorial and parliament elections to take place at the same time all over the country.
The PCB elected a state deputy (Jorge Souza, in the state of [[Amapá]]) and has about 20 local representatives.

The party's union branch currently builds the central Intersindical and is growing greatly in the union movement. The student movement is responsibility of the Young Communist Union, which is also growing in size.

The last party's Congress, the 13th, in 2005, voted to abolish the post of "president" and use only the traditional position of "secretary-general".
