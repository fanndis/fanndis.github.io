"'''Wildest Dreams'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fifth studio album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]''. Swift wrote the song with its producers [[Max Martin]] and [[shellback (record producer)|Shellback]]. "Wildest Dreams" is a [[synth-pop]] and [[dream pop]] [[power ballad]] that incorporates an atmospheric production equipped with [[string instruments]] and Swift's heartbeat as its beat. The lyrics describe Swift's plea for her lover to remember her despite the inevitable end of their relationship. The song was released to radio stations as the album's fifth single on August 31, 2015, by [[Big Machine Records|Big Machine]] and [[Republic Records]].

Contemporary critics received "Wildest Dreams" with moderate reviews; some praised Swift's vocals and the production, while others considered it unoriginal. Retrospectively, critics have positively viewed the song as one of Swift's better songs in her catalog. The single peaked within the top five on record charts of Australia, Canada, Poland and South Africa. In the United States, it was ''1989''{{'s}} fifth consecutive top-ten hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], reaching number five, and peaked atop ''Billboard'' airplay-focused charts including [[Mainstream Top 40]] and [[Adult Top 40]]. It was [[RIAA certifications|certified four times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and had sold over two million copies in the United States by November 2017.

The song's music video, directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], attracted criticism for glorifying [[colonialism]], a claim that Kahn dismissed. Set in Africa during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] era of the 1950s, it depicts Swift as a brunette actress who falls in love with her co-star on set, and later realizes their inevitable end upon completion of their film project. The video was well received in terms of production and styling. Swift donated all proceeds from the video to the [[African Parks|African Parks Foundation of America]].

According to Kahn, the video is based on classic Hollywood romances like [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Richard Burton]], as well as classic films such as ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985) and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/02/436967742/the-director-of-the-taylor-swift-video-defends-his-work|title=Director of Taylor Swift's New Video Defends His Work|publisher=NPR|date=September 2, 2015|accessdate=September 3, 2015|archive-date=September 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904002805/http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/02/436967742/the-director-of-the-taylor-swift-video-defends-his-work|url-status=live}}</ref> Set in Africa during the [[classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] era of the 1950s, the video follows the story of Marjorie Finn (Swift), a brunette actress shooting a romantic adventure film, ''Wildest Dreams'' (a reference to the 1985 film ''Out of Africa''), with co-star Robert Kingsley (Eastwood).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2256036/taylor-swift-wildest-dreams-video/|title=Taylor Swift's 'Wildest Dreams' Video Is Here To Make You Cry|author=Emilee Linder|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=August 30, 2015|accessdate=September 1, 2015|archive-date=August 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831105531/http://www.mtv.com/news/2256036/taylor-swift-wildest-dreams-video/|url-status=live}}</ref> The video is interspersed with shots of African wildlife and natural scenery, including a cascading waterfall and Swift lounging with a lion. Finn and Kingsley fall in love, but after a fight on set, the romance ends. At the premiere of ''Wildest Dreams'' in the United States, Finn sees her co-star, Kingsley, with his wife. Finn is visibly upset but tries to act nonchalant. As they both watch the film, Finn flees the premiere and gets into a waiting limousine. The video ends with a shot of the limousine's side-mirror showing Kingsley running into the street and watching as the car drives away.

Two different [[biplanes]] were used in the video.

===Reception and criticism===
Media outlets praised the video's production. ''Slate''{{'s}} Forrest Whickman found that the video was "a lot more engaging" and that "it does a good job matching the song's theme of lingering on with someone 'even if it's just pretend'."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whickman|first1=Forrest|title=Watch Taylor Swift Go Classical Hollywood With the Video for 'Wildest Dreams'|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/08/30/taylor_swift_wildest_dreams_music_video_debuts_during_mtv_vmas_video.html|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=September 2, 2015|date=August 30, 2015|archive-date=September 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902220801/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/08/30/taylor_swift_wildest_dreams_music_video_debuts_during_mtv_vmas_video.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Mike Wass of ''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'' called the video "a much stronger effort" than Swift's previous videos and likened it to romance films ''Out of Africa'', ''The English Patient'' and ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]'' (2004).

The video attracted criticism, with allegations of glorifying [[colonisation of Africa|colonialism]] due to featuring a mainly white cast in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/02/taylor-swift-accused-racism-african-colonial-fantasy-video-wildest-dreams|title=Taylor Swift accused of racism in 'African colonial fantasy' video|first=Nadia|last=Khomami|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 2, 2015|accessdate=November 21, 2020}}</ref> Writing for [[NPR]], Viviane Rutabingwa and James Kassaga Arinaitwe criticized the video for "present[ing] a glamorous version of the white colonial fantasy of Africa" and ignoring the brutality of colonialism.
