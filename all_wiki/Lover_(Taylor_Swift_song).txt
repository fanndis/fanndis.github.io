"'''Lover'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], taken from [[Lover (album)|her seventh studio album of the same name]] (2019). It was released on August 16, 2019, through [[Republic Records]], as the third single from the album. Inspired by Swift moving-in with her romantic partner, the song puts a spin on [[marriage vows]] and sees the singer deliver intimate lyrics exhibiting devotion. "Lover" is a [[Indie folk|indie-folk]] [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]] and [[Country music|country]] [[waltz]] that takes cues from vintage [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Torch song|torch songs]], built around a slow tempo, [[Bass guitar|bass]] [[riff]], booming [[Snare drum|snare]] and acoustic instrumentals. The song received universal acclaim from music critics, who praised its nostalgic quality and whimsical lyricism.

"Lover" reached top-ten postions in many territories worldwide. On the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], it peaked at number ten, becoming the album's third consecutive top-ten single in the United States. The song entered the top-five in Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore, and the top-ten in Canada and Ireland. Its music video premiered on August 22, 2019, and was directed by Swift and Drew Kirsch, featuring dancer Christian Owens as Swift's love interest. The video adopts a [[Christmas]] aesthetic, and follows a couple living inside a [[dollhouse]]—that has seven distinctly colored rooms—located inside a [[snow globe]]. Swift debuted the song live at the [[2019 MTV Video Music Awards]].

On November 13, 2019, Swift released a [[duet]] remix of the song, featuring Canadian singer [[Shawn Mendes]]. On November 26, 2019, Swift released a second remix with a reworked [[Orchestra|orchestral arrangement]], titled "First Dance Remix". Both remixes received positive reviews from music critics. A live version of the song, recorded at Swift's 2019 one-off [[Lover (album)#City of Lover concert|''City of Lover'' concert]] in Paris, was released on May 17, 2020, following the premiere of the concert film on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. "Lover" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], and scored two nominations at the [[2020 MTV Video Music Awards]]: [[Best Pop Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]]. "Lover" was named one of the best songs of 2019 by several publications.

{{Quote|quote= I was sitting up at the piano up in my loft, and I had the chorus. It just kind of happened immediately. It was one of those ones that I wrote very very, very quickly. And I was working out the cadence of the first verse and it just sort of fell together. But then I took some time to write the bridge because I wanted to really level up with that bridge. That one would for me would be less of a ranting bridge and more of a story-time fable type bridge. Sometimes I like to imagine a bridge as like a sort of fairy-tale lullaby fable expanding upon a song that has been not as detailed until that point. "Can I go where you go/ Can we always be this close forever and ever" is less detail, then when you go to the bridge and you realize like, oh, it just got really personal in the bridge.

In 2020, Swift detailed the inspiration behind the song, stating that the song is about "two people choosing to spend their life together" and "making their own traditions", and that she designed the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] to sound "like when people write their own vows and how they change the traditional part to fit their relationships".<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2020|title=Taylor Swift finally shares inspiration behind 'Lover'|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/news/taylor-swift-lover-boyfriend-joe-alwyn/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 14, 2020|website=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]|language=en}}</ref> She further explained:

==Critical reception==
"Lover" received acclaim from music critics for its songwriting and retro sensibility. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Jason Lipshutz called it the "song you should slow-dance to with your partner this weekend", and also said it "effectively transmits its romantic signals by putting the songwriting of Swift&nbsp;– a masterful writer who gets the solo credit here&nbsp;– front and center".<ref name="BBJL">{{cite web |last=Lipshutz |first=Jason |title=First Stream: New Music From Normani, Taylor Swift, Young Thug, Miley Cyrus & More |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8527595/first-stream-normani-taylor-swift-young-thug-miley-cyrus |website=Billboard |accessdate=August 16, 2019 |date=August 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816152906/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8527595/first-stream-normani-taylor-swift-young-thug-miley-cyrus |archive-date=August 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Louise Bruton of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' said the song "is the grand gesture that proves that all the heartache she's sung about" in the past "was worth it", and that it "has [[Autumn|autumnal]] vibes stamped all over it".<ref name="IrishTimes"/> Writing for ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', Constance Grady called the song "a welcome reminder of what made Swift such an unstoppable force when she first emerged onto the music scene".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/16/20808670/taylor-swift-lover-single|title=With 'Lover,' Taylor Swift shows she can still write a perfect love song|last=Grady|first=Constance|date=August 16, 2019|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|accessdate=August 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816185901/https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/16/20808670/taylor-swift-lover-single|archive-date=August 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[BuzzFeed News]]''{{'}} Ellie Bate wrote that "Lover" is "a [[love letter]] to a person you want to be with forever", describing the bridge as "[[Marriage vows|wedding vows]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-lover-single-easter-eggs|title=Taylor Swift Just Dropped Her New Song, 'Lover' – Here Are All The Clues We Missed|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=[[BuzzFeed News]]|accessdate=August 16, 2019|date=August 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816180306/https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-lover-single-easter-eggs|archive-date=August 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Jay Willis of ''[[GQ]]'' predicted the song would be a popular choice for [[First dance|first dances at weddings]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-1989-perfected-the-pop-crossover-album|title=Taylor Swift's 1989 Perfected the Pop Crossover Album|last=Willis|first=Jay|magazine=[[GQ]]|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 26, 2019|archive-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026025859/https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-1989-perfected-the-pop-crossover-album|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'s}} Nora Princiotti called the song a "[[waltz]] with a stellar bridge" that "notably pairs themes of loving bliss with ownership".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2019/08/23/lover-taylor-swift-shuns-drama-for-satisfying-pop/WLYpcg7UNeNXgiVBulMEmM/story.html|title=On 'Lover,' Taylor Swift shuns drama for satisfying pop|last=Princiotti|first=Nora|date=August 23, 2019|website=The Boston Globe|access-date=April 17, 2020|archive-date=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829173138/https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2019/08/23/lover-taylor-swift-shuns-drama-for-satisfying-pop/WLYpcg7UNeNXgiVBulMEmM/story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Critical reception====
The remix was met with positive reviews. Brittany Vincent of [[MTV]] called the remix "a beautiful anthem that expands upon the original, with Shawn giving it his own flavor, complete with rewritten lyrics and plenty of falsetto. It was already a warm and cozy love song, but it's been beefed up considerably into something transcendentally romantic."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3145745/taylor-swift-lover-remix/|title=Taylor Swift and Shawn Mendes's 'Lover' Remix Is Valentine's Day In A Song|last=Vincent|first=Brittany|website=[[MTV News]]|language=en|date=November 13, 2019|access-date=November 13, 2019|archive-date=November 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113194120/http://www.mtv.com/news/3145745/taylor-swift-lover-remix/|url-status=live}}</ref> Jael Goldfine of ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' wrote that Mendes "brings the song's sugar factor up to about a million" and that the song manages to be both "enjoyable and cloying".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.papermag.com/taylor-swift-shawn-mendes-lover-2641329292.html|title=Shawn Mendes Cosplays as Taylor Swift's 'Lover' On Remix|last=Goldfine|first=Jael|date=November 13, 2019|website=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|language=en|access-date=November 13, 2019|archive-date=November 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114014346/https://www.papermag.com/taylor-swift-shawn-mendes-lover-2641329292.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Hannah Yasharoff of ''[[USA Today]]'' praised the duo's remix, stating that they "breathed new life into Swift's romantic seventh album title track, transforming her ballad into a duet with fresh verses and harmonies that'll have fans falling in love all over again".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/13/taylor-swift-shawn-mendes-lover-remix-surprises-new-lyrics/4178470002/|title='I won't let you fall': Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes debut dreamy new lyrics in 'Lover' remix|last=Yasharoff|first=Hannah|date=November 13, 2019|website=USA Today|access-date=2019-11-14|archive-date=November 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114184829/https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/13/taylor-swift-shawn-mendes-lover-remix-surprises-new-lyrics/4178470002/|url-status=live}}</ref>
