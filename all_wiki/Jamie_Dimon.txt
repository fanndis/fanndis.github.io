== Early life and education ==
Dimon was born in New York City, one of three sons of Greek immigrants Theodore and Themis (née Kalos) Dimon,<ref>{{Cite news|title=10 facts about Jamie Dimon|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76269.html|date=May 14, 2012|first=MJ|last=Lee|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=June 14, 2012|archive-date=June 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618130040/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76269.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and attended The [[Browning School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Class of 1938 Alumnus Achievement Award|url=http://www.browning.edu/alumnus-achievement-award|publisher=[[The Browning School]]|access-date=June 14, 2012|archive-date=June 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614105955/http://www.browning.edu/alumnus-achievement-award|url-status=live}}</ref> His paternal grandfather was a Greek immigrant who changed the family name from Papademetriou to Dimon to make it sound more French,<ref>{{Cite news|title=The secret to Jamie Dimon's luster|url=http://archive.fortune.com/2009/09/21/news/companies/review_dimon_mcdonald.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2009092210|date=September 22, 2009|first=Jia-Lynn|last=Yang|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|access-date=May 30, 2015|archive-date=January 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108050319/http://archive.fortune.com/2009/09/21/news/companies/review_dimon_mcdonald.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2009092210|url-status=live}}</ref> and worked as a banker in [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]) and [[Athens]]. He has an older brother, Peter, and a fraternal twin brother, Ted. Dimon's father and grandfather were both stockbrokers at [[Shearson]].<ref>Langley, Monica. ''Tearing Down the Walls: How Sandy Weill Fought His Way to the Top of the Financial World ... and then Nearly Lost it All''. Simon & Schuster, 2003, p. 50</ref>

He majored in psychology and economics at [[Tufts University]], where he graduated summa cum laude. At Tufts, Dimon wrote an essay on Shearson mergers; his mother sent the paper to [[Sandy Weill]], who hired Dimon to work at Shearson doing budgets during one summer break.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1fq6yftgm9nrv/the-bankers-that-define-the-decades-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase|title=The bankers that define the decades: Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase|publisher=Euromoney|date=10 June 2019|access-date=14 June 2019|archive-date=10 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610204624/https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1fq6yftgm9nrv/the-bankers-that-define-the-decades-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase|url-status=live}}</ref>

After graduating, he worked in management consulting for two years before enrolling at [[Harvard Business School]], along with classmates [[Jeff Immelt]], [[Steve Burke (businessman)|Steve Burke]], [[Stephen Mandel (hedge fund manager)|Stephen Mandel]], and [[Seth Klarman]]. During the summer at Harvard, he worked at [[Goldman Sachs]]. He graduated in 1982, earning an MBA as a [[Harvard Business School|Baker Scholar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/orgchart/board/dimon.html|title=Jamie Dimon|publisher=newyorkfed.org|date=1 December 2015|access-date=1 December 2015|archive-date=8 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208125444/https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/orgchart/board/dimon.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

After graduation from Harvard Business School, [[Sandy Weill]] convinced him to turn down offers from [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]], and [[Lehman Brothers]] to join him as an assistant at [[American Express]].<ref>Langley, Monica.

== Career ==

=== Commercial Credit and Transition into Citigroup===
Sandy Weill left American Express in 1985 and Dimon followed him. The two then took over [[Primerica|Commercial Credit]], a [[consumer finance]] company, from [[Control Data]]. At 30 years of age, Dimon served as the [[chief financial officer]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1fq6yftgm9nrv/the-bankers-that-define-the-decades-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase | work=Euromoney | title=The bankers that define the decades: Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase | date=June 10, 2019 | access-date=June 14, 2019 | archive-date=June 10, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610204624/https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1fq6yftgm9nrv/the-bankers-that-define-the-decades-jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-chase | url-status=live }}</ref> helping to turn the company around. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, in 1998 Dimon and Weill were able to form a large financial services conglomerate, [[Citigroup]]. Dimon left Citigroup in November 1998, after being asked to resign by Weill during a weekend executive retreat.<ref>Langley, Monica. ''Tearing Down the Walls: How Sandy Weill Fought His Way to the Top of the Financial World ... and then Nearly Lost it All''. Simon & Schuster, 2003, p.321</ref> It was rumored at the time that he and Weill argued in 1997 over Dimon's not promoting Weill's daughter, Jessica M.

=== Move to J.P. Morgan ===
[[File:MacriDimon.jpg|thumb|Interview of Dimon with president of Argentina [[Mauricio Macri]], to announce higher investments of JP Morgan Chase in the country.]]
In March 2000, Dimon became CEO of [[Bank One]], the nation's fifth largest bank.<ref>[[Rakesh Khurana]], ''Searching for a Corporate Savior: The Irrational Quest for Charismatic CEOs'' (Princeton University Press, 2002)</ref> When [[JPMorgan Chase]] purchased Bank One in July 2004, Dimon became president and chief operating officer of the combined company.

On December 31, 2005, he was named CEO of JPMorgan Chase and on December 31, 2006, he was named Chairman and President.<ref>{{cite web|title=Board Member Bios|url=http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/board-of-directors.htm#dimon|publisher=JPMorgan Chase|access-date=2011-06-07|archive-date=2016-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105073827/https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/board-of-directors.htm#dimon|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2008 he was a Class A board member of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]. Under Dimon's leadership, with the acquisitions during his tenure, JPMorgan Chase has become the leading U.S. bank in domestic assets under management, market capitalization value, and publicly traded stock value. In 2009, Dimon was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/22/top-gun-CEOs--intelligent-investing-survey.html.php |title=The Market's Best Managers - Forbes.com |website=Archive.is |access-date=2016-02-02 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731070440/http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/22/top-gun-CEOs--intelligent-investing-survey.html.php |archive-date=2012-07-31 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS148914+10-Jun-2009+MW20090610.php]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118203820/https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS148914%2B10-Jun-2009%2BMW20090610.php|date=January 18, 2016}}</ref>

On September 26, 2011, Dimon was involved in a high-profile heated exchange with [[Mark Carney]], the governor of the [[Bank of Canada]], in which Dimon said provisions of the [[Basel III]] international financial regulations discriminate against U.S. banks and are "anti-American".<ref>{{cite web|last=Braithwaite |first=Tom |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b62779c6-e7a4-11e0-9da3-00144feab49a.html |title=Dimon in attack on Canada's bank chief |website=FT.com |date=2011-09-26 |access-date=2016-02-02}}</ref> On May 10, 2012, JPMorgan Chase initiated an emergency conference call to report a loss of at least $2 billion in trades that Dimon said were "designed to hedge the bank's overall credit risks". The strategy was, in Dimon's words, "flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored".<ref>{{cite web |author=A |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/05/14/998601/two-billion-dollar-hedge/ |title=Two billion dollar 'hedge' &#124; FT Alphaville |website=Ftalphaville.ft.com |date=2012-05-14 |access-date=2016-02-02 |archive-date=2012-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911005731/http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/05/14/998601/two-billion-dollar-hedge/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The episode was investigated by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the FBI and the central actor was labelled with the epithet the [[2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss|London Whale]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2012/05/15/more-bad-news-for-jpm-as-fbi-gets-involved/ |title=More Bad News For JPMorgan As FBI Gets Involved |website=Forbes.com |access-date=2016-02-02 |archive-date=2016-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108050319/http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2012/05/15/more-bad-news-for-jpm-as-fbi-gets-involved/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Dimon commented on the [[Volcker Rule]] in January 2012, "Part of the Volcker Rule I agreed with, which is no prop trading. But market making is an essential function. And the public should recognize that we have the widest, the deepest, the most transparent capital markets in the world. And part of that is because we have enormous market making. If the rules were written as they originally came out; I suspect they'll be changed, it would really make it hard to be a market maker in the United States."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gurufocus.com/news/159099/interview--jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-on-regulation-volcker-rule-some-of-the-global-regulations-are-unamerican |title=Interview – JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on Regulation, Volcker Rule; Some of the Global Regulations Are "Un-American" |website=GuruFocus.com |access-date=2016-02-02 |archive-date=2016-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108050319/http://www.gurufocus.com/news/159099/interview--jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-on-regulation-volcker-rule-some-of-the-global-regulations-are-unamerican |url-status=live }}</ref>  He served as chairman of the executive committee of [[The Business Council]] for 2011 and 2012.<ref name="committee">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebusinesscouncil.org/about/excommittee.aspx |title=Executive Committee 2015–2016 |publisher=The Business Council |access-date=2016-02-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721074619/http://www.thebusinesscouncil.org/about/excommittee.aspx |archive-date=2013-07-21 }}</ref>

On January 24, 2014, it was announced that Dimon would receive $20 million for his work in 2013, a year of record profits and stock price under Dimon's reign, despite significant losses that year due to scandals and payments of fines. The award was a 74% raise, which included over $18 million in restricted stock. This is despite the recent $13 billion settlement with the US government, the largest in history, for bad mortgages and practices during the financial crisis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reuters |title=JPMorgan agrees $13 billion settlement with U.S. over bad mortgages |date=November 19, 2013}}</ref> [[Forbes]] reported that, in a statement following news of Dimon's compensation, the bank said, "Under Mr. Dimon's stewardship, the Company has fortified its control infrastructure and processes and strengthened each of its key businesses while continuing to focus on strengthening the Company's leadership capabilities across all levels."<ref name="Touryalai">{{cite magazine|last=Touryalai|first=Halah|date=January 24, 2014|title=Jamie Dimon Gets $20 Million For His Worst Year As CEO, Why The Big Raise?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2014/01/24/jamie-dimon-gets-20-million-for-his-worst-year-as-ceo-why-the-big-raise/|magazine=Forbes|access-date=September 1, 2017|archive-date=August 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805230238/https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2014/01/24/jamie-dimon-gets-20-million-for-his-worst-year-as-ceo-why-the-big-raise/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Federal TARP funds ===

JPMorgan Chase was arguably the healthiest of the nine largest U.S. banks and did not need to take TARP funds. In order to encourage smaller banks with troubled assets to accept this money, Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] allegedly coerced the CEOs of the nine largest banks to accept TARP money under short notice.<ref name="Documents Reveal How Paulson Forced Banks To Take TARP Cash">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/uncovered-tarp-docs-reveal-how-paulson-forced-banks-to-take-the-cash-2009-5 |title=Uncovered TARP Docs Reveal How Paulson Forced Bankers To Take Cash |website=Business Insider |date=2009-05-13 |access-date=2016-02-02 |archive-date=2016-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108050319/http://www.businessinsider.com/uncovered-tarp-docs-reveal-how-paulson-forced-banks-to-take-the-cash-2009-5 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After Obama won the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], there was speculation that Dimon would serve in the [[Obama Administration]] as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]].

Following the acquisition of [[Washington Mutual]] by JPMorgan Chase, Obama commented on Dimon's handling of the real-estate crash, credit crisis, and the banking collapse affecting corporations nationwide, including major financial institutions like [[Bank of America]], [[Citibank]], and [[Wachovia]] (later acquired by [[Wells Fargo]]).

On the May 15, 2012, episode of ABC's ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', Obama responded to a question from [[Whoopi Goldberg]] regarding JPMorgan Chase's recently publicized $2 billion trading losses by defending Dimon against allegations of irresponsibility, saying, "first of all, JP Morgan is one of the best managed banks there is. Jamie Dimon, the head of it, is one of the smartest bankers we've got", but added, "it's going to be investigated".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/watch/the-view/SH559080/VD55202933/the-view-515|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701143038/http://abc.go.com/watch/the-view/SH559080/VD55202933/the-view-515|url-status=dead|title=The View - Watch Full TV Episodes Online - ABC.com|date=1 July 2012|archive-date=1 July 2012|website=archive.is}}</ref>

=== London Whale ===
In the case of the [[2012 JPMorgan Chase trading loss]], according to a US Senate report published in March 2013 after 9 months of investigation,<ref name="Investigations Committee">{{cite book |url=http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/rJ5Q_k_NsIk8 | title=Jpmorgan Chase Whale Trades: A Case History of Derivatives Risks and Abuses | publisher=Majority And Minority Staff Report, [[United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], [[Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] | author=[[Carl Levin]], [[John McCain]] | date=March 14, 2013 | page=307 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031174900/http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/rJ5Q_k_NsIk8 | archive-date=October 31, 2013 }}</ref> Dimon misled investors and regulators in April as losses rose dangerously to $6.2 billion on a "monstrous" derivatives bet made by the so-called "London Whale" [[Bruno Iksil]]. According to [[Carl Levin]], chairman of this panel, JP Morgan had "a trading operation that piled on risk, ignored limits on risk taking, hid losses, dodged oversight and misinformed the public". Dimon dismissed press accounts of possible losses in Iksil's book as a "tempest in a teapot" on April 13, 2012 when he knew that Iksil had already lost $1 billion, which led Levin to say "None of those statements made on April 13 to the public, to investors, to analysts were true,"  and "The bank also neglected to disclose on that day that the portfolio had massive positions that were hard to exit, that they were violating in massive numbers key risk limits."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-14/jpmorgan-misled-investors-dodged-regulators-senate-report-says.html|title=JPMorgan Report Piles Pressure on Dimon in Too-Big Debate|last=Kopecki|first=Dawn|date=16 March 2013|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|access-date=16 March 2013|url-access=subscription|archive-date=17 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317233621/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-14/jpmorgan-misled-investors-dodged-regulators-senate-report-says.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-14/jpmorgan-misled-investors-dodged-regulators-senate-report-says.html|title=JPMorgan Misled Investors, Dodged Regulators, Senate Report Says|last=Kopecki|first=Dawn|date=14 March 2013|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|access-date=14 March 2013|url-access=subscription|archive-date=17 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317233621/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-14/jpmorgan-misled-investors-dodged-regulators-senate-report-says.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
