'''Haus Laboratories''' (stylized as HAUS LABORATORIES and abbreviated as Haus Labs) is a [[vegan]] and [[Cruelty-free cosmetics|cruelty-free]] [[cosmetics]] brand launched on September 17, 2019, by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It is the first major beauty line to launch exclusively on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], released in nine countries including the UK, US, France, Japan, and Germany. The first products included lip liner, lip gloss, and liquid-to-powder shimmer. The company's mission is to spread kindness, bravery, and creativity by providing tools for self-expression and reinvention.

Haus Laboratories was originally launched in 2012 as a perfume brand, in association with [[Coty, Inc.]], an American multinational beauty company founded in 1904 and known for owning several brands. Their first fragrance, [[Lady Gaga Fame|Fame]], came out in that same year,  and the second one, called [[Eau de Gaga]], in 2014.

In February 2018, Gaga filed for trademarks for "Haus Beauty" and "Haus Labs" through her company, Ate My Heart Inc. Then, at the [[Met Gala]] in May 2019, fans started to suspect that the makeup she was using was a preview of what was to come. Besides that, she had been using the hashtag #HausBeauty on several posts on her Instagram. Haus Laboratories is Gaga's first solo cosmetics brand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Sam|title=Haus Laboratories: All the facts about Lady Gaga's new beauty brand|url=https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/haus-laboratories-lady-gaga-new-beauty-makeup-brand-all-details|accessdate=July 28, 2020|work=[[Vogue India]]|date=July 10, 2019}}</ref> Previously, she had collaborated with [[MAC Cosmetics]], for their Viva Glam Lipstick 2011 campaign, with a video directed by [[Nick Knight (photographer)|Nick Knight]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga Named MAC Spokesperson — AGAIN!|url=https://www.seventeen.com/beauty/celeb-beauty/news/a13089/lady-gaga-mac-cosmetics-spokesperson-2011|accessdate=July 28, 2020|work=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|date=December 17, 2010}}</ref> Between 2012 and 2014, Gaga released two fragrances, [[Lady Gaga Fame|Fame]] and [[Eau de Gaga]], via Haus Laboratories in association with [[Coty, Inc]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga unveils new Steven Klein artwork for Eau de Gaga|url=https://news.yahoo.com/lady-gaga-unveils-steven-klein-artwork-eau-gaga-094023300.html|accessdate=July 28, 2020|publisher=[[Yahoo!

The brand is inspired by Gaga's early days as a musician in Manhattan and it carries the spirit of embrace of individuality, and expressing it through bold makeup and body art, authenticity, and inclusivity. Also, the decision to sell it exclusively on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] was based on Haus Labs' messages of self-acceptance and confidence. Gaga stated in an interview to ''[[The Business of Fashion]]'' that the partnership with Amazon was made because only they would allow her to commercialize a brand with these principles, saying "no message of self-acceptance, no deal".<ref name="BOFInterview">{{cite web|last=Strugatz|first=Rachel|title=Revealed: Lady Gaga's New Beauty Line|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/lady-gaga-haus-laboratories-beauty-brand-details|accessdate=July 28, 2019|work=[[The Business of Fashion]]|date=July 10, 2019}}</ref>

The team assembled by Gaga consists of 15 people, such as veterans from [[Milk Makeup]] and [[Benefit Cosmetics]] owned by [[LVMH]]; Gaga's makeup artist, Sarah Tanno, who is the brand's global artistry director; and the former executive at [[The Honest Company]] and [[Zynga]], a [[mobile game]] company behind ''[[FarmVille]]'' and ''[[Words with Friends]]'', Ben Jones, who is chief executive. She has also secured backing from [[Lightspeed Venture Partners]], an investor in companies including [[Goop (company)|Goop]] and [[Stitch Fix]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Sam|title=Could Lady Gaga's New Make-Up Line Be The Next Fenty Beauty?|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/lady-gaga-haus-laboratories-everything-you-need-to-know|accessdate=July 28, 2019|work=[[Vogue UK]]|date=July 10, 2019}}</ref>
