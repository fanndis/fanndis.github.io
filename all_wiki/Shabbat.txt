'''Shabbat''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|'|b|æ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|'|b|ɑː|t}}; {{lang-he|שַׁבָּת}} {{IPA-he|ʃa'bat|}}, "rest" or "cessation"), '''Shabbos''' ({{IPA-yi|'ʃa.bəs|}}, [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] and {{lang-yi|שבת}}), or the '''Sabbath''', is [[Judaism]]'s day of rest on the seventh day of the [[seven-day week|week]]—i.e., [[Saturday]]. On this day, religious [[Jews]] remember the biblical story describing the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the heavens and the earth in six days]] and look forward to a future [[Messianic Age]]. Since the Jewish religious calendar counts days from sunset to sunset, Shabbat begins in the evening of what on the secular calendar is [[Friday]].

Shabbat observance entails refraining from [[activities prohibited on Shabbat|work activities]], often with [[shomer Shabbat|great rigor]], and engaging in restful activities to honour the day. Judaism's traditional position is that the unbroken seventh-day Shabbat originated among the Jewish people, as their first and most sacred institution, though some suggest other origins. Variations upon Shabbat are widespread in Judaism and, with adaptations, throughout the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and many other [[religions]].

According to ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish religious law), Shabbat is observed from a few minutes before sunset on Friday evening until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night.<ref>[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Orach Chayim]] 293:2</ref> Shabbat is ushered in by lighting candles and reciting a blessing. Traditionally, three [[Seudat mitzvah#Seudat Shabbat and Seudat Yom Tov|festive meals]] are eaten: The first one is held on Friday evening, the second is traditionally a lunch meal on Saturday and the third being held later in the afternoon. The evening meal and the early afternoon meal typically begin with a blessing called ''[[kiddush]]'' and another blessing recited over two loaves of [[challah]]. The third meal does not have the Kiddush recited but all have the two loaves. Shabbat is closed Saturday evening with a ''[[havdalah]]'' blessing. 

Shabbat is a festive day when Jews exercise their freedom from the regular labours of everyday life. It offers an opportunity to contemplate the spiritual aspects of life and to spend time with family.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Sabbath etymology}}
The word "Shabbat" derives from the Hebrew verb ''shavat'' ({{lang-he-n|שָׁבַת}}). Although frequently translated as "rest" (noun or verb), another accurate translation of these words is "ceasing [from work]", as resting is not necessarily denoted.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The related modern Hebrew word ''shevita'' ([[labour strike]]), has the same implication of active rather than passive abstinence from work. The notion of active cessation from labour is also regarded{{by whom|date=October 2018}} as more consistent with an [[omnipotent]] [[Names of God in Judaism|God]]'s activity on the seventh day of [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation according to Genesis]]. Other significant connotations{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} are to ''shevet'' (שֶּׁבֶת) which means sitting or staying, and to ''sheva'' (שֶׁבַע) meaning seven, as Shabbat is the seventh day of the week; the other days of the week do not have names but called by their [[Ordinal number|ordinals]].

==History==
===Biblical sources===
{{Main|Biblical Sabbath}}
Sabbath is given special status as a holy day at the very beginning of the [[Torah]] in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:1–3|HE}}. It is first commanded after [[the Exodus]] from Egypt, in {{Bibleverse||Exodus|16:26|HE}} (relating to the cessation of [[manna]]) and in {{Bibleverse||Exodus|16:29|HE}} (relating to the distance one may [[Biblical mile|travel by foot]] on the Sabbath), as also in {{Bibleverse||Exodus|20:8–11|HE}} (as one of the [[Ten Commandments]]). Sabbath is commanded and commended many more times in the Torah and [[Tanakh]]; double the normal number of animal [[korban|sacrifices]] are to be offered on the day.<ref>''Every Person's Guide to Shabbat'', by Ronald H. Isaacs, Jason Aronson, 1998, p. 6</ref> Sabbath is also described by the prophets [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Hosea]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], and [[Nehemiah]].

====Assyria====
Connection to Sabbath observance has been suggested in the designation of the seventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eight days of a lunar month in an Assyrian religious calendar as a 'holy day', also called ‘evil days’ (meaning "unsuitable" for prohibited activities).  The prohibitions on these days, spaced seven days apart, include abstaining from chariot riding, and the avoidance of eating meat by the King.  On these days officials were prohibited from various activities and common men were forbidden to "make a wish", and at least the 28th was known as a "rest-day".<ref>"Histoire du peuple hébreu".

===Status as a holy day===
[[File:Покривка за хала (леб) - כיסוי החלות - Challah cover.JPG|right|thumb|A challah cover with [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew inscription]]]]
The Tanakh and [[siddur]] describe Shabbat as having three purposes:
# To commemorate [[Names of God in Judaism|God's]] [[Creation according to Genesis|creation of the universe]], on the seventh day of which God rested from (or ceased) his work;
# To commemorate the Israelites' [[the Exodus|redemption from slavery]] in [[ancient Egypt]];
#As a "taste" of [[Olam Haba]] (the [[Messianic Age]]).

Judaism accords Shabbat the status of a joyous holy day. In many ways, Jewish law gives Shabbat the status of being the most important holy day in the Jewish calendar:<ref>One measure is the number of people called up to Torah readings at the Shachrit/morning service. Three is the smallest number, e.g. Mondays and Thursdays. Five on the Holy days of Passover, Shavuoth, Succoth. Yom Kippur: Six. Shabbat: Seven.</ref>
* It is the first holy day mentioned in the Bible, and God was the first to observe it with the cessation of [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] (Genesis 2:1–3).
* [[Jewish services|Jewish liturgy]] treats Shabbat as a "bride" and "queen" (see [[Shekhinah]]); some sources described it as a "king".<ref>The Talmud (Shabbat 119a) describes rabbis going out to greet the Shabbat Queen, and the [[Lekhah Dodi]] poem describes Shabbat as a "bride" and "queen". However, [[Maimonides]] ([[Mishneh Torah]] Hilchot Shabbat 30:2) speaks of greeting the "Shabbat King", and two independent commentaries on Mishneh Torah (Maggid Mishneh and R' Zechariah haRofeh) quote the Talmud as speaking of the "Shabbat King". The words "King" and "Queen" in Aramaic differ by just one letter, and it seems that these understandings result from different traditions regarding spelling the Talmudic word. See [https://www.maharitz.co.il/?CategoryID=174&ArticleID=672 full discussion].</ref>
* The [[Sefer Torah]] is read during the [[Torah reading]] which is part of the Shabbat morning services, with a longer reading than during the week. The Torah is read over a yearly cycle of 54 ''[[parashioth]]'', one for each Shabbat (sometimes they are doubled). On Shabbat, the reading is divided into seven sections, more than on any other holy day, including [[Yom Kippur]]. Then, the [[Haftarah]] reading from the Hebrew prophets is read.
* A tradition states that the [[Jewish Messiah]] will come if every Jew properly observes two consecutive Shabbatoth.<ref>[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 118</ref>
* The punishment in ancient times for desecrating Shabbat ([[stoning]]) is the most severe punishment in Jewish law.<ref>See e.g. Numbers 15:32–36.</ref>

===Welcoming Shabbat===
[[File:GOOD SHABBES -.jpg|thumb|Reciting blessing over Shabbat candles]]
Honoring Shabbat (''kavod Shabbat'') on Preparation Day (Friday) includes bathing, having a haircut and cleaning and beautifying the home (with flowers, for example).
Days in the Jewish calendar start at nightfall, therefore many Jewish holidays begin at [[Zmanim|such time]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Aron |title=Why do Jewish holidays begin at nightfall? |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/160961/jewish/Why-do-Jewish-holidays-begin-at-nightfall.htm |website=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad.org |access-date=25 September 2020}}</ref> According to Jewish law, Shabbat starts a few minutes before sunset. Candles are lit at this time. It is customary in many communities to light the candles 18 minutes before sundown (''tosefet Shabbat'', though sometimes 36 minutes), and most printed Jewish calendars adhere to this custom. The Kabbalat Shabbat service is a prayer service welcoming the arrival of Shabbat. Before Friday night dinner, it is customary to sing two songs, one "greeting" two Shabbat angels into the house<ref>Shabbat 119b</ref> (Shalom Aleichem -Peace Be Upon You) and the other praising the woman of the house for all the work she has done over the past week (Aishes Chayil - Women Of Valour).<ref>[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 31:10–31</ref> After blessings over the wine and challah, a festive meal is served. Singing is traditional at Sabbath meals.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ferguson|first1=Joey|title=Jewish lecture series focuses on Sabbath Course at Chabad center focuses on secrets of sabbath's serenity|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700137207/Jewish-lecture-series-focuses-on-Sabbath.html?pg=all|agency=Deseret News|date=May 20, 2011|quote=The more we are able to invest in it, the more we are able to derive pleasure from the Sabbath."  Jewish belief is based on understanding that observance of the Sabbath is the source of all blessing, said Rabbi Zippel in an interview.  He referred to the Jewish Sabbath as a time where individuals disconnect themselves from all endeavors that enslave them throughout the week and compared the day to pressing a reset button on a machine.  A welcome prayer over wine or grape juice from the men and candle lighting from the women invokes the Jewish Sabbath on Friday at sundown.}}</ref> In modern times, many composers have written sacred music for use during the Kabbalat Shabbat observance, including [[Robert Strassburg]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milkenarchive.org/artists/view/robert-strassburg/|title=Strassburg, Robert|website=Milken Archive of Jewish Music|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> and [[Samuel Adler (composer)|Samuel Adler]].<ref name="Milken Archive of Jewish Music">{{cite web|title=Milken Archive of Jewish Music – People – Samuel Adler|url=http://www.milkenarchive.org/people/view/all/482/Adler,+Samuel|access-date=2 August 2015}}</ref>

According to [[rabbinic literature]], God via the Torah commands Jews to ''observe'' (refrain from forbidden activity) and ''remember'' (with words, thoughts, and actions) Shabbat, and these two actions are symbolized by the customary two [[Shabbat candles]]. Candles are lit usually by the woman of the house (or else by a man who lives alone). Some families light more candles, sometimes in accordance with the number of children.<ref>[[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Orach Chaim]] 261.</ref>

===Other rituals===
{{redirect2|Oyneg Shabes|Oneg Shabbat|the collection of documents from the Warsaw Ghetto collected and preserved by the group known by the code name Oyneg Shabes|Ringelblum Archive}}
Shabbat is a day of celebration as well as [[Jewish services|prayer]]. It is customary to eat three festive meals: Dinner on Shabbat eve (Friday night), lunch on Shabbat day (Saturday), and a third meal (a ''[[Seudah Shlishit]]''/"Shalosh Seudot"<ref>Since it is this meal that changes the other two from meals of a two-per-day nature to two of a trio</ref>) in the late afternoon (Saturday). It is also customary to wear nice clothing (different from during the week) on Shabbat to honor the day.

On June 13, 2014, [[Am Yisrael Foundation]]’s White City Shabbat organization set the [[Guinness World Record]] for the world's largest Shabbat dinner. Held at Hangar 11 at [[Tel Aviv Port]], the event was attended by 2,226 people,  including [[Alan Dershowitz]], Tel Aviv mayor [[Ron Huldai]], Israeli basketball star [[Tal Brody]] and former US Ambassador [[Michael Oren]]. The event took almost a year of preparation and involved “60 days of crowd-sourced fundraising,<ref>[http://www.nyblueprint.com/fundraising/israeli-seeks-guinness-record-largest-shabbat-meal NY Blueprint: Crowdfunding the World's Largest Shabbat Dinner]</ref> 800 bottles of [[Israeli wine]], 80 bottles of vodka, 50 bottles of whiskey, 2,000 [[challah]] rolls, 80 long tables, 1,800 pieces of chicken, 1,000 portions of beef and 250 vegetarian meals.” A total of 2,300 diners signed up for the dinner and another 3,000 were placed on the waiting list.<ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/181797#.U58WgPmSyAV Arutz Sheva: World's Largest Shabbat Dinner Hosts 2,226]</ref>

Many Jews attend synagogue services on Shabbat even if they do not do so during the week. Services are held on Shabbat eve (Friday night), Shabbat morning (Saturday morning), and late Shabbat afternoon (Saturday afternoon).

With the exception of [[Yom Kippur]], days of public fasting are postponed or advanced if they coincide with Shabbat. Mourners sitting ''[[shivah]]'' (week of mourning subsequent to the death of a spouse or first-degree relative) outwardly conduct themselves normally for the duration of the day and are forbidden to display public signs of mourning.

Although most Shabbat laws are restrictive, the fourth of the [[Ten Commandments]] in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] is taken by the [[Talmud]] and [[Maimonides]] to allude to the ''positive'' commandments of Shabbat. These include:
* Honoring Shabbat (''kavod Shabbat''): on Shabbat, wearing festive clothing and refraining from unpleasant conversation. It is customary to avoid talking on Shabbat about money, business matters, or secular things that one might discuss during the week.<ref>{{cite book

* Recitation of ''[[kiddush]]'' over a cup of [[kosher wine|wine]] at the beginning of Shabbat meals, or at a reception after the conclusion of morning prayers (see the [[list of Jewish prayers and blessings]]).
* [[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Two homemade [[whole-wheat flour|whole-wheat]] challot covered by traditional [[embroidery|embroidered]] Shabbat [[challah cover]]]] Eating three festive meals. Meals begin with a blessing over two loaves of bread (''[[lechem mishneh]]'', "double bread"), usually of braided [[challah]], which is symbolic of the double portion of [[manna]] that fell for the Jewish people on the day before Sabbath during their 40 years in the desert after [[the Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. It is customary to serve meat or fish, and sometimes both, for Shabbat evening and morning meals. ''[[Seudah Shlishit]]'' (literally, "third meal"), generally a light meal that may be [[pareve]] or [[dairy]], is eaten late Shabbat afternoon.
* Enjoying Shabbat (''oneg Shabbat''): Engaging in pleasurable activities such as eating, singing, spending time with the family and marital relations. Sometimes referred to as "Shabbating".
* Recitation of ''[[havdalah]]''.

===Bidding farewell===
{{Main|Havdalah}}
[[File:Havdal.jpg|thumb|Observing the closing ''[[havdalah]]'' ritual in 14th-century Spain]]
''[[Havdalah]]'' (Hebrew: הַבְדָּלָה, "separation") is a Jewish religious ceremony that marks the symbolic end of Shabbat, and ushers in the new week. At the conclusion of Shabbat at nightfall, after the appearance of three stars in the sky, the ''havdalah'' blessings are recited over a cup of wine, and with the use of fragrant spices and a candle, usually braided. Some communities delay ''havdalah'' later into the night in order to prolong Shabbat. There are different customs regarding how much time one should wait after the stars have surfaced until the sabbath technically ends. Some people hold by 72 minutes later and other hold longer and shorter than that.

==Prohibited activities==
{{Main|39 melachot|Rabbinically prohibited activities of Shabbat}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law (halakha)]] prohibits doing any form of ''melakhah'' (מְלָאכָה, plural ''melakhoth'') on Shabbat, unless an urgent human or medical need is life-threatening. Though ''melakhah'' is commonly translated as "work" in [[English language|English]], a better definition is "deliberate activity" or "skill and craftmanship". There are 39 categories of ''melakhah'':<ref>[[Mishnah]] [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Tractate Shabbat]] 7:2</ref>
{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}
* plowing earth
* sowing
* reaping
* binding sheaves
* threshing
* winnowing
* selecting
* grinding
* sifting
* kneading
* baking
* shearing wool
* washing wool
* beating wool
* dyeing wool
* spinning
* weaving
* making two loops
* weaving two threads
* separating two threads
* tying
* untying
* sewing stitches
* tearing
* trapping
* slaughtering
* flaying
* tanning
* scraping hide
* marking hide
* cutting hide to shape
* writing two or more letters
* erasing two or more letters
* building
* demolishing
* extinguishing a fire
* kindling a fire
* putting the finishing touch on an object, and
* transporting an object (between private and public domains, or over 4 [[cubit]]s within public domain) {{div col end}}

The 39 ''melakhoth'' are not so much activities as "categories of activity". For example, while "winnowing" usually refers exclusively to the separation of [[chaff]] from [[cereal|grain]], and "selecting" refers exclusively to the separation of debris from grain, they refer in the Talmudic sense to any separation of intermixed materials which renders edible that which was inedible. Thus, filtering undrinkable water to make it drinkable falls under this category, as does picking small bones from fish ([[gefilte fish]] is one solution to this problem).

The categories of labors prohibited on Shabbat are [[exegesis|exegetically]] derived&nbsp;– on account of Biblical passages juxtaposing Shabbat observance ({{Bibleverse|Exodus|35:1–3|HE}}) to making the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] ({{Bibleverse|Exodus|35:4 etc.|HE}})&nbsp;– that they are the kinds of work that were necessary for the construction of the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]]. They are not explicitly listed in the Torah; the Mishnah observes that "the laws of Shabbat ... are like mountains hanging by a hair, for they are little Scripture but many laws".<ref>[[Chagigah]] 1:8.</ref> Many [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic scholars]] have pointed out that these labors have in common activity that is "creative", or that exercises control or dominion over one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Klein|first1=Miriam|title=Sabbath Offers Serenity in a Fast-Paced World|url=http://www.triblocal.com/northbrook/community/stories/2011/04/sabbath-offers-serenity-in-a-fast-paced-world/|agency=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Triblocal|date=April 27, 2011}}</ref>

In addition to the 39 ''melakhot'', additional activities were [[Rabbinically prohibited activities of Shabbat|prohibited by the rabbis]] for various reasons.

The term ''[[shomer Shabbat]]'' is used for a person (or organization) who adheres to Shabbat laws consistently. The (strict) observance of the Sabbath is often seen as a benchmark for orthodoxy and indeed has legal bearing on the way a Jew is seen by an [[Beit din|orthodox religious court]] regarding their affiliation to Judaism.<ref>See [[Yosef Dov Soloveitchik]]'s "Beis HaLevi" commentary on [[parasha]] [[Ki Tissa]] for further elaboration regarding the legal ramifications.</ref>

===Specific applications===
====Electricity====
{{Main|Electricity on Shabbat}}
Orthodox and some Conservative authorities rule that turning [[electricity|electric]] devices on or off is prohibited as a ''melakhah''; however, authorities are not in agreement about exactly which one(s). One view is that tiny sparks are created in a switch when the circuit is closed, and this would constitute lighting a fire (category 37). If the appliance is purposed for light or heat (such as an [[incandescent bulb]] or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may be considered as a type of fire that falls under both lighting a fire (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11). Turning lights off would be extinguishing a fire (category 36). Another view is that completing an electrical circuit constitutes building (category 35) and turning off the circuit would be demolishing (category 34). Some schools of thought consider the use of electricity to be forbidden only by [[rabbinical law|rabbinic injunction]], rather than a ''melakhah''.

A common solution to the problem of electricity involves preset timers ([[Shabbat clock]]s) for electric appliances, to turn them on and off automatically, with no human intervention on Shabbat itself. Some Conservative authorities<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Neulander | first1 = Arthur | year = 1950 | title = The Use of Electricity on the Sabbath | journal = Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly | volume = 14 | pages = 165–171 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = Morris | last2 = Agus | first2 = Jacob | last3 = Friedman | first3 = Theodore | year = 1950 | title = Responsum on the Sabbath | journal = Proceedings of the Rabbinical Assembly | volume = 14 | pages = 112–137 }}</ref><ref>Klein, Isaac. ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice.'' The Jewish Theological Seminary of America: New York, 1979.</ref> reject altogether the arguments for prohibiting the use of electricity. Some Orthodox also hire a "[[Shabbos goy]]", a Gentile to perform prohibited tasks (like operating light switches) on Shabbat.

====Automobiles====
{{Main|Driving on Shabbat}}
Orthodox and many Conservative authorities completely prohibit the use of automobiles on Shabbat as a violation of multiple categories, including lighting a fire, extinguishing a fire, and transferring between domains (category 39). However, the Conservative movement's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] permits driving to a synagogue on Shabbat, as an emergency measure, on the grounds that if Jews lost contact with synagogue life they would become lost to the Jewish people.

A halakhically authorized [[Shabbat mode]] added to a power-operated [[mobility scooter]] may be used on the observance of Shabbat for those with walking limitations, often referred to as a Shabbat scooter. It is intended only for individuals whose limited mobility is dependent on a scooter or automobile consistently throughout the week.

====Modifications====
Seemingly "forbidden" acts may be performed by modifying technology such that no law is actually violated. In [[Sabbath mode]], a "[[Sabbath elevator]]" will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without anyone having to press any buttons, which would normally be needed to work. ([[Dynamic braking]] is also disabled if it is normally used, i.e., shunting energy collected from downward travel, and thus the gravitational potential energy of passengers, into a [[resistor]] network.) However, many rabbinical authorities consider the use of such elevators by those who are otherwise capable as a violation of Shabbat, with such workarounds being for the benefit of the frail and handicapped and not being in the spirit of the day.

Many observant Jews avoid the prohibition of carrying by use of an [[eruv]]. Others make their [[Key (lock)|keys]] into a [[tie bar]], part of a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] buckle, or a [[brooch]], because a legitimate article of [[clothing]] or [[jewelry]] may be worn rather than carried. An elastic band with clips on both ends, and with keys placed between them as integral links, may be considered a belt.

[[Shabbat lamp]]s have been developed to allow a light in a room to be turned on or off at will while the electricity remains on. A special mechanism blocks out the light when the off position is desired without violating Shabbat.

The [[Shabbos App]] is a proposed [[Android app]] claimed by its creators to enable [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jew]]s, and all Jewish Sabbath-observers, to use a [[smartphone]] to text on the Jewish Sabbath. It has met with resistance from some authorities.<ref name=uproar>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/international/new-shabbos-app-creates-uproar-among-orthodox-circles|title=New Shabbos App Creates Uproar Among Orthodox Circles|author=Hannah Dreyfus|work=[[The Jewish Week]]|date=October 2, 2014|access-date=October 12, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007195945/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/international/new-shabbos-app-creates-uproar-among-orthodox-circles|archive-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref><ref name=toi>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/app-lets-jewish-kids-text-on-sabbath-and-stay-in-the-fold/|title=App lets Jewish kids text on Sabbath – and stay in the fold; The ‘Shabbos App’ is generating controversy in the Jewish community – and a monumental on-line discussion of Jewish law|author=David Shamah|date=October 2, 2014|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=shalom>{{cite web|url=http://www.shalomlife.com/business/26132/finally-now-you-can-text-on-saturdays-thanks-to-new-shabbos-app/|title=Finally, Now You Can Text on Saturdays Thanks to New 'Shabbos App'|date=October 2, 2014|author=Daniel Koren|work=Shalom Life|access-date=October 12, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007135626/http://www.shalomlife.com/business/26132/finally-now-you-can-text-on-saturdays-thanks-to-new-shabbos-app/|archive-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2014/10/02/will-the-shabbos-app-change-jewish-life-raise-rabbinic-ire-or-both/|title=Will the Shabbos App Change Jewish Life, Raise Rabbinic Ire, or Both?|date=October 2, 2014 |publisher=Jewish Business News|access-date=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

In the event that a human life is in danger (pikuach nefesh), a Jew is not only allowed, but required,<ref>[http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/8-saved-during-qshabbat-from-hellq 8 saved during "Shabbat from hell"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119072338/http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/8-saved-during-qshabbat-from-hellq |date=2010-01-19 }} (January 17, 2010) in [http://www.israel21c.org/ ''Israel 21c Innovation News Service''] Retrieved 2010–01–18</ref><ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3835327,00.html ZAKA rescue mission to Haiti 'proudly desecrating Shabbat'] Religious rescue team holds Shabbat prayer with members of international missions in Port au-Prince. Retrieved 2010–01–22</ref> to violate any halakhic law that stands in the way of saving that person (excluding murder, idolatry, and forbidden sexual acts). The concept of life being in danger is interpreted broadly: for example, it is mandated that one violate Shabbat to bring a woman in active labor to a hospital. Lesser rabbinic restrictions are often violated under much less urgent circumstances (a patient who is ill but not critically so).

Various other legal principles closely delineate which activities constitute desecration of Shabbat. Examples of these include the principle of ''shinui'' ("change" or "deviation"): A violation is not regarded as severe if the prohibited act was performed in a way that would be considered abnormal on a weekday. Examples include writing with one's nondominant hand, according to many rabbinic authorities. This legal principle operates ''bedi'avad'' (''[[ex post facto]]'') and does not cause a forbidden activity to be permitted barring extenuating circumstances.

===Reform and Reconstructionist views===
Generally, adherents of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] believe that the individual Jew determines whether to follow Shabbat prohibitions or not. For example, some Jews might find activities, such as writing or cooking for [[leisure]], to be enjoyable enhancements to Shabbat and its holiness, and therefore may encourage such practices. Many Reform Jews believe that what constitutes "work" is different for each person, and that only what the person considers "work" is forbidden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/18-04-17.html|title=Soc.Culture.Jewish Newsgroups Frequently Asked Questions and Answers|page=18.4.7|date=2003-09-04|access-date=2009-03-27|author=Faigin, Daniel P.|publisher=[[Usenet]]}}</ref> The radical Reform rabbi [[Samuel Holdheim]] advocated moving Sabbath to Sunday for many no longer observed it, a step taken by dozens of congregations in the United States in late 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1982_34_01_00_olitzky.pdf|title=The Sunday-Sabbath Movement in American Reform Judaism: Strategy or Evolution|website=Americanjewisharchives.org|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref>

More rabbinically traditional Reform and Reconstructionist Jews believe that these ''halakhoth'' in general may be valid, but that it is up to each individual to decide how and when to apply them. A small fraction of Jews in the Progressive Jewish community accept these laws much the same way as Orthodox Jews.

==Encouraged activities==
The Talmud, especially in [[Shabbat (Talmud)|tractate Shabbat]], defines rituals and activities to both "remember" and "keep" the Sabbath and to sanctify it at home and in the synagogue. In addition to refraining from creative work, the sanctification of the day through [[Kiddush|blessings over wine]], the preparation of special [[Shabbat meals|Sabbath meals]], and engaging in [[Jewish prayer|prayer]] and [[Torah study]] were required as an active part of Shabbat observance to promote intellectual activity and spiritual regeneration on the day of rest from physical creation. The Talmud states that the best food should be prepared for the Sabbath, for "one who delights in the Sabbath is granted their heart's desires" ([[Babylonian Talmud|BT]], Shabbat 118a-b).<ref>{{cite book|title=A Book of Jewish Concepts|last=Birnbaum|first=Philip |chapter=Sabbath|year=1975|publisher=Hebrew Publishing Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=088482876X|page=579–581}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Judaism - The Sabbath|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judaism|access-date=2020-07-28}}</ref>

All [[Jewish denominations]] encourage the following activities on Shabbat:
* Reading, studying, and discussing [[Torah]] and commentary, [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]], and learning some [[halakha]] and [[midrash]].
* [[Synagogue]] attendance for [[Jewish services|prayers]].
* Spending time with other Jews and socializing with family, friends, and guests at Shabbat meals (''hachnasat orchim'', "[[hospitality]]").
* Singing ''[[zemiroth]]'' or ''[[niggun]]im'', special songs for Shabbat meals (commonly sung during or after a meal).
* [[Jewish views on marriage#Sexual relations|Marital relations]] between husband and wife.<ref>Shulkhan Arukh, Orach Chaim 280:1</ref>
* Sleeping.

==Special Shabbat==
{{Main|Special Shabbat}}
[[Special Shabbat]]ot are the Shabbatot that precede important [[Jewish holiday]]s: e.g., ''Shabbat HaGadol'' (Shabbat preceding [[Pesach]]), ''Shabbat Zachor'' (Shabbat preceding [[Purim]]), and ''Shabbat Shuvah'' (Shabbat between [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]).

==Sabbath adaptation==
{{Main|First-day Sabbath|Seventh-day Sabbath}}
Most [[Christians]] do not observe Saturday Sabbath, but instead observe a weekly day of worship on [[Sunday]], which is often called the "[[Lord's Day]]". Several Christian denominations, such as the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Church of God (7th Day)]], the [[Seventh Day Baptist]]s, and [[List of Sabbath-keeping churches|many others]], observe [[seventh-day Sabbath]]. This observance is celebrated from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.

The principle of weekly Sabbath also exists in other beliefs. Examples include the [[Babylonian calendar]], the [[Buddhist]] ''[[uposatha]]'', and the [[Unification Church]]'s [[Ahn Shi Il]].
