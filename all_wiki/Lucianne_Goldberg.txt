==Early life and education==
She was born Lucianne Steinberger in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, to Dr. Raymond Leonard and Lucy Jane (Moseley) von Steinberger.<ref name=ohwohw/><ref name="wedding"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oinBBJ5pYa0C&q=Lucy+Moseley+Steinberger |title=Who's who of American women |publisher=Marquis Who's Who, LLC |via=Books.google.ca |date= 1976|accessdate=September 6, 2012|isbn=978-0837904092 }}</ref> She grew up in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], outside of [[Washington, D.C.]], where her father was employed as a government [[physicist]], and her mother was a [[Physical therapy|physiotherapist]].<ref name="in pursuit"/><ref name="for protection"/> She attended high school in Alexandria, leaving at age 16 to begin working.<ref name="producer and publicist"/> She married her high school sweetheart, William Cummings; the couple separated after three years of marriage and later divorced.<ref name="producer and publicist"/>

==Early career==
Goldberg started her literary career at a very early age at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', during her secondary education. Goldberg decided to seek the opportunity as a press aide in [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s unsuccessful 1960 campaign for president.<ref name="producer and publicist"/><ref name="maverick"/> After [[John F. Kennedy]] won the Democratic nomination, she got a position at the [[Democratic National Committee]] followed by a spot on Kennedy's [[Inauguration|Inaugural]] Committee.<ref name="producer and publicist"/> She has said she served on Kennedy's [[White House]] staff, but according to the ''Washington Post'', her name does not appear on any staff records.<ref name="producer and publicist"/> In response, she explained that she worked in the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building|Old Executive Office Building]] doing opposition research, then worked out of the [[National Press Building (Washington, DC)|National Press Building]] in public relations.<ref name="producer and publicist"/>

==Public relations firm==
In 1963, she opened up her own one-person public relations firm, Lucianne Cummings & Associates.<ref name="producer and publicist"/> She received national media attention in 1965 when she attempted to sell a handwritten note from [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy]] to [[Lady Bird Johnson]] through an auction house for $1000 (${{Inflation|US|1000|1965|r=0}} in today's dollars).<ref name="amazing coincidence"/> She had come into possession of the note when acting as a messenger for Kennedy in 1960.<ref name="amazing coincidence"/> Upon hearing of the auction, the First Lady became irate, and demanded that the note be returned to the White House.<ref name="amazing coincidence"/><ref name="elton"/> Cummings apologized and returned the note, then found out the next day that her income tax returns were going to be [[audit]]ed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]].<ref name="amazing coincidence"/>

In 1966, she married Sidney Goldberg, who was then the executive editor of the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]] (NANA), later acquired by [[United Media|United Features Syndicate]].<ref name="gop spy"/><ref name="paid to spy"/> She took the name Goldberg upon her marriage and worked for the Women's News Service, also a subsidiary of United Features Syndicate.<ref name="gop spy"/><ref name="paid to spy"/>

===Conservative activism and Watergate era===
In 1970, Goldberg and her friend Jeannie Sakol founded an organization called the "Pussycat League" to oppose the [[women's liberation movement]],<ref name="gop spy"/> and in 1971 she and Sakol published ''Purr Baby Purr'', a critique of [[feminism]].<ref name="two members"/><ref name="purr"/>

During the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential campaign]], she joined the press corps covering [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[George McGovern]] claiming to be a reporter for the Women's News Service, though she was on leave of absence from that position.<ref name="paid to spy"/> In fact Goldberg was being paid $1000 a week – ${{Inflation|US|1000|1972|r=0}} in today's dollars – to spy on McGovern and those traveling with him on the campaign's planes.<ref name="gop spy"/><ref name="paid to spy"/> When recruited, she was told [[United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] himself had approved the spying, which was to include traditional political intelligence and information on personal habits: "'They were looking for really dirty stuff,' [she] said. 'Who was sleeping with whom, what the [[United States Secret Service|secret service]] men were doing with the stewardesses, who was [[Cannabis (drug)|smoking pot]] on the plane – that sort of thing. I was told to send it all along.'"<ref name="paid to spy"/> Goldberg's role as a reporter-spy came to light in the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] hearings that led to the resignation of Nixon.<ref name=catalyst/>

Feminist [[Betty Friedan]] alleged in June 1973 that Goldberg, as an organizer of the Pussycat League, had been attempting to derail the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] by engaging in Watergate-style "dirty tricks" and by touring the country falsely telling women they would lose their husbands and rights to family support if the amendment was passed.<ref name="friedan charges"/>

===Literary agent and author===
Goldberg ultimately set up her own literary agency and became known as a promoter of "right-wing, tell-all attack books", according to ''The New York Times''.<ref name="maverick"/> One of her clients, [[celebrity biographer]] [[Kitty Kelley]], sued her in 1983 over proceeds from foreign sales of Kelley's [[unauthorized biography]] on [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Kelley ultimately won a judgment of $40,000, with the judge declaring that Goldberg was only guilty of "sloppy bookkeeping".<ref name="kelley"/> Goldberg was also the U.S. agent for the memoirs of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]' former [[valet]], which were blocked for publication in England by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]].<ref name="memoirs"/> In the early 1990s Goldberg promoted a [[conspiracy theory]] book about the suicide death of Clinton White House aide, [[Vincent Foster]], and several books dealing with Clinton's purported sexual infidelities including one by [[Arkansas State Police|Arkansas State Troopers]] who alleged they had procured women to have sex with then-Governor Bill Clinton.<ref name="in pursuit"/><ref name="tapes prove"/><ref name="book agent"/> None of the Clinton-themed books were ever published.<ref name="in pursuit"/><ref name="tapes prove"/> Goldberg was also the agent for former detective [[Mark Fuhrman]]'s bestselling account of the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]], ''Murder in Brentwood''.<ref name="for protection"/><ref name="book agent"/>

Goldberg has written several novels. ''Friends in High Places'' co-written with Sondra Robinson, was published in 1979. Her first solo novel ''Madame Cleo's Girls'', a story of three high-priced [[call girl]]s, was published in 1992,<ref name="in pursuit"/> followed by ''People Will Talk'' in 1994. She has also [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] for celebrities;<ref name="in pursuit"/> the romance novel ''Washington Wives'' (1987) (penned under the name of Maureen Dean, wife of Watergate figure [[John Dean]]) is one of her behind-the-scenes works.<ref name="in pursuit"/><ref name="maverick"/>

==Monica Lewinsky scandal==

===The Tripp tapes===
Goldberg met [[Linda Tripp]] in 1993 or 1994 while working on the proposal for the book on the death of Clinton aide [[Vince Foster]].<ref name="in pursuit"/><ref name="tapes prove"/> The two women became friends, and in 1997 Goldberg advised Tripp to secretly record former White House intern, [[Monica Lewinsky]], talking about her sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton.<ref name="maverick"/> Goldberg advised Tripp that it was legal to record phone conversations in [[Maryland]] without the consent of the other party; in fact it was illegal to do so.<ref name="also probing"/>

Goldberg urged Tripp to take the resulting 20 hours of tapes to Special Prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]] who had a broad mandate to investigate improprieties by Clinton.<ref name="proud"/><ref name="axis"/> Goldberg also brought the tapes to the attention of lawyers working on the [[Paula Jones]] sexual harassment case against Clinton.<ref name="proud"/><ref name="axis"/> The tapes became crucial to Starr's investigation on whether Clinton committed perjury during a sworn deposition when he denied his affair with Lewinsky,<ref name="secret tapes"/> which led to his impeachment by the House and acquittal by the Senate.

Soon after the secret taping began in the fall of 1997, Goldberg arranged for Tripp to speak with ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter [[Michael Isikoff]], who had been investigating other allegations about Clinton's sex life.<ref name="book agent"/> After the scandal became public in January 1998, Goldberg was interviewed frequently by the media.<ref name="producer and publicist"/> She declared that the tapes proved that Lewinsky and Clinton had had a sexual relationship,<ref name="tapes prove"/> and previewed other highlights of the Clinton–Lewinsky affair such as the existence of a semen-stained dress which later proved to have Clinton's DNA.<ref name="producer and publicist"/>

The ''Washington Post'' called her "the producer and publicist" who set the stage for the scandal and the investigation, she called herself the "facilitator".<ref name="producer and publicist"/> Of Goldberg's role in the scandal, ''Time'' magazine said; "At a minimum, she is forever sealed in history as the New York City literary agent who uttered to her friend the most ruinous sentence of the Clinton presidency: 'Linda, buy a tape recorder.'"<ref name="charm"/> Author [[Jeffrey Toobin]] named her as one of the seven "Key Players" in the impeachment.<ref name="whose vast"/><ref name="toobin"/>

Goldberg said her actions in helping to disclose the Lewinsky–Clinton affair were motivated by her sense that general morality had declined, and that America needed "a wake-up call".<ref name="charm"/> She also said that the disclosure of Lewinsky's affair with Clinton helped to protect Lewinsky, who suffered from an obsessive infatuation with Clinton.<ref name="maverick"/> During this time, Goldberg made no secret of her personal animus toward Clinton, saying she was glad Clinton was getting caught "at something", and that "[i]f it took this to get him, fine."<ref name="secret tapes"/> She also said she was a political independent,<ref name="maverick"/> though she was described in the press as having long standing ties to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name="tapes prove"/>

===Repercussions===
In the aftermath of the disclosures about the Clinton–Lewinsky affair, Goldberg was subjected to media attacks on her character and past business dealings.<ref name="maverick"/> The Democratic National Committee faxed an unflattering "information sheet" on Goldberg to reporters within days after the story broke.<ref name="charm"/> Goldberg admitted that slurs on her own character were to be expected, '"I have never thought of myself as a victim in all this," she [said]. '"Never. Let them take their best shot."'<ref name="charm"/> She later said she had been worn down by the scrutiny.<ref name="maverick"/>

Goldberg denied allegations made in the media that she was part of a vast right wing conspiracy to bring down the presidency of Bill Clinton.<ref name="maverick"/> When Jeffrey Toobin published his 1999 book, ''A Vast Conspiracy'', that also alleged Goldberg had told friends that she had an affair with Lyndon Johnson,<ref name="toobin"/> and a ''Washington Post'' writer claimed he and others had overheard Goldberg bragging about an affair with Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] as well, Goldberg threatened Toobin and Random House with a [[libel]] suit, denied both affairs, and denied telling any such stories.<ref name="reliable source"/>

Goldberg was subpoenaed to testify before a Maryland grand jury that was contemplating indicting Tripp for having made the recordings. Under Maryland law, knowledge that such recordings were illegal was a necessary element of the crime. Goldberg explained that she had given Tripp incorrect advice, telling her it was legal to make secret recordings.<ref name="also probing"/> Charges against Tripp were later dropped.<ref name="no criminal"/>

Liberal filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] later set up a [[webcam]] focused on the windows of Goldberg's Manhattan apartment, that he called "I See Lucy Cam".<ref name="filmmaker"/><ref name="on-line Louvre"/> Moore's project did not violate [[New York State]]'s laws. Claiming that Goldberg did not respect the privacy rights of other people, Moore wrote, "`[s]he believes in keeping an eye on persons who are a threat to the country. So do we.'"

==Later career==
Goldberg was a prominent presence on the conservative website, ''[[Free Republic]]'' in the late 1990s, posting under the name "Trixie". She and other conservatives, including [[Matt Drudge]], left the site when the webmaster, in Goldberg's words, "let all the Y2K, gun-nut, Jew-baiting crazies take over [the forum] and flame the plain-old conservatives.<ref name="free for all"/> She then founded her own website, "[[Lucianne.com]]",<ref name="free for all"/><ref name="remembering"/> and for a time, was a nationally syndicated [[talk radio]] host whose show featured a Washington correspondent.<ref name="daly"/>

Goldberg will be portrayed by [[Margo Martindale]] in season three of [[American Crime Story]]; "[[American Crime Story#Seasons|Impeachment]]".<ref>https://deadline.com/2019/11/margo-martindale-play-lucianne-goldberg-impeachment-american-crime-story-1202792574/</ref>

==Personal life==
Lucianne was married to Sidney Goldberg, a wealthy Jewish newspaper executive with United Features Syndicate from 1966 until his death in 2005.<ref name="maverick"/><ref name="charm"/><ref name="notice"/> The couple had two children. Joshua (1967–2011) was the editor of her websites, and was the 2009 Republican nominee for the [[New York City Council]] seat representing district number six on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]]. He lost the election to the now [[Manhattan Borough President]],  [[Gale Brewer]]. [[Jonah Goldberg|Jonah]] (b. 1969) is a best selling author and conservative political commentator. The children were raised in their father's [[Judaism|Jewish]] faith,<ref name="christmas"/> while Lucianne, who was raised an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], remained a [[Christians|Christian]].<ref name="variations"/>
