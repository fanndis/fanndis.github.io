== History ==
Founded in [[Silicon Valley]] in 2003 by Paul J.J. Payack, the GLM describes its role as "a media analytics company that documents, analyzes and tracks cultural trends in language the world over, with a particular emphasis upon International and Global English".  GLM's main services include various products based on the Narrative Tracker technologies for global Internet and social media analysis. NarrativeTracker is based on global discourse, providing a real-time, accurate picture about any topic, at any point in time. NarrativeTracker analyzes the Internet, blogosphere, the top 275,000 print and electronic global media, as well as new social media sources as they emerge.<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|work=The Times |location=  London |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com |title=Global Language Monitor |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref> In April 2008, GLM moved its headquarters from [[San Diego]] to [[Austin]].<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&s_dispstring=%22global%20language%20monitor%22&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(%22global%20language%20monitor%22)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no] / Finally, California sends a business we can support</ref>

In July 2020, GLM announced that 'Covid' was the Top Word of 2020 for Global or International English.   

Covid is the commonly used shorthand for the shorthand for Covid-19.  Covid-19 is the official name of the virus caused by the SARS CoV-2 virus, so named in WHO’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD). ‘Covid’ has received the highest number of citations ever recorded in our global survey.  In fact, ‘covid’ has outranked all previous Words of the Year in the 21st century by a factor of 100.

Covid-19 is ranked No. 2. The Top Ten Words of the Year (#WOTY) for 2020 include Covid, Covid-19, Coronavirus, Corona, Face mask, Progress, Truth, Social Distancing, Trade War, and Sustainability.  Typically, the Global Language Monitor ranks words, phrases, and names on three separate lists, and the lists are limited to twenty items.  For this effort, GLM has combined the lists and extended the word count to fifty items.   

Other recently released word-lists include:

The [[New York Times]] quoted Paul JJ Payack as saying that the PQI is "an algorithm that tracks words and phrases in the media and on the Internet in relation to frequency, context and appearance in global media.  It is a weighted index that takes into account year-to-year increases and acceleration in the last several months".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/realestate/29cov.html The Power of Words]</ref> In general terms, GLM describes its Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI), used to run its analytics on global language trends and, as a weighted index, factoring in long-term trends, short-term changes, momentum and velocity, using frequency data on words and phrases in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet, and throughout the [[blogosphere]], as well as in proprietary databases ([[Factiva]], [[Lexis-Nexis]], etc.). It can also create "signals" that can be used in a variety of applications.<ref>[http://www.languagemonitor.com/predictive-quantities-indicator/pqi/  The Predictive Quantities Indicator (PQI)], GLM website</ref>
