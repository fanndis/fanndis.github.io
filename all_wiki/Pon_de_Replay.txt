"'''Pon de Replay'''" is the debut single recorded by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]], from her debut studio album ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005). It was written and produced by [[Vada Nobles]], Alisha "M'Jestie" Brooks, [[Carl Sturken]] and [[Evan Rogers]]. The song was released on 24 May 2005 as the [[lead single]] from the album. Prior to signing a six album record deal with [[Def Jam Recordings]], "Pon de Replay" was one of three songs which was recorded for her [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] to be sent to record labels. It is a [[dance-pop]], [[dancehall]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song that features elements of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[reggae]]. The lyrics revolve around Rihanna asking a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] to turn the volume of her favorite songs up louder. The name means "play it again" in [[Bajan Creole]], one of [[Barbados]]'s two official languages.

"Pon de Replay" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised the song's composition and its choice as the singer's debut single. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number one in New Zealand and on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Dance Club Songs]] chart. It also reached number two on both the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the [[UK Singles Chart]], whilst achieving top five positions in eight other countries including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. It was certified two times Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] denoting shipments of over 2,000,000 copies. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Little X]], and features Rihanna in a club with her friends, who ask the DJ to play their favorite song repeatedly.

== Background ==
Prior to signing a record deal with Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna was discovered in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers, who made the necessary arrangements for her to fly to New York. There, she recorded a collection of demos for a demo tape to be sent to record labels. One of the demos recorded was that of "Pon de Replay", which was written and produced by Carl Sturken, Evan Rogers and Vada Nobles in 2004.<ref name="TheGuardian1" /><ref name="Allmusic1">{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-of-the-sun-r783863/credits|title=Music of the Sun – Rihanna|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=24 September 2011}}</ref> The first to respond to the demo tape was [[Jay-Z]], who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of [[Def Jam Recordings]], where Rihanna auditioned for him and music executive [[L.A.

I was like: 'Oh God, he's right there, I can't look, I can't look, I can't look!' I remember being extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I'm sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Zee. I was star-struck."<ref name="TheGuardian1" /> During the audition, Rihanna performed [[Whitney Houston]]{{'}}s cover of "[[For the Love of You]]", "Pon de Replay" and "The Last Time", the latter two of which would go on to be included on her debut album, ''Music of the Sun''.<ref name="TheGuardian1" /> Initially, Jay-Z was skeptical about signing Rihanna, because he felt "Pon de Replay" was too big for her, saying "when a song is that big, it's hard [for a new artist] to come back from.

In an interview with Kidzworld, Rihanna explained the lyrical content of the song, saying: "It's just language that we speak in Barbados. It's broken English.

Subsequently, Rihanna vows to make the DJ turn up the music, thus stepping up onto a platform, wearing a gold belly top with baggy jeans, beginning to perform to the song, causing the DJ, played by [[DJ Cipha Sounds|Cipha Sounds]], to turn the music up. With this, the people still boring now begin dancing to Rihanna's track, including Canadian rapper [[Kardinal Offishall]], who also makes a cameo appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Kardinal+Offishall/+wiki|title=Kardinal Offishall's Biography|publisher=[[Last.fm]]|access-date=17 August 2009}}</ref> Scenes of people dancing in the club are shown, with intercut shots being juxtaposed of Rihanna leaning against a wall with the word "Bar" in LED lights (which is actually part of a Parking sign outside of the window). She dons a pastel blue short dress, singing to the lyrics of the song. Rihanna can be seen belly-dancing on the stage, with neon green laserlights transmit above her. After Rihanna gets the crowd moving, she runs off of the platform onto a dance floor, where the crowd later join her. The video's final scenes show the people in the club all gathered on the middle of the dance floor, choreographing different dance moves. These include a line of people featuring Rihanna, and male dancers who teach a bicycle from their bodies.<ref name="YouTube1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEauWw9ZGrA&ob=av3e|title=Rihanna – Pon de Replay|publisher=[[Universal Music Group]]|access-date=17 August 2009}}</ref>
