{{Main|History of Stanford University}}

Stanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to Leland Stanford Jr, their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by [[Herbert Hoover]] to preserve artifacts related to [[World War I]]. The Stanford Medical Center, completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] (originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University|title=Stanford University – Location, Enrollment, & Notable Alumni|publisher=britannica.com|date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>

Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern universities, most specifically [[Cornell University]]. Stanford opened being called the "Cornell of the West" in 1891 due to faculty being former Cornell affiliates (either professors, alumni, or both) including its first president, [[David Starr Jordan]]. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to have higher education be accessible, nonsectarian, and open to women as well as to men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt this radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Margo Baumgartner |last2=Nilan |first2=Roxanne |title=The Stanford Album: A Photographic History, 1885–1945 |date=1989 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1639-0 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0qpzomMwkC&pg=PA14 |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:View Stanford.jpg|thumb|An [[aerial photography|aerial photograph]] of the center of the Stanford University campus in 2008.]]

Most of Stanford University is on an {{convert|8180|acre|sqmi km2|1|adj=on}}<ref name="stanford_facts_glance" /> campus, one of the largest in the [[United States]].{{#tag:ref|It is often stated that Stanford has the largest contiguous campus in the world (or the United States)<ref name="virtualtour">{{cite web

Stanford's main campus includes a [[Stanford, California|census-designated place]] within [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], although some of the university land (such as the [[Stanford Shopping Center]] and the [[Stanford Research Park]]) is within the city limits of [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] (including the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] and the [[Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve]]), as well as in the city limits of [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] (Stanford Hills neighborhood), [[Woodside, California|Woodside]], and [[Portola Valley, California|Portola Valley]].<ref name="stanford_facts_lands">{{cite web

=== Central campus ===
The academic central campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]], Stanford Avenue, Jane Stanford Way, and [[Sand Hill Road]]. The [[United States Postal Service]] has assigned it two [[ZIP Codes]]: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for [[Post-office box|P.O. box]] mail. It lies within [[area code 650]].

=== Non-central campus ===
Stanford currently operates in various locations outside of its central campus.

On the founding grant:
* [[Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on}} natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research.
* [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest [[linear particle accelerator]] in the world, {{convert|2|mi|km}} on {{convert|426|acre|ha}} of land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.slac.stanford.edu/AboutSLAC.aspx | title=About SLAC |access-date= April 4, 2011}}</ref>
* Golf course and a seasonal lake: The university also has its own golf course and a seasonal lake ([[Lake Lagunita]], actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the vulnerable [[California tiger salamander]]. As of 2012 [[Lake Lagunita]] was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/12/05/lake-lag-feels-brunt-of-adverse-weather/ |title=University monitors Lake Lagunita after fall storms |access-date=December 20, 2013 |date=December 5, 2012 |author=Julia Enthoven |publisher=[[The Stanford Daily]]}}</ref>

Off the founding grant:
* [[Hopkins Marine Station]], in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]], California, is a [[marine biology]] research center owned by the university since 1892.

=== Faculty residences ===
Many Stanford faculty members live in the "Faculty Ghetto," within walking or biking distance of campus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford Faculty Staff Housing|url=http://fsh.stanford.edu/index.shtml|access-date=December 20, 2013}}</ref> The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned entirely by Stanford. Similar to a [[condominium]], the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the "Ghetto" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall [[Silicon Valley]] values.

=== Other uses ===
Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the [[Stanford Shopping Center]] and the [[Stanford Research Park]]. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the [[Palo Alto Unified School District]] for several schools including [[Palo Alto High School]] and [[Gunn High School]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Breitrose|first1=Charlie|title=SCHOOLS: District wants Stanford land for school|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/news/1998_Dec_2.LAND.html|access-date=January 24, 2016|newspaper=Palo Alto Weekly|date=December 2, 1998}}</ref> El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park (established 1914), is also on Stanford land.<ref>{{cite web|title=El Camino Park|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=105&TargetID=14|publisher=City of Palo Alto|access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>

== Administration and organization ==
Stanford University is a private, non-profit university that is administered as a [[corporate trust]] governed by a privately appointed [[board of trustees]] with a maximum membership of 38.<ref name="stanford_facts_admin" />{{refn|group=note|The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s the board decided that 15 members was not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee ''ex officio''.<ref name="FoundingGrant" /> The last original trustee, [[Timothy Hopkins]], died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D.

=== Computer and applied sciences ===
* [[ARPANET]] – [[Stanford Research Institute]], formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.<ref name="SU-ITS">{{cite web|url=http://itservices.stanford.edu/service/network|title=Network (SUNet — The Stanford University Network)|date=July 16, 2010|publisher=Stanford University Information Technology Services|access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://university-discoveries.com/stanford-university|title=Stanford University|publisher=University Discoveries|access-date=February 8, 2017}}</ref>
* [[Internet]]—Stanford University was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. [[Vint Cerf]] led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn ([[Bob Kahn]]) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.
* [[Frequency modulation synthesis]] – [[John Chowning]] of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to [[Yamaha Corporation]].
* [[Google]] – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] when they were both PhD students at Stanford.<ref name="milestones">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html|title=Google Milestones|publisher=Google, Inc.|access-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref> They were working on the [[Stanford Digital Library Project]] (SDLP).

* [[Klystron tube]] – invented by the brothers [[Russell and Sigurd Varian]] at Stanford. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.<ref>Varian, Dorothy. "The Inventor and the Pilot". Pacific Books, 1983 p. 187</ref> Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on [[radar]] equipment.
* [[RISC]] – [[DARPA|ARPA]] funded [[VLSI project]] of [[microprocessor]] design. Stanford and [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The [[Stanford MIPS]] would go on to be commercialized as the successful [[MIPS architecture]], while [[Berkeley RISC]] gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the [[SPARC]]. Another success from this era were [[IBM]]'s efforts that eventually led to the [[IBM POWER instruction set architecture]], [[PowerPC]], and [[Power ISA]]. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the [[Unix workstation]] market as well as [[embedded processor]]s in [[laser printer]]s, [[router (computing)|routers]] and similar products.<ref name="coinrisk">{{cite book|title=Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology|url=https://archive.org/details/milestonesincomp0000reil|url-access=registration|last=Reilly|first=Edwin D.|year=2003|isbn=1-57356-521-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/milestonesincomp0000reil/page/50 50]}}</ref>

In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/rde/shs/ugrad/wilbur.htm#junipero |archive-date=October 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151009205734/https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/#junipero |url-status=dead|title=Stanford University—Student Housing—Tour Undergraduate Housing |publisher=Stanford.edu |access-date=July 9, 2010 }}</ref>

[[housing cooperative|Co-ops]] or "Self-Ops" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial [[LGBT]] house),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/coop/cgi-bin/public/wiki.php?wikiid=1&pagename=Terra|title=About Terra|work=ResEd|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=February 8, 2016}}</ref> and Synergy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/resed/Staff/StaffResources/StudentMgmt/CoOps.html |title=Residential Education—Cooperative Houses |publisher=Stanford University |access-date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.<ref>This chapter had voiced concern that women were being treated unfairly due to the campus ban on sororities.

=== Traditions ===
[[File:Stanford banner.jpg|thumb|Vintage Stanford University postcard]]
* The unofficial motto of Stanford University, selected by President Jordan, is "''Die Luft der Freiheit weht.''"<ref name="stanford_facts_founding">{{cite web|title=Stanford Facts: The Founding of the University
|url=http://facts.stanford.edu/about/|publisher = Stanford University| date = 2014| access-date = December 11, 2014}}</ref> Translated from the German language, this quotation from [[Ulrich von Hutten]] means, "The wind of freedom blows." The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.<ref name="casper" />
* {{anchor|Hail, Stanford, Hail!}}"Hail, Stanford, Hail!" is the Stanford Hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various University singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in Economics and later became associate professor of Sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=39027 |title=Century at Stanford |author=Karen Bartholomew |publisher=Alumni.stanford.edu |date=March–April 2002 |access-date=August 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.stanford.edu/Assets/StanfordHymn.pdf|title=Hail, Stanford Hail! |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095506/http://music.stanford.edu/Assets/StanfordHymn.pdf|archive-date=February 2, 2014}}</ref>

Technically, this degree is awarded by the Stanford Associates, a voluntary group that is part of the university's alumni association. As Stanford's highest honor, it is not conferred at prescribed intervals, but only when appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include [[Herbert Hoover]], [[Bill Hewlett]], [[Dave Packard]], [[Lucile Packard Foundation for Children's Health#Lucile Packard|Lucile Packard]], and [[John W.

* Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at [[Main Quad (Stanford University)|Main Quad]].
* Mausoleum Party: An annual [[Halloween]] Party at the [[Stanford Mausoleum]], the final resting place of [[Leland Stanford Jr.]] and his parents.

=== Religious life ===
Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is "to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.
[[Stanford Memorial Church]], in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the "Protestant Ecumenical Christian" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.<ref>{{cite web| title = University Public Worship
| work = Office for Religious Life| publisher = Stanford University| url = http://web.stanford.edu/group/religiouslife/cgi-bin/wordpress/memorial-church/university-public-worship/
| access-date = October 5, 2013}}</ref> In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over 20 years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.

In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Baha'i, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.<ref>{{cite web| title = Stanford Associated Religions| work = Office for Religious Life | publisher = Stanford University

The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the "Windhover" paintings by [[Nathan Oliveira]], the late Stanford professor and artist.<ref>{{cite web| last = Xu| first = Victor| title = Windhover contemplative center to finish by early summer| work = The Stanford Daily| publisher = The Stanford Daily

=== Greek life ===
Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891, when the university first opened. In 1944, University President [[Donald Tresidder]] banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chapters.kappakappagamma.org/betaeta/pages/our-chapter.php |title=Kappa Kappa Gamma |publisher=Chapters.kappakappagamma.org |date=April 26, 1944 |access-date=July 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528005547/http://chapters.kappakappagamma.org/betaeta/pages/our-chapter.php |archive-date=May 28, 2010  }}</ref> However, following [[Title IX]], the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/chiomega/cgi-bin/history.php|title=Chi Omega – Nu Alpha – History|website=Cgi.stanford.edu|access-date=September 19, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120104456/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/chiomega/cgi-bin/history.php |archive-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.<ref name="greek-faq">{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://resed.stanford.edu/life-residences/about-fraternity-and-sorority-life-fsl/recruitment-and-intake/frequently-asked|website=Stanford Residential Education|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=June 17, 2016}}</ref>

As of 2016 Stanford had 31 Greek organizations, including 14 sororities and 16 fraternities.

=== Student groups ===
As of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://admission.stanford.edu/student/communities/index.html | title=Campus Communities & Service Opportunities: Student Organizations | publisher=Stanford University | access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref> Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include "special fees," which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body.
