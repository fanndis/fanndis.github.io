==Royal correspondent==
In 1985, Bond became a radio news reporter and in 1988 she began to report for  television, both for the BBC. She became a royal correspondent, which was to bring her to public attention, in 1989. During the 1990s she combined her reporting with several presentational roles&nbsp;– regularly fronting ''[[Breakfast News]]'', the ''[[BBC News at One|BBC One O'Clock News]]'' and the ''[[BBC News at Six|BBC Six O'Clock News]]'', including presenting the ''Six O'Clock News'' on the day of the death of her close friend and fellow newsreader [[Jill Dando]].<ref name="Interview"/>

Bond held the position as royal correspondent until the summer of 2003. During that time she reported on many dramatic and notable events to do with the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], including the [[1992 Windsor Castle fire]]; two royal weddings; the break-up of [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|the Duke of York]]'s marriage to [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Sarah Ferguson]]; the divorce of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|the Prince]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess of Wales]]; the deaths of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], and has reported on [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]]'s celebrations of [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her Golden Jubilee]].<ref name="Interview"/> She has also travelled extensively with the Royal Family. She was in Australia, in January 1994, when an attempt was made to shoot the Prince of Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2839421.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Bond gives up royal job|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Bond's reporting style suggested that she was very close personally to members of the Royal Family. She commented that she had become close to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and that her death came as a great shock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3096614.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Bond says her BBC farewell|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> She actually instigated her first extended meeting with Diana in June 1995.<ref name="STimes20201115">{{cite news|last=Bond|first=Jennie|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news-review/jennie-bond-on-princess-diana-just-between-us-and-these-four-walls-she-bared-her-soul-to-me-first-0drprghrn|title=Jennie Bond on Princess Diana: just between us and these four walls, she bared her soul to me first|work=The Sunday Times|date=15 November 2020|access-date=15 November 2020}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Bond sent the princess a note, suggesting that if she was to report on Diana properly then she should at least know what her character was actually like, not basing her thoughts on stories that had appeared in newspapers. She commented on that meeting at [[Kensington Palace]], stating: "Princess Diana was charming, articulate, fresh, interesting, but [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]. She knew I was a journalist. This was no girlie-girlie meeting."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/highlights/011002_bond.shtml|title=Jennie Bond: The royal reporter  - BBC World Service|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> In November 2020, Bond wrote in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that the princess told her virtually all of the details she later said to [[Martin Bashir]] in the interview she gave for ''[[Panorama (British TV programme)|Panorama]]'' in November 1995.<ref name="STimes20201115" />

She travelled with Diana, Princess of Wales on her trip to Angola, with the Queen on her first official visits to Russia in 1994 and when she met [[Nelson Mandela]] in South Africa a year later.<ref name="Interview"/> However, her hardest and most challenging assignments were when she had to report on [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|the death]] and [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997.<ref name="Interview"/>

Bond wrote a book in 2001 called ''Reporting Royalty'', which tells how she covered the Royal Family in the 1990s. Impressionists such as [[Ronni Ancona]] on ''[[Alistair McGowan's Big Impression]]'' took to satirising Bond's royal reports by posing as Bond and pretending to be the Queen herself, crown and all; in one sketch it was announced that Bond was to imminently accede to the throne.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Life after the BBC==
Following her departure from the BBC in 2003, Bond's career took a different turn. In 2003, she made an appearance in an episode of the comedy series ''[[Little Britain]]''.
