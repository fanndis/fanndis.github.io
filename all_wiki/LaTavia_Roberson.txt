==Early life==

Roberson was born '''LaTavia Marie Roberson''' on November 1, 1981 in Houston Texas to Cheryl Lastrap and Terry Roberson.{{cn|date=November 2020}} In the 1980s, before joining Destiny's Child, Roberson was a child model, appearing in commercials such as Soft and Beautiful's Just for Me Hair Care [[relaxer]] for kids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lataviaroberson.com/|title=Latavia House|website=Latavia House}}</ref>

==Career==

===1990–2000: Girl's Tyme and Destiny's Child===
When LaTavia was nine years old, she auditioned for a girl group to become a rapper and dancer, and was one of the many girls who got through. She met [[Beyoncé Knowles]] on the same day of the audition for the group and became best friends, singing and dancing with other local girls in which LaTavia and Beyoncé made a video for the song "One Time". She then met [[Kelly Rowland]] in elementary school after hearing her sing she told her to try out for the group which she did. Initially LaTavia was a rapper and dancer at the time and did not sing; subsequently she had vocal lessons and, after singing at local events, LaTavia got her break when she entered the singing competition TV show ''[[Star Search]]'' with Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, [[Tamar Davis]] and LaTavia's cousins Nikki and Nina Taylor. The group, then named Girl's Tyme were heartbroken after losing the competition to Skeleton Crew.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://people.com/celebrity/skeleton-crew-meet-the-band-that-beat-beyonce-on-star-search/ |title=Skeleton Crew: Meet the Band Who Beat a Young Beyoncé on Star Search |work=People |access-date=October 22, 2018 }}</ref> Beyonce's father [[Mathew Knowles]] began to manage the group, and he changed the line-up as the group was then reduced to a quartet, with best-friend Beyoncé, Rowland, and Beyoncé's elementary school friend [[LeToya Luckett]]. The group underwent several name changes: The Dolls, Something Fresh, and Cliché. They were shortly signed to [[Elektra Records]]. However the group were dropped by the label. After plenty of training done by the manager to become prepared and ready for the music industry, they were signed by [[Columbia Records]] in 1997 by the name of Destiny's Child with Knowles as lead vocalist, Rowland as second-lead vocalist, and Roberson and Luckett as background vocalists. Roberson was the [[alto]], adding the low notes, and Luckett was the [[soprano]], adding the high notes to the group's harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7503986/why-beyonce-shades-kelly-rowland-destinys-child-interview|title=LeToya Luckett Talks Beyonce's Cough In That Old Destiny's Child Interview|date=January 31, 2014|website=idolator}}</ref> Roberson was designated as the group's spokesperson. In 1998, Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut album ''[[Destiny's Child (album)|Destiny's Child]]''. The singles were "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]" featuring [[Wyclef Jean]] and "[[With Me (Destiny's Child song)|With Me]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/destinys-child|title=Destiny's Child – News, Music Performances and Show Video Clips |publisher=MTV}}</ref> Roberson can be heard rapping in the song "Illusions". Later in 1998, their song "[[Get on the Bus (song)|Get on the Bus]]" featuring [[Timbaland]] (which was released as a single in Europe) was featured on the ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' soundtrack. The song was the lead single for their second album. Destiny's Child toured as an opening act on [[TLC (band)|TLC]]'s [[FanMail Tour]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]'s debut tour.

In 1999, Destiny's Child released their second album ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]''. It became one of the biggest selling albums released by a female group and was certified eight-times platinum in the U.S. The album includes four hit singles, "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]", "[[Bug a Boo]]", "[[Say My Name]]", and "[[Jumpin', Jumpin']]".<ref>https://www.stereogum.com/2051843/destinys-child-the-writings-on-the-wall/franchises/reviews/the-anniversary/</ref> LaTavia also gained co-writing contribution more on this album than their first. Roberson performed lead on two songs: "Sweet Sixteen" and "Where'd You Go". Additionally LaTavia sang lead on the song "Can't Help Myself" but this song only was released on the albums ''Houston Edition''. In late 1999, in the midst of the success of ''The Writing's on the Wall'', Roberson and [[LeToya Luckett]] attempted to bring in a third-party mediator to work with their manager Mathew Knowles; however, the pair soon found themselves on the outs with Knowles.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/20050613/story.jhtml Destiny's Child's Long Road to Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' for Nothing)] MTV</ref> When the "Say My Name" video debuted in February 2000, the pair learned<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/qvvgw7/original-destinys-child-member-latavia-roberson-on-finding-her-own-sound |title=original destiny's child member latavia roberson on finding her own sound |date=September 11, 2017 |work=I-d }}</ref> they'd been replaced by [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]], which led to several lawsuits with the outcome of Roberson and Luckett being entitled to royalty checks from the previous albums they had made with the group.

While in Destiny's Child with the other members, LaTavia had appeared in music videos for artists such as [[Jagged Edge (American group)|Jagged Edge]]. Roberson performed with Destiny's Child in live shows and had won awards such as [[Soul Train Music Awards]]. She also starred in TV roles such as ''[[Smart Guy]]'' and the movie ''Beverly Hills'' with the other members of the group.

===2001–2003: Anjel===
Following the break-up, Roberson and Luckett won two Grammys for their contribution to Destiny Child's "Say My Name". After that, they formed a group called Anjel with two other girls, Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin. In 2000, Linda Casey, the mother of [[Jagged Edge (American group)|Jagged Edge]]'s Brian and Brandon Casey, had held a talent search in Connecticut. This contest would determine the newest member of the group, Natasha Ramos. Due to personality differences, Ramos left the group. Before leaving, she introduced them to Naty Quinones, who auditioned and was added to the group. In February 2001, Anjel attended the Grammys. Later that year, Tiffany Beaudoin was introduced to Anjel by a mutual friend, and joined after an audition. They recorded a 22-track demo, planning to release their album, Heavenly, with the help of Jagged Edge.<ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/1441286/ex-destinys-child-members-say-their-name-is-angel/</ref> They also appeared in the music video for Jagged Ege's "Where the Party At" remix. The group made one live appearance in 2001 on Good Day, NY; where they talked about the album they were working on and sang part of their song "Missing You".

Unfortunately, the production company which handled the group fell through and all the girls from Anjel went their separate ways. Their label was 581 Entertainment, ran by Jagged Edge under [[So So Def Recordings]], while it was still under [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. So So Def owner [[Jermaine Dupri]]'s decision to leave Columbia caused problems with 581 Entertainment. Prior to Dupri's move, Anjel's project was on track to be released. The members decided to look into individual projects while group business issues were being handled. In 2003, the record company soon folded and the group broke up. The group never released Heavenly and split up, before actually recording a full album. The tracks were later leaked on the internet.

===2004–2011: Personal endeavors and solo career===
In 2005, LaTavia got invited to replace [[Kandi Burruss|Kandi]] in the group [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]], but passed on the opportunity due to her priority to take care of her family at home in Houston.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sheairbutters.com/|title=Sheair Butters – Shea Nilotica Body Butter|website=Sheair Butters}}</ref>

In July 2006, it was confirmed by LaTavia herself, that she had been secretly recording her debut album on and off since March 2006. She collaborated with producers such as [[Scott Storch]] and hoped to work with Houston rappers [[Mike Jones (rapper)|Mike Jones]] and [[Slim Thug]] in the future, but was quick to point out it was in no way an attempt to recreate the success of former bandmate [[LeToya Luckett]]. Her album would appear sometime in 2009, called 'Black Summer's Night', a mix of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] meets [[jazz]] and [[Soul music|soul]], with help from [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Polow da Don]], and [[André 3000]] of [[Outkast]].<ref>{{Citation |last=MrTavMarie110181 |title=LaTavia's Old Myspace Message |date=January 12, 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=986XFhBrt1Q |access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref> Unfortunately, she never managed to complete this album, so it was never released.

In 2007, LaTavia along with other [[Destiny's Child]] past members [[LeToya Luckett]] and [[Farrah Franklin]] appeared in the TV series [[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (TV series)|''Boulevard of Broken Dreams'']] telling their side of the story about what happened during their time with Destiny's Child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949990/|title=Destiny's Child/Jonathan Brandis|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>

In 2008, LaTavia was in a stage play ''Those Jeans''. It was described as "a truly well written love story, about a fashion designer and a high fashion photographer, looking for love in all the wrong places". It ran from April 18, 2008, to July 12, 2008.

In 2009, LaTavia featured in the song "Swagga Check" by Young Sween on his album ''The Goodie Room'', released by Fleet Street Records; the song was mistakenly named "Holdin on to You" on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160910092153/https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/store/music/album/young-sween/the-goodie-room/8d6kgx6nmn7l]</ref>

In 2010, LaTavia appeared on ''[[The Real Housewives of Atlanta]]'' speaking to her then-lawyer [[The Real Housewives of Atlanta|Phaedra Parks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hellobeautiful.com/1446365/latavia-talks-about-being-fired-from-destinys-child-on-rhoa-video/|title=LaTavia Talks About Being Fired From Destiny's Child On "RHOA"|date=November 9, 2010}}</ref> During this episode, Roberson talked about how she dealt with alcoholic problems and getting in trouble with the law for a [[Driving under the influence|DWI]].

Season 3 of R&B Divas consisted of eleven episodes starring LaTavia (including the reunion shows).<ref>http://www.eurweb.com/2014/06/rb-divas-fans-blast-latavia-roberson-for-being-too-chicken-to-sing-video/</ref> To promote R&B Divas, she appeared on [[the Wendy Williams Show]] in May 2014.

=="Survivor" lawsuit==
In March 2000, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and the group. This began a media battle in which the two sides exchanged barbs in magazine and newspaper interviews. Roberson and Luckett agreed to a settlement that required them to drop the part of their lawsuit that targeted their former group members (though they retained the suit against Mathew Knowles) and required both sides to stop disparaging each other in public.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bing.com/search?q=destiny%27s+child+survivor+lawsuit&form=EDGNTC&qs=PF&cvid=6779a72b61014ea6abd5704c39d667d2&pq=destiny%27s+child+survivor+lawsuit|title=destiny's child survivor lawsuit – Bing|website=bing.com}}</ref> Roberson and Luckett later filed another suit against Destiny's Child. They claimed that the first single, "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]", from the group's 2001 album [[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|of the same name]], violated their previous settlement. As evidence, Roberson and Luckett cited lyrics, such as "thought I couldn't sell without you, sold nine million", which they believed referenced the ugly split. In July 2002, Destiny's Child again settled out of court with the pair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1456291/destinys-child-settle-with-ex-members-over-survivor-dis/|title=Destiny's Child Settle With Ex-Members Over 'Survivor' Dis|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|publisher=MTV News}}</ref>
