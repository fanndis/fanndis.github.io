"'''Right Here, Right Now'''" is a song by British [[big beat]] musician [[Fatboy Slim]], released on 19 April 1999 as the fourth single from his second studio album ''[[You've Come a Long Way, Baby]]''. The song reached number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], behind [[Westlife]]'s single "[[Swear It Again]]" for one week. It was voted by ''[[Mixmag]]'' readers as the tenth-greatest dance record of all time.<ref>[http://mixmag.net/words/news/what-is-the-greatest-dance-track-of-all-time What is the Greatest Dance Track of All Time?] ''[[Mixmag]]'' (15 February 2013).</ref>

==Composition==
The basic string melody of the song was sampled from the [[James Gang]] song "Ashes, the Rain & I". The lyrics "''right here, right now''" are a sample of [[Angela Bassett]]'s voice saying "''This is your life, right here, right now!''" from the film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' at the 1:43:21 mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strange Days movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3Aeb8yx4_k|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> The album version of "Right Here, Right Now" ends with a radio talk between Bradley Jay, a DJ of the [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]] radio station of [[Boston]], and a Fatboy Slim fan called Brad.

==Critical reception==
''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' said the song is "brilliant".<ref>"Chart Slot". ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''. 7 May 1999. Retrieved 3 December 2020.</ref>

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for the song, created by [[Hammer & Tongs]], is an elaborate homage to the famous opening sequence of the French educational series ''[[Once Upon a Time... Man]]''. It shows a (scientifically inaccurate) timeline depicting the entire process of [[human evolution]] condensed into three and a half minutes. The beginning of the music video is set "350 billion years ago", and starts with a single celled [[eukaryote]] in the ocean evolving into a [[jellyfish]], a [[pufferfish]], and then a predatory fish. It manages to eat a smaller fish before leaping up onto dry land. With a [[dinosaur]] visible in the background and an insect in front, it stays still for a few seconds before setting off and eating the insect. The land-fish evolves into a small [[alligator]] as it enters a forest. It sees a tall tree, which it climbs up.  Its body is obscured by the tree as its hands visibly evolve until it arrives at the top as a [[baboon]]-like [[ape]]. It jumps from the tree into an icy landscape, enduring a [[blizzard]] as it evolves into a larger, [[gorilla]]-like ape. At the end of a large cliff, the ape beats its chest as the camera zooms out to show a vast desert. The ape jumps onto the ground, where it has evolved into a primate resembling an [[homo erectus]]. A large storm blows away much of its hair, turning it into a [[human]] (at this point the timer at the bottom right slows dramatically). The human runs faster and puts on some [[trousers]] and a T-[[shirt]] with the logo "I'm #1 so why try harder". When fully clothed, it turns into a modern human with a beard. The man walks through a city environment and eats a [[hamburger]] (taken from a cardboard cutout of Fatboy Slim himself), he pulls off the beard and morphs into the obese character depicted on the cover of the album. He finally sits down on a bench at night, at which point the video ends.
