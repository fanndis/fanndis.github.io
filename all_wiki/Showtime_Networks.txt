'''Showtime Networks Inc.''' is an American entertainment company that oversees the company's [[pay television|premium]] [[cable television]] [[television channel|channel]]s, including its flagship service [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. It is a subsidiary of media conglomerate [[ViacomCBS]] under [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks|its domestic networks unit]].

==Overview==
The company was established in 1983 as '''Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.''' after [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]] and [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]] (now [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]]) merged their premium channels, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[The Movie Channel]] respectively, into one division. In 1984, [[American Express]] sold their interest in Warner-Amex to Warner Communications (now [[WarnerMedia]]) making Warner the new half-owner of Showtime/TMC. In 1985, Warner sold its half-interest to Viacom, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary of Viacom. 1985 also saw the pay-per-view service [[In Demand|Viewer's Choice]] become part of the operation; it merged with rival PPV service Home Premiere Television in 1988, and Viacom ceded control to the cable companies that owned HPT (Viacom still held a stake until the 1990s). In 1988, the company was renamed '''Showtime Networks Inc.'''<ref>[https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117801025.html?categoryid=1013&cs=1 Variety June 7, 2001 25 memorable moments in Showtime's 25-year history]</ref>

On March 1, 1994, a partnership between Showtime Networks and [[Home Box Office, Inc.]] (parent of HBO and Cinemax) implemented a cooperative [[United States pay television content advisory system|content advisory system]] that was initially unveiled across Showtime, The Movie Channel and the HBO properties that would provide specific content information for pay-cable subscribers to determine the suitability of a program for children. The development of the system—inspired by the advisory ratings featured in Showtime and The Movie Channel's respective program guides and those distributed by other participating premium cable services—was in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups about violent content on television, allowing the Showtime Networks and other services to assign individual ratings corresponding to the objectionable content depicted in specific programs (and categorized based on violence, profanity, sexuality or miscellaneous mature material). Labels are assigned to each program at the discretion of the participating service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Leaders to Develop Violence Ratings|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-870441.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611020259/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-870441.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|author=Ellen Edwards|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 11, 1994|accessdate=March 11, 2013|url-access=subscription}}</ref> A revised system—centered around ten content codes of two to three letters in length—was implemented across the Showtime Networks and Home Box Office services on June 10, 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Premium Cable Channels Adopt Content Labels|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-06-08/entertainment/ca-1867_1_cable-channels/|author=Steve Weinstein|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]]|date=June 8, 1994}}</ref>
