== History ==
The ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law'' was created by [[Wolfgang G. Friedmann]] and a group of Columbia law students belonging to the Columbia Society of International Law.<ref name=":0" /> The first volume, published in 1961 under the name the ''Bulletin of the Columbia Society of International Law'', consisted of informal discussions of international legal questions.<ref name=":0" /> The second volume, published in 1963 under the title ''International Law Bulletin'', adopted the tradition of the scholarly law review.<ref name=":0" />

During its second decade, the journal expanded publication to three issues per year, experimented with themed issues, and published some of the early proceedings of the Friedmann Conference which is held annually at Columbia Law School.<ref name=":0" /> By the beginning of its third decade, the journal’s themed issues—entire issues dedicated to the examination of current international law problems—became regular publications.<ref name=":0" /> These topical issues have examined international taxation, international trade embargoes and boycotts, China’s legal development, sovereign debt rescheduling, socialist law and international satellite communications.<ref name=":0" />
