==History==
The first Children's Peace Prize was launched in November 2005 during the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in [[Rome]], an annual meeting of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winners and international organisations such as [[UNICEF]] and [[Amnesty International]]. "We welcome the launch of Children’s Peace Prize during our summit," the summit's closing statement said.

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] presented the 2005 prize, which was posthumously awarded to [[Nkosi Johnson]], a [[South Africa]]n boy who brought international attention to children with HIV/AIDS and founded the [[Nkosi's Haven]] home for HIV-positive mothers and children. 

The 2006 award was handed out by Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]] in a ceremony at the [[Binnenhof]], the seat of the Dutch parliament in [[The Hague]]. The 2007 was presented at the Binnenhof by [[Bob Geldof]] and Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]]. The 2008 prize was presented by [[Desmond Tutu]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theirworld.org/news/us-school-shooting-campaigners-win-international-childrens-peace-prize|title=US teenagers who campaigned for safer schools win the International Children's Peace Prize|last=Theirworld|date=2019-08-29|website=Theirworld|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>
