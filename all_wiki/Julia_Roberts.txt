[[File:Ocean's11Cast.jpg|thumb|[[Brad Pitt]], [[George Clooney]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Andy García]], and Roberts with ''[[Ocean's Eleven]]'' director [[Steven Soderbergh]] in December 2001]]
Roberts' first film following ''Erin Brockovich'' was the road gangster comedy, ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), giving her a chance to work with long-time friend [[Brad Pitt]]. The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an [[independent film|independent production]] without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. ''The Mexican'' earned $66.8&nbsp;million at the U.S. box office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236493/|title=The Mexican|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>

Her next film, the romantic comedy ''[[America's Sweethearts]]'' (also 2001), starred Roberts along with [[Billy Crystal]], [[John Cusack]], and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]. Directed by [[Joe Roth]], the Hollywood [[farce]] centers on a [[supercouple]], Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked "sympathetic characters" and was "only funny in spurts."<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes | id=m/americas_sweethearts | title=America's Sweethearts}}</ref> A commercial success, it grossed over $138&nbsp;million worldwide, however.<ref>{{Mojo title | id=americassweethearts | title=America's Sweethearts}}</ref>

In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with ''Erin Brockovich'' director [[Steven Soderbergh]] for ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'', a [[Heist film|comedy-crime caper]] film and remake of the 1960 [[Rat Pack]] film [[Ocean's 11 (1960 film)|of the same name]], featuring an [[ensemble cast]] including [[George Clooney]], [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Matt Damon]]. Roberts played [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Tess Ocean|Tess Ocean]], the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by [[Angie Dickinson]], who is dating a casino owner played by [[Andy García]].  A success with critics and at the box office alike, ''Ocean's Eleven'' became the [[2001 in film#Top-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of the year]] with a total of $450&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{Mojo title | id=oceanseleven | title=Ocean's Eleven}}</ref>

In 2003, Roberts was cast in [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]'s drama film ''[[Mona Lisa Smile]]'', also starring [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], and [[Julia Stiles]]. Roberts received a record $25&nbsp;million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at [[Wellesley College]] in 1953 – the highest ever earned by an actress until then.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.forbes.com/2007/01/17/richest-women-entertainment-tech-media-cz_lg_richwomen07_0118womenstars_slide_9.html| title = The 20 Richest Women in Entertainment|work=Forbes| date = January 17, 2007| access-date = July 15, 2011| first1=Lea| last1=Goldman| first2=Kiri| last2=Blakeley}}</ref> The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it "predictable and safe".<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes | id=m/mona_lisa_smile | title=Mona Lisa Smile}}</ref>
