'''Sir George Iain Duncan Smith''' (born '''George Ian Duncan Smith'''; 9 April 1954), often referred to by his initials '''IDS''', is a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician. He served as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] from 2010 to 2016 and was previously [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2001 to 2003. He has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]], formerly [[Chingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford]], since [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]].

The son of a [[Royal Air Force]] [[flying ace]], Duncan Smith was born in [[Edinburgh]] and raised in [[Solihull]]. After education at the training school {{HMS|Conway|school ship|6}} and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], he served in the [[Scots Guards]] from 1975 to 1981, seeing tours in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Rhodesia]]. He joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1981. After unsuccessfully contesting [[Bradford West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford West]] in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], he was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].

After the resignation of [[William Hague]], Duncan Smith won the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election]], partly owing to the support of [[Margaret Thatcher]] for his [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] beliefs. However, many Conservative MPs came to consider him incapable of winning the next general election and, in 2003, passed a vote of no confidence in his leadership; he immediately resigned and was succeeded by [[Michael Howard]].

Returning to the backbenches, Duncan Smith became a published novelist. He then founded the [[Centre for Social Justice]], a [[centre-right]] [[think tank]] independent of the Conservative Party, and became chair of its [[Social justice|Social Justice]] Policy Group. In May 2010, new [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] appointed him to serve in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]]. He resigned from the Cabinet in March 2016, in opposition to Chancellor [[George Osborne]]'s proposed cuts to disability benefits.

==Early parliamentary career==
At the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] Duncan Smith contested the constituency of [[Bradford West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford West]], where the incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP [[Max Madden]] retained his seat.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-08-11|title=UK General Election results: June 1987|url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge87/i03.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811181223/http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge87/i03.htm|archive-date=2011-08-11|access-date=2020-06-10|website=politicsresources.net}}</ref> At the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] he stood in the London constituency of [[Chingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford]], a safe Conservative seat, following the retirement of Conservative MP [[Norman Tebbit]].

Duncan Smith remained on the [[backbencher|backbenches]] until 1997, when the new Conservative leader [[William Hague]] brought him into the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Shadow Secretary of State for Social Security]]. At the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], boundary changes saw his constituency renamed [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]] and his majority of 14,938 was reduced to 5,714. Duncan Smith realised the dangers that he and neighbouring Conservative MPs faced, so redoubled his efforts: "We spent the final week of the campaign working my seat as if it was a marginal. I held on but everywhere around me went."{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=2}} In 1999, Duncan Smith replaced [[John Maples]] as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2003-10-29|title=View from the grassroots|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3223461.stm|access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref>

[[William Hague]] resigned after the Labour Party continued in government with another large parliamentary majority following the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. In September 2001, Duncan Smith was the successful candidate in the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative Party leadership election]]. Although he was initially viewed as an outsider,  his campaign was bolstered when [[Margaret Thatcher]] publicly gave her support for him. His victory in the contest was helped by the fact that his opponent in the final vote of party members was [[Kenneth Clarke]], whose strong support for the [[European Union]] was at odds with the views of much of the party.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=13 September 2001|access-date=22 October 2010|title=Duncan Smith elected Tory leader|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1542554.stm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008182326/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1542554.stm|archive-date=8 October 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

Due to the [[September 11 attacks]], the announcement of Duncan Smith gaining the Conservative leadership was delayed until 13 September 2001. In November 2001, he was one of the first politicians to call for an invasion of [[Iraq]] and held talks in Washington, DC, with senior US officials, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]], [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]].<ref>Rupert Cornwell, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14433602 "Campaign Against Terrorism: Duncan Smith calls for pressure on Iraq"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Independent]]'', 30 November 2001.</ref>

In the [[2002 United Kingdom local elections|2002 local elections]], the first of two elections in which Duncan Smith led the party, the Conservatives gained 238 extra seats on local councils, primarily in England.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} VOTE 2002 {{!}} LOCAL ELECTIONS|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2002/local_elections/atoz.stm|access-date=2020-06-10|website=BBC News}}</ref> The 2002 Conservative Party conference saw an attempt to turn Duncan Smith's lack of charisma into a positive attribute, with his much-quoted line, "do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davies|first=Mark|date=2002-10-11|title=Duncan Smith: The Tories are back|language=en-GB|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2314149.stm|access-date=2020-06-11}}</ref> This prompted Labour [[backbenchers]] to raise their fingers to their lips and say "shush" when he was speaking during [[Prime Minister's Questions]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nelson|first=Nigel|date=2019-03-30|title=Iain Duncan Smith 'to join gang of Tories set to replace Theresa May as PM'|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/iain-duncan-smith-to-join-14210921|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Mirror}}</ref>

==Political views==
===Views on gay rights and marriage===
During his leadership campaign in 2001, Duncan Smith changed his stance from opposing repeal of [[Section 28]] of the [[Local Government Act 1988]] to supporting repeal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339340/Duncan-Smith-outrages-both-sides-with-Clause-28-switch.html|title=Duncan Smith outrages both sides with Clause 28 switch|first=Andy|last=McSmith|date=3 September 2001|access-date=21 April 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527042114/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339340/Duncan-Smith-outrages-both-sides-with-Clause-28-switch.html|archive-date=27 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2003, his decision to compromise on the repeal of Section 28 was described as "illogical" and "messy" by other Conservative MPs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2664163.stm|title=Section 28 compromise avoids a crisis|first=Nyta|last=Mann|work=BBC News Online|date=16 January 2003|access-date=21 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527114531/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2664163.stm|archive-date=27 May 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

Duncan Smith has become significantly involved in issues of family and social breakdown. He has stated his support for early interventions to reduce and prevent social breakdown.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|date=12 March 2012|title=Iain Duncan Smith: early intervention crucial to prevent social breakdown|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/12/duncan-smith-early-intervention-foundation|url-status=live|access-date=21 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111172314/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/12/duncan-smith-early-intervention-foundation|archive-date=11 November 2014}}</ref> In December 2010, he studied a state-sponsored relationship education programme in Norway, under which couples were forced to "think again" and confront the reality of divorce before formally separating. The policy has been credited with reversing Norway's trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to £100&nbsp;billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to "work through what is going to happen with their children", which has "a very big effect on their thinking". "Many of them think again about what they are going to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently," he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |title=IDS backs shock courses to stop couples splitting up |date=28 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012357/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8210666/IDS-backs-shock-courses-to-stop-couples-splitting-up.html |archive-date=6 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Duncan Smith said in February 2011 that it was "absurd and damaging" for ministers not to extol the benefits of marriage for fear of stigmatising those who choose not to marry. Duncan Smith said: "We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend to be associated with better outcomes for children. There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage." He added that "The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high. But what is most painful to see is the human cost – the wasted potential, the anti-social behaviour, and the low self-esteem."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |title=Couples should be encouraged to marry, says Iain Duncan Smith |date=8 February 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211084819/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/8310165/Couples-should-be-encouraged-to-marry-says-Iain-Duncan-Smith.html |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> In April 2012, he signalled his support for [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage]] on the basis that it would promote stability in relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|title=Iain Duncan Smith defies Catholic Church to back marriage for gay couples|work=PinkNews|date=28 April 2012|access-date=28 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429151542/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/04/28/iain-duncan-smith-defies-catholic-church-to-back-marriage-for-gay-couples/|archive-date=29 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Views on immigration===
Duncan Smith has said that tighter immigration controls are vital if Britain is to avoid "losing another generation to dependency and hopelessness". In a speech delivered in Spain he said that only immigrants with "something to offer" should be allowed into the country and that too often foreign workers purporting to be skilled take low-skilled jobs that could be occupied by British school leavers. According to ''The Daily Telegraph'''s analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron "that a 'slack' attitude to immigration will result in the Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as "an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed "a level playing field". "If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most vulnerable group who will be the most affected are young people," he said.<ref>Andrew Porter, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html Migrants 'take the jobs from young Britons'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827041733/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8609827/UK-jobs-Migrants-take-the-jobs-from-young-Britons.html |date=27 August 2019 }}, ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London)</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111104191200/http://www.fundacionfaes.org/record_file/filename/3098/2011_07_01_IAIN_DUNCAN_SMITH.pdf Address by Iain Duncan Smith at the opening session of the FAES campus], fundacionfaes.org; accessed 9 May 2015.</ref>

===Views on social credit===
Duncan Smith has called for cuts to [[Universal Credit]] to be reversed. Duncan Smith said, “Rolling out a new system, and pulling the money out of it the whole time, is very difficult to do it. It counters the whole purpose of what the welfare reforms are about.”<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/13/reverse-universal-credit-cuts-iain-duncan-smith-tells-chancellor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313110053/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/13/reverse-universal-credit-cuts-iain-duncan-smith-tells-chancellor |date=13 March 2018 }} ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

===''R (Miller) v. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union''===
On 3 November 2016 and in response to the decision of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in ''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|R (Miller) v. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]'' on whether the UK government was entitled to notify an intention to leave the [[European Union]] under [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] without a vote in [[Parliament]], Duncan Smith stated that "it's not the position of the courts to tell parliament or the Government how that process should work. It never has been. Their job is to interpret what comes out of parliament, not to tell parliament how it goes about its functions."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/europe/eu-policy-agenda/brexit/news/80467/updating-reaction-high-court-ruling-article-50 |title=UPDATING: Reaction to High Court ruling on Article 50 |date=3 November 2016 |work=Politics Home |location=London |access-date=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113180658/https://www.politicshome.com/news/europe/eu-policy-agenda/brexit/news/80467/updating-reaction-high-court-ruling-article-50 |archive-date=13 November 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Brexit===
In December 2019, Duncan Smith voted in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement.<ref>https://votes.parliament.uk/Votes/Commons/Division/736</ref> When the House of Commons debated the agreement at the time, Duncan Smith argued against further scrutiny by the House, stating that Members of the House "had more than 100 hours in committee over the last 3 and a half years ... If there is anything about this arrangement that we have not now debated, thrashed to death, I would love to know what it is."<ref>https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/video-of-ids-commons-speech-against-wa-scrutiny-found-on-twitter-1-6778151</ref> In August 2020, Duncan Smith subsequently said that because of clauses buried in the fine print of the Withdrawal Agreement, it costs too much and denies the UK true independence, urging the UK government to denounce it.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=MPIainDS |number=1290292769089626114 |date= 3 August 2020 |title= Denounce WA}}</ref>
