'''North Central College''' is a private [[liberal arts college]] in [[Naperville, Illinois]]. It is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]] and has nearly 70 areas of study in undergraduate majors, minors, and programs through 19 academic departments organized in three undergraduate colleges/schools (College of Arts and Sciences, School of Business and Entrepreneurship, School of Education and Health Sciences) and a masters program (School of Graduate and Professional Studies).

==History==
[[File:North Central College Old Main.jpg|300x300px|thumb|NCC Old Main in May 2013|left]]
North Central College was founded in 1861 as '''Plainfield College''' in [[Plainfield, Illinois]]. Classes were first held on November 11 of that year.  On February 15, 1864, the Board of Trustees changed the name of the school to '''North-Western College'''. The college moved to Naperville in 1870 and the name was again changed in 1926 to North Central College.

In June 2017, North Central College acquired [[Shimer College]] and instituted the Shimer Great Books School of North Central College.

North Central College is just 30 minutes from the [[Chicago Loop]] which allows students to have internships, jobs and other opportunities in Chicago.

==Campus==
The college is on a 65-acre (24 ha) campus in downtown Naperville on Chicago Avenue.

Old Main was completed in 1870 and remains the focal point of campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&d=p1235|title=The Council of Independent Colleges: Historic Campus Architecture Project|website=hcap.artstor.org|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref>

In the early 1900s, College President Herman J. Kiekhoefer and Judge John S. Goodwin initiated contact with philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]] to seek out funds for new facilities on campus. Carnegie agreed to donate $25,000 (approximately $679,059 in the current [[consumer price index]]) to then North-Western College for a new library building. Carnegie Library, as it was called, was one of only a few academic libraries in Illinois that received funding from Carnegie. The building still exists on campus and is now known as Carnegie Hall.

Pfeiffer Hall is North Central College's oldest fine arts building. The 4,500-square-foot building was built in 1926 and seats 1,057. This structure has been historically used by the college to screen films and host lectures, debates, and theatrical productions. Today Pfeiffer Hall continues to host events such as these along with live performances by popular music artists and comedians.

In 2008, North Central College dedicated the $30 million Wentz Concert Hall and Fine Arts Center. Designed by the Chicago architectural firm of [[Loebl Schlossman & Hackl]], the {{convert|57000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility was  planned and sited with the needs of both the College and the Naperville community in mind. Plans evolved over a 15-year period, driven by explosive growth in the college's music, theatre and art programs, as well as the parallel transformation of the city's downtown, which has brought more than 50 restaurants, numerous national stores and the first four- and five-story buildings within a few blocks of the North Central campus.

The concert hall is named in honor of [[Myron Wentz]], Class of 1963. Nearly $10 million in gifts from Wentz &mdash; a scientist, entrepreneur, and music lover &mdash; over the past two years have brought the facility to center stage. Plans for a new fine arts center were put on hold a decade ago when a devastating flood in Naperville forced the college to turn its attention to its damaged athletic complex instead.

[[File:Miley Swallow Hall.jpg|thumb|296x296px|Meiley Swallow Hall]]In addition to Wentz Concert Hall, the Fine Arts Center also features the Madden Theatre, which is a 150-seat “black box” experimental theatre that can double as a dance studio and a facility to provide music rehearsal space, practice rooms and offices. The center also houses a spacious lobby, a kitchen facility and the Schoenherr Art Gallery (all supportive of major civic gatherings).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://finearts.northcentralcollege.edu/venues/madden-theatre|title=North Central College Madden Theatre|publisher=North Central College Fine & Performing Arts}}</ref>

The rededication of Meiley-Swallow Hall, the old Grace Evangelical Church at Ellsworth Street and Van Buren Avenue, was a highlight during the 2007 Homecoming weekend. In 2005, the college embraced the opportunity to preserve a part of Naperville and North Central history by acquiring the former Grace Evangelical Church. The 95-year-old structure was erected by the same denomination that founded North Central College and an addition to the college's art and theatre programs. Special features of this building include nearly {{convert|23000|sqft|m2}} of space, much-needed art display area, a 225-seat thrust stage theatre, and additional office space.

==Academics==

North Central has all-college requirements, which include an intercultural seminar, a leadership, ethics, and values seminar, and a religion and ethics course, which are important components to the integrative curriculum.<ref name="North Central College Academics">{{cite web|url=http://northcentralcollege.edu/academics/curriculum/general-education|title=North Central College Academics|work=northcentralcollege.edu|access-date=2015-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215101323/http://www.northcentralcollege.edu/academics/curriculum/general-education|archive-date=2015-12-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> The college also has opportunities for individual work, such as the Richter Independent Study Grants and the Honors program's Senior Honors Thesis.<ref name="North Central College Academics"/> Students are encouraged to study abroad, with opportunities on five continents from three-week courses to full-time term-long or full-year programs.
