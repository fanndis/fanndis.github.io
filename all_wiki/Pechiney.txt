'''Pechiney SA''' was a major [[aluminium]] conglomerate based in [[France]].  The company was acquired in 2003 by the [[Alcan|Alcan Corporation]], headquartered in [[Canada]].<ref name=alcan/> In 2007, [[Alcan]] itself was taken over by mining giant [[Rio Tinto Alcan]].

Prior to its acquisition, Pechiney grew to be the world's 4th largest producer and developer of aluminium products, employing 34,000 people and operating 320 manufacturing and sales facilities in 50 countries at the time it was purchased by Alcan.  The group operated in all facets of the aluminium industry from [[bauxite]] mining to the development of sophisticated applications of metal products  in addition to international commodities trading and brokerage of the metal on the [[London Metal Exchange]] (LME).

Pechiney gained worldwide recognition for its use of [[electrolysis]] technology, and was a leader in specialty packaging and aerospace applications.<ref name=alcan>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3105208.stm Pechiney accepts Alcan bid].  BBC News, September 12, 2003</ref>

==History==
The company was founded in 1855 by Henri Merle as a producer of [[caustic soda]] at a [[manufacturing]] facility in [[Salindres]].  Founded as '''Compagnie des Produits Chimiques Henri Merle''' the company was renamed in 1897 the Société des Produits Chimiques d'Alais et de la Camargue.

The company first began producing aluminium [[metal]] in 1860 using a chemically-based process developed by [[Henri Sainte-Claire Deville]] in 1854 and was granted a 30-year [[monopoly]] by the French government.

During [[World War I]] (1914–18) [[Tréfileries et Laminoirs du Havre]] (TLH) acquired a large stake in the Société d'Alais et de la Camargue.
This company in turn took control of the Société électrométallurgique de Froges in 1919 to become the Compagnie des produits chimiques et électrométallurgiques d'Alais, Froges et Camargue.
Hippolyte Bouchayer represented TLH in Pechiney.{{sfn|Lagana|1990|p=106}}

Pechiney had developed a significant presence in Europe in the 1930s and first prospected the American market in 1911 before acquiring a strong foothold there in the 1960s.  In the 1954, Pechiney expanded into Africa and subsequently it developed a presence in Australia, Latin America, Greece and Asia.

The corporate name was changed to Pechiney in 1948, after a former influential managing director referred to by the same name, A. R. Pechiney.

In 1962 TLH merged with the [[Compagnie française des métaux]] and became [[Tréfimétaux]].{{sfn|Hours}}
In 1967 Tréfimétaux was acquired by Pechiney and became the copper division of that group, contributing 8% of the group's total.{{sfn|L’Histoire de Tréfimétaux – self}}
