"'''Safe & Sound'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] featuring [[alternative country]] duo [[The Civil Wars]], taken from ''[[The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond]]'', the official soundtrack for the 2012 film ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]''. The artists co-wrote the track with its producer, [[T-Bone Burnett]]; the song was written at Burnett's house within two hours.

The song was released to the [[iTunes Store]] in the United States on December 26, 2011, and was later added to the [[BBC Radio 1]] playlist in the United Kingdom. The song was critically lauded, with critics praising Swift's breathy vocals, the simplicity of the music, and its lyrics, with some citing it as a welcome return to form for Swift.

==Background==

"Safe & Sound" was written by Taylor Swift, [[Joy Williams (singer)|Joy Williams]], [[John Paul White]], and [[T-Bone Burnett]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond]]|author=Various artists|publisher=[[Mercury Records]]|type=liner notes|year=2011}}</ref> In summer 2011, [[Lionsgate]] required Burnett to record songs for ''[[The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond]]'', and he subsequently corralled a range of artists, including Swift, [[Maroon 5]], [[The Civil Wars]], and [[Arcade Fire]]. On a fall night in 2011, Burnett and the production team, as well as Swift and The Civil Wars, came to Burnett's house in [[Los Angeles]] to write the lyrics. After two hours, the song was finished. Swift further elaborated, "The Civil Wars had a show that night in L.A., so they raced right over to T Bone's house. There's so many things he could've done production-wise to make that song bigger sonically than it is, but I think that would have possibly been a mistake. For him to have left the song as a lullaby is brilliant."<ref name="RS">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-arcade-fire-talk-hunger-games-20120315|title=Taylor Swift, Arcade Fire Talk 'Hunger Games'|first=Monica|last=Herrera|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 29, 2012|access-date=July 26, 2014|archive-date=June 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627015052/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-arcade-fire-talk-hunger-games-20120315|url-status=live}}</ref>

"Safe & Sound" received near universal acclaim from [[music journalism|music critics]]. [[Jody Rosen]] from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the song four out of five stars, calling it Swift's "prettiest ballad."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/safe-and-sound-20111229 |title=Song Review, 'Safe & Sound' |author=Rosen, Jody |date=December 30, 2011 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=March 21, 2012 |archive-date=February 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EUqKFHkt?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/safe-and-sound-20111229 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a review of ''The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond'', [[AllMusic]]'s Heather Phares picked it as one of the highlights on the soundtrack, calling it "the most crucial" track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hunger-games-songs-from-district-12-and-beyond-mw0002308080|title=The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond|first=Heather|last=Phares|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 31, 2014|archive-date=October 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001172326/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hunger-games-songs-from-district-12-and-beyond-mw0002308080|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Idolator (website)|''Idolator'']] praised Swift's "breathiness that sounds more eerie than sweet",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/6121271/taylor-swift-hunger-games-song-safe-and-sound|title=Listen To Taylor Swift's Song 'Safe and Sound'|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=December 23, 2011|access-date=July 31, 2007}}</ref> while Jason Lipshutz writing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commended the "non-Swiftian anthem that embraces the folksiness of the soundtrack" and favored the guest appearance contributed by The Civil Wars.<ref name="Lipshutz"/> In a less favorable feedback, Darren Franich, and editor from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was not impressed towards the track's lyrics and Swift's vocals, writing that "there's no sense of triumph". He further added that "Safe & Sound" "sounds more like a funeral dirge than a victory chant, especially as the song continues with light percussion that sounds like soldiers marching to their doom."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/12/23/hunger-games-taylor-swift-safe-sound/|title='Hunger Games' song: Taylor Swift's 'Safe & Sound'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Darren|last=Franich|date=December 23, 2011|access-date=July 31, 2014|archive-date=May 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513144757/http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/12/23/hunger-games-taylor-swift-safe-sound/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''{{'}}s Christopher John Farley agreed, opining that the song "has a rural feel, but doesn't sound like a commercial country song."<ref name="WSJ"/> In a 2019 review, [[Idolator (website)|''Idolator'']]'s Mike Wass wrote: "With sparse, eerie production, "Safe & Sound" is one of the Swift's most beguiling singles.

During the Australian leg of the [[Speak Now World Tour]], Swift added "Safe & Sound" to the tour's setlist.<ref name="Nova">{{cite web|url=http://www.novafm.com.au/article/review-taylor-swift-sparkles-stage-melbourne|title=Review: Taylor Swift sparkles on stage in Melbourne|first=Giselle|last=Nguyen|publisher=[[Nova (radio network)|Nova FM]]|date=March 12, 2012|access-date=July 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402110905/http://www.novafm.com.au/article/review-taylor-swift-sparkles-stage-melbourne|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Swift performed the track while sitting on a couch onstage, wearing a "sparkling, floor-length gown", which, according to Brittany Cooper of Taste of Country, was slightly reminiscent of [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] from [[Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991). Cooper provided a positive feedback to the performance, writing that "[Swift] took the song with a whimsical air and gave it all the mystique you would expect from the haunting ballad."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-safe-and-sound-live-video/|title=Taylor Swift Performs 'Safe and Sound' Live in Australia|first=Brittany|last=Cooper|publisher=Taste of Country|date=March 9, 2012|access-date=July 27, 2014|archive-date=July 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727085505/http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-safe-and-sound-live-video/|url-status=live}}</ref>
