== Controversies ==
Ramos has issued violations to several high-profile tennis players who then objected to Ramos' penalties.<ref name=":1" />

=== 2016 French Open ===

During the [[2016 French Open]], Ramos issued a code violation to [[Nick Kyrgios]] after the latter shouted at a ball boy about a towel during a match.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/nick-kyrgios-through-in-straight-sets-after-umpire-altercation-at-french-open|title=Nick Kyrgios through in straight sets after umpire altercation at French Open|last=Mitchell|first=Kevin|date=2016-05-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> Kyrgios continued to clash with Ramos after the violation was issued, stating later that Ramos was operating on a double standard since Kyrgios claimed his opponent ([[Marco Cecchinato]]) was also committing violation-worthy offenses.<ref name=":3" />

=== 2016 Summer Olympics ===

At the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] Ramos issued a code violation to [[Andy Murray]] after Murray criticized Ramos' "stupid umpiring".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/tennis-murray-shrugs-off-stupid-row-reach-rio-164803972.html|title=Andy Murray shrugs off 'stupid' row to reach Rio tennis final|agency=AFP|date=13 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

=== 2017 French Open ===

During the [[2017 French Open]], Andy Murray received two time violations from Ramos, the second of which was a loss of first serve.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/19572153/andy-murray-fired-violation-french-open-win-kei-nishikori|title=Murray 'fired up' by 'strange' time violation|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}</ref> Murray noted that he indeed had been in violation of the controversial time rule and described Ramos as a "very good umpire", but he criticized the penalty.<ref name=":4" /> Ramos also gave [[Novak Djokovic]] a loss of first serve after Djokovic committed multiple time violations. Djokovic then yelled to himself in Serbian and flipped a tennis ball at a ball boy behind him, leading to Ramos penalizing him for unsportsmanlike conduct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2017/06/02/djokovic-muguzura-nadal-in-action-at-french-open/102416366/|title=All so difficult for Djokovic, easy for Nadal at French Open|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}</ref>

=== 2018 US Open ===
At the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open]] [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles|women's singles]] [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles final|final]] between Serena Williams and [[Naomi Osaka]], Ramos gave Williams three code violations. Williams' first code violation was a warning for receiving coaching during the match (Williams' coach, [[Patrick Mouratoglou]], later admitted to coaching using hand signals, though he noted the rule against such signals was not always enforced).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/09/08/patrick-mouratoglou-i-was-coaching-serena-during-match/|title=Patrick Mouratoglou: 'I was coaching' Serena during match|date=2018-09-08|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> Williams contested this, stating her coach had only given her a thumbs-up and reassuring Ramos that she never gets coaching or cheats. Later in the match, Williams intentionally broke her racket against the ground, incurring a second code violation from Ramos, which was a point penalty. Williams continued to argue with Ramos between games, first asking and then demanding he apologize for implying she was cheating by getting coaching, and then telling him, "''You stole a point from me''".<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/tennis/naomi-osaka-upsets-serena-williams-who-received-game-penalty-to-win-2018-us-open/2018/09/08/089e1df4-b39f-11e8-aed9-001309990777_story.html|title=Naomi Osaka upsets Serena Williams, who received game penalty, to win 2018 U.S. Open|website=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Ava|last=Wallace|date=9 September 2018|language=en|access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref> Willams then told Ramos: "''You will never, ever, ever be on another [tennis] court of mine as long as you live ... You owe me an apology. Say it. Say you’re sorry . . . How dare you insinuate that I was cheating. You stole a point from me. You're a thief, too.''".<ref name=":5" /> This exchange resulted in Ramos issuing Williams a third code violation for verbally abusing the umpire, which awarded a game to Osaka.<ref name=":5" /> Play was then stopped, and Williams called the tournament referee and supervisor onto the court, but the two officials upheld Ramos' violations. Williams went on to lose the match to Osaka 6–2 6–4.<ref name=":5" /> 

Williams was fined $17,000 for the violations.<ref>{{cite news | last = Lam | first = Katherine | title = Serena Williams fined $17,000 for violations during US Open final | newspaper = | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Fox News]] | date = 9 September 2018 | url = http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2018/09/09/serena-williams-fined-17000-for-violations-during-us-open-final.html | access-date = 9 September 2018}}</ref> After the match Williams accused Ramos of sexism by claiming that men were not penalized in the same manner for the same conduct she was accused of.
