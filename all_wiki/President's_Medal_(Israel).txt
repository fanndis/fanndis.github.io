'''President's Medal''' ({{lang-he|עיטור נשיא מדינת ישראל}}, ''Itur Nesi Medinat Yisra'el'') (also Medal of Distinction<ref>[http://www.president.gov.il/English/About/Pages/presidentawardofdistinction.aspx Presidential Medal of Distinction]</ref>) is the highest civil medal given by the [[State of Israel]]. 
==History==
The President's Medal was first presented on March 1, 2012 in [[Beit HaNassi]] by then President of Israel, [[Shimon Peres]]. It was awarded to five people and one organisation "who have made an outstanding contribution to the State of Israel or to humanity, through their talents, services, or in any other form."

The President's Medal, based on the French [[Légion d'Honneur]], was designed by Yossi Matityahu.<ref>[http://jerusalemworldnews.com/2012/02/10/peres-unveils-presidents-medal-for-service-to-israel/ Peres unveils “President’s Medal” for service to Israel]</ref>
