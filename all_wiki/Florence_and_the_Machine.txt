==History==

===2007–2008: Formation===
The name of Florence and the Machine is attributed to [[Florence Welch]]'s teenage collaboration with [[Isabella Summers|Isabella "Machine" Summers]]. Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, "The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad."<ref name="Timesbio">{{cite web |last=Patterson |first=Sylvia |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6838997.ece |title=Behind the success of Florence and the Machine |work=[[The Sunday Times]]  |date=20 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615093956/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6838997.ece |archive-date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="naming">{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Sean |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/life-style/real-lives/a-piece-of-my-mind-florence-welch-of-florence-and-the-machine-1.820514 |title=A piece of my mind: Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref>

In addition to Summers (keyboards and backing vocals), the current band members include musicians Robert Ackroyd (guitar and backing vocals), Chris Hayden (drums, percussion and backing vocals), Mark Saunders (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Tom Monger (harp).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomtheharpist.com/london.html |title=Tom in London |publisher=tomtheharpist.com |accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref> In the past, Welch has praised her band for understanding her creative process, claiming, "I've worked with most of them for a long time and they know my style, know the way I write, they know what I want."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.florenceandthemachine.net/biography/2-3 |title=Florence and the Machine: About |publisher=florenceandthemachine.net |accessdate=26 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105205126/http://www.florenceandthemachine.net/biography/2-3 |archive-date=5 November 2011  }}</ref>

===2011–2013: ''Ceremonials''===
{{Main|Ceremonials}}
[[File:Florence and the Machine.jpg|thumb|upright|Florence and the Machine performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] 2012]]
The first demo session occurred in January 2010 with Welch and [[Paul Epworth]] at a small London studio. Numerous producers expressed an interest in working on the album but Welch rejected the offers because she wanted ''Ceremonials'' to be a better version of ''Lungs'' with a "more dark, more heavy, bigger drum sounds, bigger bass, but with more of a whole sound". For the rest of the year work on the album continued only intermittently as the band concentrated on an extensive tour of the US, where ''Lungs'' had become popular. The majority of the writing for the album was done between January and April 2011, with recording taking place in April at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Refinement took place at Epworth's own London studios while Welch recorded vocal tracks in various US studios, during days off from touring.
