The '''Sapphire Jubilee of Elizabeth II''' on 6 February 2017, marked sixty-five years of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s reign. The [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning monarch in British history]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the first British monarch to have a [[sapphire jubilee]].<ref name=contemplation>{{cite web| last=Rayner| first=Gordon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/28/blue-sapphire-jubilee-queen-will-not-celebrate-65th-anniversary/|title=The Blue Sapphire Jubilee: Queen will not celebrate 65th anniversary but instead sit in 'quiet contemplation' remembering father's death| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=29 January 2017| accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>

Unlike her [[Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Golden]] and [[Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Diamond]] Jubilees, there were no widespread public celebrations of the Sapphire Jubilee. Instead, like the [[Ruby Jubilee of Elizabeth II|February 1992 Ruby Jubilee]], the Queen did not undertake any official engagements.<ref name=contemplation/><ref name=history>{{cite web| first1=Hannah| last1=Furness| first2=Danny| last2=Boyle| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/06/queen-makes-history-reaches-sapphire-jubilee/| title=Queen makes history with Sapphire Jubilee: Royal gun salutes mark 65-year reign| work=The Daily Telegraph| date=6 February 2017| accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref> As then, she spent the day in "quiet reflection" on the anniversary of the death of her father, [[George VI]], and undertaking official work at [[Sandringham House]].<ref name=contemplation/><ref name=history/> She attended a service at St Peter and St Paul Church in [[West Newton, Norfolk]] on Sunday 5 February, where she was greeted by crowds of well-wishers.<ref name=history/> Larger-scale celebrations took place in June 2016, to mark the Queen's 90th birthday, and any extensive celebrations would be reserved for a possible [[Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II|platinum jubilee]] in 2022.<ref name=history/><ref>{{cite news |first=Dena| last=Silver |url=http://observer.com/2017/02/queen-elizabeth-celebrates-the-sapphire-jubilee-with-lots-of-sapphires/ |title=Queen Elizabeth Celebrates the Sapphire Jubilee With Lots of Sapphires |journal=Observer |date=6 February 2017 |accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref> Despite proposals for larger celebrations to mark the 65th anniversary of the Queen's accession in June 2017, including a mooted [[bank holiday]], no such celebrations were held.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39182963| title=Queen's Sapphire Jubilee: Call to mark milestone with bank holiday| work=BBC News| date=6 March 2017 |accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>
