==History==

The Marshall Project began as an idea of Neil Barsky, a former hedge-fund manager, in November 2013. When writing an op-ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Barsky thought it might be a good opportunity to plug the idea, so he included a brief description of the project and the website URL in his byline.<ref name=deblasio>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/chill-out-1-percenters.html|title = Chill Out, 1 Percenters|last = Barsky|first = Neil|date = November 15, 2013|accessdate = May 8, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=capital-in-depth>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/magazine/2014/07/8548087/marshall-projects-charmed-launch|title = The Marshall Project's charmed launch|last = Pompeo|first = Joe|date = July 1, 2014|accessdate = May 7, 2015 |work=[[Capital New York]]}}</ref> Within a few weeks, he was contacted by several criminal justice organizations that offered funding support. In February 2014, ''The New York Times'' reported that Bill Keller, who had been executive editor at ''The New York Times'' from July 2003 to September 2011, was going to work for the Marshall Project.<ref name=capital-in-depth/><ref name=keller-leaves-nyt>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/business/media/bill-keller-former-editor-of-the-times-is-leaving-for-news-nonprofit.html |title = Bill Keller, Former Editor of The Times, Is Leaving for News Nonprofit|last = Somaiya|first = Ravi|date = February 9, 2014|accessdate = May 8, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

The Marshall Project publishes journalistic and opinion pieces on its own website, and also collaborates with news organizations and magazines to publish investigations. Its first two investigations were published in August 2014 (on its own website and in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' together) and in October 2014 (on its own website and in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'').<ref name=newsonomics/><ref name=capital-launch>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/10/8555216/marshall-project-launch-november|title = The Marshall Project to launch in November|date = October 23, 2014|accessdate = May 7, 2015|work = [[Capital New York]]}}</ref> It also publishes a weekly feature called "Life Inside," where people who work or live in the criminal justice system tell their stories in first-person essays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/tag/life-inside|title=Life Inside|website=The Marshall Project|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref> Until October 2018, Life Inside was co-published with [[Vice Media|VICE]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/life-inside|title=Life Inside|website=Vice|accessdate=Jul 18, 2019}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Joe Pompeo wrote of The Marshall Project that it had had a great start due to a mix of good initial publicity and association with high-profile names.<ref name=capital-in-depth/>

The Marshall Project has also been identified as part of a new and experimental [[non-profit journalism]] format.<ref name=nieman/><ref name=capital-journalism-nonprofit>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/magazine/2014/07/8548086/journalism%E2%80%99s-nonprofit-surge|title = Journalism's Nonprofit Surge|last = Pompeo|first = Joe|date = July 1, 2014|accessdate = May 8, 2015|work = [[Capital New York]]}}</ref> It has been compared with the non-profit ''[[ProPublica]]'', the [[Center for Investigative Reporting]], [[InsideClimate News]],  and ''[[The Texas Tribune]]'',<ref name=newsonomics/><ref name=capital-journalism-nonprofit/> and also with recent for-profit journalistic experiments such as [[Vox (website)|Vox]] and [[FiveThirtyEight]].<ref name=nieman/>

The Marshall Project has also been praised for its timely launch given current bipartisan interest in criminal justice reform in the United States.<ref name=newsonomics/>

The Marshall Project has been compared with the [[Innocence Project]], but distinguishes itself because its focus is not merely on innocent people ensnared by the criminal justice system but also on guilty people whose rights to due process, fair trial, and proportionate punishment are violated.<ref name=huffpo/>
