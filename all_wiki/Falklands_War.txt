The '''Falklands War''' ({{lang-es |link=no|Guerra de las Malvinas}}) was a 10-week [[undeclared war]] between [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in 1982 over two [[British dependent territories]] in the South Atlantic: the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[Falkland Islands Dependencies|its territorial dependency]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. The result of the war was a British victory.

The conflict began on 2&nbsp;April, when [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Argentina invaded]] and [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|occupied the Falkland Islands]], followed by the [[invasion of South Georgia]] the next day. On 5&nbsp;April, the British government dispatched a [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|naval task force]] to engage the [[Argentine Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]] before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74&nbsp;days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14&nbsp;June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649&nbsp;Argentine military personnel, 255&nbsp;British military personnel, and three [[Falkland Islanders]]<!-- Please don't change these figures without discussing in talk. Thanks. --> died during the hostilities.

The conflict was a major episode in the [[History of the Falkland Islands|protracted dispute]] over the territories' [[sovereignty]]. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalturk.com/en/argentina-to-reaffirm-sovereignty-rights-over-the-falkland-islands-15712 |title= Argentine to reaffirm Sovereignty Rights over The Falkland Islands |publisher= National Turk |access-date=7 January 2012|date= 4 January 2012 }}</ref> and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a [[Crown colony]] since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th&nbsp;century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly [[1986 Falkland Islands status referendum|favour British sovereignty]]. Neither state officially [[Declaration of war|declared war]], although both governments declared the Islands a war zone. 

The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various [[Cultural impact of the Falklands War|books, articles, films, and songs]]. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the unfavourable outcome prompted large protests against the [[National Reorganization Process|ruling military government]], hastening its downfall and the [[1983 Argentine general election|democratisation of the country]]. In the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, bolstered by the successful outcome, [[1983 United Kingdom general election|was re-elected with an increased majority the following year]]. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it remains a common topic for discussion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2007/04/01/z-03415.htm |title=Cómo evitar que Londres convierta a las Malvinas en un Estado independiente |publisher= Clarin |access-date=7 February 2010}}</ref>

Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in [[Madrid]], at which the two governments issued a joint statement.<ref>{{cite web |title= Joint statement of 19 October 1989: Re-establishing Consular Relations Between Britain and Argentina, and Agreeing a Framework on Sovereignty Which Would Allow Further Talks |url= http://www.falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |website= Falklands info |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120517012555/http://falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |archive-date=17 May 2012 |access-date=4 January 2013}}</ref> No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina adopted a new [[Constitution of Argentina|Constitution]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/cuerpo1.php |title= Constitución Nacional |website= Argentine Senate |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040617152239/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/cuerpo1.php |archive-date=17 June 2004 |language= es |quote=La Nación Argentina ratifica su legítima e imprescriptible soberanía sobre las Islas Malvinas, Georgias del Sur y Sandwich del Sur y los espacios marítimos e insulares correspondientes, por ser parte integrante del territorio nacional. }}</ref> which added the Falkland Islands by law as an Argentine province.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Argentina: Constitución de 1994|url=https://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Argentina/argen94_e.html|access-date=2020-08-03|website=pdba.georgetown.edu}}</ref>

== Prelude ==
{{main|Events leading to the Falklands War}}

===Failed diplomacy===
In 1965, the United Nations called upon Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a settlement of the sovereignty dispute.  The UK [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO) regarded the islands as a nuisance and barrier to UK trade in South America, so, whilst confident of British sovereignty, was prepared to cede the islands to Argentina.  When news of a proposed transfer broke in 1968, elements sympathetic with the plight of the islanders were able to organise an effective Parliamentary lobby to frustrate the FCO plans.  Negotiations continued but in general failed to make meaningful progress; the islanders steadfastly refused to consider Argentine sovereignty on one side, whilst Argentina would not compromise over sovereignty on the other.<ref name="Welch">{{cite book |last1=Welch |first1=David A. |title=Painful Choices: A Theory of Foreign Policy Change |date=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Google Books |isbn=9781400840748 |pages=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6VJbfckQAkC&q=Painful+Choices%3A+A+Theory+of+Foreign+Policy+Change |access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref> The FCO then sought to make the islands dependent on Argentina, hoping this would make the islanders more amenable to Argentine sovereignty. A Communications Agreement signed in 1971 created an airlink and later YPF, the Argentine oil company, was given a monopoly in the islands.  

In 1980, a new [[Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (United Kingdom)|Minister of State for Foreign Affairs]], [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], went to the Falklands trying to sell the islanders the benefits of a [[leaseback]] scheme, which met with strong opposition from the islanders. On returning to London in December 1980 he reported to parliament but was viciously attacked at what was seen as a sellout.  (It was unlikely that leaseback could have succeeded since the British had sought a long-term lease of 99 years, whilst Argentina was pressing for a much shorter period of only 10 years.) At a private committee meeting that evening, it was reported that Ridley cried out: "If we don't do something, they will invade.  And there is nothing we could do."<ref name="Eddy, et al">{{cite book |author1=Paul Eddy |author2=Magnus Linklater |author3=Peter Gillman |author4=Sunday Times of London Insight Team |title=The Falklands War |date=1982 |publisher=André Deutsch |location=Google Books |pages=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVt7AAAAMAAJ&q=%22If+we+don%27t+do+something,+they+will+invade.++And+there+is+nothing+we+could+do.%22 |access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref>

In the period leading up to the war—and, in particular, following the transfer of power between the military dictators General [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] and General [[Roberto Eduardo Viola]] late in March 1981—Argentina had been in the midst of devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest against the [[Military dictatorship|military ''junta'']] that had been governing the country since 1976.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boughton |first1=James M. |title=Silent Revolution: The IMF 1979–1989 |url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/history/2001/ch08.pdf |publisher=IMF |access-date=28 June 2019 |pages=328–329 |date=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/arg060330mc |title=Argentina – the horrors of a dictatorial past live on – Radio Netherlands Worldwide – English |publisher=Radionetherlands.nl |date=30 March 2006 |access-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316181305/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/arg060330mc |archive-date=16 March 2009}}</ref> 

In December 1981 there was a further change in the Argentine military regime, bringing to office a new ''junta'' headed by General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] (acting president), Air Brigadier [[Basilio Lami Dozo]] and Admiral [[Jorge Anaya]]. Anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long-standing claim over the islands,<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Oscar|last1= Kirschbaum | first2 = Roger | last2 =Van Der Kooy |first3=Eduardo |last3=Cardoso| title = Malvinas, La Trama Secreta | publisher=Sudamericana/Planeta | location = Buenos Aires | language=es |year = 1983 | isbn = 978-950-37-0006-8 }} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref> calculating that the United Kingdom would never respond militarily.<ref>{{cite web |title=Haig: "Malvinas fue mi Waterloo" |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/74556-haig-malvinas-fue-mi-waterloo |date=10 August 1997 |website=La Nación |access-date=25 October 2010 |language=es |quote={{lang|es|''¿Qué creía?''

By opting for military action, the Galtieri government hoped to mobilise the long-standing patriotic feelings of Argentines towards the islands, [[Diversionary foreign policy|diverting public attention]] from the chronic economic problems and the ongoing human rights violations of its [[Dirty War]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.me.gov.ar/curriform/publica/sirlin_conv_dictadura.pdf |title=Ministerio de Educación, Ciencia y Tecnología de la Nación |access-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318112134/http://www.me.gov.ar/curriform/publica/sirlin_conv_dictadura.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009  }}</ref> bolstering the junta's dwindling legitimacy. The newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' speculated on a step-by-step plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the islands, ending in direct actions late in 1982, if the UN talks were fruitless.<ref name="Jimmy Burns,1987">Jimmy Burns: ''The land that lost its heroes'', 1987, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7475-0002-9}}.</ref>

The ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March, when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants (actually infiltrated by [[Argentine Marines]]){{fact|date=November 2020}} raised the [[Argentine flag]] at [[South Georgia Island]], an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war. The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response. The Argentine military junta, suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces, ordered the [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invasion of the Falkland Islands]] to be brought forward to 2 April.

The UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands, despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas Barker (commander of the ''Endurance'') and others. Barker believed that Defence Secretary [[John Nott]]'s 1981 review (in which Nott described plans to withdraw the ''Endurance'', the UK's only naval presence in the South Atlantic) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling, and would soon be unable, to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Harold|last=Briley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-captain-nicholas-barker-1266075.html|title=Obituary: Captain Nicholas Barker|work=The Independent |location=UK|page=16|date=9 April 1997|access-date=2 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-11982515 |title=The high cost of cuts |work=The Spectator |access-date=7 February 2010 |first=Correlli |last=Barnett |year=1997 }}</ref>

On 2 April 1982 Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings, known as Operation Rosario,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Falklands War 1982 – Operation Rosario |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/southamerica/falklands/falklandswarmaprosario2.htm |website=The British Empire |access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> on the Falkland Islands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1899334.stm|title=Falklands War: The first day, 2 April 1982|date=2 April 2002|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> The invasion was met with a nominal defence organised by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Falkland Islands' Governor]] [[Rex Hunt (governor)|Sir Rex Hunt]], giving command to Major Mike Norman of the [[Royal Marines]]. The events of the invasion included the landing of [[Lieutenant Commander]] Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots' [[Amphibious Commandos Group]], the attack on Moody Brook barracks, the engagement between the troops of Hugo Santillan and Bill Trollope at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and the final engagement and surrender at [[Government House (Falkland Islands)|Government House]].

=== Initial British response ===
{{further|British naval forces in the Falklands War|British ground forces in the Falklands War|British air services in the Falklands War}}
The British had already taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In response to events on South Georgia, on 29 March, Ministers decided to send the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA) ''[[RFA Fort Austin (A386)|Fort Austin]]'' south from the Mediterranean to support HMS ''Endurance'', and the submarine {{HMS|Spartan|S105|6}} from [[Gibraltar]], with {{HMS|Splendid|S106|6}} ordered south from [[HMNB Clyde|Scotland]] the following day.<ref name="Freedman, Gamba-Stonehouse 1991">{{cite book |last1=Freedman |first1=Lawrence |last2=Gamba-Stonehouse |first2=Virginia |title=Signals of War: The Falklands Conflict of 1982 |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-6158-3}}</ref>{{rp|75}}<ref name="Freedman2007">{{harvnb|Freedman|2005a|pp=202–203}}</ref> [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments.<ref name="Freedman2007"/> Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine {{HMS|Superb|S109|6}} left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press it was heading south. There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before nuclear-powered submarines could be deployed.<ref name="Freedman2007"/>

The following day, during a crisis meeting headed by the Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir [[Henry Leach]], advised them that "Britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded". On 1 April, Leach sent orders to a [[Royal Navy]] force carrying out [[Military exercise|exercises]] in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south. Following the invasion on 2 April, after an emergency meeting of the cabinet, approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands. This was backed in an emergency session of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] the next day.<ref name=falkislands>{{cite web|access-date=24 December 2011|publisher=Falkland Islands Information|title=A Chronology of events during the Falklands Conflict of 1982|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/82timeline.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327150403/http://www.falklands.info/history/82timeline.html|archive-date=27 March 2010}}</ref>

On 6 April, the British Government set up a [[War Cabinet#Falklands War, 1982|War Cabinet]] to provide day-to-day political oversight of the campaign.<ref name="Freedman2005">{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|pp=21–22}}: "day-to-day oversight was to be provided by&nbsp;... which came to be known as the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet met at least daily until it was dissolved on 12 August. Although Margaret Thatcher is described as dominating the War Cabinet, [[Lawrence Freedman]] notes in the ''Official History of the Falklands Campaign'' that she did not ignore opposition or fail to consult others. However, once a decision was reached she "did not look back".<ref name="Freedman2005"/>

===United Nations Security Council Resolution 502===
On 31 March 1982, the Argentine ambassador to the UN, [[Eduardo A. Roca|Eduardo Roca]], tried garnering support against a British military build-up designed to thwart earlier UN resolutions calling for both countries to resolve their Falklands dispute through discussion.<ref name="Freedman, Gamba-Stonehouse 1991"/>{{rp|134}} He did this because Argentina, based on inadequate intelligence gathering, was convinced a British task force was already on its way to the South Atlantic, and because of Britain's threat to use HMS ''Endurance'' to remove the scrap-metal workers from South Georgia. Any Argentine military action could then be justified as trying to counter Britain's use of force to evade complying with an earlier UN resolution. This Argentine approach to portray Britain as the aggressor came to nothing.{{cn|date=November 2020}} 

On 1 April, London told the UK ambassador to the UN, Sir [[Anthony Parsons]], that an invasion was imminent and he should call an urgent meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to get a favourable [[United Nations resolution|resolution]] against Argentina.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=Anthony |title=The Falklands Crisis in the United Nations, 31 March-14 June 1982 |journal=International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944–) |date=1983 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=169–178 |publisher=Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Institute of International Affairs}}</ref> Parsons had to get nine affirmative votes from the 15 Council members (not a simple majority) and to avoid a blocking vote from any of the other four permanent members. The meeting took place at 11.00am on 3 April, New York time  (4.00pm in London). [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502]] was adopted by 10 to 1 (with Panama voting against) and 4 abstentions. Significantly, the Soviet Union and China both abstained.<ref>{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Gold | title=Gibraltar, British or Spanish? | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC&q=Falklands&pg=PA39 | page=39}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Gold | title=Gibraltar, British or Spanish? | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC&pg=PA37 | page=37}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Voting System |url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/voting-system |website=UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL |publisher=United Nations |access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> The resolution stated that the UN Security Council was: 
:Deeply disturbed at reports of an invasion on 2 April 1982 by armed forces of Argentina; 
:Determining that there exists a breach of the peace in the region of the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), 
:Demands an immediate cessation of hostilities; 
:Demands an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
:Calls on the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a diplomatic solution to their differences and to respect fully the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 
This was a significant win for the UK, giving it the upper hand diplomatically. The draft resolution Parsons submitted had avoided any reference to the sovereignty dispute (which might have worked against the UK): instead it focused on Argentina's breach of Chapter VII of the UN Charter which forbids the threat or use of force to settle disputes.<ref>{{cite web |title=CHAPTER VII: ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THREATS TO THE PEACE, BREACHES OF THE PEACE, AND ACTS OF AGGRESSION |website=CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS |url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html |publisher=United Nations |access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref> The resolution called for the removal only of Argentine forces: this freed Britain to retake the islands militarily, if Argentina did not leave, by exercising its right to self-defence, that was allowed under the UN Charter.<ref name="Freedman, Gamba-Stonehouse 1991"/>{{rp|141}}

The British government had no contingency plan for an invasion of the islands, and the task force was rapidly put together from whatever vessels were available.<ref name=GS>{{cite web|access-date=25 December 2011|publisher=Global Security|title=The Falkland Islands Conflict, 1982|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/HJA.htm}}</ref> The nuclear-powered submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|2}} set sail from France on 4 April, whilst the two aircraft carriers {{HMS|Invincible|R05|2}} and {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}}, in the company of escort vessels, left [[Portsmouth]] only a day later.<ref name=falkislands/> On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner {{SS|Canberra}} was requisitioned and set sail two days later with [[3 Commando Brigade]] aboard.<ref name=falkislands/> The ocean liner ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' was also requisitioned and left [[Southampton]] on 12 May with [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] on board.<ref name=falkislands/> The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 [[Royal Navy]] vessels, 22 [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] ships and 62 [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|merchant ships]].<ref name=GS/>

The retaking of the Falkland Islands was considered extremely difficult. The chances of a British counter-invasion succeeding were assessed by the US Navy, according to historian [[Arthur L. Herman]], as "a military impossibility".<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997|p=72}} Cited in ''To Rule The Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World'' Herman, A.

By mid-April, the [[Royal Air Force]] had set up the airbase of [[RAF Ascension Island]], co-located with Wideawake Airfield on the mid-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] British overseas territory of [[Ascension Island]], including a sizeable force of [[Avro Vulcan]] B Mk 2 bombers, [[Handley Page Victor]] K Mk 2 [[aerial refuelling|refuelling aircraft]], and [[F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR Mk 2]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] to protect them. Meanwhile, the main British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for active service. A small force had already been sent south to recapture South Georgia.

Encounters began in April; the British Task Force was shadowed by [[Boeing 707]] aircraft of the [[Argentine Air Force]] during their travel to the south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/538-550/548/site/fotos/b707.gif |title=FAA map |access-date=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024064142/http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/538-550/548/site/fotos/b707.gif |archive-date=24 October 2007  }}</ref> Several of these flights were intercepted by Sea Harriers outside the British-imposed [[Total Exclusion Zone]]; the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the UK had not yet decided to commit itself to armed force.

=== Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on ''Santa Fe'' ===
The South Georgia force, [[Operation Paraquet]], under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM, consisted of Marines from [[42 Commando]], a troop of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) and [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS) troops who were intended to land as [[reconnaissance]] forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines. All were embarked on {{ship|RFA|Tidespring|A75|6}}. First to arrive was the {{sclass-|Churchill|submarine}} HMS ''Conqueror'' on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a radar-mapping [[Handley Page Victor]] on 20 April.

[[File:USS Catfish;0833910.jpg|thumb|left|The {{ship|ARA|Santa Fe|S-21|6}} (as {{ship|USS|Catfish|SS-339|6}}) in 1956]]

The first landings of SAS troops took place on 21 April, but—with the southern hemisphere autumn setting in—the weather was so bad that their landings and others made the next day were all withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog on [[Fortuna Glacier]]. On 23 April, a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted, with ''Tidespring'' being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception. On 24 April, the British forces regrouped and headed in to attack.

On 25 April, after resupplying the Argentine garrison in South Georgia, the submarine {{ship|ARA|Santa Fe|S-21|6}} was spotted on the surface<ref name="handle.dtic.mil">{{cite web|url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA279554 |title=Submarine Operations during the Falklands War – U.S. Naval War College |access-date=7 February 2010}}</ref> by a [[Westland Wessex]] HAS Mk 3 helicopter from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, which attacked the Argentine submarine with [[depth charge]]s. {{HMS|Plymouth|F126|6}} launched a [[Westland Wasp]] HAS.Mk.1 helicopter, and {{HMS|Brilliant|F90|6}} launched a [[Westland Lynx]] HAS Mk 2. The Lynx launched a [[torpedo]], and [[strafing|strafed]] the submarine with its [[pintle]]-mounted [[L7 (machine gun)|general purpose machine gun]]; the Wessex also fired on ''Santa Fe'' with its [[General-purpose machine gun|GPMG]]. The Wasp from {{HMS|Plymouth|F126|6}} as well as two other Wasps launched from {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} fired [[Aerospatiale SS.12/AS.12|AS-12]] [[Air-to-surface missile|ASM]] [[anti-ship missile|antiship missiles]] at the submarine, scoring hits. ''Santa Fe'' was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at [[King Edward Point]] on South Georgia.

With ''Tidespring'' now far out to sea, and the Argentine forces augmented by the submarine's crew, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and make a direct assault that day. After a short forced march by the British troops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two Royal Navy vessels (''Antrim'' and ''Plymouth''), the Argentine forces surrendered without resistance. The message sent from the naval force at South Georgia to London was, "Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the [[White Ensign]] flies alongside the [[Union Jack]] in South Georgia. God Save the Queen." The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, broke the news to the media, telling them to [[Rejoice (Margaret Thatcher)|"Just rejoice at that news, and congratulate our forces and the Marines!"]]<ref name="fn_1">{{Cite news| title = 1982: Marines land in South Georgia |publisher=BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/25/newsid_2503000/2503977.stm | access-date =20 June 2005 | date=25 April 1982}}</ref>

=== Black Buck raids ===
{{Main|Operation Black Buck}}
[[File:Avro Vulcan Bomber RAF.JPEG|thumb|RAF [[Avro Vulcan]] B.Mk.2 [[strategic bomber]]]]
On 1 May British operations on the Falklands opened with the "Black Buck 1" attack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley. A [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan bomber]] from [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] flew on an {{convert|8000|nmi|adj=on}} round trip dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley and back to Ascension. The mission required repeated [[aerial refuelling|refuelling]], and required several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker-to-tanker refuelling. The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine, and the raids consumed precious tanker resources from Ascension,<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2000|p=186}}: "...&nbsp;to get twenty-one bombs to Port Stanley is going to take about one million, one hundred thousand pounds of fuel – equalled about {{formatnum:137000}} gallons. That was enough fuel to fly 260 Sea Harrier bombing missions over Port Stanley. Which in turn meant just over 1300 bombs. Interesting stuff!"</ref> but also prevented Argentina from stationing fast jets on the islands.

Historian [[Lawrence Freedman]], who was given access to official sources, comments that the significance of the Vulcan raids remains controversial.<ref>{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|pp=285}}</ref> Although taking pressure off the small Sea Harrier force, the raids were costly and used a great deal of resources.  The single hit in the centre of the runway was probably the best that could have been expected but it did reduce the capability of the runway to operate fast jets and caused the Argentine air force to deploy Mirage III to defend the capital.<ref>{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|pp=285–286}}</ref> Argentine sources confirm that the Vulcan raids influenced Argentina to withdraw some of its Mirage IIIs from Southern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Offensive Air Operations of the Falklands War |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/DWF.htm |work=Globalsecurity.org |quote=As a result of these heavy losses&nbsp;... it was decided to pull the Mirage III's back to the mainland to stand alert for a possible Vulcan attack.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Falkland Islands Conflict, 1982: Air Defense of the Fleet |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/HJA.htm |work=Globalsecurity.org |quote= Finally, the bombing raids caused the Argentines to fear an air attack on the mainland, causing them to retain some Mirage aircraft and Roland missiles for defense.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/520-528/520/mirage.htm |title=La familia Mirage |journal=Aeroespacio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531161152/http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/520-528/520/mirage.htm |archive-date=31 May 2011 | issn=0001-9127 |language=es |quote="Los M III debían defender el territorio continental argentino de posibles ataques de los bombarderos Vulcan de la RAF, brindar escolta a los cazabombarderos de la FAA, e impedir los ataques de aviones de la Royal Navy y de la RAF sobre las Malvinas."<br /> ("The M III would defend the Argentine mainland against possible attacks by Vulcan bombers from the RAF, providing escort of fighter bombers to the FAA, and to prevent attacks by aircraft of the Royal Navy and RAF on the Falklands.") }}</ref> This dissuasive effect was watered down when British officials made clear that there would not be strikes on air bases in Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Falkland Islands Conflict, 1982: Air Defense of the Fleet |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/HJA.htm |work=Globalsecurity.org |quote=Unfortunately the British Secretary of State for Defence announced sometime later that Britain would not bomb targets on the Argentine mainland. This statement was undoubtedly welcomed by the Argentine military command, because it permitted the very limited number of Roland SAM's to be deployed around the airfield at Stanley.}}</ref> The raids were later dismissed as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward.<ref>{{harvnb|Ward|2000|pp=247–48}}: "Propaganda was, of course, used later to try to justify these missions: 'The Mirage IIIs were withdrawn from Southern Argentina to Buenos Aires to add to the defences there following the Vulcan raids on the islands.' Apparently the logic behind this statement was that if the Vulcan could hit Port Stanley, the {{sic}} Buenos Aires was well within range as well and was vulnerable to similar attacks. I never went along with that baloney. A lone Vulcan or two running in to attack Buenos Aires without fighter support would have been shot to hell in quick time."-"Mirage IIIs were in evidence near the islands on several occasions during the conflict, either escorting the Neptune reconnaissance missions or on 'interference' flights that attempted to draw CAP attention away from air-to-ground attacks."-"Suffice it to say that you didn't need more than one or two Mirage IIIs to intercept a Vulcan attack on Buenos Aires"-"It would have taken much more than a lone Vulcan raid to upset Buenos Aires"</ref>

Of the five Black Buck raids, three were against Stanley Airfield, with the other two anti-radar missions using [[AGM-45 Shrike|Shrike]] [[anti-radiation missile]]s.{{cn|date=October 2019}}<!-- also, to what effect were the "other" airfield raids and the anti-radar missions? -->

=== Escalation of the air war ===
[[File:Super Etendard ARA 204.jpg|thumb|French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard|Super Étendard]] of the [[Argentine Naval Aviation]]]]
The Falklands had only three airfields. The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and even that was too short to support fast jets (although an [[Arresting gear|arrestor gear]] was fitted in April to support Skyhawks). Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, [[combat air patrol]]s, and [[close air support]] over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands.

The first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ([[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]], [[IAI Nesher|IAI Daggers]], [[English Electric Canberra]]s, and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted the morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the islands and by using a late [[Toss bombing|pop up]] profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by [[BAE Sea Harrier]]s operating from {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}. A Dagger<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2002/05/01/argentine-air-force-remembers-its-baptism-of-fire-twenty-years-on |title=Argentine Air Force remembers its 'baptism of fire' twenty years on |publisher=En.mercopress.com |date=1 May 2002 |access-date=9 June 2010}}</ref> and a Canberra was shot down.

Combat broke out between Sea Harrier FRS Mk 1 fighters of No. 801 Naval Air Squadron and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] fighters of Grupo 8. Both sides refused to fight at the other's best altitude, until two Mirages finally descended to engage. One was shot down by an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]] (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland airbase. The plane made for Stanley, where it fell victim to friendly fire from the Argentine defenders.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rodríguez Mottino |first=Horacio |date=1984 |title=La artillería argentina en Malvinas |language=es |publisher=Editorial Clio |isbn=978-9509377028 |page=170 }}</ref>

As a result of this experience, Argentine Air Force staff decided to employ A-4 Skyhawks and Daggers only as strike units, the Canberras only during the night, and Mirage IIIs (without air refuelling capability or any capable AAM) as decoys to lure away the British Sea Harriers. The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the [[Escuadrón Fénix]], a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours a day, simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet. On one of these flights on 7 June, an Air Force [[Learjet 35]]A was shot down, killing the squadron commander, Vice Commodore Rodolfo De La Colina, the highest-ranking Argentine officer to die in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/caidos/baja01.html |title=Rodolfo Manuel de la Colina |website=[[Fuerza Aérea Argentina]] |language=es |access-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007131156/http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/caidos/baja01.html |archive-date=7 October 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madryn.gov.ar/noticias.php?newsid=3213 |title=Noticias Municipales &#124; Puerto Madryn |publisher=Madryn.gov.ar |date=2 April 2009 |access-date=4 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415012750/http://www.madryn.gov.ar/noticias.php?newsid=3213 |archive-date=15 April 2012  }}</ref>

Stanley was used as an Argentine strongpoint throughout the conflict. Despite the Black Buck and Harrier raids on Stanley airfield (no fast jets were stationed there for air defence) and overnight shelling by detached ships, it was never out of action entirely. Stanley was defended by a mixture of [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) systems (Franco-German [[Roland (missile)|Roland]] and British [[Sea Cat|Tigercat]]) and Swiss-built [[Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon|Oerlikon 35 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons]]. [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed Hercules]] transport night flights brought supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel, and airlifted out the wounded up until the end of the conflict.

The only Argentine Hercules shot down by the British was lost on 1 June when TC-63 was intercepted by a Sea Harrier in daylight<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/dias/jun01.html |title=Fuerza Aérea Argentina |publisher=Fuerzaaerea.mil.ar |access-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430100836/http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/dias/jun01.html |archive-date=30 April 2009  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19820601-0&lang=en |title=ASN Aircraft accident description Lockheed C-130H Hercules TC-63 – Pebble Island |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |access-date=7 February 2010}}</ref> when it was searching for the British fleet north-east of the islands after the Argentine Navy retired its last [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|SP-2H Neptune]] due to airframe attrition.

=== Sinking of ARA ''General Belgrano'' ===
[[File:ARA Belgrano 1982.PNG|thumb|ARA ''General Belgrano'' sinking]]
[[File:ARA Alférez Sobral (A-9).jpg|thumb|''Alferez Sobral'']]
Two British naval task forces (one of surface vessels and one of submarines) and the Argentine fleet were operating in the neighbourhood of the Falklands and soon came into conflict. The first naval loss was the [[Second World War]]-vintage Argentine [[light cruiser]] {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano}}. The [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank ''General Belgrano'' on 2 May. Three hundred and twenty-three members of ''General Belgrano''{{'}}s crew died in the incident. More than 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather. The losses from ''General Belgrano'' totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in the Falklands conflict, and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the Argentine government.

Regardless of [[ARA General Belgrano#Controversy over the sinking|controversies over the sinking]]—including disagreement about the exact nature of the maritime exclusion zone and whether ''General Belgrano'' had been returning to port at the time of the sinking—it had a crucial strategic effect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the entire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the diesel-powered submarine {{ship|ARA|San Luis|S-32|6}},<ref name="handle.dtic.mil"/> returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting. The two escorting [[destroyer]]s and the battle group centred on the aircraft carrier {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} both withdrew from the area, ending the direct threat to the British fleet that their [[pincer movement]] had represented.

However, settling the controversy in 2003, the ship's captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that ''General Belgrano'' had actually been manoeuvering, not sailing away from the exclusion zone, and had orders to sink any British ship he could find.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/may/25/uk.world|website=[[The Guardian]]|title=Belgrano crew 'trigger happy'|author=Peter Beaumont|date=25 May 2003|access-date=20 May 2018}}</ref>

In a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat, the {{ship|ARA|Alferez Sobral|A-9|6}}, that was searching for the crew of the Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May. Two Royal Navy [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters fired four [[Sea Skua]] missiles at her. Badly damaged and with eight crew dead, ''Alferez Sobral'' managed to return to [[Puerto Deseado]] two days later. The Canberra's crew were never found.

=== Sinking of HMS ''Sheffield'' ===
[[File:HMS Sheffield (D80).jpg|thumb|HMS ''Sheffield'']]
On 4 May, two days after the sinking of ''General Belgrano'', the British lost the [[Type 42 destroyer]] {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|6}} to fire following an [[Exocet]] missile strike from the Argentine [[2da Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Caza y Ataque|2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron]].

''Sheffield'' had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile [[Radar_picket|picket]] far from the British carriers. She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days. She finally sank outside the [[Total Exclusion Zone|Maritime Exclusion Zone]] on 10 May. 

The incident is described in detail by Admiral [[Sandy Woodward]] in his book ''One Hundred Days'', in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of ''Sheffield''.<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997|p=8}}</ref> The destruction of ''Sheffield'' (the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War) had a profound impact on the British public, bringing home the fact that the "Falklands Crisis", as the [[BBC News]] put it, was now an actual "shooting war".

=== Diplomatic activity ===
The tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General [[Pérez de Cuéllar]] on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous "red-line" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502]].

Instead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentine and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to "[[self-determination]]" of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN.<ref>[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography'' (2013) Volume 1, pp. 726–728</ref>

=== Special forces operations ===
Given the threat to the British fleet posed by the Étendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some [[Special Air Service|SAS]] troops to attack the home base of the five Étendards at [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego]]. The operation was codenamed "[[Operation Mikado|Mikado]]". The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine {{HMS|Onyx|S21|6}} to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteukforces.info/articles/sas-versus-exocets.php#prof |title=The SAS vs the Exocet |publisher=eliteukforces.info |date=27 October 2007 |access-date=7 February 2010}}</ref>

An SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration. A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying the assigned team took off from HMS ''Invincible'' on the night of 17 May, but bad weather forced it to land {{convert|50|mi|km}} from its target and the mission was aborted.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Michael |last1=Evans |first2=Alan |last2=Hamilton |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article537842.ece |title=Thatcher in the dark on sinking of Belgrano |journal=The Times |date=27 June 2005}}</ref> The pilot flew to [[Chile]], landed south of [[Punta Arenas]], and dropped off the SAS team. The helicopter's crew of three then destroyed the aircraft, surrendered to Chilean police on 25 May, and were repatriated to the UK after interrogation. The discovery of the burnt-out helicopter attracted considerable international attention. Meanwhile, the SAS team crossed the border and penetrated into Argentina, but cancelled their mission after the Argentines suspected an SAS operation and deployed some {{formatnum:2000}} troops to search for them. The SAS men were able to return to Chile, and took a civilian flight back to the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sasspecialairservice.com/sas-falklands-war-argentina.html|title=British Special Air Service SAS – The Falklands – Operation Corporate|access-date=2 October 2014}}</ref>

On 14 May the SAS carried out a [[raid on Pebble Island]] on the Falklands, where the Argentine Navy had taken over a grass airstrip <sup>[https://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&q=-51.308889,-59.610278&ll=-51.308887,-59.610271&spn=0.022964,0.055189&z=14 map]</sup> for [[FMA IA 58 Pucará]] light ground-attack aircraft and [[Beechcraft T-34 Mentor]]s, which resulted in the destruction of several aircraft.{{refn|6 Pucaras, 4 T-34 Mentor and 1 Short Skyvan|group=nb}}

At sea, the limitations of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of {{HMS|Ardent|F184|6}} on 21 May, {{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} (on 24 May when attempts to defuse bombs failed), and the loss of the cargo of [[helicopter]]s, runway-building equipment and tents on {{ship|MV|Atlantic Conveyor}} (struck by two AM39 [[Exocet]]s) on 25 May. The loss of all but one of the [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|Chinook]] helicopters being carried by the Atlantic Conveyor as well as their maintenance equipment and facilities was a severe blow from a logistical perspective.

Also lost on 25 May was {{HMS|Coventry|D118|6}}, a sister to {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|2}}, whilst in company with {{HMS|Broadsword|F88|6}} after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw away Argentine aircraft from other ships at San Carlos Bay.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rumley |first=Leesa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6705387.stm |title=Captain Hart Dyke, Commanding Officer of HMS ''Coventry'' |work=BBC News|date=1 June 2007 |access-date=7 February 2010}}</ref> {{HMS|Argonaut|F56|6}} and {{HMS|Brilliant|F90|6}} were moderately damaged.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Corum |first1=James S. |title=Argentine Airpower in the Falklands War: An Operational View. |journal=Air and Space Power Journal|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj02/fal02/corum.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191905/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj02/fal02/corum.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-01-02 |date=2002 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=59–77}}</ref> However, many British ships escaped being sunk because of limitations imposed by circumstances on Argentine pilots. To avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released bombs at very low altitude, and hence those bomb [[fuze]]s<!--For anyone tempted to correct the "mis-spelling", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance --> did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the [[retarded bomb]]s (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves.<ref>A simple free-fall bomb in a low-altitude release impacts almost directly below the aircraft, which is then within the lethal fragmentation zone of the explosion. A retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft. The <!--For anyone tempted to correct the "mis-spelling", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance -->fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation.</ref> The pilots would have been aware of this—but due to the high concentration required to avoid [[Surface-to-air missiles|SAMs]], [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] (AAA), and British [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]], many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised [[Gravity bomb|retarding devices]], allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.

In his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the [[BBC World Service]] for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being "fearless seekers after truth" than with the lives of British servicemen.<ref name="Woodward">{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref> Colonel [['H'.

=== San Carlos – Bomb Alley===
{{Main|Operation Sutton}}
[[File:Action stations Falklands 1982.JPG|thumb|upright|British sailors in [[anti-flash gear]] at action stations on {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}} near San Carlos, June 1982]]
During the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore [[Michael Clapp]] (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted [[Operation Sutton]], the amphibious landing on beaches around [[San Carlos Water]],{{refn| Location: "Bomb Alley" San Carlos Water, Falkland Islands|group=nb}} on the northwestern coast of [[East Falkland]] facing onto [[Falkland Sound]]. The bay, known as ''Bomb Alley'' by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Yates | first = David | title = Bomb Alley – Falkland Islands 1982 | publisher=Pen and Sword | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-84415-417-3 }}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref name = "BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/297414.stm |title=Americas &#124; Charles ends Falklands tour on sombre note |work=BBC News|date=15 March 1999 |access-date=7 February 2010}}</ref>

The {{formatnum:4000}} men of [[3 Commando Brigade]] were put ashore as follows: [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (2 Para) from the [[RORO]] ferry ''[[Norland (ferry)|Norland]]'' and [[40 Commando]] [[Royal Marines]] from the amphibious ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} were landed at San Carlos (Blue Beach), [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (3 Para) from the amphibious ship {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|6}} was landed at [[Port San Carlos]] (Green Beach) and [[45 Commando]] from [[RFA Stromness (A344)|RFA ''Stromness'']] was landed at [[Ajax Bay]] (Red Beach). Notably, the waves of eight [[Landing Craft Utility|LCUs]] and eight [[Landing craft of the Royal Marines#LCVP Mk2|LCVPs]] were led by Major [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]], who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to 1979. [[42 Commando]] on the ocean liner {{SS|Canberra}} was a tactical reserve. Units from the [[Royal Artillery]], [[Royal Engineers]], etc. and armoured reconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft, the [[Round Table class landing ship logistics|Round Table class]] [[Landing Ship Logistics|LSL]] and [[mexeflote]] barges. [[Rapier missile]] launchers were carried as underslung loads of [[Westland Sea King|Sea Kings]] for rapid deployment.

By dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations. From there, [[Brigadier]] [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]]'s plan was to capture [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and [[Goose Green]] before turning towards Port Stanley. Now, with the British troops on the ground, the [[South Air Force]] (Argentina) began the night bombing campaign against them using [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bomber planes until the last day of the war (14 June).

=== Goose Green ===
{{Main|Battle of Goose Green}}
[[File:Land.ops.2.en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Infantry deployment in East Falklands after landing in San Carlos]]
From early on 27 May until 28 May, 2 Para (approximately 500 men), with naval gunfire support from {{HMS|Arrow|F173|6}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/09/guardianobituaries.falklands|newspaper=The Guardian |title=Captain Paul Bootherstone obituary|date=9 April 2001}}</ref> and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery, Royal Artillery, approached and attacked [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and [[Goose Green]], which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment. After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day, the British won the battle; in all, 17 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed. A total of 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the ''Condor'' airfield) were taken prisoner.

The BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the [[BBC World Service]] before it had actually happened. It was during this attack that [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[H. Jones]], the commanding officer of 2 Para, was killed at the head of his battalion while charging into the well-prepared Argentine positions. He was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].

With the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead. On 27 May, men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a [[loaded march]] across [[East Falkland]] towards the coastal settlement of [[Teal Inlet]].

=== Special forces on Mount Kent ===
Meanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent.{{refn|Location: Mount Kent, Falkland Islands|group=nb}} Unknown to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] surface-to-air missiles and [[commando]]s (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. This operation was known as ''Autoimpuesta'' ("Self-determination initiative").

For the next week, the SAS and the [[Mountain Leader Training Cadre|Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre]] (M&AWC) of [[3 Commando Brigade]] waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers' 602nd Commando Company under Major [[Aldo Rico]], normally second in Command of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment. Throughout 30 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, Harrier ''XZ963'', flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook—in responding to a call for help from D Squadron, attacked Mount Kent's eastern lower slopes, and that led to its loss through small-arms fire. Pook was subsequently awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=49134 |supp=y |page=12854 |date=8 October 1982 }}</ref>
On 31 May, the M&AWC defeated Argentine Special Forces at the [[skirmish at Top Malo House]]. A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain José Vercesi's 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in a small shepherd's house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed {{convert|200|m|ft|-2}} from the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition almost exhausted, they elected to surrender.

Three Cadre members were badly wounded. On the Argentine side, there were two dead, including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert (who were posthumously decorated for their bravery). Only five Argentines were left unscathed. As the British mopped up Top Malo House, Lieutenant Fraser Haddow's M&AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill, brandishing a large [[Union Flag]]. One wounded Argentine soldier, Lieutenant Horacio Losito, commented that their escape route would have taken them through Haddow's position.

601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain. Spotted by 42 Commando, they were engaged with [[L16 81mm mortar]]s and forced to withdraw to Two Sisters mountain. The leader of 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain realised his position had become untenable and after conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/David/kent2.html |title=The Argentine Commandos on Mount Kent |publisher=Britains-smallwars.com |access-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328175325/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/David/kent2.html |archive-date=28 March 2010  }}</ref>

The Argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to position and extract patrols; the [[601 Assault Helicopter Battalion|601st Combat Aviation Battalion]] also suffered casualties. At about 11:00&nbsp;am on 30 May, an [[Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma]] helicopter was brought down by a shoulder-launched [[FIM-92 Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) fired by the SAS in the vicinity of Mount Kent. Six [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]] Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2002/04/12/argentine-puma-shot-down-by-american-stinger-missile#prof |title=Argentine Puma Shot Down By American "Stinger" Missile |publisher=En.mercopress.com |date=12 April 2002 |access-date=7 February 2010}}</ref>

As Brigadier Thompson commented, "It was fortunate that I had ignored the views expressed by [[Northwood HQ]] that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before insertion of 42 Commando was superfluous. Had D Squadron not been there, the Argentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before de-planing and, in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone, inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters."<ref name="NoPicnic">Julian Thompson, ''No Picnic'', p. 93, Cassell & Co, 2001.</ref>

=== Bluff Cove and Fitzroy ===
{{Main|Bluff Cove Air Attacks}}
By 1 June, with the arrival of a further {{formatnum:5000}} British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade,<!-- landed at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] from {{SS|Canberra|2}}, ''[[Norland]]'' and ''Stromness'' having transferred from the liner [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|''Q.E.II'']] at [[South Georgia Island]] --> the new British divisional commander, Major General [[Jeremy Moore]] RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the [[Welsh Guards]] on [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA ''Sir Galahad'']] and [[RFA Sir Tristram (L3505)|RFA ''Sir Tristram'']] on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander [[Rick Jolly]] of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including [[Simon Weston]].<ref>Rick Jolly, ''The Red & Green Life Machine'', p. 124.</ref>

The Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army [[Westland Scout]] helicopters. Telephoning ahead to [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]], they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|RAF Chinook]] helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and [[Bluff Cove]] (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).

[[File:Stanley.falklands.war.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The road to Stanley]]

This uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with {{convert|30|mi|km}} of indefensible positions, strung along their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.

Plans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the [[Landing Ship Logistics]] (LSL) ''Sir Tristram'' and the [[amphibious transport dock|landing platform dock]] (LPD) ''Intrepid'' on the night of 5 June. ''Intrepid'' was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of ''Sir Tristram'' as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which ''Sir Tristram'' would be left to unload using a [[Mexeflote]] (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.

Political pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore [[ Michael Clapp]] to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, ''Intrepid''{{'}}s [[landing craft]] would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with ''Intrepid'' and her sister ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.

The attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when ''Fearless'' dispatched her landing craft. ''Sir Tristram'' sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by ''Sir Galahad'' at dawn on 7 June. Anchored {{convert|1200|ft|m}} apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.

The landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine [[combat engineering|combat engineers]]) to their destination, a journey of around {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}}.

On ''Sir Galahad''{{'}}s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board ''Sir Galahad'' of the [[Royal Engineer]] Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] and may have been overconfident in the air defences. [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]] gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach; the order was ignored.<ref name="SouthbyTailyour1990">{{cite book|author=Ewen Southby-Tailyour|title=Reasons in Writing: A Commando's View of the Falklands War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NWkAwAAQBAJ|date=31 December 1990|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-84415-014-4|page=297}} ''"It was clear that I was achieving nothing and so, in desperation, I gave a direct order for the infantry to get ashore with or without their kit in order that we could get on with unloading Sir Tristram.<br /> The officers ignored my order. In doing so they explained to me quite clearly that no orders would be accepted from an officer of equivalent rank."''</ref>

The longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to Bluff Cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused an enormous delay in unloading. This had disastrous consequences. Without escorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully laden, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of Argentine [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]].

The disaster at Port Pleasant (although often known as Bluff Cove) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news video footage showed [[Royal Navy|Navy]] helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.

British casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/8/newsid_2500000/2500607.stm |work=BBC News|title=1982:Fifty die in Argentine air attack|date=8 June 1982 }}</ref> Three Argentine pilots were also killed.

He expected that the losses would cause enemy morale to drop and the British assault to stall.

[[File:Argentine prisoners of war - Port Stanley.JPG|thumb|Argentine prisoners of war in Port Stanley]]
On the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley. Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the [[Battle of Mount Harriet]], [[Battle of Two Sisters]], and [[Battle of Mount Longdon]]. Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and [[friendly fire]], but managed to capture their objectives. The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery fire, sniper fire, and ambushes. Despite this, the British continued their advance.

During this battle, 13 were killed when {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}}, straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-based [[Exocet]] MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer {{ship|ARA|Seguí|D-25|6}} by Argentine Navy technicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fuerzasnavales.com/itb.html |title=An interview with CL (R) Ing.

After a night of fierce fighting, all objectives were secured. Both sides suffered heavy losses.

[[File:Discarded weapons, Stanley 1982.JPG|thumb|A pile of discarded Argentine weapons in Port Stanley]]

The second phase of attacks began on the night of 13 June, and the momentum of the initial assault was maintained. 2 Para, with light armour support from the [[Blues and Royals]], [[Battle of Wireless Ridge|captured Wireless Ridge]], with the loss of 3 British and 25 Argentine lives, and the 2nd battalion, [[Scots Guards]] captured Mount Tumbledown at the [[Battle of Mount Tumbledown]], which cost 10 British and 30 Argentine lives.

With the last natural defence line at [[Mount Tumbledown]] breached, the Argentine town defences of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] began to falter. In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent.

On 20 June, the British retook the [[South Sandwich Islands]], which involved accepting the surrender of the [[Southern Thule]] Garrison at the [[Corbeta Uruguay]] base, and declared hostilities over. Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/navynews/docs/198208|title=The race to regain Thule|newspaper=Navy News p.21|date=July 1982}}</ref>

In 2012, it came to light that while this support was taking place, a French technical team, employed by [[Dassault]] and already in Argentina, remained there throughout the war despite the presidential decree. The team had provided material support to the Argentines, identifying and fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers. John Nott said he had known the French team was there but said its work was thought not to be of any importance. An adviser to the then French government denied any knowledge at the time that the technical team was there. In contrast, a then French intelligence officer maintained he knew the team was there but it was in an intelligence-gathering capacity. John Nott, when asked if he felt let down by the French, said he thought the French were "duplicitous", and "always have been".<ref name="Thomson, Mike, 2012"/>

* Argentina itself was politically backed by a majority of countries in [[Latin America]] (though, notably, not [[Chile]]). Several members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] also backed Argentina's position; notably, Cuba and Nicaragua led a diplomatic effort to rally non-aligned countries from Africa and Asia towards Argentina's position. This initiative came as a surprise to Western observers, as Cuba had no diplomatic relations with Argentina's right-leaning military junta. British diplomats complained that Cuba had "cynically exploited" the crisis to pursue its normalization of relations with Latin American countries; Argentina eventually resumed relations with Cuba in 1983, followed by Brazil in 1986.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Krepp|first1=Stella Paresa|last2=Krepp|first2=Stella Paresa|date=April 2017|title=Between the Cold War and the Global South: Argentina and Third World Solidarity in the Falklands/Malvinas Crisis|journal=Estudos Históricos (Rio de Janeiro)|volume=30|issue=60|pages=141–160|doi=10.1590/s2178-14942017000100008|issn=0103-2186|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Before British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side. This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box ({{coord|48|30|S|53|45|W|scale:10000000}}), about {{convert|45|mi|km}} north of [[Falkland Sound]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://casebook.icrc.org/case-study/argentinaunited-kingdom-red-cross-box |title=Argentina/United Kingdom, The Red Cross Box |author=International Committee of the Red Cross |author-link=International Committee of the Red Cross |access-date=2019-10-01 }}</ref> Ultimately, the British stationed four ships ({{HMS|Hydra|A144|6}}, {{HMS|Hecla|A133|6}} and {{HMS|Herald|H138|6}} and the primary hospital ship [[SS Uganda (1952)|SS ''Uganda'']]) within the box,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Arthur |title=Logistics in The Falklands War |url=https://jmvh.org/article/logistics-in-the-falklands-war/ |website=jmvh.org |publisher=Journal of Military and Veterans' Health |access-date=15 September 2020 |ref=Volume 25 No. 1 Book Reviews |pages=41–43 |language=en |date=January 2017}}</ref> while the Argentines stationed three ({{ship|ARA|Almirante Irízar|Q-5|6}}, {{ship|ARA|Bahía Paraíso|B-1|6}} and {{ship|ARA|Puerto Deseado|Q-20|2}}).

Throughout the conflict officials of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions.

This brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large [[materiel]] loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.

In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher's popularity increased. The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, who had been trailing behind the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began, but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win [[1983 United Kingdom general election|the following year's general election]] by a landslide.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm |title= 1983: Thatcher triumphs again |work=BBC News|access-date=8 June 2010 | date=5 April 2005}}</ref> Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.

The islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983, their lifestyle was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands|new constitution]] was enacted promoting self-government, which has continued to devolve power to the islanders.

In Argentina, defeat in the Falklands War meant that a [[Beagle conflict|possible war with Chile]] was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the [[1983 Argentine general election|1983 general election]], the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military's image as the "moral reserve of the nation" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.

Various figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed suicide since the war. Some studies have estimated that 264 British veterans and 350–500 Argentine veterans have committed suicide since 1982.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Suicide after leaving the UK armed forces—a cohort study|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000026 |year=2009|editor1-last=Hotopf|editor1-first=Matthew|last1=Kapur|first1=Navneet|last2=While|first2=David|last3=Blatchley|first3=Nick|last4=Bray|first4=Isabelle|last5=Harrison|first5=Kate|journal=PLOS Medicine|volume=6|issue=3|pages=e26|pmid=19260757|pmc=2650723}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/4/edicion_664/contenidos/noticia_0017.html |title=Edición Impresa &#124; Una fecha trágica de nuestra historia |publisher=Perfil.com |date=4 January 2012 |access-date=3 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501233745/http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/4/edicion_664/contenidos/noticia_0017.html |archive-date=1 May 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, a detailed study<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/causes-of-deaths-among-the-uk-armed-forces-veterans-of-the-1982-falklands-campaign A study of deaths among UK Armed Forces personnel deployed to the 1982 Falklands Campaign: 1982 to 2012] published: 14 May 2013</ref> of {{formatnum:21432}} British veterans of the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that between 1982 and 2012 only 95 had died from "intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent (suicides and open verdict deaths)", a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/defence-and-security-blog/2013/may/14/falklands-veterans-suicide-army |title=Falklands war: new study debunks claims of high suicide rates |work=The Guardian |access-date=12 July 2013 | date=14 May 2013 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor}}</ref>

=== Military analysis ===
Militarily, the Falklands conflict remains one of the largest air-naval combat operations between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant "lessons learned" include: the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.

In 1986, the [[BBC]] broadcast the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme, ''In the Wake of HMS Sheffield'', which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures since taken to implement them, such as [[stealth ship]]s and [[close-in weapon system]]s.

=== Memorials ===
[[File:1982 Liberation Memorial in Stanley (5612271774).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[1982 Liberation Memorial]] in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]]]
There are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the [[1982 Liberation Memorial]], unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war. It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking [[Stanley Harbour]]. The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words "In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us".<ref name="FITB">{{Cite web|url=https://www.falklandislands.com/things-to-do/1982-liberation-memorial-p673571|title=1982 Liberation Memorial – Things to Do in the Falkland Islands|website=falklandislands.com|access-date=14 February 2018}}</ref>

During the war, British dead were put into plastic [[body bag]]s and buried in mass graves. After the war, the bodies were recovered; 14 were reburied at [[Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos|Blue Beach Military Cemetery]] and 64 were returned to the UK.

Many of the Argentine dead are buried in the [[Argentine Military Cemetery]] west of the Darwin Settlement. The government of Argentina declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to Argentina.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=1982 Falklands |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t0w9 |access-date=20 October 2011 |series=20th Century Battlefields |credits=Peter Snow, Dan Snow |network=BBC |station= BBC Two|airdate=16 July 2008 |quote="After the war the British government offered to return the bodies of the Argentine dead to Argentina for burial, but their government refused.

=== Minefields ===
{{Main|Land mines in the Falkland Islands}}

[[File:Falklands-Minefield.JPG|thumb|left|Although some minefields have been cleared, a substantial number of them still exist in the islands, such as this one at [[Port William, Falkland Islands|Port William]], [[East Falkland]].]]

There were 113 uncleared minefields plus [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXOs) covering an area of {{convert|13|sqkm|acre|abbr=on}} on the Falkland Islands, as of 2011. Of this area, {{convert|5.5|sqkm|acre|abbr=on}} on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being "suspected minefields"—the area had been heavily pastured for 25 years without incident. It was estimated that these minefields had {{formatnum:20000}} anti-personnel mines and {{formatnum:5000}} anti-tank mines.  

The UK reported six military personnel injured by mines or UXO in 1982, then two more in 1983. Most military accidents took place in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, while clearing minefields or trying to establish the extent of minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed. No civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands, and no human casualties from mines or UXO have been reported since 1984.   

On 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands "present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands," and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them. However, the British Government, in accordance with its commitments under the [[Mine Ban Treaty]] had a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/theme/2282|publisher=Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor|title = United Kingdom – Mine Action, Contamination and Impact|date = 21 September 2011|access-date =16 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper = MercoPress|title = Falklands' land mine clearance set to enter a new expanded phase in early 2012|date = 8 December 2011|location = Montevideo}}</ref>

== Press and publicity ==

=== Argentina ===
[[File:Gentemayo1982.jpg|thumb|''Gente''{{'}}s "Estamos ganando" headline ("We're winning")]]
Selected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war. Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on "the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes".<ref name="Jimmy Burns,1987"/>

Officers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and 'leaked' information confirming the official communiqués from the government. The glossy magazines ''Gente'' and ''[[Siete Días]]'' swelled to 60 pages with colour photographs of British warships in flames—many of them faked—and bogus eyewitness reports of the Argentine commandos' guerrilla war on South Georgia (6 May) and an already dead Pucará pilot's attack on HMS ''Hermes''<ref name="Jimmy Burns,1987"/> (Lt. Daniel Antonio Jukic had been killed at Goose Green during a British air strike on 1 May). Most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid press. One of the best remembered headlines was "Estamos ganando" ("We're winning") from the magazine ''Gente'', that would later use variations of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/20414/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706082632/http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/20414/|title=El periodismo argentino y su papel en la Guerra de Malvinas|archive-date=6 July 2011}}</ref>

The Argentine troops on the Falkland Islands could read ''Gaceta Argentina''—a newspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen. Some of its untruths could easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses.<ref>{{harvnb|Middlebrook|1989|p=94}}: "First of May. Menéndez ordered the publication of a newspaper for the troops on the Falkland Islands called ''Gaceta Argentina''. It stated that one of the Mirages lost on 1 May had collided with a Sea Harrier and the Argentine pilot survived. In fact Argentine AAA at Stanley shot down the Mirage when it tried an emergency landing there. It was a blatant lie for all those Argentine servicemen who had seen the Mirage being shot down by Argentine guns and had removed the dead pilot from the crashed aeroplane. Similarly, the junta's press office in Buenos Aires informed that Lieutenant Antonio Jukic, who actually was killed in his Pucará on the ground at Goose Green, had perished in a gallant, single-handed Pucará attack on HMS ''Hermes'', setting it on fire. This statement was illustrated with dramatic sketches. The men at Goose Green knew that Lieutenant Jukic had died on the ground there.<br />
''Gaceta Argentina'' summed up the British losses up to 25 May as: 5 warship sunk (correct number 3), 3 transport ships including SS ''Canberra'' (1; ''Atlantic Conveyor''), 14 Sea Harriers (2 shot down & 3 accidents) and many ships damaged, including HMS ''Hermes''. ''Gaceta Argentina'' even wrote: 'All of these details refer only to proven claims and not to estimated or unproven claims&nbsp;...'."</ref>

The ''Malvinas cause'' united the Argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that protected the junta from critics, and even opponents of the military government supported Galtieri; [[Ernesto Sabato]] said: "In Argentina, it is not a military dictatorship that is fighting. It is the whole people, her women, her children, her old people, regardless of their political persuasion. Opponents to the regime like myself are fighting for our dignity, fighting to extricate the last vestiges of colonialism. Don't be mistaken, Europe, it is not a dictatorship that is fighting for the Malvinas; it is the whole nation".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Welch |first1=David A. |title=Justice and the Genesis of War |date=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=175 |isbn=9780521558686 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2Z5blE1KGoC&q=In+Argentina+it+is+not+a+military+dictatorship+that+is+fighting.+It+is+the+whole+people%2C+her+women%2C+her+children%2C+her+old+people%2C+regardless+of+their+political+persuasion.+Opponents+to+the+regime+like+myself+are+fighting+for+our+dignity%2C+fighting+to+extricate+the+last+vestiges+of+colonialism.+Don%27t+be+mistaken%2C+Europe%2C+it+is+not+a+dictatorship+that+is+fighting+for+the+Malvinas%3B+it+is+the+whole+nation&pg=PA175 |access-date=3 October 2020}}</ref>

[[File:The Sun (Gotcha).png|thumb|''The Sun''{{'}}s infamous [[Gotcha (headline)|"Gotcha" headline]]]]
Seventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war. The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media.
The hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II's son [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], who was serving in the conflict.<ref>Freedman, "two journalists on ''Invincible'' were interested in no issue other than what Prince Andrew, a helicopter pilot as well as the Queen's son, was up to".</ref> The Prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including [[Anti-Surface Warfare]], [[Exocet missile]] decoy and casualty evacuation.

Merchant vessels had the civilian [[Inmarsat]] uplink, which enabled written [[Teletypewriter message|telex]] and voice report transmissions via satellite. {{SS|Canberra}} had a [[fax|facsimile machine]] that was used to upload 202 pictures from the South Atlantic over the course of the war. The Royal Navy leased bandwidth on the U.S. [[Defense Satellite Communications System]] for worldwide communications. Television demands a thousand times the data rate of telephone, but the Ministry of Defence was unsuccessful in convincing the U.S. to allocate more bandwidth.<ref name="Freedman">{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|p=36}}</ref>

TV producers suspected that the enquiry was half-hearted; since the [[Vietnam War]] television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised as having negative propaganda value. However, the technology only allowed uploading a single frame per 20 minutes—and only if the military satellites were allocated 100% to television transmissions. Videotapes were shipped to Ascension Island, where a broadband satellite uplink was available, resulting in TV coverage being delayed by three weeks.<ref name="Freedman"/>

The press was very dependent on the Royal Navy, and was [[censorship|censored]] on site. Many reporters in the UK knew more about the war than those with the Task Force.<ref name="Freedman"/> Ministry of Defence press briefings in London were characterised by the restrained dictation-speed delivery of its spokesman, [[Ian McDonald (civil servant)|Ian McDonald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forces.net/news/falklands/voice-falklands-war-ian-mcdonald-dies|title='Voice of Falklands War' Ian McDonald Remembered|date=10 April 2019|website=Forces Network|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref>

== Cultural impact ==
{{main|Cultural impact of the Falklands War}}
There were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina, from the immediate postwar period to the present. The Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] described the war as "a fight between two bald men over a comb".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/19/falkland-islands-editorial|title=Falkland Islands: Imperial pride|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2 October 2014|date=19 February 2010}}</ref> The words ''[[yomp]]'' and ''[[Exocet]]'' entered the British vernacular as a result of the war. The Falklands War also provided material for theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians. In Argentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockenespanol.about.com/od/rockypolitica/a/Malvinas-El-Curioso-Renacer-Del-Rock-Argentino.htm|title=Malvinas, el curioso renacer del rock argentino|author=Por MATIAS QUEROL|work=About|access-date=2 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608015717/http://rockenespanol.about.com/od/rockypolitica/a/Malvinas-El-Curioso-Renacer-Del-Rock-Argentino.htm|archive-date=8 June 2013}}</ref>
