'''"Currency manipulator"''' is a designation applied by [[United States]] government authorities, such as the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], to countries that engage in what is called “unfair currency practices” that give them a trade advantage. Such practices may be [[currency intervention]] or [[monetary policy]] in which a [[central bank]] buys or sells foreign [[currency]] in exchange for domestic currency, generally with the intention of influencing the [[exchange rate]] and [[commercial policy]]. Policymakers may have different reasons for currency intervention, such as controlling [[inflation]], maintaining international competitiveness, or [[financial stability]]. In many cases, the central bank weakens its own currency to subsidize [[export]]s and raise the price of [[import]]s, sometimes by as much as 30-40%, and it is thereby a method of [[protectionism]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2015/02/25/currency-manipulation-why-something-must-be-done/ | title=Currency Manipulation: Why Something Must Be Done | first=C.

Under the 1988 [[Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] is required to "analyze on an annual basis the exchange rate policies of foreign countries … and consider whether countries manipulate the [[exchange rate]] between their currency and the [[United States dollar]] for purposes of preventing effective [[balance of payments]] adjustments or gaining unfair [[competitive advantage]] in [[international trade]]" and that "If the Secretary considers that such manipulation is occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take action to initiate negotiations with such foreign countries on an expedited basis, in the [[International Monetary Fund]] or bilaterally, for the purpose of ensuring that such countries regularly and promptly adjust the [[rate of exchange]] between their currencies and the [[United States dollar]] to permit effective [[balance of payments]]".<ref name=1988act>{{cite web | url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/exchange-rate-policies/Documents/authorizing-statute.pdf | title=OMNIBUS TRADE AND COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 1988 (H.R. 3) : SEC. 3004.

According to the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, the Secretary of the Treasury must publish a semi-annual report in which the developments in international economic and exchange rate policies are reviewed. If a country is labeled a currency manipulator under this Act, "The [[President of the United States|President]], through Treasury, shall take specified [[remedial action]] against any such countries that fail to adopt policies to correct the undervaluation of their currency and [[trade surplus]] with the United States."<ref>{{cite web | title=H.R.644 - Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. 114th Congress (2015-2016), VII, Sec. 701 | url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/644 | website=[[Congress.gov]] | date=February 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/macroeconomic-and-foreign-exchange-policies-of-major-trading-partners | title=Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the United States | publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]}}</ref>

It has been argued that the concept of "currency manipulation" is hypocritical, given that the US already has the privilege of having the main reserve currency of the world, which is needed for international trade. Besides, massive interventions of the Federal Reserve since the financial crisis of 2008, such as Quantitative Easing and interventions in the REPO market, could very easily be interpreted as currency cheating.

==Designations under the 1988 Act==
Since the 1988 Act was enacted, the U.S. has designated the following countries as currency manipulators: [[South Korea]] in 1988, [[Taiwan]] in 1988 and again in 1992, and [[China]] from 1992 until 1994. India was added to the list in 2017 for ‘questionable foreign exchange policies’. It had stated that India had increased its purchases of foreign exchange over the last three quarters of 2017, although the rupee still rose in value. India's net purchases of foreign exchange in 2017 as a whole totalled $56 billion (2.2% of GDP).<ref>[https://thepolicytimes.com/india-removed-from-currency-manipulation-monitoring-list/ India removed from ‘currency manipulation’ monitoring list]</ref> In May 2019, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] removed [[India]] and Switzerland from its currency monitoring list but China, [[Japan]], South Korea, [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] remained on the list.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/us-removes-india-from-its-currency-monitoring-list-china-japan-stay-119052900174_1.html | title=US removes India from its currency monitoring list; China, Japan stay | agency=[[Press Trust of India]] | publisher=[[Business Standard]] | date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> India was removed from the list after it met one of the three criteria necessary for inclusion on the monitoring list, namely, a significant bilateral surplus with the US.

==Impact on manufacturing==
Currency manipulation has a disproportionate effect on the [[secondary sector of the economy]] and lobbyists of the U.S. manufacturing sector have regularly referred to China as a currency manipulator. A 2013 analysis by Carlos D. Ramirez found that "an increase of one percentage point in the share of congressional district labour force in manufacturing is associated with a 19.6% increase in the likelihood that the district legislator will label China a currency manipulator".<ref name=ramirez2013>{{cite journal | last=Ramirez | first=Carlos D. | title=The political economy of "currency manipulation" bashing | journal=[[China Economic Review (journal)|China Economic Review]] | date=December 2013 | volume=27 | pages=227–237 | doi=10.1016/j.chieco.2012.10.005 | citeseerx=10.1.1.408.3085}}</ref>
