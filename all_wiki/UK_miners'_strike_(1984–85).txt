The '''miners' strike of 1984-85''' was a major [[industrial action]] to shut down the British [[Coal mining|coal industry]] in an attempt to prevent [[colliery]] closures. It was led by [[Arthur Scargill]] of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) against the [[National Coal Board]] (NCB), a government agency. Opposition to the strike was led by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.

The NUM was divided over the action and many mineworkers, especially in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]], worked through the dispute. Few major [[trade unions]] supported the NUM, primarily because of the absence of a vote at national level. Violent confrontations between [[Picketing#Types of picket|flying pickets]] and police characterised the year-long strike, which ended in a decisive victory for the [[Second Thatcher ministry|Conservative government]] and allowed the closure of most of Britain's collieries. Many observers regard the strike as "the most bitter industrial dispute in British history".<ref>{{cite news|title=1984: The beginning of the end for British coal |location=London |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/12/newsid_3503000/3503346.stm|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref><ref name="Around World">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strikes Around the World, 1968–2005: Case-studies of 15 Countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ2ms23ZuVQC&q=statisticians+strike |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |pages=352–4 |date=2007 |isbn=9789052602851 }}</ref>  The number of person-days of work lost to the strike was over 26 million, making it the largest since the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]].<ref name="Around World"/> The journalist [[Seumas Milne]] said of the strike, "it has no real parallel – in size, duration and impact – anywhere in the world".<ref>{{cite book|last=Milne|first=Seumas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55iV2JlUz9YC&pg=PA383|title=The Enemy Within: The Secret War Against the Miners|location=London & New York|publisher=Verso|year=2004|page=ix|isbn=9781844675081}}</ref>

The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at [[Cortonwood|Cortonwood Colliery]], which led to the NUM's Yorkshire Area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The NUM President, [[Arthur Scargill]], made the strike official across Britain on 12 March 1984, but the lack of a national ballot beforehand caused controversy. The NUM strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the [[UK miners' strike (1972)|1972 strike]]. The government strategy, designed by [[Margaret Thatcher]], was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a national strike ballot.<ref name="in JSTOR">{{Cite journal |jstor = 23745863|title = Goodbye to All That?: A review of literature on the 1984/5 miners' strike|journal = Work, Employment & Society|volume = 1|issue = 3|pages = 388–404|last1 = Howell|first1 = David|year = 1987|doi = 10.1177/0950017087001003007|s2cid = 154609889}}</ref><ref name="R.R.

The number of strikes fell sharply in 1985 as a result of the "[[demonstration effect]]" and trade union power in general diminished.<ref name="Around World"/> Three deaths resulted from events related to the strike.

The much-reduced coal industry was privatised in December 1994, ultimately becoming [[UK Coal]].

Coal mining, [[Nationalisation|nationalised]] by [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in 1947, was managed by the [[National Coal Board]] (NCB) under [[Ian MacGregor]] in 1984. As in most of Europe, the industry was heavily subsidised. In 1982–3, the operating loss per tonne was £3.05, and international market prices for coal were about 25% cheaper than that charged by the NCB.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111028092310-PutPitsintoProfit1985.pdf|title=Put Pits Into Profit|author=Boyfield, Keith|date=1985|pages=21, 18|publisher=CPS}}</ref> The calculation of these operating losses was disputed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/saville/1985/08/miners.htm|title=John Saville: An Open Conspiracy – Conservative Politics and the Miners' Strike 1984–5 (August 1985)|first=John |last=Saville|work=marxists.org}}</ref>

By 1984, the richest seams of coal had been increasingly worked out and the remaining coal was more and more expensive to reach. The solution was mechanisation and greater efficiency per worker, making many miners redundant due to overcapacity of production.<ref name="theguardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/07/arthur-scargill-miners-strike|title=We could surrender – or stand and fight|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 March 2009|accessdate=9 February 2017| location=London}}</ref> The industry was restructured between 1958 and 1967 in cooperation with the unions, with a halving of the workforce; offset by government and industry initiatives to provide alternative employment. Stabilisation occurred between 1968 and 1977, when closures were minimised with the support of the unions even though the broader economy slowed. The accelerated contraction imposed by Thatcher after 1979 was strenuously opposed by the unions. In the [[post-war consensus]], policy allowed for closures only where agreed to by the workers, who in turn received guaranteed economic security. Consensus did not apply when closures were enforced and redundant miners had severely limited employment alternatives.<ref>Jim Phillips, "Deindustrialization and the Moral Economy of the Scottish Coalfields, 1947 to 1991."

The NUM's [[Three-Day Week#Background|strike in 1974]] played a major role in bringing down [[Edward Heath]]'s Conservative government. The party's response was the [[Ridley Plan]], an internal report that was leaked to ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine and appeared in its 27 May 1978 issue. Ridley described how a future Conservative government could resist and defeat a major strike in a nationalised industry. In Ridley's opinion, trade union power in the UK was interfering with market forces, pushing up inflation, and the unions' undue political power had to be curbed to restore the UK's economy.

===National Union of Mineworkers===

The mining industry was effectively a [[closed shop]]. Although not official policy, employment of non-unionised labour would have led to a mass walkout of mineworkers.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit">{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984–5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|isbn=0-7102-1371-9 }}</ref>{{rp|267}}

The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) came into being in 1945 and in 1947 most collieries in Britain were nationalised (958 nationalised, 400 private).<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/5 5] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> Demand for coal was high in the years following the Second World War, and Polish refugees were drafted to work in the pits.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|8}} Over time, coal's share in the energy market declined relative to oil and nuclear.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/6 6] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> Large-scale closures of collieries occurred in the 1960s, which led to migration of miners from the run-down coalfields (Scotland, Wales, Lancashire, the north-east of England) to Yorkshire and the Midlands coalfields.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/8 8] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> After a period of inaction from the NUM leadership over employment cuts, there was an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike in 1969]], after which many more militant candidates were elected to NUM leadership.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984–85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David  |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=19 July 2015| pages=248–250}}</ref> The threshold for endorsement of strike action in a national ballot was reduced from two-thirds in favour to 55% in 1971.<ref name="BallotThreshold">{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=David John |title=Pit Sense versus the State: A history of militant miners in the Doncaster area |year=1994 |location=London |publisher=Phoenix Press |pages=11–12 |isbn=0-948984-26-0 }}</ref> There was then success in the [[UK miners' strike (1972)|national strike in 1972]], an overtime ban, and the subsequent [[UK miners' strike (1974)|strike in 1974]] (which led to the [[Three Day Week]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |pages=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/9 9–14] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> The NUM's success in bringing down the Heath government demonstrated its power, but it caused resentment at their demand to be treated as a special case in wage negotiations.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|11}}

This 70-year-old multi-millionaire import, who massacred half the steel workforce in less than three years, is almost certainly brought in to wield the axe on pits. It's now or never for Britain's mineworkers. This is the final chance – while we still have the strength – to save our industry".<ref>Paul Routledge, "Pit strike would last 'very long time' warns NCB", ''The Times'' (8 March 1983), p. 1.</ref> On 12 May 1983, in response to being questioned on how he would respond if the Conservatives were re-elected in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|general election]], Scargill replied: "My attitude would be the same as the attitude of the working class in Germany when the Nazis came to power. It does not mean that because at some stage you elect a government that you tolerate its existence. You oppose it".<ref name="Times130583" >Paul Routledge, "Tories likened to Nazis", ''The Times'' (13 May 1983), p. 1.</ref> He also said he would oppose a second-term Thatcher government "as vigorously as I possibly can".<ref name="Times130583" /> After the election, Scargill called for [[Extra-parliamentary opposition|extra-parliamentary action]] against the Conservative government in a speech to the NUM conference in Perth on 4 July 1983:

<blockquote>A fight back against this Government's policies will inevitably take place outside rather than inside Parliament. When I talk about 'extra-parliamentary action' there is a great outcry in the press and from leading Tories about my refusal to accept the democratic will of the people. I am not prepared to accept policies elected by a minority of the British electorate. I am not prepared quietly to accept the destruction of the coal industry, nor am I willing to see our social services decimated. This totally undemocratic Government can now easily push through whatever laws it chooses. Faced with possible parliamentary destruction of all that is good and compassionate in our society, extra-parliamentary action will be the only course open to the working class and the Labour movement.<ref>Paul Routledge, "Pit leaders seek backing for big pay increases", ''The Times'' (5 July 1983), p. 1.</ref></blockquote>

Scargill also rejected the idea that pits that did not make a profit were "uneconomic": he claimed there was no such thing as an uneconomic pit and argued that no pits should close except due to geological exhaustion or safety.<ref>Campbell, p. 356.</ref><ref>Peter Jenkins, ''Mrs Thatcher's Revolution: The Ending of the Socialist Era'' (London: Pan, 1988), pp. 226-228.</ref>

===National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers===
No mining could legally be done without being overseen by an overman or deputy.<ref name="STimes161162" /> Their union, the [[National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers]] (NACODS) with 17,000 members in 1984, was less willing to take industrial action.<ref name="STimes161162">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |pages=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/161 161–162] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> Its constitution required a two-thirds majority for a national strike.<ref name="STimes164">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/164 164] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> During the 1972 strike, violent confrontations between striking NUM and non-striking NACODS members led to an agreement that NACODS members could stay off work without loss of pay if they were faced with aggressive picketing.<ref name="STimes161162" /> Thus solidarity with striking NUM members could be shown by claims of violence preventing the crossing of picket lines even without a NACODS union vote for strike action. Initially the threshold for striking was not met; although a majority had voted for strike action, it was not enough. However, later during the strike 82% did vote for strike action.<ref name="theguardian"/>

===Calls for action===
In January 1981, the Yorkshire area of the NUM held a successful ballot to approve strike action over any pit threatened with closure on economic grounds.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|169}}  This led to a two-week local strike over the closure of Orgreave Colliery, but the ballot result was later invoked to justify strikes over other closures, including Cortonwood in 1984.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|169}}  In February 1981, the government announced plans to close 23 pits across the country but the threat of a national strike was enough to force a back down. Coal stocks would last only six weeks, after which Britain would shut down and people would demand concessions.

===Thatcher's strategy===
[[File:Premier Thatcher tijdens een persconferentie, Bestanddeelnr 932-7044.jpg|thumb|upright|Margaret Thatcher in 1983]]
Prime Minister Thatcher expected Scargill to force a confrontation, and in response she set up a defence in depth.<ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady'' (2003), pp. 355–64.</ref><ref>Moore, ''Thatcher'' (2016), pp. 142–50.</ref> She believed that the excessive costs of increasingly inefficient collieries had to end in order to grow the economy. She planned to close inefficient pits and depend more on imported coal, oil, gas and nuclear. She appointed hardliners to key positions, set up a high level planning committee,<ref>Jim Phillips, "Containing, Isolating, and Defeating the Miners: The UK Cabinet Ministerial Group on Coal and the Three Phases of the 1984–85 Strike." ''Historical Studies in Industrial Relations'' 35 (2014): 117–141.</ref> and allocated funds from the highly profitable electrical supply system to stockpile at least six months’ worth of coal.<ref>"Sir Peter Gregson, civil servant – obituary: Whitehall mandarin who helped lay the groundwork for Mrs Thatcher's defeat of Arthur Scargill," [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12062743/Sir-Peter-Gregson-civil-servant-obituary.html ''The Telegraph'' 21 Dec 2015]</ref> Thatcher's team set up mobile police units so that forces from outside the strike areas could neutralise efforts by flying pickets to stop the transport of coal to power stations. It used the National Recording Centre (NRC), set up in 1972 by the Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales linking 43 police forces to enable police forces to travel to assist in major disturbances.<ref>Martin Kettle, "The National Reporting Centre and the 1984 miners' strike," in  Bob Fine and Robert Millar, eds., ''Policing the miners' strike'' (1985), pp. 23–33.</ref><ref>J.

On 19 April 1984 a Special National Delegate Conference was held where there was a vote whether to hold a national ballot or not. The NUM delegates voted 69-54 not to have a national ballot,<ref name="auto4">Campbell, p. 357.</ref> a position argued for by Arthur Scargill. Scargill states "Our special conference was held on 19 April. McGahey, Heathfield and I were aware from feedback that a slight majority of areas favoured the demand for a national strike ballot; therefore, we were expecting and had prepared for that course of action with posters, ballot papers and leaflets. A major campaign was ready to go for a "Yes" vote in a national strike ballot."<ref name="theguardian"/> McGahey said: "We shall not be constitutionalised out of a strike...Area by area will decide and there will be a domino effect".<ref name="auto4"/>

Without a national ballot, miners in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, South Derbyshire, North Wales and parts of Lancashire kept working. The police provided protection for working miners from aggressive picketing.<ref>David Amos, "The Nottinghamshire miners, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and the 1984–85 miners strike: scabs or scapegoats?' (PhD Diss. University of Nottingham, 2012).</ref>

In 1983, Thatcher had appointed [[Ian MacGregor]] to head the [[National Coal Board]]. He had turned the [[British Steel Corporation]] from one of the least efficient steel-makers in Europe to one of the most efficient, bringing the company into near profit.<ref>Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady'' (2003), pp. 99–100.</ref> Success was achieved at the expense of halving the workforce in two years and he had overseen a 14-week national strike in 1980. His tough reputation raised expectations that coal jobs would be cut on a similar scale and confrontations between MacGregor and Scargill seemed inevitable.

Thatcher in closed meetings referred to union leaders as "the enemy within" but word got out and strikers and organisers misinterpreted the quote to say that Thatcher was demonizing all miners.<ref>She used the term in closed talks in July 1984. The phrase was widely reported and was used by [[Seumas Milne]] as the title of his 2004 book: {{cite book|first=Seumas |last=Milne |author-link=Seumas Milne |title=The Enemy Within: The Secret War Against the Miners |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55iV2JlUz9YC|year=2004 |publisher=Verso |page=23|isbn=9781844675081 }}</ref>

===Pit closures announced===
[[File:KentNUMStrikeBadge.JPG|thumb|A badge produced by Kent NUM in support of the miners' strike]]
On 6 March 1984, the NCB announced that the agreement reached after the 1974 strike was obsolete, and that to reduce government subsidies, 20 collieries would close with a loss of 20,000 jobs. Many communities in [[Northern England]], Scotland and Wales would lose their primary source of employment.<ref>''Coal Not Dole, memories of the 1984/85 Miners' Strike'' by Guthrie Hutton {{ISBN|978-1-84033-329-9}}</ref>

Scargill said the government had a long-term strategy to close more than 70 pits. The government denied the claim and MacGregor wrote to every NUM member claiming Scargill was deceiving them and there were no plans to close any more pits than had already been announced. Cabinet papers released in 2014 indicate that MacGregor wished to close 75 pits over a three-year period.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25549596 | work=BBC News | title=Cabinet papers reveal 'secret coal pits closure plan' | date=3 January 2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Thatcher government had prepared against a repeat of the effective 1974 industrial action by stockpiling coal, converting some power stations to burn heavy fuel oil, and recruiting fleets of road hauliers to transport coal in case sympathetic railwaymen went on strike to support the miners.<ref name="BBC"/>

===Action begins===
Sensitive to the impact of proposed closures, miners in various coalfields began strike action. In  [[South Yorkshire Coalfield|Yorkshire]], miners at [[Manvers Main Colliery|Manvers]],<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|86}} [[Cadeby, South Yorkshire|Cadeby]],<ref name="Winterton66">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=66 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref> [[Silverwood Colliery|Silverwood]],<ref name="Winterton66"/> [[Kiveton Park Colliery|Kiveton Park]]<ref name="Winterton66"/> and [[Yorkshire Main Colliery|Yorkshire Main]]<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|218}} were on unofficial strike for other issues before official action was called. More than 6,000 miners were on strike from 5 March at [[Cortonwood]] and Bullcliffe Wood, near Wakefield.<ref name="Winterton67">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=67 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref> Neither pit's reserves were exhausted. Bullcliffe Wood had been under threat, but Cortonwood had been considered safe. Action was prompted on 5 March by the NCB's announcement that five pits would be subject to "accelerated closure" in just five weeks; the other three were [[Herrington]] in County Durham, [[Snowdown]] in Kent and [[Fallin, Stirling|Polmaise]] in Scotland. The next day, pickets from Yorkshire appeared at pits in Nottinghamshire and [[Harworth Colliery]] closed after a mass influx of pickets amid claims that Nottinghamshire was "scabland in 1926".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984–85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |page=293 |last1=Amos |first1=David  |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=19 July 2015}}</ref> On 12 March 1984, Scargill declared the NUM's support for the regional strikes in Yorkshire and Scotland, and called for action from NUM members in all other areas but decided not to hold a nationwide vote which was used by his opponents to delegitimise the strike.<ref>Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-war Britain: A political history'' (Harvester Press, 1979), p. 449.</ref>

===Picketing===
[[File:Miners strike rally London 1984.jpg|right|thumb|Miners' strike rally in London, 1984]]
The strike was almost universally observed in [[South Wales]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Scotland]], [[North East England]] and [[Kent]], but there was less support across the [[The Midlands|Midlands]] and in [[North Wales]]. [[Nottinghamshire]] became a target for aggressive and sometimes violent picketing as Scargill's pickets tried to stop local miners from working.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|264}}  Lancashire miners were reluctant to strike, but most refused to cross picket lines formed by the Yorkshire NUM.<ref name="Winterton81">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |pages=81–82 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref> Picketing in Lancashire was less aggressive and is credited with a more sympathetic response from the local miners.<ref name="Winterton81" />

The '[[Battle of Orgreave]]' took place on 18 June 1984 at the Orgreave Coking Plant near [[Rotherham]], which striking miners were attempting to blockade. The confrontation, between about 5,000 miners and the same number of police, broke into violence after police on [[Mounted police|horseback]] charged with [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]] drawn – 51 pickets and 72 policemen were injured. Other less well known, but bloody, battles between pickets and police took place, for example, in [[Maltby, South Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_2527000/2527559.stm|title=On this Day, 21 September – 1984: Maltby picket sparks violence.|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2009| date=21 September 1984}}</ref>

During the strike, 11,291 people were arrested, mostly for breach of the peace or obstructing roads whilst picketing, of whom 8,392 were charged and between 150 and 200 were imprisoned.<ref name ="Around World"/>  At least 9,000 mineworkers were dismissed after being arrested whilst picketing even when no charges were brought.<ref name ="Around World"/>

After the 1980 steel strike, many hauliers [[blacklist (employment)|blacklisted]] drivers who refused to cross picket lines to prevent them obtaining work, and so more drivers crossed picket lines in 1984–85 than in previous disputes.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|144}}  Picketing failed to have the widespread impact of earlier stoppages that led to [[Power outage|blackouts and power cuts]] in the 1970s and electricity companies maintained supplies throughout the winter, the time of biggest demand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/3/newsid_2515000/2515019.stm|title=On this Day, 3 March – 1985: Miners call off year-long strike|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2009| date=3 March 1985}}</ref>

From September, some miners returned to work even where the strike had been universally observed. It led to an escalation of tension, and riots in [[Easington, County Durham|Easington]] in Durham<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |pages=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/203 203–204] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> and [[Brampton Bierlow]] in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |pages=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/206 206–207] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>

===Strike ballots by NACODS===
In April 1984, [[National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers|NACODS]] voted to strike but was short of the two-thirds majority that their constitution required.<ref name="STimes164" /> In areas where the strike was observed, most NACODS members did not cross picket lines and, under an agreement from the 1972 strike, stayed off work on full pay.<ref name="STimes161162"/>  When the number of strikebreakers increased in August, Merrick Spanton, the NCB personnel director, said he expected NACODS members to cross picket lines to supervise their work threatening the 1972 agreement which led to a second ballot.<ref name="STimes161162" /> Ian MacGregor suggested that deputies could be replaced by outsiders as Ronald Reagan had done during the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)#August 1981 strike|1981 airline strike]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Macintyre |first=Donald |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ian-macgregor-scourge-of-miners-dies-1156189.html|title=Ian MacGregor, scourge of miners, dies|work=[[The Independent]]|date=7 March 2009|accessdate=4 September 2016| location=UK}}</ref> In September, for the first time, NACODS voted to strike with a vote of 81% in favour.<ref name="theguardian"/><ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|196}} The government then made concessions over the review procedure for unprofitable collieries, much to the anger of Ian MacGregor, and a deal negotiated by North Yorkshire NCB Director Michael Eaton persuaded NACODS to call off the strike action.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|197–200}}

The results of the review procedure were not binding on the NCB, and the NUM rejected the agreement.<ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd3637">{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|pages=36–37}}</ref>  Reviews for Cadeby in Yorkshire and Bates in Northumberland concluded that the pits could stay open but the NCB overruled and closed them.<ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd3637"/>  The abandonment of strike plans when most of their demands had not been met led to conspiracy theories on the motives of NACODS leaders.<ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd3637"/>

MacGregor later admitted that if NACODS had gone ahead with a strike, a compromise would probably have been forced on the NCB. Files later made public showed that the government had an informant inside the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC), passing information about negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1484704,00.html|title=Mole betrayed striking miners|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 May 2005|last1=Evans|first1=Rob|last2=Hencke|first2=David|accessdate=6 March 2009| location=London}}</ref>

In 2009, Arthur Scargill wrote that the settlement agreed with NACODS and the NCB would have ended the strike and said, "The monumental betrayal by NACODS has never been explained in a way that makes sense."<ref name="theguardian"/>

===Court judgments on legality of strike===
In the first month of the strike, the NCB secured a court injunction to restrict picketing in Nottinghamshire, but the Energy Minister Peter Walker forbade Ian MacGregor from invoking it as the government considered it would antagonise the miners and unite them behind the NUM.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|157–158}}  Legal challenges were brought by groups of working miners, who subsequently organised as the Working Miners' Committee. David Hart, a farmer and property developer with libertarian political beliefs, did much to organise and fund working miners.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|157–158}} On 25 May, a writ issued in the High Court by Colin Clark from Pye Hill Colliery, sponsored by Hart, was successful in forbidding the Nottinghamshire area from instructing that the strike was official and to be obeyed.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|165}} Similar actions were successful in Lancashire and South Wales.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|165}}

In September, Lord Justice Nicholls heard two cases, in the first, North Derbyshire miners argued that the strike was illegal both at area level, as a majority of its miners had voted against, and at national level, as there had been no ballot. In the second, two miners from Manton Colliery, in the Yorkshire area but geographically in North Nottinghamshire, argued that the area-level strike in Yorkshire was illegal. Miners at Manton had overwhelmingly voted against the strike, but police had advised that their safety could not be guaranteed.<ref name="SundayTimes46">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/46 46] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> The NUM was not represented at the hearing.<ref name="SundayTimes46"/>  The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled that the NUM had breached its constitution by calling a strike without holding a ballot.<ref name="Illegal">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_2540000/2540813.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY – 28 September – 1984: Pit dispute 'illegal' says judge|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Although Justice Nicholls did not order the NUM to hold a ballot, he forbade the union from disciplining members who crossed picket lines.<ref name="Illegal"/>

The strike in Yorkshire relied on a ballot from January 1981, in which 85.6% of the members voted to strike if any pit was threatened with closure on economic grounds.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|169}}  The motion was passed with regard to the closure of Orgreave Colliery, which prompted a two-week strike.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|169}}  The NUM executive approved the decision in Yorkshire to invoke the ballot result as binding on 8 March 1984.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|169}} Mr Justice Nicholls ruled that the 1981 ballot result was "too remote in time [with]... too much change in the branch membership of the Area since then for that ballot to be capable of justifying a call to strike action two and a half years later."<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|171}}  He ruled that the Yorkshire area could not refer to the strike as "official", although he did not condemn the strike as "illegal" as he did in the case of the national strike and the North Derbyshire strike.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|171}}

Scargill referred to the ruling as "another attempt by an unelected judge to interfere in the union's affairs."<ref name="Illegal"/> He was fined £1,000 (paid by an anonymous businessman), and the NUM was fined £200,000. When the union refused to pay, an order was made to [[sequestration (law)|sequester]] the union's assets, but they had been transferred abroad.<ref>Campbell, p. 366.</ref>  In October 1984, the NUM executive voted to cooperate with the court to recover the funds, despite opposition from Scargill, who stated in court that he was only apologising for his contempt of court because the executive voted for him to do so.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|175–176}} By the end of January 1985, around £5&nbsp;million of NUM assets had been recovered.<ref name="Thatcher">{{cite book | last=Thatcher | first=Margaret | author-link=Margaret Thatcher | year=1993 | title=The Downing Street Years | url=https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that | url-access=registration | publisher=[[HarperCollins]] | isbn=978-0-00-638321-5 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/downingstreetyea00that/page/n409 374]}}</ref>

A Court of Session decision in Edinburgh ruled that Scottish miners had acted within their rights by taking local ballots on a show of hands and so union funds in Scotland could not be sequestered. "During the strike, the one area they couldn't touch was Scotland. They were sequestering the NUM funds, except in Scotland, because the judges deemed that the Scottish area had acted within the rules of the Union" – David Hamilton MP, Midlothian<ref>{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Guthrie|title=Coal Not Dole Memories of the 1984/85 miners' strike.|year=2005|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, Ayrshire|isbn=9781840333299|page=8|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=395}}</ref>

Scargill claims "It was essential to present a united response to the NCB and we agreed that, if the coal board planned to force pit closures on an area by area basis, then we must respond at least initially on that same basis. The NUM's rules permitted areas to take official strike action if authorised by our national executive committee in accordance with Rule 41."<ref name="theguardian"/>

===Breakaway union===
The Nottinghamshire NUM officially supported the strike, but most of its members continued to work and many considered the strike unconstitutional given their majority vote against a strike and absence of a ballot for a national strike.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|262}}  As many working miners felt the NUM was not doing enough to protect them from intimidation from pickets, a demonstration was organised on May Day in [[Mansfield]], in which the representative Ray Chadburn was shouted down, and fighting ensued between protesters for and against the strike.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|264}}

In NUM elections in summer 1984, members in Nottinghamshire voted out most of the leaders who had supported the strike, so that 27 of 31 newly elected were opposed to the strike.<ref name="Winterton227">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=227 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref>  The Nottinghamshire NUM then opposed the strike openly and stopped payments to local strikers.<ref name="Winterton227" />  The national NUM attempted to introduce "Rule 51", to discipline area leaders who were working against national policy.<ref name="Winterton227" />  The action was nicknamed the "star chamber court" by working miners (in reference to the [[Star Chamber]] in English history).<ref name="Winterton227" />  It was prevented by an injunction from the High Court.<ref name="Winterton228">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=228 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref>

Working miners in Nottinghamshire and South Derbyshire set up a new union: the [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]].<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), p. 274.</ref>  It attracted members from many isolated pits in England – including [[Agecroft Colliery|Agecroft]] and [[Parsonage Colliery|Parsonage]] in Lancashire, Chase Terrace and Trenton Workshops in Staffordshire, and Daw Mill in Warwickshire.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|274}}

Although most Leicestershire miners continued working, they voted to stay in the NUM.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|276}}  Unlike Nottinghamshire, the leadership in Leicestershire never attempted to enforce the strike,<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), 276.</ref>  and an official, Jack Jones, had publicly criticised Scargill.<ref name="Winterton227" />  At some pits in Nottinghamshire, Ollerton, Welbeck and Clipstone, roughly half the workforce stayed in the NUM.<ref name="Winterton234">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=234 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref>

===The formal end===

The strike ended on 3 March 1985, nearly a year after it had begun. The South Wales area called for a return to work on condition that men sacked during the strike would be reinstated, but the NCB rejected the proposal when its bargaining position was improved by miners returning to work.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/249 249] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>  Only the Yorkshire and Kent regions voted against ending the strike.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |pages=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/249 249–251] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>  One of the few concessions made by the NCB was to postpone the closure of the five pits: Cortonwood, Bullcliffe Wood, [[Herrington#Herrington Country Park|Herrington]], Polmaise and Snowdown.<ref name="ST253">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/253 253] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>

At several pits, miners' wives groups organised the distribution of [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnations]], the flower that symbolises the hero, at the pit gates on the day the miners went back. Many pits marched back to work behind [[brass band]]s, in processions dubbed "loyalty parades". Arthur Scargill led a procession accompanied by a Scots piper, back to work at [[Barrow Colliery]] in [[Worsborough]] but then it was stopped by a picket of Kent miners. Scargill said, "I never cross a picket line," and turned the procession away.<ref name="ST254" />

==Issues==

===Ballots===
The role of ballots in NUM policy had been disputed over a number of years, and a series of legal disputes in 1977 left their status unclear. In 1977, the implementation of an incentive scheme proved controversial, as different areas would receive different pay rates. After the NUM's National Executive Conference rejected the scheme, NUM leader [[Joe Gormley (trade unionist)|Joe Gormley]] arranged a national ballot. The Kent area who opposed the scheme sought a court injunction to prevent it, but [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] ruled that "the conference might not have spoken with the true voice of all the members and in his view a ballot was a reasonable and democratic proposal". The scheme was rejected by 110,634 votes to 87,901. The Nottinghamshire, South Derbyshire and Leicestershire areas resolved to adopt the incentive scheme as their members would benefit from increased pay. The Yorkshire, Kent and South Wales areas sought an injunction to prevent these actions on the grounds of the ballot result. [[Tasker Watkins|Mr. Justice Watkins]] ruled that, "The result of a ballot, nationally conducted, is not binding upon the National Executive Committee in using its powers in between conferences. It may serve to persuade the committee to take one action or another, or to refrain from action, but it has no great force or significance."<ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd32">{{cite book|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|year=2005|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|page=32|last1=Douglass|first1=David John}}</ref>

Scargill did not call a ballot for national strike action, perhaps due to uncertainty over the outcome. Instead, he started the strike by allowing each region to call its own strikes, imitating Gormley's strategy over wage reforms; it was argued that 'safe' regions should not be allowed to ballot other regions out of jobs. The decision was upheld by  a vote by the NUM executive five weeks into the strike.<ref name="cpgb">{{cite journal|url=http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/454/scargillism.html |title=Scargillism and the miners |journal=[[Weekly Worker]] |publisher=[[Communist Party of Great Britain]] |date=31 October 2002 |issue=454 |last=Douglass |first=Dave |author-link=Dave Douglass |accessdate=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820224224/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/454/scargillism.html |archive-date=20 August 2008 }}</ref>

Two polls by [[MORI]] in April 1984 found that the majority of miners supported a strike.<ref name="ST78">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/78 78] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>  [[Ken Livingstone]] wrote in his memoirs that Scargill had interpreted a ''[[Daily Mail]]'' poll that suggested a comfortable majority of miners favoured a national strike to be a trick and that he would actually lose a national ballot.<ref>Livingstone, Ken (2011).

In ballots in South Wales on 10 March 1984, only 10 of the 28 pits voted in favour of striking, but the arrival of pickets from Yorkshire the next day led to virtually all miners in South Wales going on strike in solidarity.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/262 262] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>  The initial vote against strike action by most lodges in South Wales was interpreted as an act of retaliation for a lack of support from Yorkshire in years when numerous pits in Wales were closing, especially following the closure of the Lewis Merthyr colliery in March 1983 and only 54% of Yorkshire miners voting for a national strike that month, a full 14% below the vote for a national strike in both South Wales and Kent.<ref>[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/callinicos/1985/miners/chap1.html ''The Strike Begins''] in {{cite book|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/callinicos/1985/miners/index.html |title=The great strike: the miners strike of 1984–5 and its lessons|last1=Callinicos|first1=Alex|author-link=Alex Callinicos|last2=Simons|first2=Mike|year=1985|publisher=Socialist Worker|location=London|isbn=0-905998-50-2}}</ref>

The [[British Conservative Party|Conservative]] government under Margaret Thatcher enforced a law that required unions to ballot members on strike action. On 19 July 1984, Thatcher said in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that giving in to the miners would be surrendering the rule of [[parliamentary democracy]] to the [[ochlocracy|rule of the mob]]. She referred to union leaders as "the enemy within" and claimed they did not share the values of other British people; advocates of the strike misinterpreted the quote to suggest that Thatcher had used it as a reference to all miners.<ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: Everything She Wants'', 2015, p. 164.</ref>

Thatcher on 19 July 1984 delivered a speech in which she spoke to backbench MPs and compared the [[Falklands War]] to the strike:

{{quote|We had to fight the enemy without in the [[Falklands War|Falklands]]. We always have to be aware of the enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.<ref name=1984strike>{{cite web|title=Speech to 1922 Committee ("the enemy within")|url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105563|date=19 July 1984}}</ref>}}

She claimed that the miners' leader was making the country witness an attempt at preventing democracy.<ref name=1984strike />

On the day after the [[Battle of Orgreave|Orgreave picket]] of 18 June, which saw five thousand pickets clash violently with police, she remarked:

<blockquote>I must tell you... that what we have got is an attempt to substitute the rule of the mob for the rule of law, and ''it must '''not''' succeed''. ''[cheering]'' It must not succeed. There are those who are using violence and intimidation to impose their will on others who do not want it.... The rule of law must prevail over the rule of the mob.<ref name="rule of law">{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=105691|title=Remarks on Orgreave picketing ("attempt to substitute the rule of the mob for the rule of law")|work=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Neil Kinnock]] supported the call for a national ballot in April 1984.<ref name="auto1"/>
Scargill's response to the Orgreave incident was:

<blockquote>We've had riot shields, we've had riot gear, we've had police on horseback charging into our people, we've had people hit with truncheons and people kicked to the ground.... The intimidation and the brutality that has been displayed are something reminiscent of a Latin American state.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/29/newsid_2494000/2494793.stm|title=On This Day, 29 May – 1984: Miners and police clash at Orgreave|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2009| date=29 May 1984}}</ref></blockquote>

At the [[Battle of Orgreave]] on 18 June 1984, the NUM pickets failed to stop the movement of lorries amid police violence and subsequent retaliation by the pickets, with the footage controversially reversed by the BBC on their news broadcast. The violence was costing the NUM public support in the country as a whole, as a Gallup poll showed 79% disapproval of NUM methods. While it was now clear that the government had the equipment, the forces, the organisation, and the will to prevail against pickets, the strong pro-strike solidarity outside of the Midlands and the possibility of extended strike action by other trade unions, especially the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Spitfires (NACODS) which could shut down every pit in the country if NACODS members went on strike, was a constant threat for the government and had the outcome of who would likely win the miners' strike dispute hanging in the balance for many months.

The number of miners at work grew to 53,000 by late June.<ref>Moore, ''Thatcher'' (2016) 2:158.</ref>

===Mobilisation of police===
The government mobilised police forces from around Britain including the [[Metropolitan Police]] in an attempt to stop pickets preventing strikebreakers from working. They attempted to stop pickets travelling from Yorkshire to Nottinghamshire which led to many protests.<ref name="travel stopped">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/9/newsid_2903000/2903651.stm|title=On this day, 9 April – 1984: Dozens arrested in picket line violence|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2009| date=9 April 1984}}</ref> On 26 March 1984, pickets protested against the police powers by driving very slowly on the M1 and the A1 around Doncaster.<ref name="ST70">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/70 70] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> The government claimed the  actions were to uphold the law and safeguard individual [[civil rights]].

On 16 July 1984, Thatcher convened a ministerial meeting to consider declaring a [[state of emergency]], with the option to use 4,500 military drivers and 1,650 [[tipper truck]]s to keep coal supplies available. This backup plan was not needed and was not implemented.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/miners-strike-margaret-thatcher-prepared-2981964|title=Miners' strike: Margaret Thatcher was prepared to declare state of emergency and use 4,500 troops to break unions|first=James |last=Lyons|date=3 January 2014|work=mirror}}</ref>

===No welfare benefit payments===
Welfare benefits had never been available to strikers but their dependents had been entitled to make claims in previous disputes. Clause 6 of the [[Social Security Act 1980]]<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/30/section/6/enacted Social Security Act 1980] ''www.legislation.gov.uk'', accessed 3 November 2020</ref> banned the dependents of strikers from receiving "urgent needs" payments and applied a compulsory deduction from the benefits of strikers' dependents.

===Public opinion and the media===
According to [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] "though there was widespread sympathy for the miners, faced with the loss of their livelihoods, there was remarkably little public support for the strike, because of Scargill's methods".<ref>Campbell, p. 358.</ref> When asked in a [[Gallup poll]] in July 1984 whether their sympathies lay mainly with the employers or the miners, 40% said employers; 33% were for the miners; 19% were for neither and 8% did not know.

''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper took a very anti-strike position, as did the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', and even the Labour Party-supporting ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' became hostile as the strike became increasingly violent.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|251–252}} The ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'' was the only national daily newspaper that consistently supported the striking miners and the NUM.

Socialist groups considered the mainstream media deliberately misrepresented the miners' strike, with Mick Duncan of the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]] saying of ''The Sun''{{'}}s reporting of the strike: "The day-to-day reporting involved more subtle attacks, or a biased selection of facts and a lack of alternative points of view. These things arguably had a far bigger negative effect on the miners' cause".<ref name="media1">{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/2366|title=The miners' strike 1984–5: lies, damned lies and the press|last=Duncan|first=Mick|work=[[Solidarity (newspaper)|Solidarity]]|publisher=[[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]]|date=13 August 2004|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref><ref name="media2">{{cite web|url=http://www.wcml.org.uk/culture/miners.htm|title=Writing and the Miners' Strike 1984–5|last=Palfrey|first=Sammy|work=Working Class Movement Library|accessdate=6 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009182408/http://www.wcml.org.uk/culture/miners.htm|archive-date=9 October 2007}}</ref>

Writing in the ''Industrial Relations Journal'' immediately after the strike in 1985, Professor Brian Towers of the [[University of Nottingham]] commented on the way the media had portrayed strikers, stating that there had been "the obsessive reporting of the 'violence' of generally relatively unarmed men and some women who, in the end, offered no serious challenge to the truncheons, shields and horses of a well-organised, optimally deployed police force."<ref name="towersb">{{Cite journal | last1 = Towers | first1 = B. | title = Posing larger questions: The British miners' Strike of 1984–85 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2338.1985.tb00510.x | journal = Industrial Relations Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 8–25| year = 1985 }}</ref>

The stance of the ''Daily Mirror'' varied. Having initially been uninterested in the dispute, the paper's owner Robert Maxwell took a supportive stance in July 1984 by organising a seaside trip for striking miners and meeting with NUM officials to discuss tactics.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|251–252}} However, Maxwell insisted that Scargill should condemn the violence directed against strike-breakers, which he was unwilling to do.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|251–252}} The ''Daily Mirror'' then adopted a more critical stance, and journalist [[John Pilger]] published several articles on the violence directed against strike-breakers.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|251–252}}

===NUM links with Libya and the Soviet Union===
As the courts seized the NUM's assets, it began to look abroad for money, and found supplies in the Soviet bloc and, it was mistakenly thought, also from Libya. These countries were highly unpopular with the British public. The Soviet Union's official trade union federation donated £1.5&nbsp;million to the NUM.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|228}}<ref>{{cite book|first=Irina |last=Prokhorova|title=1990: Russians Remember a Turning Point|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7g-BAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PR7|year=2014|publisher=Quercus|page=1|isbn=9781623655341}}</ref>

Media reports alleged that senior NUM officials were personally keeping some of the funds. In November 1984, it was alleged that senior NUM officials had travelled to Libya for money.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kinnock leads condemnation of NUM's Libyan links|work=Glasgow Herald|date=29 October 1984|page=1|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e8FAAAAAIBAJ&pg=5939,6427434}}</ref> Cash from the Libyan government was particularly damaging coming seven months after the murder of policewoman [[Yvonne Fletcher]] outside the Libyan embassy in London by Libyan agents. In 1990, the ''Daily Mirror'' and TV programme ''[[The Cook Report]]'' claimed that Scargill and the NUM had received money from the Libyan government. The allegations were based on allegations by [[Roger Windsor]], who was the NUM official who had spoken to Libyan officials. [[Roy Greenslade]], the editor of the ''Mirror'', said 18 years later he was "now convinced that Scargill didn't misuse strike funds and that the union didn't get money from Libya."<ref>{{cite news

[[Poland|Polish]] trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] criticised Scargill for "going too far and threatening the elected government", which influenced some Polish miners in Britain to oppose the strike.<ref name="Douglas 96" />  Scargill opposed Solidarity as an "anti-socialist organisation which desires the overthrow of a socialist state".<ref>{{cite news|last1=McKinlay|first1=John|title=Scargill angers unions with Solidarity attack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19830908&id=hfU9AAAAIBAJ&pg=2345,1392758|accessdate=1 September 2014|publisher=The Glasgow Herald|date=8 September 1983}}</ref>  The supply of Polish coal to British power stations during the strike led to a brief picket of the embassy of Poland in London.<ref>{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=David John |title=Pit Sense versus the State: A history of militant miners in the Doncaster area |year=1994 |location=London |publisher=Phoenix Press |page=45 |isbn=0-948984-26-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=92 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref>

===Violence===
The strike was the most violent industrial dispute in Britain of the 20th century.<ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd37">{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=37}}</ref>  Strikes in the British coal industry had a history of violence, but the 1984–85 strike exceeded even the 1926 strike in the levels of violence.<ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd37"/>  Nevertheless, the majority of pickets lines were non-violent.<ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd37"/> Instances of violence directed against working miners were reported from the start. The BBC reported that pickets from [[Fallin, Stirling|Polmaise Colliery]] had punched miners at [[Loanhead|Bilston Glen Colliery]] who were trying to enter their workplace on 12 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/12/newsid_2540000/2540175.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY – 12 March – 1984: Miners strike over threatened pit closures|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Property, families and pets belonging to  working miners were also attacked.<ref name="attacks">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3437083.stm|title=What is a scab?|work=BBC News|date=4 March 2004|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>  Ted McKay, the North Wales secretary who supported a national ballot before strike action, said he had received death threats and threats to kidnap his children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8550787.stm|title=BBC News – Former NUM officer's fears in 1984/85 miners' strike|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>  The intimidation of working miners in Nottinghamshire, vandalism to cars and pelting them with stones, paint or brake fluid, was a major factor in the formation of the breakaway [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]].<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), p. 264.</ref>

Occasionally, attacks were made on working members of [[National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers|NACODS]] and administrative staff. In March 1984 the NCB announced it would abandon [[Yorkshire Main Colliery]] after a deputy engineer suffered a split chin from being stoned and administrative staff had to be escorted out by the police.<ref name="YorkshireMain"/> Some pits continued working without significant disruption. In Leicestershire only 31 miners went on strike for the full 12 months<ref name="DT7">{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=David |date=2009 |title=The Dirty Thirty: Heroes of the Miners' Strike |location=Nottingham |publisher=Five Leaves |page=7 |isbn=9781905512676 }}</ref> and in South Derbyshire only 17, but these areas were not targeted by pickets in the same way as Nottinghamshire.<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), p. 262.</ref>

On 9 July 1984 pickets at [[Rossington]] Colliery attempted to trap 11 NCB safety inspectors inside the colliery. Camera teams were present as two police vans arrived to assist the safety inspectors and were attacked by missiles from the pickets.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|94}}

Following the breakdown of relations between the NUM and the ISTC ([[Iron and Steel Trades Confederation]]), NUM pickets threw bricks, concrete and eggs full of paint at lorries transporting coal and iron ore to South Wales.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|139}} In September 1984, Viv Brook, assistant chief constable of South Wales Police, warned that throwing concrete from motorway bridges was likely to kill someone.<ref>{{cite news |last=Boseley |first=Sarah |date=1 December 1984 |title=From the archive, 1 December 1984: Taxi driver killed by striking miners |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/01/miners-strike-taxi-driver-killed-1984 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=21 December 2014 }}</ref> Taxi driver, [[Killing of David Wilkie|David Wilkie]], was killed on 30 November 1984 while driving a non-striking miner to [[Merthyr Vale]] Colliery, in South Wales.

Scargill said in December 1984 that those who returned to work after taking the NCB's incentives for strikebreaking should be treated as "lost lambs" rather than traitors.<ref name="ST214" /> When questioned by the media, Scargill refused to condemn the violence, which he attributed to the hardship and frustration of pickets,<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/155 155] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref> with the one exception being the killing of David Wilkie.<ref name="ST214" />  There was criticism of picket-line violence from lodges at striking pits, such as the resolution by the Grimethorpe and Kellingley lodges in Yorkshire that condemned throwing bricks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=David John |title=Pit Sense versus the State: A history of militant miners in the Doncaster area |year=1994 |location=London |publisher=Phoenix Press |pages=58–59 |isbn=0-948984-26-0 }}</ref>

Even amongst supporters, picketing steel plants to prevent deliveries of coal and coke caused great divisions. Local branches agreed deals with local steel plants on the amounts to be delivered. In June 1984, the NUM area leader for South Wales, Emlyn Williams, defied orders from Scargill to stop deliveries of coal by rail to steel plants, but he capitulated after a vote by the national executive to end dispensations.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/105 105] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>

Some of the above areas were large and had high internal variances. Within the large geographical Yorkshire area, there was still something of a regional variation in observing the strike despite the still high 97.3% overall Yorkshire solidarity rate in observing the strike in November 1984, as miners from South Yorkshire were considerably more militant than miners from North Yorkshire. This was something which became clearer still in the last three months of the strike with the number of North Yorkshire miners drifting back to work.<ref>{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=David John |title=Pit Sense versus the State: A history of militant miners in the Doncaster area |year=1994 |location=London |publisher=Phoenix Press |page=78 |isbn=0-948984-26-0 }}</ref>

===Analysis of the situation in Nottinghamshire===
A number of reasons have been advanced for the lack of support by the Nottinghamshire miners for the strike. It was compared to the return to work led by [[George Alfred Spencer|George Spencer]] in Nottinghamshire  during the 1926 coal strike, but Nottinghamshire had gone on strike alongside other regions in 1972 and 1974.<ref name="Paterson">{{cite news | last =Lewis | first =Jeremy | title =Miners' strike: 30 years on from bitter conflict that divided mining communities | newspaper =Nottingham Post | location =Nottingham | date =18 March 2014 | url =http://www.nottinghampost.com/30-years-bitter-conflict-divided-mining/story-20822500-detail/story.html | accessdate =15 March 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150402115418/http://www.nottinghampost.com/30-years-bitter-conflict-divided-mining/story-20822500-detail/story.html | archive-date =2 April 2015 | url-status =dead | df =dmy-all }}</ref>  Other explanations include the perception that Nottinghamshire pits were safe from the threat of closure, as they had large reserves, and the area-level incentive scheme introduced by Tony Benn caused them to be amongst the best-paid in Britain.<ref name="Paterson"/>

David Amos noted that some pits in Nottinghamshire closed in the early 1980s.<ref name="DAMOS">{{cite web|url=http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/events/minersstrike.htm|title=The Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway > Events > The Nottinghamshire Miners, the UDM and the 1984–85 Miners' Strike (1980–1985) by Dr David Amos > Overview|work=nottsheritagegateway.org.uk}}</ref>  He argues that Nottinghamshire miners reacted in the same way in 1984 as they did to the unofficial strikes in 1969 and 1970, both of which saw blockading of Nottinghamshire pits by striking miners from South Yorkshire and both of which were regarded as unconstitutional under NUM rules.<ref name="DAMOS"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984–85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David  |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=19 July 2015 |quote=In 1984 this tradition derived not from 1926, but from more recent unofficial disputes of 1969, 1970 and to some extent 1981. As the evidence in Chapter 5 shows, the reaction in many parts of the Nottingham Area of the NUM to the 1984–85 strike was the same as it had been to the unofficial disputes of the past; they were seen as being unconstitutional and unauthorised.}}</ref>

As the Nottinghamshire collieries had attracted displaced miners from Scotland and the north-east in the 1960s, it has been argued that they were reluctant to strike to stop pit closures when there had been no action to save their home pits from closure.<ref name="Douglas 96">{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=David John |title=Pit Sense versus the State: A history of militant miners in the Doncaster area |year=1994 |location=London |publisher=Phoenix Press |page=96 |isbn=0-948984-26-0 }}</ref><ref name="Paterson"/>  A large Polish community in Nottinghamshire (especially [[Ollerton]]) had been alienated by Scargill's policy of supporting the Communist government in Poland against the [[Solidarity]] union, which the NUM previously had supported.<ref name="Douglas 96"/>  [[David John Douglass]], a branch delegate at Hatfield Colliery dismissed the suggestions as the [[Doncaster]] pits also had large numbers of displaced and Polish miners, yet the it was amongst the most militant areas of the NUM.<ref name="Douglas 96"/>

Nottinghamshire NUM executive Henry Richardson argued that the Nottinghamshire miners would have probably voted for strike had they not been subjected to so much intimidation within days of the walk-out in Yorkshire, which prompted many to defy the Yorkshire pickets as a matter of principle.<ref name="ST78" />  At some pits, most miners initially refused to cross picket lines formed by Welsh miners but returned to work when more aggressive pickets arrived from Yorkshire.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|98}}  After the strike, Mick McGahey, one of the most prominent voices against a national ballot, said that he accepted "some responsibility" for alienating the Nottinghamshire miners through aggressive picketing.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|98}}  Jonathan and Ruth Winterton have suggested that the greater success of picketing in Lancashire, a region with little tradition of militancy, might be ascribed to the more cautious tactics of the North Yorkshire area of the NUM, which worked with local officials in Lancashire to coordinate respectful picketing, in contrast to the aggressive tactics adopted by the Doncaster NUM in Nottinghamshire.<ref name="Winterton81" /> The Marxist academic [[Alex Callinicos]] has suggested that the NUM officials had failed to make the case to their members adequately and believes that the Nottinghamshire miners were simply ignorant of the issues.<ref>[https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/callinicos/1985/miners/chap3.html ''The Tragedy of Nottinghamshire''] in {{cite book|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/callinicos/1985/miners/index.html |title=The great strike: the miners strike of 1984–5 and its lessons|last1=Callinicos|first1=Alex|author-link=Alex Callinicos|last2=Simons|first2=Mike|year=1985|publisher=Socialist Worker|location=London|isbn=0-905998-50-2}}</ref>

==Responses to the strike==

Kinnock appeared at a Labour Party rally alongside Scargill in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] on 30 November 1984 – the day of the killing of David Wilkie. His speech developed into an argument with hecklers who saw him as having betrayed the NUM by failing to support the strike.<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), pp.&nbsp;294–95.</ref> Kinnock began by saying, "We meet here tonight in the shadow of an outrage."  When interrupted, Kinnock accused the hecklers of "living like parasites off the struggle of the miners."  As Kinnock denounced the lack of the ballot, violence against strikebreakers and Scargill's tactical approach, he was asked by hecklers what he had done for the striking miners. Kinnock shouted back, "Well, I was not telling them lies. That's what I was not doing during that period."<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), pp. 294–95.</ref> It was a thinly-veiled attack on Scargill, whom he later admitted that he detested.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/02_february/27/coal_war.shtml|title=BBC – Press Office – The Coal War|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Former party leader and prime minister [[James Callaghan]] said that a ballot was needed to decide when to end the strike and return to work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=111|isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref> [[Tony Benn]] was vocal in support of Scargill's leadership during the strike.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|300}}  In addition, 12 left-wing MPs refused to sit down in the Commons in January in an attempt to force a debate on the strike.<ref name="auto2"/>

The Communist Party supported the strike and opposed Thatcher's government, but expressed reservations about Scargill's tactics. Peter Carter said that Scargill had "the idea that the miners could win the strike alone through a re-run of Saltley Gate".<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|298}}  The 39th congress of the party passed a motion that the strike could not succeed without sympathy from the wider public and other unions, and that the aggressive picketing was dividing the working class and alienating public support.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|299}}

In contrast to the close cooperation with the [[Trades Union Congress]] in the 1970s, the NUM never asked the TUC to support the strike and wrote at the outset to say that, "No request is being made by this union for the intervention or assistance of the TUC."<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|129–131}}  Scargill disliked [[Len Murray]] and blamed the TUC for the failure of the [[1926 General Strike]].<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|130}} Part way through the strike, [[Norman Willis]] took over from Murray as general secretary of the TUC.

The NUM had a "Triple Alliance" with the [[Iron and Steel Trades Confederation]] (ISTC) and the railway unions. Solidarity action was taken by railway workers and few crossed picket lines,<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|150}} but the NUM never asked the railway unions to strike.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|136}}  In contrast, Scargill demanded that steel workers not cross miners' picket lines and only work to keep furnaces in order.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|137–138}}  Bill Sirs of the ISTC felt that Scargill was reneging on an agreement to deliver coke. British Steel was planning to close a steel plant and steel workers feared that support for the strikers might make closure more likely.<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), pp. 137–39.</ref>

The National Union of Seamen supported the strike and limited the transport of coal. The decision was taken by a delegates' conference and not authorised by an individual ballot. Transport leaders, Ross Evans and Ron Todd, supported the NUM "without reservation", but an increasing proportion of drivers were not unionised and they failed to have much influence.<ref>Adeney and Lloyd, ''The Miners' Strike, 1984–5: Loss Without Limit'' (1988), pp. 140–42.</ref> The [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union]], actively opposed the strike; Ian MacGregor's autobiography detailed how its leaders supplied the government with information that allowed the strike to be defeated.<ref name="MacGregor">{{cite book | last=MacGregor | first=Ian | author-link=Ian MacGregor | date=2 October 1986 | title=The Enemies Within: The Story of the Miners' Strike 1984–5 | publisher=William Collins Sons & Co Ltd | isbn=978-0-00-217706-1 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/enemieswithinsto0000macg/page/384 384] | url=https://archive.org/details/enemieswithinsto0000macg }}</ref>  The EETPU was supportive of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers and met with its leaders before the TUC had extended formal recognition.<ref name="ST276" />

==Long-term impact==
During the strike, many pits lost their customers and the immediate problem facing the industry was due to the economic recession in the early-1980s. There was extensive competition in the world coal market and a concerted move towards oil and [[Natural gas|gas]] for power production. The government's policy, the [[Ridley Plan]], was to reduce Britain's reliance on coal claiming it could be imported from [[Australia]], the [[US|United States]] and [[Colombia]] more cheaply than it could be produced in Britain.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/otr/intext92-93/Heseltine18.10.92.html|title=On the Record – Interview with Michael Heseltine|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=18 October 1992|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref> The strike emboldened the NCB to accelerate the closure of pits on economic grounds.

Tensions between strikers and those who worked continued after the return to work. Many strikebreakers left the industry and were shunned or attacked by other miners. Almost all the strikebreakers in [[Kent]] had left the industry by April 1986, after suffering numerous attacks on their homes.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Strike: 358 Days that Shook the Nation |year=1985 |location=London |publisher=Sunday Times |page=[https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils/page/305 305] |isbn=0-340-38445-X |url=https://archive.org/details/strikethatchersc0000wils }}</ref>  At Betteshanger Colliery, posters were put up with photographs and names of the thirty strikebreakers.<ref name="Winterton217">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=217 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref>  A [[wildcat strike]] at South Kirkby Colliery was supported by neighbouring Ferrymoor-Riddings on 30 April 1985 after four men were dismissed for attacks on strikebreakers, and another wildcat strike occurred at Hatfield Colliery in April 1986 after it emerged that there was a strikebreaker had not been transferred away from the pit.<ref name="Winterton218">{{cite book |last1=Winterton|first1=Jonathan |last2=Winterton |first2=Ruth |title=Coal, Crisis, and Conflict: The 1984–85 Miners' Strike in Yorkshire |year=1989 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=218 |isbn=9780719025488 }}</ref>  In contrast, other pits that had been divided by the strike managed to work without any harassment.<ref name="Winterton217" />

The NCB was accused of deserting the strikebreakers, as abuse, threats and assaults continued, and requests for transfers to other pits were declined.<ref name="Winterton218" />  Michael Eaton argued that "a decision to return to work was a personal decision on the part of the individual."<ref name="Winterton218" />

Miners were demoralised and sought work in other industries. Scargill's authority in the NUM was challenged and his calls for another strike in 1986 were ignored.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|303}} Mick McGahey, who was loyal to Scargill during the strike, became critical of him. McGahey claimed the leadership was becoming separated from its membership, the violence had gone too far and argued for reconciliation with the UDM.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|98,303}} Scargill said that it was a "tragedy that people from the far north should pontificate about what we should be doing to win back members for the NUM."<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|303}} Scargill became president of the NUM for life in 1985.<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|171–172}}

In the aftermath of the strike, miners were offered large redundancy payments in ballots organised by the NCB and the  offers were accepted even at the most militant pits. The manager of the militant Yorkshire Main Colliery said at the time of the pit's vote to close in October 1985, "I know people who abused us and threatened us on the picket line and then were the first to put in for redundancy."<ref name="lossWithoutLimit" />{{rp|239}}

The coal industry was privatised in December 1994 creating  "R.J.B. Mining", subsequently known as [[UK Coal]].

In October 2020, the [[Scottish government]] announced plans to introduce legislation to pardon Scottish miners convicted of certain offences during the strike.

==Historical assessments==
Many historians have provided interpretations and explanations of the defeat, largely centring on Scargill's decisions.

* Numerous scholars have concluded that Scargill's decisive tactical error was to substitute his famous flying picket for the holding of a national strike ballot. His policy divided the NUM membership, undermined his position with the leaders of the trade union movement, hurt the union's reputation in British public opinion, and led to violence along the picket line. That violence strengthened the stature of the Coal Board and  the Thatcher government.<ref name="in JSTOR"/><ref name="R.R. Darlington 2005"/><ref name="Geoffrey Goodman 1985 p 48"/>
* Robert Taylor depicts Scargill as an 'industrial Napoleon' who called a strike 'at the wrong time' on the 'wrong issue', and adopted strategies and tactics that were 'impossibilist', with 'an inflexible list of extravagant non-negotiable demands' that amounted to 'reckless adventurism' that was 'a dangerous, self-defeating delusion'.<ref>Robert Taylor, ''The trade union question in British politics: government and unions since 1945'' (Blackwell, 1993), pp. 292, 298.</ref>
* Journalist [[Andrew Marr]] argues that:
::Many found Scargill inspiring; many others found him frankly scary. He had been a Communist and retained strong Marxist views and a penchant for denouncing anyone who disagreed with him as a traitor.... Scargill had indeed been elected by a vast margin and he set about turning the NUM's once moderate executive into a reliably militant group.... By adopting a position that no pits should be closed on economic grounds, even if the coal was exhausted...he made sure confrontation would not be avoided. Exciting, witty [[Arthur Scargill]] brought coalmining to a close in Britain far faster than would have happened had the NUM been led by some prevaricating, dreary old-style union hack.<ref>Andrew Marr, ''A history of modern Britain'' (Macmillan, 2007), pp. 412–13.</ref>
* In a book published by the [[National Coal Mining Museum for England]], [[David John Douglass]] argues that too much focus has been put on the personality of Scargill and not enough on the decision of the Yorkshire NUM to invoke the area's 1981 ballot result to strike against economic closures.
::There is a prevailing view that Arthur Scargill, the NUM National President, called the strike. He did not. The strike started in Yorkshire, and he was not present at the delegate Council meeting in Barnsley. He had no means of calling a strike in Yorkshire.<ref name=StrikeNotTheEnd29>{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=29}}</ref>

In January 2014, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] stated, "I think if anyone needs to make an apology for their role in the miners' strike it should be [[Arthur Scargill]] for the appalling way that he led the union." This was in the Prime Minister's rejection of Labour calls for an apology for government actions during the 1984–85 miners' strike. His comments followed a question in the Commons from Labour MP [[Lisa Nandy]], who said the miners and their families deserved an apology for the mine closures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-25930172|title=PM rules out miners' strike apology|date=2014-01-29|access-date=2019-08-18|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Independent filmmakers documented the strike including the behaviour of the police, the role of miners' wives and the role of the media. The outcome was the Miner's Campaign Tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmstore.bfi.org.uk/acatalog/info_14813.html|title=DVD & Blu-ray|work=bfi.org.uk}}</ref>

The 2000 film ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', set in 1984, was based around mining communities in [[Easington Colliery]] and [[Seaham]]. The father and brother of the title character are striking miners. Several scenes depict the chaos at picket lines, clashes between armies of police and striking miners, and the shame associated with crossing the picket line. It showed the abject poverty associated with the strike and the harshness and desperation of not having coal for heat in winter. The film was turned into a musical, ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' with music by [[Elton John]] and book and lyrics by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], who wrote the film's screenplay..<ref>Jacqueline Jones, "Small Towns and Big Dreams: Meditations on Two Mining-Town Movies" ''Perspectives on History'' (Feb 2011) 49#2 pp. 30–31.</ref>

The 1996 film ''[[Brassed Off]]'' was set 10 years after the strike in the era when numerous pits closed before the privatisation of British Coal. The film refers to the strike and some of the dialogue contrasts the resistance in 1984 with the resignation with which most miners responded to the pit closures of the early 1990s. It was set in the fictional town of Grimley, a thin disguise for the hard-hit ex-mining village of [[Grimethorpe]], where some of it was filmed.

The satirical ''[[The Comic Strip|Comic Strip Presents]]'' episode "[[The Strike]]" (1988) depicts an idealistic Welsh screenwriter's growing dismay as his hard-hitting and grittily realistic script about the strike is mutilated by a [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] producer into an all-action thriller. The film parodies Hollywood films by overdramatising the strike and changing most of the important historic facts. It won a [[Golden Rose]] and Press Reward at the [[Rose d'Or|Montreux Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The Comic Strip Presents (an Episode Guide) | url=http://epguides.com/ComicStripPresents/guide.shtml | date=14 May 2005 | accessdate=13 December 2007}}</ref>

The "1984" episode of the 1996 [[BBC television drama]] serial ''[[Our Friends in the North]]'' revolves around the strike, and scenes of clashes between the police and strikers were re-created using many men who had taken part in the real-life events on the miners' side. In 2005, BBC One broadcast the one-off drama ''Faith'', written by [[William Ivory]]. Many of the social scenes were filmed in the former colliery town of Thorne, near Doncaster. It viewed the strike from the perspective of both the police and the miners.

The British film ''[[The Big Man]]'' casts [[Liam Neeson]] as a Scottish coalminer who has been unemployed since the strike. His character has been blacklisted due to striking a police officer and has served a six-month prison sentence for the offence.

The 2014 film ''[[Pride (2014 film)|Pride]]'', directed by [[Matthew Warchus]], is based on a true story of a [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners|group of LGBT activists]] who raised funds to assist and support families in a Welsh mining village.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kellaway|first=Kate|author-link=Kate Kellaway|title=When miners and gay activists united: the real story of the film Pride|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 August 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/31/pride-film-gay-activists-miners-strike-interview}}</ref>

In 2001, British visual artist Jeremy Deller worked with historical societies, battle re-enactors, and people who participated in the violent 1984 clashes between picketers and police to reconstruct and re-enact the [[Battle of Orgreave]]. A documentary about the re-enactment was produced by Deller and director Mike Figgis and was broadcast on British television; and Deller published a book called ''The English Civil War Part II'' documenting both the project and the historical events it investigates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/2001/the_battle_of_orgreave|title=The Battle of Orgreave|publisher=Artangel Media|accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref>

On 5 March 2010, the 25th anniversary of the strike, an artwork by visual artist Dan Savage was unveiled in [[Sunderland Civic Centre]]. Commissioned by Sunderland City Council, Savage worked with the Durham Miners Association to create the large scale commemorative window, which features images and symbols of the strike and the North East's mining heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Miners39-Strike-glass-memorial-unveiled.6126991.jp|title=Miners' Strike Glass Memorial Unveiled|publisher=Sunderland Echo|accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref>
In August 1984, photographer Keith Pattison was commissioned by Sunderland's Artists' Agency to photograph the strike in Easington Colliery for a month. He remained there on and off until it ended in March 1985, photographing from behind the lines a community rallying together against implacable opposition. Twenty-five years later, on 6 May 2010, Election Day, Pattison took David Peace to Easington to interview three of the people caught up in the strike. A selection of the photographs together with the interviews were published in book form – 'No Redemption' (Flambard Press).

===Music===
The strike is the subject of songs by many music groups including the [[Manic Street Preachers]]' "[[A Design for Life]]", and "1985", from the album ''[[Lifeblood (album)|Lifeblood]]''; [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s "[[Hits (Pulp album)|Last Day of the Miners' Strike]]"; [[Funeral for a Friend]]'s "[[History (Funeral For A Friend song)|History]]", and [[Ewan MacColl]]'s cassette of pro-NUM songs ''Daddy, What Did You Do In The Strike?''. [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] recorded a song about the strike called "We Work the Black Seam" for his first solo album, ''[[The Dream of the Blue Turtles]]'', in 1985. [[Billy Bragg]]'s version of "[[Which Side Are You On?]]", encapsulated the strikers' feeling of betrayal by the perceived indifference of wider elements within British society. Bragg raised awareness through his music and disagreement with the Thatcher government.<ref>Tranmer, Jeremy. ''Wearing Badges Isn't Enough in Days Like These: Billy Bragg and His Opposition to the Thatcher Governments''. ''Cercles''. Université de Rouen, 2001. Web. 21 October 2015.</ref>

The sound of the Miners Strike features at the start of [[The Smiths]] 1987 song "[[Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me]]". However, this version only appears on the album ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come (album)|Strangeways, Here We Come]]'' and not the single edit which has made subsequent compilation albums.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Throughout the strike, the South London group [[Test Dept]] travelled on their "battle bus" to Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland, Paddington and Glasgow. They filmed images of the strike in one town and showed at their next gig, where they met the miners, joined pickets and raised funds. The songs of the South Wales Striking Miners' Choir and the speeches of Kent miner Alan Sutcliffe are included on their 1985 album ''Shoulder to Shoulder''.<ref>Graham Cunnington, Angus Farquhar and Paul Jamrozy, ''Test Dept: Total State Machine'', eds.

[[Chris Cutler]], [[Tim Hodgkinson]] and [[Lindsay Cooper]] from [[Henry Cow]], along with [[Robert Wyatt]] and poet [[Adrian Mitchell]] recorded ''[[The Last Nightingale]]'' in October 1984 to raise money for the strikers and their families.<ref name="AM-review">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=the-last-nightingale-mw0000972551|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Last Nightingale|last=Chadbourne|first=Eugene|author-link=Eugene Chadbourne|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref>

"[[Red Hill Mining Town]]", by [[U2]] is about the breakdown of relationships during the strike.

The storyline of [[Radio K.A.O.S.]], a 1987 album by [[Roger Waters]], makes several references to the strike and its repercussions.

The strike saw the resurgence of traditional folk songs about coal mining. [[Dick Gaughan]] released a mixture of old and new songs on his LP ''True and Bold''. An old Northumbrian folk song, "[[Blackleg Miner]]" gained attention when recorded by [[Steeleye Span]] in 1970 and was played to show support for the NUM and intimidate strikebreakers.<ref name="SteeleyeSpan">{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=The Nottinghamshire Miners, The Union of Democratic Mineworkers and the 1984–85 Miners' Strike: Scabs or Scapegoats? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=19 July 2015 |page=291}}</ref>
