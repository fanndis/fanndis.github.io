'''Christine Paule Pelosi''' (born May 5, 1966) is an American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] political strategist from [[California]]. Pelosi is the author of ''Campaign Boot Camp'' (2007), a guide to successful campaigning. She is a daughter of [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Paul Pelosi]] and sister of [[Alexandra Pelosi]].

==Biography==

Pelosi is the daughter of [[Nancy Pelosi]] and was born in California.

Pelosi is the author of ''Campaign Boot Camp 2.0'' (2012) and ''Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders'<nowiki/>'' (2007), books used in her leadership trainings for candidates and causes. Since 2005 she has directed the [[AFSCME]] PEOPLE Congressional Candidates Boot Camp, which prepares Democrats for campaigns and has helped over 40 challengers get elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.

Her work in public policy and politics includes service as Executive Director (1998–99), Platform Chair (1995–2008), and Women's Caucus Chair (2011–present) of the [[California Democratic Party]]; Deputy City Attorney (Construction and Trial Teams) and Assistant District Attorney (Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Unit) for the City of [[San Francisco]]; [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Special Counsel]] in the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton/Gore Administration]] (1999–2001); and, [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]] to U.S. Representative [[John F. Tierney]] (2001–2005). Pelosi has also served as a board member and the Interim Executive Director of the [[Young Democrats of America]] (2011).

In addition, Pelosi has served as volunteer board member for the [[AIDS Memorial Grove|National AIDS Memorial Grove]] and the [[New Leaders Council]].

She holds a JD from the [[University of California Hastings College of the Law]] and a bachelor's degree from [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]].<ref name="HuffPostBio" />

== Democratic National Committee ==
Pelosi has been elected six times to the [[Democratic National Committee]], where she cofounded the DNC Veterans and Military Families Council and serves as a vice chair.

A member of the DNC Resolutions Committee since 2001, she has co-authored dozens of DNC policy statements embracing civil rights, voting rights, economic justice, women's equality, the Fight for 15, gun violence prevention, and veterans and military families.[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']

As a member of the DNC, Pelosi has also been a [[Superdelegate]] to the Democratic Party National Conventions. She endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]] on June 3, 2008, when he won the popular delegate vote, and joined Ready for Hillary [Clinton] in April 2014.

Pelosi is currently running for an open position of the DNC Executive Committee representing the Western Region. She is promoting her vision to:
* Ban corporate donations and ban corporate lobbyists from serving as DNC chair-appointed, at-large members. Instead empower diverse grassroots Democrats so that more voices can be heard;
* Organize a DNC 50-state strategy with state-based staff required to perform coalition building with Democrats and nonpartisan groups;
* Work to democratize our presidential nominating process by ending superdelegates' capacity to trump the will of the voters and by reforming our calendar, caucuses, and convention to maximize participation;
* Expand Party outreach by dedicating DNC staff to Member services, caucuses, councils, and committees; and,
* Revive our connection to the American people by establishing a DNC Artists Council to defend the First Amendment and engage communities through the arts.

== Superdelegate reform ==
In 2016, Pelosi joined Anna Galland, the executive director of [[MoveOn.org]] Civic Action, in calling for a change in how superdelegates to the Democractic Party Convention view their representational obligations. She also co-authored a resolution at the California Democratic Party Convention that "called for a broad overhaul of how the party nominates its presidential candidates, including the elimination of caucuses and most super-delegates".

This reflects a long-standing position of Pelosi's. In 2008, she promoted the reduction of the total number of superdelegates to have superdelegates vote for the winner of the pledged delegates and to allow absentee ballots at the caucuses.

== Electoral College member ==
In 2016, Pelosi was a [[presidential elector]] for the state of California in the [[United States]] [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Every presidential election year, the 538 members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] meet in their state capitals on December 19 to cast the official vote for president. She helped lead the effort to inform the electors and the public about foreign interference in elections.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Kyle Cheney |author2=Gabriel Debenedetti |title=Electors demand intelligence briefing before Electoral College vote |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/electors-intelligence-briefing-trump-russia-232498 |newspaper=Politico |date=December 12, 2016 |accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> Her motion of opposition to Russian interference in the United States elections was formally unanimously approved by California's Electoral College.
