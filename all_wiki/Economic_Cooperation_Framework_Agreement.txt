The '''Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement''' ('''ECFA''') is a [[preferential trade agreement]] between the governments of the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[mainland China]], commonly "[[China]]") and the [[Republic of China]] (known as "[[Taiwan]]") that aims to reduce tariffs and commercial barriers between the two sides. The pact, signed on June 29, 2010, in [[Chongqing]],<ref name="xinhuanet1">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-06/29/c_13375203.htm |title=Chinese mainland, Taiwan sign landmark economic pact |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref><ref>Taiwan News, [http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1299089&lang=eng_news&cate_img=83.jpg&cate_rss=news_Politics_TAIWAN ECFA signing scheduled for June 29] June 25, 2010</ref> was seen as the most significant agreement since the two sides split after the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, since neither government recognize the other as "[[sovereign state|countries]]".<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Hogg |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10442557.stm |title=Taiwan and China sign landmark trade agreement |publisher=BBC News |date= 2010-06-29|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref> It was expected to boost the then-current US$197.28 billion bilateral trade between both sides.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201401100017.aspx |title = Taiwan's 2013 trade surplus with China shows 21.6% growth - Focus Taiwan}}</ref>

==Background==
{{Further|Economy of the People's Republic of China|Economy of Taiwan|Three Links}}
The government of the People's Republic of China uses its influence on [[Economy of Asia|neighboring economic powers]] to prevent them from signing free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the Republic of China ("Taiwan") which [[Succession of states|China claims that the ROC has been eliminated]] and so Taiwan is part of its territory.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/09/12/2003453371 Taipei Times] 2009/09/12</ref><ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/09/25/2003454366 Taipei Times] 2009/09/25</ref> Instead, under the leadership of the [[Kuomintang]], [[government of the Republic of China|Taipei]] was motivated to sign the ECFA with mainland China partly in hope that once it has this agreement the PRC will stop pressuring other countries to avoid such agreements with Taiwan,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} as well as to counteract the negative consequences of [[ASEAN–China Free Trade Area|China's free trade agreement with ASEAN]].<ref name=JSTOR>{{Cite journal |first=Jie |last=Huang |jstor=23462218 |title=TPP versus ECFA: Similarities, Differences, and China's Strategies | volume=12 |issue=2 | date=Fall 2012| page=87 | journal=China Review | publisher=Chinese University Press  }}</ref> The ECFA has been compared with the [[Mainland and Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement|Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement]]s mainland China signed with the [[Special Administrative Region]]s: [[Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement|Hong Kong]] and [[Mainland and Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement|Macau]].<ref>Sina.com, (2010), [http://news.sina.com.tw/article/20100710/3475116.html 陸學者：ECFA與CEPA提升競爭力]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2010-07-10 {{in lang|zh}}</ref>

The deal is thought to be structured to benefit Taiwan far more than mainland China. The "early harvest" list of tariff concessions covers 539 Taiwanese products and 267 mainland Chinese goods. The advantage to Taiwan would amount to {{Nowrap|US$13.8 billion}}, while mainland China would receive benefits estimated at {{Nowrap|US$2.86 billion}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1299089&lang=eng_news&cate_img=83.jpg&cate_rss=news_Politics_TAIWAN |title=ECFA signing scheduled for June 29 - Taiwan News Online |publisher=Etaiwannews.com |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref> Mainland China will also open markets in 11 service sectors such as banking, securities, insurance, hospitals and accounting, while Taiwan agreed to offer wider access in seven areas, including banking and movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-29/china-pulls-taiwan-closer-with-historic-trade-deal-update1-.html |title=China Pulls Taiwan Closer With Historic Trade Deal (Update1) |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>

Financial reforms were kicked off on January 16, 2010 with the signing of three Memoranda of Understanding  between Taiwan's [[Financial Supervisory Commission (Republic of China)|Financial Supervisory Commission]] Chairman Sean Chen and three counterpart agencies in Beijing for Banking, Insurance and Securities. The FSC is hoping that Taiwan will get more leniency in the hurdles set by the Chinese government for foreign players. These hurdles have limited the growth of these foreign players relative to their local peers.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2010/gb20100115_565732.htm Financial Reforms Open China to the Taiwanese, by [[Sam Radwan]], Bloomberg Businessweek, Jan 2010]</ref>

==Signing and review==
The negotiation process took place over several rounds. Substantive yet informal discussions regarding the ECFA initially took place during the 4th round of SEF-ARATS discussions in December 2009.

==Issues==

===Debate===
{{main|ECFA Debate}}
There is currently much controversy in Taiwan over the ECFA, including over potential effects on local Taiwanese businesses,<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2009/07/31/2003450020 Taipei Times] 2009/07/31</ref> as well as on how the government has presented it to the public. The opposition [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) and other [[Taiwan independence|pro independence]] groups believe the ECFA is a cover for [[Chinese reunification|unification with China]]. It neither accord the same rights as a [[Free Trade Agreement]] which will reduce manufacturing jobs and average salary, nor accelerate [[capital outflow]] and [[brain drain]] of management and technology expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1074539&lang=eng_news&cate_img=46.jpg&cate_rss=news_Editorial |title=etaiwannews Editorial |publisher=Etaiwannews.com |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> The opponents of the ECFA also indicated concerns about allowing the influx of mainland Chinese [[white-collar worker]]s or professionals to work in Taiwan which could put the [[job security]] of locals at risk.<ref name="focus 20100">{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201004060021 |title=focustaiwan |publisher=Focustaiwan.tw |date= |accessdate=2010-07-01}}</ref> According to Jie Huang of ''China Review'', it is a means to maintain peace in cross-Strait relations and "ultimately to reach the goal of reunification."<ref name=JSTOR/> A debate was held and televised on April 25, 2010.

===Clash in the legislature===
On July 8, 2010 a [[Legislative Yuan]] meeting was held. The DPP insisted the ECFA agreement be reviewed article by article.
