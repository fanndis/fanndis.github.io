'''Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schröder''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡɛɐ̯haɐ̯t fʁɪts kʊɐ̯t ˈʃʁøːdɐ|lang|De-Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schröder.ogg}}; born 7 April 1944) is a German politician who served as [[Chancellor of Germany]] from 1998 to 2005, during which his most important political initiative was [[Agenda 2010]]. As a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), he led a [[coalition government]] of the SPD and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]]. Since 2017, Schröder serves as the [[Chairperson|chairman]] of [[Russia|Russian]] [[Energy industry|energy]] company [[Rosneft]].

Before becoming a full-time politician, he was a lawyer, and before becoming Chancellor he served as [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony]] (1990–1998). Following the [[2005 German federal elections|2005 federal election]], which his party lost, after three weeks of negotiations he stood down as Chancellor in favour of [[Angela Merkel]] of the rival [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. He is currently the chairman of the board of [[Nord Stream AG]] and of [[Rosneft]], after having been hired as a global manager by investment bank [[N M Rothschild & Sons|Rothschild]], and also the chairman of the board of football club [[Hannover 96]].

==Early life and education==
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2015}}
Schröder was born in [[Blomberg, North Rhine-Westphalia|Blomberg]], [[Free State of Lippe|Lippe]], Greater German Reich. His father, Fritz Schröder, a lance corporal in the [[Wehrmacht]], was killed in action in [[World War II]] in [[Romania]] on 4 October 1944, almost six months after Gerhard's birth. His mother, Erika (née Vosseler), worked as an agricultural laborer to support herself and her two sons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article110587496/Gerhard-Schroeder-und-seine-Mutter-Erika-Vosseler.html |title=Altkanzler: Gerhard Schröder und seine Mutter Erika Vosseler - Bilder & Fotos - DIE WELT |website=Die Welt |accessdate=2015-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211165338/http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article110587496/Gerhard-Schroeder-und-seine-Mutter-Erika-Vosseler.html |archive-date=11 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Schröder completed an [[apprenticeship]] in retail sales in a [[Lemgo]] hardware shop from 1958 to 1961 and subsequently worked in a [[Lage, North Rhine-Westphalia|Lage]] retail shop and after that as an unskilled construction worker and a sales clerk in [[Göttingen]] while studying at night school for a general qualification for university entrance ([[Abitur]]). He did not have to do military service because his father had died in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,128137,00.html|title=Zivildienst: Hat sich Joschka Fischer gedrückt?|work=Der Spiegel|date=17 April 2001|accessdate=17 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0%2C1518%2C128137%2C00.html|archive-date=16 November 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1966, Schröder secured entrance to a university, passing the [[Abitur]] exam at Westfalen-Kolleg, [[Bielefeld]]. From 1966 to 1971 he studied law at the [[University of Göttingen]]. From 1972 onwards, Schröder served as teaching assistant at the university. In 1976, he passed his second law examination, and he subsequently worked as a lawyer until 1990.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Among his more controversial cases, Schröder helped [[Horst Mahler]], a founding member of the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof]] terrorist group, to secure both an early release from prison and permission to practice law again in Germany.<ref name="schroeder">{{cite web|url=http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv98/208aa7.htm|title=Gerhard-Schröder-Biographie: Horst Mahler stellt das Buch eines Konservativen vor Hoffnung keimt im Verborgenen|accessdate=7 November 2007|work=Junge Freiheit|first=Thorsten|last=Thaler|date=8 May 1998|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212033638/http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv98/208aa7.htm|archive-date=12 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early political career==
Schröder joined the Social Democratic Party in 1963. In 1978 he became the federal [[chairman]] of the [[Young Socialists in the SPD|Young Socialists]], the youth organisation of the SPD. He spoke for the dissident [[Rudolf Bahro]], as did President [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Wolf Biermann]].

===Member of the German Bundestag, 1980–1986===
In 1980, Schröder was elected to the German [[Bundestag]] (federal parliament), where he wore a sweater instead of the traditional suit. Under the leadership of successive chairmen [[Herbert Wehner]] (1980–83) and [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]] (1983–86), he served in the SPD parliamentary group. He also became chairman of the SPD [[Hanover]] district.

Considered ambitious from early on in his political career, it was widely reported and never denied, that in 1982, a drunken Schröder stood outside the [[West Germany|West German]] [[Federal Chancellery (Bonn)|federal chancellery]] yelling: "I want to get in."<ref>[http://www.politico.eu/article/would-be-chancellor/ Would-be chancellor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005100648/http://www.politico.eu/article/would-be-chancellor/ |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[European Voice]]'', 25 February 1998.</ref> That same year, he wrote an article on the idea of a red/green coalition for a book at Olle & Wolter, Berlin; this appeared later in ''[[Die Zeit]]''. Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], the SPD and SI chairman, who reviewed Olle & Wolter at that time, had just asked for more books on the subject.

In 1985, Schröder met the [[East Germany|GDR]] leader [[Erich Honecker]] during a visit to [[East Berlin]]. In 1986, Schröder was elected to the parliament of [[Lower Saxony]] and became leader of the SPD group.

===Minister-President of Lower Saxony, 1990–1998===
After the SPD won the state elections in June 1990, Schröder became [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony|Minister-President of Lower Saxony]] as head of an SPD-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] coalition; in this position, he also won the 1994 and 1998 state elections.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} He was subsequently also appointed to the [[supervisory board]] of [[Volkswagen]], the largest company in Lower Saxony and of which the state of Lower Saxony is a major stockholder.

Following his election as Minister-President in 1990, Schröder also became a member of the board of the federal SPD. In 1997 and 1998, he served as [[President of the German Bundesrat|President]] of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Between 1994 and 1998, he was also chairman of Lower Saxonian SPD.

During Schröder's time in office, first in coalition with the environmentalist Green Party, then with a clear majority, Lower Saxony became one of the most deficit-ridden of Germany's 16 federal states and unemployment rose higher than the national average of 12 percent.<ref>[[Alan Cowell]] (3 March 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/03/world/to-battle-kohl-a-socialist-who-s-pro-business.html To Battle Kohl, a Socialist Who's Pro-Business] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005152545/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/03/world/to-battle-kohl-a-socialist-who-s-pro-business.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Ahead of the [[1994 German federal election|1994 elections]], SPD chairman [[Rudolf Scharping]] included Schröder in his [[shadow cabinet]] for the party's campaign to unseat incumbent [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor.<ref>Ferdinand Protzman (30 August 1994), [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/world/german-opposition-names-shadow-cabinet-in-hopes-of-votes.html German Opposition Names Shadow Cabinet in Hopes of Votes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804140510/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/world/german-opposition-names-shadow-cabinet-in-hopes-of-votes.html |date=4 August 2018 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> During the campaign, Schröder served as shadow minister of economic affairs, energy and transport.

In 1996, Schröder caused controversy by taking a free ride on the Volkswagen corporate jet to attend the [[Vienna Opera Ball]], along with Volkswagen CEO [[Ferdinand Piëch]]. The following year, he nationalized a big steel mill in Lower Saxony to preserve jobs.<ref>[[Alan Cowell]] (1 March 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/01/world/kohl-s-rival-faces-a-vote-that-s-make-or-break.html Kohl's Rival Faces a Vote That's Make Or Break] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005201828/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/01/world/kohl-s-rival-faces-a-vote-that-s-make-or-break.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In the [[1998 Lower Saxony state election|1998 state elections]], Schöder's Social Democrats increased their share of the vote by about four percentage points over the 44.3 percent they recorded in the previous elections in 1994 – a postwar record for the party in Lower Saxony that reversed a string of Social Democrat reversals in state elections elsewhere.<ref>[[Alan Cowell]] (2 March 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/02/world/german-social-democrat-triumphs-in-key-state-election.html German Social Democrat Triumphs in Key State Election] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005202355/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/02/world/german-social-democrat-triumphs-in-key-state-election.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

==Chancellor of Germany, 1998–2005==
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2015}}
'''First term, 1998–2002'''

Following the [[1998 German federal election|1998 national elections]], Schröder became Chancellor as head of an SPD-Green coalition. Throughout his campaign for Chancellor, he portrayed himself as a pragmatic ''new'' Social Democrat who would promote economic growth while strengthening Germany's generous social welfare system.<ref>[[Edmund L. Andrews]] (20 October 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/choice-for-economics-post-spurns-offer-by-schroder.html Choice for Economics Post Spurns Offer by Schroder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005152448/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/choice-for-economics-post-spurns-offer-by-schroder.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

After the resignation of [[Oskar Lafontaine]] as SPD Chairman in March 1999, in protest at Schröder's adoption of a number of what Lafontaine considered "[[neo-liberal]]" policies, Schröder took over his rival's office as well. In a move meant to signal a deepening alliance between Schröder and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] of the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>Rachel Sylvester (29 May 1999), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/we-say-third-way-you-say-die-neue-mitte-1096855.html We say Third Way, you say die neue mitte] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005151218/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/we-say-third-way-you-say-die-neue-mitte-1096855.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref> the two leaders issued an eighteen-page manifesto for economic reform in June 1999. Titled "Europe: The Third Way",<ref>[[Tony Blair]] and Gerhard Schroeder, (19 August 1999) https://web.archive.org/web/19990819090124/http://www.labour.org.uk/views/items/00000053.html Europe: The Third Way/Die Neue Mitte]</ref> or "Die Neue Mitte" in German, it called on Europe's centre-left governments to cut taxes, pursue labour and welfare reforms and encourage entrepreneurship. The joint paper said European governments needed to adopt a "supply-side agenda" to respond to globalisation, the demands of capital markets and technological change.<ref>[[Edmund L. Andrews]] (20 October 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/09/business/worldbusiness/britishgerman-agenda-marks-break-with-left-manifesto.html British-German Agenda Marks Break With Left : Manifesto Maps Out 'Third Way'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005203051/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/09/business/worldbusiness/britishgerman-agenda-marks-break-with-left-manifesto.html|date=5 October 2017}} ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

Schröder's efforts backfired within his own party though, where its left-wing rejected the Schröder-Blair call for cutbacks to the welfare state and pro-business policies. Instead, the paper took part of the blame for a succession of six German state election losses in 1999 for the Social Democratic Party. Only by 2000, Schröder managed to capitalise on the [[CDU donations scandal|donations scandal]] of his Christian Democratic opposition to push through a landmark tax reform bill and re-establish his dominance of the German political scene.<ref>Tom Buerkle and John Schmid (22 July 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/22/news/the-third-wayschroeder-soars-but-blair-stalls.html The Third Way: Schroeder Soars but Blair Stalls] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005152528/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/22/news/the-third-wayschroeder-soars-but-blair-stalls.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

In May 2001, Schröder moved to his new official residence, the Chancellery building in Berlin, almost two years after the city became the seat of the German Government. He had previously been working out of the building in eastern Berlin used by the former leaders of East Germany.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1308018.stm Schroeder gets new home] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005104554/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1308018.stm |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[BBC News]]'', 2 May 2001.</ref>

'''Second term, 2002–2005'''

Throughout the build-up to the [[2002 German federal election|2002 German election]], the Social Democrats and the Green Party trailed the centre-right candidate [[Edmund Stoiber]] until the catastrophe caused by [[2002 European floods|rising floodwater in Germany]] led to an improvement in his polling numbers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211615.stm Schroeder buoyed by flood disaster] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108074859/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211615.stm |date=8 January 2017 }} ''[[BBC News]]'', 23 August 2002.</ref> Furthermore, his popular opposition to a war in [[Iraq]] dominated campaigning in the run-up to the polls.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/09/23/germany.0700/ Schroeder wins second term] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323164545/http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/09/23/germany.0700/ |date=23 March 2018 }} ''[[CNN]]'', 23 September 2002.</ref> At 22 September vote, he secured another four-year term, with a narrow nine-seat majority (down from 21).

In February 2004, Schröder resigned as chairman of the SPD amid growing criticism from across his own party of his reform agenda;<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1453618/Schroder-resigns-SPD-chairmanship.html Schröder resigns SPD chairmanship] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005101100/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1453618/Schroder-resigns-SPD-chairmanship.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 6 February 2004.</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/2426732 A resigning matter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502024043/http://www.economist.com/node/2426732 |date=2 May 2017 }} ''[[The Economist]]'', 12 February 2004.</ref> [[Franz Müntefering]] succeeded him as chairman. On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] (CDU) in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections "as soon as possible". A [[motion of confidence]] was subsequently defeated in the [[Bundestag]] on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. In response, a grouping of left-wing SPD dissidents and the neo-communist [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] agreed to run on a joint ticket in the general election, with Schröder's rival [[Oskar Lafontaine]] leading the new group.<ref>Richard Milne (11 June 2005), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2dce77e4-da15-11d9-b071-00000e2511c8.html New leftwing alliance to challenge SPD]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

The 2005 [[2005 German federal elections|German federal elections]] were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schröder's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by [[Angela Merkel]] achieved a majority in parliament, but the CDU/CSU had a stronger popular electoral lead by one percentage point. On election night, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory and chancellorship, but after initially ruling out a [[grand coalition]] with Merkel, Schröder and Müntefering entered negotiations with her and the CSU's [[Edmund Stoiber]]. On 10 October, it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a grand coalition. Schröder agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm|title=Merkel named as German chancellor|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=10 October 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313164059/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm|archive-date=13 March 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Merkel was elected chancellor on 22 November.

On 11 October 2005, Schröder announced that he would not take a post in the new Cabinet and, in November, he confirmed that he would leave politics as soon as Merkel took office. On 23 November 2005, he resigned his [[Bundestag]] seat.

On 14 November 2005, at a SPD conference in [[Karlsruhe]], Schröder urged members of the SPD to support the proposed coalition, saying it "carries unmistakably, perhaps primarily, the imprint of the Social Democrats". Many SPD members had previously indicated that they supported the coalition, which would have continued the policies of Schröder's government, but had objected to [[Angela Merkel]] replacing him as Chancellor. The conference voted overwhelmingly to approve the deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm|title=German parties back new coalition|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=14 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111191948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm|archive-date=11 January 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Domestic policies===
In his first term, Schröder's government decided to phase out [[nuclear power]], fund [[renewable energy|renewable energies]], institute [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|civil unions]] for same-sex partners, and liberalise the [[naturalization]] law.

During Schröder's time in office, economic growth slowed to only 0.2% in 2002 and Gross Domestic Product shrank in 2003, while German unemployment was over the 10% mark.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/schr%C3%B6der-urges-reform-as-spd-celebrates-140th-anniversary/a-876290-1 Schröder Urges Reform as SPD Celebrates 140th Anniversary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005101830/http://www.dw.com/en/schr%C3%B6der-urges-reform-as-spd-celebrates-140th-anniversary/a-876290-1 |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 23 May 2002.</ref> Most voters soon associated Schröder with the [[Agenda 2010]] reform program, which included cuts in the [[social welfare]] system ([[national health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance|unemployment payments]], [[pension]]s), lower taxes, and reformed regulations on employment and payment. He also eliminated capital gains tax on the sale of corporate stocks and thereby made the country more attractive to foreign investors.<ref>Claus Christian Malzahn (14 October 2005), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-modern-chancellor-taking-stock-of-gerhard-schroeder-a-379600.html The Modern Chancellor: Taking Stock of Gerhard Schröder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023033112/http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-modern-chancellor-taking-stock-of-gerhard-schroeder-a-379600.html |date=23 October 2012 }} ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref>

After the 2002 election, the SPD steadily lost support in opinion polls. Many increasingly perceived Schröder's [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] program to be a dismantling of the German [[welfare state]]. Moreover, Germany's high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government. Schröder's tax policies were also unpopular; when the satirical radio show ''[[The Gerd Show]]'' released "Der Steuersong", featuring Schröder's voice (by impressionist [[Elmar Brandt]]) lampooning Germany's [[indirect taxation]] with the lyrics "Dog tax, tobacco tax, emissions and environmental tax, did you really think more weren't coming?", it became Germany's 2002 Christmas #1 hit and sold over a million copies. The fact that Schröder served on the [[Volkswagen]] board (a position that came with his position as [[Minister-president#Germany|minister-president]] of Lower Saxony) and tended to prefer pro-car policies led to him being nicknamed the "Auto-Kanzler" (car chancellor).

===European integration===
In 1997, Schröder joined the ministers-president of two other German states, [[Kurt Biedenkopf]] and [[Edmund Stoiber]], in making the case for a five-year delay in Europe's currency union.<ref>John Schmid (28 July 1997), [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/28/business/worldbusiness/IHT-another-german-premier-seeks-delay-on-the-euro.html Another German Premier Seeks Delay on the Euro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901083640/https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/28/business/worldbusiness/IHT-another-german-premier-seeks-delay-on-the-euro.html |date=1 September 2019 }} ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> After taking office, he made his first official trip overseas to [[France]] for meetings with [[President of France|President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]] in October 1998.<ref>Craig R.

In his first months in office, Schröder vigorously demanded that Germany's net annual contribution of about $12,000,000,000 to the [[budget of the European Union]] be cut, saying his country was paying most for European "waste."<ref>[[Roger Cohen]] (27 March 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/27/world/statesmanlike-schroder-pulls-harmony-from-europe-s-hat.html Statesmanlike Schroder Pulls Harmony From Europe's Hat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915151812/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/27/world/statesmanlike-schroder-pulls-harmony-from-europe-s-hat.html |date=15 September 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> He later moderated his views when his government held the rotating [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] in 1999.

In 2003, Schröder and Chirac agreed to share power in the [[institutions of the European Union]] between a [[President of the European Commission]], elected by the [[European Parliament]], and a full-time [[President of the European Council]], chosen by heads of state and government; their agreement later formed the basis of discussions at the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] and became law with the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].<ref>Dana Spinant (15 January 2003), [http://www.politico.eu/article/paris-and-berlin-cook-up-shock-deal-over-eu-presidency/ Paris and Berlin cook up shock deal over EU presidency] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005101124/http://www.politico.eu/article/paris-and-berlin-cook-up-shock-deal-over-eu-presidency/ |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref> Ahead of the [[2005 French European Constitution referendum|French referendum on a European Constitution]], Schröder joined Chirac in urging French voters to back the new treaty, which would have enshrined new rules for the expanded EU of 25 member states and widened the areas of collective action.<ref>John Thornhill and Martin Arnold (26 April 2005), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/651ca752-b675-11d9-aebd-00000e2511c8.html Schröder echoes Chirac call for French Yes vote]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

Also in 2003, both Schröder and Chirac forced a suspension of sanctions both faced for breaching the European Union's fiscal rules that underpin the [[euro]] – the [[Stability and Growth Pact]] – for three years in a row. Schröder later called for a revision of the [[Lisbon Strategy]] and thereby a retreat from Europe's goal of overtaking the United States as the world's most competitive economy by 2010.

Marking a clear break with the caution of German foreign policy since World War II, Schröder laid out in 1999 his vision of the country's international role, describing Germany as "a [[great power]] in Europe" that would not hesitate to pursue its national interests.<ref>[[Roger Cohen]] (12 September 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/world/a-new-german-assertiveness-on-its-foreign-policy-stance.html A New German Assertiveness On Its Foreign Policy Stance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816154614/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/world/a-new-german-assertiveness-on-its-foreign-policy-stance.html |date=16 August 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

Schröder also began seeking a resolution ways to compensate Nazi-era slave labourers almost as soon as he was elected Chancellor. Reversing the hard-line stance of his predecessor, [[Helmut Kohl]], he agreed to the government contributing alongside industry to a [[Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future"|fund]] that would compensate people forced to work in German factories by the Nazi regime and appointed [[Otto Graf Lambsdorff]] to represent German industry in the negotiations with survivors' organisations, American lawyers and the U.S. government.<ref>[[Edmund L. Andrews]] (9 December 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/world/schroder-dismisses-demands-to-enlarge-fund-for-nazi-slaves.html Schroder Dismisses Demands To Enlarge Fund for Nazi Slaves] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915150307/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/world/schroder-dismisses-demands-to-enlarge-fund-for-nazi-slaves.html |date=15 September 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

Schröder sent forces to [[Kosovo]] and to [[Afghanistan]] as part of [[NATO]] operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/07/afghanistan.terrorism4|title=German troops to join war effort|work=The Guardian|date=6 November 2001|accessdate=25 May 2020|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801013506/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/07/afghanistan.terrorism4|url-status=live}}</ref> Until Schröder's chancellorship, German troops had not taken part in combat actions since [[World War II]]. With Germany having a long experience with [[terrorism]] itself, Schröder declared solidarity with the United States after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. When Schröder left office, Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States, UK, France, Canada and after two years Afghanistan.

'''Relations with the Middle East'''

During their time in government, both Schröder and his foreign minister [[Joschka Fischer]] were widely considered sincerely, if not uncritically, pro-Israel.<ref>[[Steven Erlanger]] (7 April 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/weekinreview/the-world-the-jewish-question-europe-knows-who-s-to-blame-in-the-middle-east.html The World: The Jewish Question; Europe Knows Who's to Blame in the Middle East] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005152414/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/weekinreview/the-world-the-jewish-question-europe-knows-who-s-to-blame-in-the-middle-east.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Schröder represented the German government at the funeral service for [[List of kings of Jordan|King]] [[Hussein of Jordan]] in [[Amman]] on 9 February 1999.<ref>John M.

When British planes joined United States forces [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|bombing]] [[Iraq]] without consulting the [[United Nations Security Council]] in December 1998, Schröder endorsed the military action unequivocally.<ref>Craig R. Whitney (18 December 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/18/world/two-fronts-international-reaction-critics-paris-kuwait-but-friend-london.html Critics From Paris to Kuwait, but a Friend in London] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005201754/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/18/world/two-fronts-international-reaction-critics-paris-kuwait-but-friend-london.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Along with French President [[Jacques Chirac]] and many other world leaders, Schröder later spoke out strongly against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and refused any military assistance in that enterprise. Schröder's stance caused political friction between the US and Germany, in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign. Schröder's stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD. The parliamentary leader of the SPD, [[Ludwig Stiegler]], compared US President [[George W. Bush]] to [[Julius Caesar]] while Schröder's Minister of Justice, [[Herta Däubler-Gmelin]], likened Bush's foreign policy to that of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Schröder's critics accused him of enhancing, and campaigning on, anti-American sentiments in Germany. After his 2002 re-election, Schröder and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the US and Europe. Bush stated in his memoirs that Schröder initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion, to which Schröder responded saying that Bush was "not telling the truth".<ref>{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Adnan R.|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/11/24/schroder-bush-dust-up|title=The Schröder-Bush dust-up – World|work=Maclean's|date=24 November 2010|accessdate=17 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723125821/http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/11/24/schroder-bush-dust-up/|archive-date=23 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> When asked in March 2003 if he were at all self-critical about his position on Iraq, Schröder replied, "I very much regret there were excessive statements" from himself and former members of his government (which capitalised on the war's unpopularity).<ref>[[John Vinocur]] (5 March 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/news/news-analysis-schroeder-is-edging-closer-to-blair-views.html Schroeder is edging closer to Blair views] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005152440/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/05/news/news-analysis-schroeder-is-edging-closer-to-blair-views.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

'''Relations with Russia'''

On his first official trip to [[Russia]] in late-1998, Schröder suggested that Germany was not likely to come up with more aid for the country. He also sought to detach himself from the close personal relationship that his predecessor, [[Helmut Kohl]], had with Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]], saying that German-Russian relations should "develop independently of concrete political figures."<ref>Celestine Bohlen (17 November 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/17/world/world-briefing.html Russia: German Aid Likely To End] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005202257/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/17/world/world-briefing.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Soon after, however, he cultivated close ties with Yeltsin's successor, President [[Vladimir Putin]], in an attempt to strengthen the "strategic partnership" between Berlin and Moscow,<ref>[[Roger Cohen]] (17 June 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/17/world/putin-discovers-a-new-rapport-with-germany.html Putin Discovers A New Rapport With Germany] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005202556/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/17/world/putin-discovers-a-new-rapport-with-germany.html |date=5 October 2017 }} ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> including the opening of a gas pipeline from ''Russian Dan Marino-Pipelines'' over the Baltic Sea exclusively between Russia and Germany (see [[#Gazprom|"Gazprom controversy"]] below). During his time in office, he visited the country five times.

Schröder was criticised in the media, and subsequently by Angela Merkel, for calling Putin a "flawless democrat" on 22 November 2004, only days before Putin prematurely congratulated [[Viktor Yanukovich]] during the [[Orange Revolution]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,330461,00.html |title=Gerhard Schroeder's Dangerous Liaison |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=29 April 2007 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2005, Schröder suggested at the ceremonial introduction of the [[Airbus A380]] in Toulouse that there was still "room in the boat" of [[EADS]] for Russia.<ref>Nicola Clark (14 September 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/business/worldbusiness/14iht-eads.2814910.html Airbus parent rebuffs Russia bid for influence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701104821/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/business/worldbusiness/14iht-eads.2814910.html |date=1 July 2020 }} ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> 

Only a few days after his chancellorship, Schröder joined the board of directors of the Nord Stream joint venture, thus bringing about new speculations about his prior objectivity. In his memoirs ''Decisions: My Life in Politics'', Schröder still defends his friend and political ally, and states that "it would be wrong to place excessive demands on Russia when it comes to the rate of domestic political reform and democratic development, or to judge it solely on the basis of the Chechnya conflict."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,444944,00.html|title=It Would Be Wrong to Place Excessive Demands|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804072100/http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,444944,00.html|archive-date=4 August 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Life after politics==
Schröder rents an apartment in Berlin while retaining his primary residence in Hanover. As a former Chancellor, he is entitled to a permanent office, also situated in Berlin. In late 2005, he spent time in the UK improving his English language skills.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4509818.stm|title=Schroeder's Welsh English course|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=8 December 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614133645/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4509818.stm|archive-date=14 June 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Representative role===
After leaving public office, Schröder represented Germany at the funeral services for [[Death and state funeral of Boris Yeltsin|Boris Yeltsin]] in [[Moscow]] (jointly with [[Horst Köhler]] and [[Helmut Kohl]], 2007) and [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]] (2016).<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/fidel-castro-gerhard-schroeder-vertritt-deutschland-bei-trauerfeier-auf-kuba-a-1123489.html Schröder vertritt Deutschland bei Trauerfeier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130081121/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/fidel-castro-gerhard-schroeder-vertritt-deutschland-bei-trauerfeier-auf-kuba-a-1123489.html |date=30 November 2016 }} ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 28 November 2016.</ref>

===Business activities===

==Criticism and controversies==

===Relationship with Gazprom and Rosneft===
As Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder was a strong advocate of the [[Nord Stream]] pipeline project, which aims to supply Russian gas directly to Germany, thereby bypassing transit countries.

At the time of the [[2005 German federal election|German parliamentary election]], according to Rick Noak of ''[[The Washington Post]]'':
{{Quote
|text=In 2005, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s friend Schroeder hastily signed the deal just as he was departing the office from which he had been voted out days earlier. Within weeks, he started to oversee the project implementation himself, leading the Nord Stream AG’s shareholder committee.<ref name = WaPo_Noak_11Jul18>{{cite news|last=Noak|first=Rick|date=11 July 2018|title=The Russian pipeline to Germany that Trump is so mad about, explained|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/11/the-russian-pipeline-to-germany-that-trump-is-so-mad-about-explained|work=The Washington Post|access-date=11 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711133407/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/11/the-russian-pipeline-to-germany-that-trump-is-so-mad-about-explained/|archive-date=11 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}
On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schröder stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost, should [[Gazprom]] default on a loan. However, this guarantee had never been used.<ref name=ft>{{cite web|work=Financial Times|first1=Tobias|last1=Buck|first2=Bertrand|last2=Benoit|title=EU to probe German gas pipeline guarantee|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4b16eef6-deb2-11da-acee-0000779e2340.html|date=8 May 2006|accessdate=26 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312190115/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4b16eef6-deb2-11da-acee-0000779e2340.html|archive-date=12 March 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of [[Nord Stream AG]], raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.

German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4515914.stm|title=Schroeder attacked over gas post|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=10 December 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904053631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4515914.stm|archive-date=4 September 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> In an editorial entitled ''Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout'', the American newspaper ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schröder's new post.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/12/AR2005121201060.html|title=Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=13 December 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823084510/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/12/AR2005121201060.html|archive-date=23 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Democrat [[Tom Lantos]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], likened Schröder to a "political prostitute" for his recent behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-13-2870151492_x.htm|title=Lantos Raps Former European Leaders|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=13 June 2007|date=13 June 2007|first=Harry|last=Dunphy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529191335/http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-13-2870151492_x.htm|archive-date=29 May 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2009, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that Schröder would join the board of the oil company [[TNK-BP]], a joint venture between oil major [[BP]] and Russian partners.<ref>{{cite web |last=Herron |first=James |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123203091405585667 |title=WSJ, Schröder to join TNK-BP board, 19 January 2009 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=2009-01-16 |accessdate=2013-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820160837/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123203091405585667 |archive-date=20 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2016, Schröder switched to become manager of [[Nord Stream 2]], an expansion of the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder.<ref>Stefan Wagstyl (17 August 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/84a0a330-8336-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff Germany’s SPD criticised over Schröder’s post at Rosneft] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820061659/https://www.ft.com/content/84a0a330-8336-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff |date=20 August 2017 }} ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

===Defamation lawsuit (2002)===
In April 2002, Schröder sued the DDP press agency for publishing an opinion of [[public relations]] consultant Sabine Schwind saying that he "would be more credible if he didn't dye his gray hair". The court decided to ban the media from suggesting that he colours his hair.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A36035-2002May17&notFound=true|title=Court: Stay Out of Schroeder's Hair|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|first=Peter|last=Finn|date=18 May 2002|archive-date=26 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926132845/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A36035-2002May17&notFound=true|url-status=live}}</ref> <!--Unnecessary given the sentence afterward?: The case was taken seriously by politicians.--> The Chancellor's spokesman said: "This is not a frivolous action taken over whether he does or doesn't dye his hair, but is a serious issue regarding his word." The agency's lawyer said that they could not accept a verdict which "does not coincide with freedom of the press".

===Dispute over Estonian war memorial===
During a heated dispute between Russia and Estonia in May 2007 over [[Bronze Night|the removal of a Soviet-era war memorial]] from the centre of the Estonian capital [[Tallinn]] to a military cemetery, Schröder defended the Kremlin's reaction. He remarked that Estonia had contradicted "every form of civilised behaviour".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/daily/columns/europeview/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9142057&fsrc=nwl|title=How to fight back|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=10 May 2007|date=10 May 2007|archive-date=26 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926132831/https://www.economist.com/europe/2007/05/10/how-to-fight-back|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, the Estonian government cancelled a planned visit by Schröder in his function as chairman of [[Nord Stream]] AG, which promotes the petroleum pipeline from Russia to Germany.

===Comments on Kosovo independence===
Schröder has criticised some European countries' swift decision to recognise Kosovo as an independent state after it [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] in February 2008. He believes the decision was taken under heavy pressure from the US government and has caused more problems, including the weakening of the so-called pro-EU forces in Serbia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=05&dd=05&nav_id=49989 |title=Schroeder: Kosovo recognition "against Europe's interests" |work=B92 |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507200059/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=05&dd=05&nav_id=49989 |archivedate=7 May 2008}}</ref> In August 2008, Schröder laid the blame for the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] squarely on [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] and "the West", hinting at American foreknowledge and refusing to criticize any aspect of Russian policy which had thus far come to light.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,572686-2,00.html|title=Serious Mistakes by the West|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=21 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824234500/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,572686-2,00.html|archive-date=24 August 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Comments on Crimean crisis===
In March 2014, Schröder likened Russia's [[2014 Crimean crisis|intervention in Crimea]] with NATO's [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|intervention in Kosovo]], citing both cases as violations of [[international law]] and the [[UN Charter]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2014-03/ukraine-russland-putin-schroeder|title=Putin verstehen mit Gerhard Schröder|work=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|date=9 March 2014|accessdate=11 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309174705/http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2014-03/ukraine-russland-putin-schroeder|archive-date=9 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/russland-und-die-krim-gerhard-schroeder-nennt-putins-vorgehen-voelkerrechtswidrig-12838902.html|title=Gerhard Schröder nennt Putins Vorgehen völkerrechtswidrig|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|language=German|date=9 March 2014|accessdate=11 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311053506/https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/russland-und-die-krim-gerhard-schroeder-nennt-putins-vorgehen-voelkerrechtswidrig-12838902.html|archive-date=11 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He further stated that there had been "unhappy developments" on the outskirts of the former Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War, leading Putin to develop justifiable "fears about being encircled".<ref name=Paterson2014a>{{cite news|last1=Paterson|first1=Tony|title=Merkel fury after Gerhard Schroeder backs Putin on Ukraine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10697986/Merkel-fury-after-Gerhard-Schroeder-backs-Putin-on-Ukraine.html|accessdate=6 September 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=14 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825005442/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10697986/Merkel-fury-after-Gerhard-Schroeder-backs-Putin-on-Ukraine.html|archive-date=25 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> On 13 March 2014, an attempt by the German Green Party to ban Schröder from speaking in public about Ukraine was narrowly defeated in the European parliament.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10697986/Merkel-fury-after-Gerhard-Schroeder-backs-Putin-on-Ukraine.html |title=telegraph.co.uk: "Merkel fury after Gerhard Schroeder backs Putin on Ukraine" 14 Mar 2014 |access-date=2 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223224028/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10697986/Merkel-fury-after-Gerhard-Schroeder-backs-Putin-on-Ukraine.html |archive-date=23 February 2018 |url-status=live |date=14 March 2014 |last1=Paterson |first1=Tony }}</ref> His decision to celebrate his 70th birthday party with Putin in [[Saint Petersburg]]'s [[Moika Palace|Yusupov Palace]] in late April elicited further criticism from several members of Merkel's grand coalition, including human rights spokesperson {{ill|Christoph Strässer|de}}.<ref name=Paterson2014b>{{cite news|last1=Paterson|first1=Tony|title=Gerhard Schroeder's birthday party with Vladimir Putin angers Germany|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10795042/Gerhard-Schroeders-birthday-party-with-Vladimir-Putin.html|accessdate=6 September 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=29 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906065124/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10795042/Gerhard-Schroeders-birthday-party-with-Vladimir-Putin.html|archive-date=6 September 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Schröder identifies himself as a member of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], but does not appear to be religious. He did not add the optional phrase ''So wahr mir Gott helfe'' ("so help me God") when sworn in as chancellor for his first term in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/10/27/world/main21100.shtml|title=Schroeder Takes Germany's Helm Social Democrat Sworn in As Chancellor Tuesday|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=8 January 2008|date=27 October 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024045952/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/10/27/world/main21100.shtml|archive-date=24 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Schröder is known to be an avid art collector. He chose his friend [[Jörg Immendorff]] to paint his official portrait for the [[German Chancellery]]. The portrait, which was completed by Immendorff's assistants, was revealed to the public in January 2007; the massive work has ironic character, showing the former Chancellor in stern heroic pose, in the colors of the German flag, painted in the style of an [[icon]], surrounded by little monkeys.<ref>[http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/01/20/673044.html ''Der goldene Gerd''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011534/http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/01/20/673044.html |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''[[Hamburger Abendblatt]]'', 20 January 2007. {{in lang|de}}</ref> These "painter monkeys" were a recurring theme in Immendorff's work, serving as an ironic commentary on the artist's practice. On 14 June 2007, Schröder gave a [[eulogy]] at a memorial service for Immendorf at the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin.<ref>Gabriela Walde (14 June 2007), [https://www.welt.de/kultur/article947129/Bewegende-Trauerfeier-fuer-Joerg-Immendorff.html ''Bewegende Trauerfeier für Jörg Immendorff''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130194406/https://www.welt.de/kultur/article947129/Bewegende-Trauerfeier-fuer-Joerg-Immendorff.html |date=30 November 2016 }}, ''[[Die Welt]]''.</ref>
