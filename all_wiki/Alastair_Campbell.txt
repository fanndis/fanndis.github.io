'''Alastair John Campbell''' (born 25 May 1957) is a British author, journalist, broadcaster, consultant strategist and mental health campaigner. He worked as [[Tony Blair]]'s [[spokesman]] and campaign director (1994–1997), then as [[Downing Street Press Secretary]] (1997–2000) for Blair, who was then [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Prime Minister. He then became [[Downing Street Director of Communications]] and [[spokesman]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (2000–2003). He returned as campaign director for Blair's third election win in 2005.

In the run-up to the [[Iraq War]], Campbell was involved in the preparation and release of the "[[September Dossier]]" in September 2002 and the "[[Iraq Dossier]]" (nicknamed "Dodgy Dossier") in February 2003. These documents argued the case for concern over possible [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) in Iraq, and were criticised as overstating or distorting the actual intelligence findings. Campbell was directly accused by the media of 'sexing up' the intelligence case, but was cleared by a number of inquiries. Subsequent investigation revealed that the September Dossier had been altered on Campbell's orders to be consistent with a speech given by [[George W. Bush]] and statements by other United States officials.<ref name="Ames">{{cite news

He is the editor at large of ''[[The New European]]'' and chief interviewer for ''[[GQ]]'' magazine. He continues to act as a consultant [[strategist]] and as an ambassador for [[Time to Change (mental health campaign)|Time To Change]] and other mental health charities. He was an adviser to the [[People's Vote]] campaign, demanding a public vote on the final [[Brexit]] deal. Since his work for Blair, Campbell has continued to act as a freelance advisor to a number of [[governments]] and [[political parties]], including the Prime Minister of [[Albania]].<ref>[http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2017/04/29/on-brexit-trump-trust-and-whither-politics/ On Brexit, Trump, trust and whither politics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709012950/http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2017/04/29/on-brexit-trump-trust-and-whither-politics/|date=9 July 2017}}, 29 April 2017, Retrieved 8 May 2017.</ref> He published his sixteenth book in 2020.

==Early life==
Campbell was born on 25 May 1957 in [[Keighley]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], son of a Scottish veterinary surgeon, Donald Campbell, and his wife Elizabeth.<ref name="Debretts-2005">{{cite book|title=Debrett's People of Today 2005|edition=18th|isbn=1-870520-10-6|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|page=263}}</ref> Campbell's parents had moved to Keighley when his father became a partner in a local veterinary practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Aireworth Veterinary Surgery |url=http://www.aireworthvets.co.uk/contact/history |accessdate=11 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230003909/http://www.aireworthvets.co.uk/contact/history |archivedate=30 December 2011 }}</ref> Donald was a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaker from the island of [[Tiree]]; his wife was from [[Ayrshire]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Seon C.

He attended [[Bradford Grammar School]] for a short period of time, followed by [[City of Leicester College|City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School]] and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]],<ref name="Debretts-2005"/> where he studied modern languages, French and German, for which he received an upper second (2:1). Campbell is an [[Emeritus Professor]] in Media at Cambridge University.

In the late 1970s, Campbell spent time teaching in a secondary school in [[Nice]] as part of his academic degree course. While hitchhiking back to the city from [[Aix-en-Provence]], he learned of the Belgian singer [[Jacques Brel]]'s death and shared stories with the Belgian lorry driver who had picked him up, leading to a lifelong interest in Brel's music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/23/alastair-campbell-why-i-love-jacques-brel |title=Alastair Campbell – why I love Jacques Brel |work=The Guardian |last=Dickson |first=Andrew |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=16 May 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801094321/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/23/alastair-campbell-why-i-love-jacques-brel |archivedate=1 August 2016  }}</ref>

After leaving university Campbell spent some months busking, as well as training as a [[roulette]] dealer at the [[Golden Nugget Casino]] on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], before being accepted as a trainee reporter with the [[Mirror Group Newspapers]].

His first published work was ''Inter-City Ditties'', his winning entry to a readers' competition in ''[[Penthouse Forum|Forum]]'', the journalistic counterpart to ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine. This led to a lengthy stint writing pieces for the magazine with such titles as "Busking with Bagpipes" and "The Riviera Gigolo", written in a style calculated to lead readers at the time to believe they were descriptions of his own sexual exploits.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Peter Oborne|Oborne, Peter]] and Simon Walters|year=2004|title=''Alastair Campbell''|publisher=[[Aurum Press|Aurum]]|isbn=1-84513-001-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alastaircampbell0000obor/page/25 25–32]|url=https://archive.org/details/alastaircampbell0000obor/page/25}}</ref>

As part of the Mirror Group training scheme Campbell spent a year at a local weekly paper and he quickly became the sports editor at the [[Tavistock Times Gazette|''Tavistock Times'']], writing a column called 'Campbell's Corner'. It was while he was at the ''Tavistock Times'' he met his partner [[Fiona Millar]], with whom he has three children; two sons (born November 1987 and July 1989) and a daughter, comedian Grace Campbell (born May 1994).<ref>''[[10 O'Clock Live]]'', 8 February 2012</ref> However, his first significant contribution to the news pages was coverage of the [[Penlee lifeboat disaster]] in December 1981, while a trainee on the Plymouth-based ''[[Sunday Independent (England)|Sunday Independent]]'', then owned by Mirror Group Newspapers.

==National newspapers==
In 1982 Campbell moved to the London office of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', [[Fleet Street]]'s sole remaining big-circulation supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. He became a political correspondent, then in 1986 moving to ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'', a full-colour tabloid newspaper which was at the time trying to turn leftward, where he worked as a news editor.  His rapid rise and its accompanying stress led to alcohol abuse.<ref name=CU>"Cracking Up". [[BBC Two]] television documentary written and presented by Alastair Campbell. Broadcast Sunday, 12 October 2008.</ref>

===Alcoholism and depression===
While accompanying [[Neil Kinnock]]'s tour of Scotland in 1986 he began to display increasingly erratic behaviour, including dumping his hire car in the [[Rosyth Dockyard]]. He continued on that day, following Kinnock on to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Falkirk]] and finally [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]] where he had a [[nervous breakdown]] and was arrested by two [[Special Branch]] detectives. Police contacted his partner and following her calls to friends in Scotland the police let a family friend take Campbell to Ross Hall Hospital, a private [[BMI Healthcare|BMI hospital]] in Glasgow where she and her father visited him. Over the next five days as an in-patient he was given medication to calm him, and he realised that he had an alcohol problem after seeing a [[psychiatrist]]. Campbell said that from that day onwards he counted each day that he did not drink alcohol, and did not stop counting until he had reached thousands.<ref name=CU/>

Campbell returned to England, preferring to stay with friends near [[Cheltenham]], rather than return to London (and his partner) where he did not feel safe. His condition continued with a phase of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and he was reluctant to seek further medical help. He eventually cooperated with treatment from his [[General Practitioner|family doctor]].<ref name=CU/>

===Return to work===
Campbell's first son was born in 1987. He returned to the ''Daily Mirror'', where he eventually became political editor.<ref name=CU/>

He was a close adviser to Neil Kinnock, going on holiday with the Kinnocks, and worked closely with ''Mirror'' publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. Shortly after Maxwell drowned in November 1991, Campbell punched ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] after White joked about "Captain Bob, Bob, Bob...bobbing" in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], referring to where the tycoon's body had been recovered.<ref>{{cite news

After leaving the ''Mirror'' in 1993, Campbell became political editor of ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]''. He was working there when Labour leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] died in 1994. Campbell was a well-known face and helped to interview the three candidates for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader; it later became known he had already formed links with [[Tony Blair]].

==Politics and government==
[[File:Alastair Campbell (1).jpg|thumb|right|Campbell lecturing at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] series 'From Kennedy to Blair,' 7 July 2003]]
Shortly after [[Tony Blair]] was elected as [[1994 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|Leader of the Labour Party in 1994]], Campbell left ''Today'' to become Blair's press secretary. Having recovered and become [[teetotal]], he told Blair about his alcoholism, which Blair did not see as a problem. In his autobiography, Blair would later reveal that Campbell had coined the name "[[New Labour]]" and described Campbell as a "genius". Campbell wrote the speech that led to the party's review of [[Clause IV]] and the birth of "New Labour". In addition to being press spokesman, Campbell was Blair's speechwriter and chief strategist. He oversaw new co-ordination and rebuttal systems which gave birth to a communications machine which became both feared and respected, and the model for modern communications in politics and business. He earned a reputation for ruthless news management which made him many enemies in the media. But even the Conservatives conceded they were partly defeated by their inability to find someone to match him.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alastair |last=Campbell|title=[[The Blair Years]]|page=entry for 6 April 2002|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-09-951475-3|year=2007|nopp=true}}</ref> Campbell played an important role in the run-up to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], working with [[Peter Mandelson]] to co-ordinate Labour's successful election campaign. He also worked hard to win support from the national media for the Labour Party, particularly from newspapers that for many years had been anti-Labour. By March 1997, many of the leading newspapers—including ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', once a staunch [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherite]] paper; had declared their support for Labour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 |work=BBC News |title=The rise and fall of New Labour |date=3 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805051127/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 |archivedate=5 August 2010 |url-status=live  |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>

Campbell moved into government when Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election in May 1997]] and served as the Prime Minister's chief press secretary until 2000. In government, he implemented many radical changes to both procedure and operational management. He persuaded [[Cabinet Secretary]] Sir Robin Butler that government communications had to be modernised, and the government set up the Mountfield Review. He created a Strategic Communications Unit which gave [[Downing Street]] the power to co-ordinate all government activity, using what became known as "the grid" as its main apparatus. He set up a rapid rebuttal unit similar to the one he had used in opposition. He put Downing Street briefings on record for the first time, and although he was only identified as "The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman", he became one of the most high-profile and written about figures in British politics, earning the epithet "the real deputy Prime Minister". He opened briefings to the foreign media, among a raft of modernisation and efficiency strategies he introduced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Alastair|title=Power and the people 'the alastair campbell diaries' vol two|publisher=Arrow Books|isbn=9780099493464}}</ref>

BBC documentary maker [[Michael Cockerell]] produced a full-length documentary about Campbell's media operation, ''News From Number Ten'', which Cockerell said attracted more coverage than any of the other films he made. Campbell attacked the news media for their obsession with him, and eventually began to pull back from frontline work and delegated direct briefing of the media to others, but, if anything, his profile continued to grow. He then moved to the post of Prime Minister's Director of Communications which gave him a strategic role in overseeing government communications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside number ten|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4bAuSgr9oQ|website=you tube|publisher=you tube|accessdate=8 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616053114/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4bAuSgr9oQ|archivedate=16 June 2017}}</ref>

He was sponsored by US President [[George W. Bush]] to complete the London Marathon in aid of leukaemia research charity, [[Bloodwise]].

Campbell was part of Tony Blair's core team that conducted the negotiations that led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in Northern Ireland, and he has been honoured by several Irish universities for his role in the peace process. He became a close friend of, among others, [[Martin McGuinness]], and attended his funeral in 2017. It emerged McGuinness was helping Campbell with a novel which had an IRA active service unit as part of the plot.

He was seconded to overhaul the communications of [[NATO]] during the Kosovo crisis, when US President [[Bill Clinton]] feared NATO was losing the propaganda war against the [[Slobodan Milošević]] regime. The general in charge of the military operation, [[Wesley Clark]], credited Campbell with bringing order and discipline to NATO communications, and freeing the military to do its job.

Campbell became a central figure in the handling of the aftermath of [[Princess Diana]]'s death, after the head of The Royal Household, the [[Earl of Airlie]], asked Tony Blair to second Campbell to help prepare the funeral, saying they knew it would have to be different. Campbell is widely reported to have coined the phrase "the people’s princess" and also to have persuaded The Queen to make her broadcast to the nation more personal, not least by using the phrase "speaking as a grandmother". Campbell's character appears in the 2006 film ''The Queen'', though he has said most of it was made up.

He oversaw Tony Blair's successful 2001 general election campaign for re-election and also returned to assist with the successful 2005 general election campaign.

===Iraq War===
In the run-up to the [[Iraq War]], Campbell was involved in the preparation and release of the "[[September Dossier]]" in September 2002 and the "[[Iraq Dossier]]" (nicknamed "Dodgy Dossier") in February 2003. These documents argued the case for concern over possible [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) in Iraq. Both have been criticised as overstating or distorting the actual intelligence findings. Subsequent investigation revealed that the September Dossier had been altered on Campbell's orders to be consistent with a speech given by [[George W. Bush]] and statements by other United States officials. On 9 September 2002, Campbell sent a memo to Sir [[John Scarlett]], the chairman of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]], in which Campbell directed that the British dossier be "one that complements rather than conflicts with" the US claims.<ref name="Ames"/>

Later in 2003, commenting on WMDs in Iraq, Campbell said, "Come on, you don't seriously think we won't find anything?".<ref>{{cite magazine|title='Did I say that'|magazine= Observer magazine |date=29 March 2009}}</ref> He resigned in August 2003 during the [[Hutton Inquiry]] into the death of Dr. [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]]. Kelly's view that the government exaggerated the Iraqi threat in the Iraq Dossier, told to BBC journalists [[Andrew Gilligan]] and Susan Watts, had led to Campbell battling with the BBC. When Defence Secretary [[Geoff Hoon]] revealed to Campbell that Kelly had talked to the BBC, Campbell had then decided, in his own words, to use this fact to "fuck Gilligan".<ref>{{cite news

==Later career==
[[File:CampbellBothamWillisErskineGower.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Campbell with cricketers [[Ian Botham]], [[Bob Willis]] and [[David Gower]], and politician [[James Erskine, 14th Earl of Mar|James Erskine]].]]
Campbell worked again for the Labour Party as Campaign Director in the run-up to their third consecutive victory at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. Campbell also acted as an adviser to [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Ed Miliband]] at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] and the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] general elections. [[Sir Clive Woodward]] recruited Campbell to manage relations with the press for the [[British and Irish Lions]] [[2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|tour to New Zealand]] in 2005. Campbell wrote a column for ''[[The Times]]'' during the tour.

Throughout his time in Downing Street, Campbell kept a diary which reportedly totalled some two million words. Selected extracts, titled ''[[The Blair Years]]'', were published on 9 July 2007. Subsequent press coverage of the book's release included coverage of what Campbell had chosen to leave out, particularly in respect of the relationship between Blair and his [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] and successor, [[Gordon Brown]]. Campbell expressed an intention to one day publish the diaries in fuller form, and indicated in the introduction to the book that he did not wish to make matters harder for Brown in his new role as Prime Minister, or to damage the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

In 2003 and 2004, he ran a series for ''[[The Times]]'' newspapers, analysing greatness in sport to answer the question "Who is the greatest sports star of all time?" Though his conclusion was [[Muhammad Ali]], as part of the process; he interviewed and profiled sports stars from around the world, including [[Ian Botham]], [[Nick Faldo]], [[Ben Ainslie]], [[Michael Phelps]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Alex Ferguson]], [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Lance Armstrong]]. Campbell later said that he "fell hook, line and sinker" for the Armstrong legend. He subsequently worked with Armstrong, campaigning for cancer charities, but drew criticism from Armstrong's nemesis [[David Walsh (journalist)|David Walsh]] for being so supportive and defending him so passionately. Campbell later said that Walsh had been right.

In 2006 and 2007, Campbell took part in [[Soccer Aid]] as part of the [[Rest of the World]] team. He appeared alongside [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Paul Gascoigne]] to raise money for [[UNICEF]].

In 2007, he appeared on ''[[Comic Relief Does The Apprentice]]'' as project manager, having several clashes with [[Piers Morgan]] including his comment of "again?" when Morgan got fired, which went viral.<ref>{{cite web|title=celebrity apprentice 'your fired'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEYKjN2mHuA|website=youtube.com|publisher=you tube|accessdate=17 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122140333/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEYKjN2mHuA|archivedate=22 January 2010}}</ref>

Campbell has his own website and blog, as well as several pages on social networking websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog.php |title=Hear the latest from Alastair's Blog: Sign up for RSS feed |publisher=Alastaircampbell.org |accessdate=11 May 2009 |archivedate=23 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423205534/http://alastaircampbell.org/blog.php |url-status=dead  }}</ref> He uses these platforms to discuss British politics and other topics close to his heart. So far, Campbell's commentaries and views have garnered media attention and generated interest among various online communities. In October 2008, he broadcast the personal story of his mental illness in a television documentary partly to reduce the stigma of that illness.<ref name="CU"/> He has written a novel on the subject entitled ''All in the Mind''.

Campbell appeared as a mentor in the [[BBC Two]] series ''[[The Speaker (TV series)|The Speaker]]'' in April 2009 offering his advice on persuasive speaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/speaker/improve/persuasion/ |title=Alastair Campbell, Speaker Mentor – "Define your key message" |date=April 2009 |work=[[The Speaker (TV series)|The Speaker]]|publisher= BBC |accessdate=10 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411061829/http://www.bbc.co.uk/speaker/improve/persuasion/ |archivedate=11 April 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Campbell famously clashed with [[Adam Boulton]] on [[Sky News]] about the result of the 2010 general election, with the latter being reduced to shouting over both Campbell and the show's presenter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adam Boulton Vs Alastair Campbell|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkHwU4DRA8|website=You Tube GB|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=15 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513034304/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkHwU4DRA8|archivedate=13 May 2010}}</ref>

Campbell made his first appearance on the [[BBC One]] political discussion programme ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' on 27 May 2010. At the opening of the edition, presenter [[David Dimbleby]] said that the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition would not allow a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|frontbench member of the government]] to appear on the show unless Campbell was dropped. The BBC refused to do this. The government later accused the BBC of behaving improperly for allowing Campbell to appear as a more in-depth version of his diaries was due to be published the following week, and a Downing Street spokesman told ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Campbell seemed to be on because he's flogging a book next week, so the BBC haven't behaved entirely properly here."<ref name="Guardian28May2010">{{cite news

Three days later, Laws resigned his post following revelations about possible irregularities in his expenses claims in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' the day before.

Campbell appeared on BBC's ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' in July 2010 where he was booed by the audience but set a time of 1:47 around the ''Top Gear'' test track in the [[Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car]] segment.

=== Return to journalism ===
In January 2014, Campbell announced that he was joining ''[[British GQ]]'' with a brief to conduct interviews with figures from "politics... sport, business, culture, (and) other aspects of life that I find interesting", succeeding [[Piers Morgan]]. In his role at ''GQ'' Campbell has interviewed a wide range of people, including [[Jose Mourinho]], [[Raheem Sterling]], [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]] [[Mario Balotelli]], [[Mo Farah]] and [[Usain Bolt]] from the world of sport and [[Tony Blair]], [[Sadiq Khan]], [[Nicola Sturgeon]], [[George Osborne]], [[John McDonnell]], [[John Bercow]], and [[Chuka Umunna]] from the world of politics, as well as conducting in depth interviews with many other figures from public life, including [[Archbishop]] [[Justin Welby]], [[Garry Kasparov]] and [[Rachel Riley]].  In 2017, he conducted an interview with [[Prince William]]. In March 2017, ''[[GQ]]'' began to film the interviews to use as part of their digital platform, beginning with an interview with [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]], and then [[Tony Blair]]. When [[Jeremy Corbyn]] was interviewed for the magazine in late 2017, he did so on the condition that Campbell would not be the interviewer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeremy Corbyn fronts cover of GQ – but rejects Campbell interview|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-fronts-cover-of-gq-but-rejects-campbell-interview|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Alastair Campbell at GQ|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/search?q=Alastair+campbell|website=www.gq-magazine.com|publisher=GQ|accessdate=15 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808113546/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/search?q=Alastair+campbell|archivedate=8 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/alastair-campbell-succeeds-piers-morgan-gq/1226835 |title=Alastair Campbell succeeds Piers Morgan at GQ |last=Durrani |first=Arif |date=13 January 2014 |website=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]] |accessdate=13 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081507/http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/alastair-campbell-succeeds-piers-morgan-gq/1226835 |archivedate=14 April 2017  }}</ref>

In March 2017 the newspaper ''[[The New European]]'' announced that it had appointed Campbell as [[editor-at-large]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/alastair-campbell-joins-the-new-european-as-editor-at-large-1-4943379|title=Alastair Campbell joins The New European as editor-at-large|newspaper=The New European|date=24 March 2017|accessdate=13 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414082722/http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/alastair-campbell-joins-the-new-european-as-editor-at-large-1-4943379|archivedate=14 April 2017}}</ref>

In May 2019, he announced that he and his daughter Grace, a comedian and feminist, had launched a joint podcast, ''Football, Feminism and Everything In Between''; a series of interviews with figures from politics, sport and other walks of life. Their first interview with [[Ed Miliband]] was followed by [[Rachel Riley]], [[Jamie Carragher]], [[Kelly Holmes]] and [[Maro Itoje]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Iqbal |first1=Nosheen |title=Politics, privilege and podcasts: at home with Alastair Campbell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/alastair-campbell-grace-podcast-privilege-politics-at-home-labour |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=11 June 2019}}</ref>

When Government Adviser [[Dominic Cummings]] broke government guidelines to visit [[Durham, England|Durham]], Campbell urged his social media followers to write to all Tory MPs asking for their view, and published a 50,000 word analysis of what he called 'Organised Hypocrisy' on his website based on the responses he collated.<ref>{{cite web |title=THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE BULLSHIT – HOW TORY MPS ARE DEALING WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT CUMMINGS |url=https://alastaircampbell.org/2020/05/the-good-the-bad-and-the-bullshit-how-tory-mps-are-dealing-with-complaints-about-cummings/ |accessdate=8 October 2020}}</ref>

=== People's Vote campaign ===
[[File:Alastair Campbell March 2017.jpg|thumb|left|Alastair Campbell speaking at an anti-[[Brexit]] rally in Parliament Square, London on 25 March 2017]]
Campbell stated immediately after the UK's referendum on membership to the [[European Union]] in June 2016 that he thought it was "the worst decision Britain had made in his lifetime" and would do what he could to change people's minds. In addition to establishing ''[[The New European]]'', he was one of the early movers in the [[People's Vote]] campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the [[Brexit]] negotiations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/final-say-alastair-campbell-reddit-ama-questions-peoples-vote-a8544101.html|title=Final Say: Alastair Campbell to answer questions on Reddit about the campaign for a People's Vote|accessdate=2 November 2018|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

In 2018 Campbell became part of the top table team at the People's Vote campaign fighting for a referendum on the Brexit deal. This included overseeing the production of campaign films including one written by and starring his daughter Grace, called The Brexit Special, for which Campbell persuaded actor [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] to revive his most famous character, [[Victor Meldrew]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kIU93qaFag|title=The Brexit Special|website=You Tube|publisher=People's Vote|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/final-say-alastair-campbell-reddit-ama-questions-peoples-vote-a8544101.html|title=Final Say: Alastair Campbell to answer questions on Reddit|accessdate=11 October 2018|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

In 2018 Campbell worked for the People's Vote campaign's planning and organisation of a march on Parliament on 20 October, which drew an estimated 250,000 people<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/05/peoples-vote-march-attended-third-number-organisers-claimed/|title=People's Vote march was attended by a third of number that organisers claimed, official estimate says|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> onto the streets. The march was described by the media as the second biggest ever, after the protest against the Iraq war in 2003.

He helped organize and spoke at a second march and rally attended by an estimated million people in October 2019, on the day [[Boris Johnson]] called a rare Saturday sitting in Parliament to back his [[Brexit]] deal.

In July 2017, he was invited to speak at the [[French National Assembly]] to the newly elected MPs of President [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s victorious [[En Marche]] party, Campbell having met and advised [[Macron (president)|Macron]] during the campaign. He urged the French to be patient with the United Kingdom and to give them a chance to change course and reverse Brexit. He said [[Emmanuel Macron|Macron]] had been bolder than [[Tony Blair]] in setting up a new party and leading it to power within little over a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe1.fr/emissions/linterview-politique-de-8h20/brexit-europe-macron-trump-turquie-alastair-campbell-repond-aux-questions-de-pierre-de-vilno-3391712|title=Brexit, Europe, Macron, Trump, Turquie : Alastair Campbell répond aux questions de Pierre de Vilno|website=europe1.fr|publisher=europe1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820161450/http://www.europe1.fr/emissions/linterview-politique-de-8h20/brexit-europe-macron-trump-turquie-alastair-campbell-repond-aux-questions-de-pierre-de-vilno-3391712|archivedate=20 August 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe1.fr/international/alastair-campbell-le-gouvernement-britannique-est-nul-3391691|title=Alastair Campbell : "Le gouvernement britannique est nul"|website=europe1.fr|publisher=europe1.fr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718134132/http://www.europe1.fr/international/alastair-campbell-le-gouvernement-britannique-est-nul-3391691|archivedate=18 July 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref>

Campbell took part in the [[Mental Health Foundation]]'s takeover of [[Channel Four]] for Mental Health Awareness Week 2017, acting as a celebrity [[continuity announcer]]. For the Mental Health Awareness Week two years later he broadcast a documentary on [[BBC Two]], ''Alastair Campbell: Depression and Me'', exploring different ways of dealing and coping with depression. It was part of a BBC series drawing attention to different mental health conditions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Three personal films airing as part of BBC's mental health season |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/mental-health-and-me/depression |website=bbc.co.uk |publisher=The British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>

In 2019 he was appointed Global Ambassador to Australians for Mental Health, a new umbrella organisation fighting for better services. He made numerous media appearances and caused controversy by saying on the Australian version of ''Question Time'', the [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]]'s [[Q&A (Australian talk show)|''Q&A'']], that [[Donald Trump]] and fellow populists were "sowing the seeds of fascism".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/23/qa-alastair-campbell-compares-donald-trump-to-hitler |title=Q&A: Alastair Campbell compares Donald Trump to Hitler |first=Michael |last=McGowan |date=23 July 2019 |work=[[Guardian Australia]] |accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref>

He followed that by writing a book, Living Better, on his struggle with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], announcing it would be published in May 2020.

=== Expulsion from Labour Party ===
On 28 May 2019, Campbell announced that he had been expelled from the Labour Party after voting for the [[Liberal Democrat (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in that month's [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European elections]], and that he would appeal the decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/labour-expels-alastair-campbell-from-party |title=Labour expels Alastair Campbell from party |date=28 May 2019 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref> He also questioned the speed of his expulsion compared to the treatment of Labour colleagues [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|accused of anti-semitism]]. In response, shadow minister [[Dawn Butler]] stated that it was common knowledge that voting for another party would result in automatic exclusion.<ref name=":0" />

He was a long-standing critic of Labour's [[Brexit]] strategy and in the May 2019 European elections, he voted Liberal Democrat as a protest vote. He announced this after the polls had closed in interviews on TV and radio covering the results as they came in. He said he did so, in common with many others, to persuade Labour unequivocally to back a [[People's Vote]].  Two days later, by email, he was expelled from the Party, a move which provoked a major media storm in which many other [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] members outed themselves as having voted for parties other than Labour, including [[Cherie Blair]], [[Charles Clarke]], [[Bob Ainsworth]] and [[Betty Boothroyd]]. A hashtag #ExpelMeToo trended on Twitter as ordinary members expressed their support for Campbell. He immediately appealed the decision, saying tactical voting was not a breach of the rule under which he had been expelled, and arguing that unless all others who had acted as he did were expelled he also had a case for discrimination.

In July 2019, in the week [[Boris Johnson]] became Prime Minister, Campbell penned a 3,500 word open letter to [[Jeremy Corbyn]] saying he no longer wished to be re-admitted to the party, despite legal advice saying he would win a court case against his expulsion. He called on Corbyn to step down and cited his "failure" on [[Brexit]], [[antisemitism]], broader policy and "above all the failure to develop and execute a strategy". The story was broken in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the full letter published in ''[[The New European]]''. Corbyn said he was "disappointed", prompting Campbell to ask why he had been expelled.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Rowena |title='Alastair Campbell says he no longer wishes to be a Labour member' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/29/alastair-campbell-says-he-no-longer-wishes-to-be-a-labour-member |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=ALASTAIR CAMPBELL: Why I no longer want to be readmitted to Labour |url=https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/alastair-campbell-s-letter-to-jeremy-corbyn-1-6188152 |newspaper=The New European |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Campbell has described himself as a pro-faith [[atheist]], and his statement ‘we don’t do God’ is one of his most repeated soundbites. Yet despite this, he was asked in late-2017 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Justin Welby]], whom Campbell had interviewed for ''[[GQ]]'', to contribute to his book on the meaning of Christmas.

In August 2016 Campbell's older brother, Donald, a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]], died at the age of 62 due to complications resulting from his illness. Campbell has talked extensively about how Donald, the Principal's official [[Great Highland bagpipe|bagpiper]] at [[Glasgow University]] and a competitor in high-level [[Piobaireachd]] competitions, had inspired him to fight for better mental health services and understanding, and to become the ambassador for several mental health charities.<ref>{{cite web |title=A lament for my lost piper |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-lament-for-my-lost-piper-f8cfmdswb |newspaper=The Times |location=London|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=My Brother Donald|url=http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2016/08/14/my-brother-donald-please-spread-his-story-far-and-wide-and-join-the-fight-for-better-mental-health-services-and-understanding/|website=alastaircampbell.org|publisher=Alastair Campbell|accessdate=11 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808114055/http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2016/08/14/my-brother-donald-please-spread-his-story-far-and-wide-and-join-the-fight-for-better-mental-health-services-and-understanding/|archivedate=8 August 2017}}</ref>

Campbell plays the [[bagpipes]] to relieve stress in his spare time. In December 2017, a musical project he was involved in won the Community Award at the '[[Na Trads]]' traditional Scottish music awards. He had played the bagpipes at a concert in [[Glasgow]] earlier in the year, staged entirely by musicians with links to [[Tiree]]. The Tiree Community Songbook was made into a CD, which won a Community award at the Traditional Music awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tireeassociation.co.uk/product/the-tiree-songbook-double-album/|title=The Tiree Songbook|website=The Tiree Association|publisher=The Tiree Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203164802/http://tireeassociation.co.uk/product/the-tiree-songbook-double-album/|archivedate=3 December 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>

He is a keen runner, [[cyclist]], [[swimmer]] and [[triathlete]]. He raised over half a million pounds for charity running the [[London Marathon]] in 2003. In his 60s he developed an interest in cold water swimming.

He was a prominent critic of the U.K. government's handling of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]], and also of the media and Opposition failure to hold the government to account. He was signed up by&nbsp;TheArticle.Com&nbsp;and wrote for them and others a number of incisive articles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stay active and curious: 20 tips to help avoid sadness in lockdown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/stay-active-and-curious-20-tips-to-help-avoid-sadness-in-lockdown |work=The Guardian |date=7 April 2020|accessdate=4 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Boris Johnson needs to get a grip on this communications meltdown |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/02/boris-johnson-needs-get-grip-communications-meltdown/ |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=4 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Alastair Campbell: Show leadership and empathy — my 10-point plan to manage a crisis |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/leadership-empathy-10point-plan-to-manage-a-crisis-a4406401.html |work=The Evening Standard |accessdate=4 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Alastair Campbell: How I deal with insomnia and depression in stressful times |url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/alastair-campbell-insomnia-depression |work=GQ |accessdate=4 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/27/alastair-campbell-breaks-social-distancing-rules-selfie-speedo-mick-12764786/ |title=Alastair Campbell breaks social distancing rules for selfie with ‘Speedo Mick’|newspaper= [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=27 May 2020|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], he performed on the bagpipes in a charity song written by Martin Gillespie of Scottish band [[Skerryvore]], Everyday Heroes, which topped the iTunes download charts within hours of release. All proceeds from sales went to the [[NHS]] Charities [[COVID-19]] Urgent Appeal. Earlier, a film of Campbell serenading his next door neighbour, nurse Matilda Bridge as she come home from work, had millions of views and garnered media coverage around the world. It started a trend of pipers playing around the country during weekly ‘clap for the [[NHS]]’ events.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watch: Scottish musicians join forces with Alastair Campbell to launch charity single in aid of NHS workers |url=https://www.scotsman.com/health/coronavirus/watch-scottish-musicians-join-forces-alastair-campbell-launch-charity-single-aid-nhs-workers-2535147 |newspaper=The Scottsman |accessdate=4 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=VIDEO: Alastair Campbell teams up with Scottish musicians to release NHS charity single |url=https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/video-alastair-campbell-teams-up-with-scottish-musicians-to-release-nhs-charity-single/ |newspaper=The Sunday Post |accessdate=4 May 2020}}</ref>

== Stage and screen portrayals ==
A regular feature of comedy programme ''[[Bremner, Bird and Fortune]]'' was a satirical version of Campbell's discussions with [[Tony Blair]], in which [[Rory Bremner]] played Blair and [[Andrew Dunn (actor)|Andrew Dunn]] played Campbell. In 2005, Campbell was played by [[Jonathan Cake]] in the [[Channel 4]] television film ''[[The Government Inspector (television drama)|The Government Inspector]]'', based on the David Kelly Case. The following year, he was portrayed by Mark Bazeley in the [[Stephen Frears]] film ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' – a role reprised by Bazeley in 2010 follow-up ''[[The Special Relationship (film)|The Special Relationship]]'', also written by [[Peter Morgan]] but this time directed by [[Richard Loncraine]]. [[Alex Jennings]], who portrayed [[Prince Charles]] in ''The Queen'', portrayed Campbell in the television drama ''A Very Social Secretary''.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[International Movie Database]]|url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0421105 |title=Alex Jennings (I) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207152552/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0421105/ |archivedate=7 February 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}</ref> In an episode of [[Dead Ringers (comedy)|''Dead Ringers'']] his close relationship with Tony Blair is satirised in an imaginary scenario where Blair is divorcing his wife. He is asked if it will be difficult to sack the person he most loves and cherishes replying "I'm not sacking Alastair Campbell".

It is also widely believed that the character of [[Malcolm Tucker]] from the [[BBC]] political satire comedy ''[[The Thick of It]]'' is loosely based on Campbell. Tucker is famous for his short fuse and use of very strong language. In an interview with [[Mark Kermode]] on [[BBC2]]'s ''[[The Culture Show]]'', Campbell denied that the two are similar in any relevant way, but admitted to his liberal use of profanities in the workplace. The interview descended into argument with Campbell accusing the likes of [[Mark Kermode]] and the show's creator [[Armando Iannucci]] of being responsible for people's cynicism with modern politics.<ref>{{cite web|date=4 August 2009|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcFaizGw860|title=Alastair Campbell views In the Loop|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=4 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013000955/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcFaizGw860|archivedate=13 October 2014}}</ref>

In February 2018, he wrote, with [[Paul Fletcher (footballer)|Paul Fletcher]], a novel on football and terrorism in the 1970s, ''Saturday Bloody Saturday''.
