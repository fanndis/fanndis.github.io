==Broadcasting career==
===CBC===
Before completing his degree, Trebek began his career in 1961 working for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].<ref name=q2008 /> According to Trebek, "I went to school in the mornings and worked at nights; I did everything, at one time replacing every announcer in every possible job."<ref name="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/alex-trebek-hosted-so-many-cbc-shows-before-jeopardy-1.4754826 |title=Alex Trebek hosted so many CBC shows before Jeopardy! |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=June 17, 2011 |access-date=July 22, 2018 |archive-date=July 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724204248/https://www.cbc.ca/archives/alex-trebek-hosted-so-many-cbc-shows-before-jeopardy-1.4754826 |url-status=live }}</ref> He would eventually read the CBC national radio news and cover a wide range of special events for [[CBC Radio]] and [[CBC Television]], including [[curling]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/16529/cbc_championship_curling/details/ |title=CBC Championship Curling |website=TVArchive.ca |access-date=April 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220140227/http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/16529/cbc_championship_curling/details/ |archive-date=February 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[horse racing]].<ref name=q2008 />

Trebek's first hosting job was on a Canadian music program called ''[[Music Hop]]'' in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ryan|last=Edwardson|title=Canuck Rock: A History of Canadian Popular Music|page=181|publisher=University of Toronto Press|date=2009}}</ref> In 1966, he hosted a high school [[game show|quiz show]] called ''[[Reach for the Top]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek became a pop culture luminary|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-jeopardy-host-became-a-pop-culture-luminary/|access-date=2020-11-09}}</ref> From 1967 to 1970, he was a host for the CBC, introducing classical music programs including performances by [[Glenn Gould]]. For one or two seasons he hosted a weekly skating program. Starting in spring 1969, Trebek also hosted ''[[Strategy (TV series)|Strategy]]'', a weekday afternoon game show.<ref name="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation" /> From 1971 until the end of 1972, Trebek hosted ''I'm Here Til 9'', the local [[morning drive]] radio show on [[CBLA-FM|CBC Toronto]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradburn |first1=Jamie |title=Vintage Toronto Ads: Alex Trebek The Jeopardy! host was CBC Radio's morning man for a year in the early 1970s. |url=https://torontoist.com/2015/07/vintage-toronto-ads-alex-trebek/ |access-date=December 6, 2019 |work=Torontoist |date=July 15, 2015 |archive-date=October 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025192803/https://torontoist.com/2015/07/vintage-toronto-ads-alex-trebek/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1971, Trebek was one of several to have been shortlisted to succeed [[Ward Cornell]] as host of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''. Although Trebek was the preferred choice of executive producer [[Ralph Mellanby]], based on his audition and other CBC roles, Mellanby stated in 2020 that he ultimately chose [[Dave Hodge]] instead, because his boss did not want someone with a mustache to host ''Hockey Night''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Campbell|first=Ken|title=How Alex Trebek Almost Became Host of Hockey Night in Canada|url=https://www.si.com/hockey/news/how-alex-trebek-almost-became-host-of-hockey-night-in-canada|access-date=2020-11-11|website=The Hockey News on Sports Illustrated|language=en}}</ref>

===Game show career===
In 1973, Trebek moved to the United States and worked for [[NBC]] as host of a new game show, ''[[The Wizard of Odds]].''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hollywood Flashback: Alex Trebek Came to the U.S. in 'Wizard of Odds' in 1973 {{!}} Hollywood Reporter|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-flashback-alex-trebek-came-us-wizard-odds-1973-1265279|access-date=November 8, 2020|website=www.hollywoodreporter.com|archive-date=January 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106000543/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-flashback-alex-trebek-came-us-wizard-odds-1973-1265279|url-status=live}}</ref> A year later Trebek hosted the popular [[Heatter-Quigley Productions|Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley]] game show ''[[High Rollers]],'' which had two incarnations on NBC (1974–76 and 1978–80) and an accompanying syndicated season (1975–76).<ref name="David Schwartz 1999, p. 92">David Schwartz, Steve Ryan and Fred Wostbrock, The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows, 3rd ed., Checkmark Books, 1999, p. 92</ref> In between stints as host of ''High Rollers,'' Trebek hosted the short-lived CBS game show ''[[Double Dare (1976 game show)|Double Dare]]''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Noel |title=The Evolution of Alex Trebek |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-evolution-of-alex-trebek-1798215578 |website=tv.avclub.com |access-date=January 8, 2019 |archive-date=January 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109011959/https://tv.avclub.com/the-evolution-of-alex-trebek-1798215578 |url-status=live }}</ref> (not to be confused with the [[Double Dare (franchise)|1986 Nickelodeon game show of the same name]]). ''Double Dare'' turned out to be his only game show with the CBS network (he returned to CBS in 1994 to host the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]] until 1998), and the first show he hosted for what was then [[Mark Goodson|Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions]], as well as the second season of the syndicated series ''[[The $128,000 Question]],'' which was recorded in [[Toronto]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Archival Television Audio – Search Results|url=https://www.atvaudio.com/ata_search.php?keywords=$128,000+QUESTION,+THE|access-date=November 8, 2020|website=www.atvaudio.com}}</ref>

Since the second incarnation of ''High Rollers'' premiered while ''The $128,000 Question'' was still airing and taping episodes, Trebek became one of two hosts to emcee shows in both the United States and Canada, joining [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]], who was hosting ''[[Definition (game show)|Definition]]'' and ''[[Headline Hunters (game show)|Headline Hunters]]'' in Canada and ''[[Card Sharks]]'', which coincidentally premiered the same day as ''High Rollers'' in 1978 in the United States. Trebek's [[French language|francophone]] side was put on display in 1978, in a special bilingual edition of ''Reach for the Top'' and its Radio-Canada equivalent, ''[[Génies en herbe]].'' In this show, Trebek alternated smoothly between French and English throughout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/programs/2089/ |title=CBC Archives |work=CBC News |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105314/http://archives.cbc.ca/programs/2089/ |archive-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref>

Like other hosts of the day, Trebek made several guest appearances as a panelist or player on other shows.

After ''[[High Rollers]]'' was cancelled in 1980, Trebek moved on to ''[[Battlestars (game show)|Battlestars]]'' for NBC.

''Pitfall'' was cancelled after its production company, Catalena Productions, went bankrupt.

The Heatter pilots were ''Malcolm'', an NBC-ordered pilot featuring Trebek with an animated character as his co-host, and ''Lucky Numbers,'' an attempt at a revival of ''High Rollers'' that failed to sell. For Griffin, he shot two pilots for a revival of ''Jeopardy!'' when original host [[Art Fleming]] (a friend of Trebek's) declined to return to the role owing to creative differences. This revival sold; Trebek began hosting it in 1984 and remained the host until his death.

[[Mike Richards (television personality)|Mike Richards]] opened the show with this statement:
<blockquote>
I'm Mike Richards, the executive producer of ''Jeopardy!''. Over the weekend, we lost our beloved host Alex Trebek. This is an enormous loss for our staff and crew, for his family, and for his millions of fans. He loved this show and everything it stood for. In fact, he taped his final episodes less than two weeks ago. He will forever be an inspiration for his constant desire to learn, his kindness, and for the love of his family. We will air his final 35 episodes as they were shot. That's what he wanted. On behalf of everyone here at ''Jeopardy!'', thank you for everything Alex. This is ''Jeopardy!''.
</blockquote>

The lights on the set then dimmed blue in remembrance.

After each posthumous episode the title card read, “Dedicated to Alex Trebek. Forever in our hearts. Always our inspiration.”
