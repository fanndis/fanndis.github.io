'''Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn''' (Arthur William Patrick Albert; 1 May 1850{{spaced ndash}}16 January 1942), was the seventh child and third son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. He served as the [[Governor General of Canada]], the [[List of Governors General of Canada#Governors General of Canada, 1867–present|tenth]] since [[Canadian Confederation]] and the only [[British prince]] to do so. In 1910 he was appointed Grand Prior of the [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]] and held this position until 1939.

Arthur was educated by private tutors before entering the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] at 16 years old. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]], where he served for some 40 years, seeing service in various parts of the [[British Empire]]. During this time he was also created a [[Duke#Royal dukes|royal duke]], becoming the Duke of [[Connaught]] and [[Strathearn]], as well as the Earl of Sussex. In 1900 he was appointed as Commander in Chief of the British Army in Ireland, which he regretted his preference being to join the campaign against the Boers in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite news|date=8 January 1900|title=Ireland|work=The Times}}</ref> In 1911, he was appointed as Governor General of Canada, replacing the [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] as [[viceroy]]. He occupied this post until he was succeeded by the [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] in 1916. He acted as the King's, and thus the [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces|Canadian Commander-in-Chief]]'s, representative through the first years of the [[First World War]].

After the end of his viceregal tenure, Arthur returned to the United Kingdom and there, as well as in India, performed various royal duties, while also again taking up military duties. Though he retired from public life in 1928, he continued to make his presence known in the army well into the Second World War, before his death in 1942. He was Queen Victoria's last surviving son.

==Early life==
[[File:Queen Victoria with Prince Arthur.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of [[Queen Victoria]] with Prince Arthur by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]].]]
Arthur was born at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 1 May 1850, the seventh child and third son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. The prince was baptised by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[John Bird Sumner]], on 22 June in the palace's private chapel.  His godparents were [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Prince William of Prussia]] (the later King of Prussia and German Emperor Wilhelm I); his great-uncle's sister-in-law, [[Princess Ida of Saxe-Meiningen|Princess Bernard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] (for whom his maternal grandmother [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Duchess of Kent]] stood proxy); and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]], with whom he shared his birthday and after whom he was named.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=21108 |date=26 June 1850 |page=1807}}</ref><ref name=Bousfield80>{{cite book| last=Bousfield| first=Arthur| author2=Toffoli, Gary| title=Home to Canada: Royal Tours 1786–2010| publisher=Dundurn Press| year=2010| location=Tonawanda| page=[https://archive.org/details/royaltours1786200000bous/page/80 80]| isbn=978-1-55488-800-9| url=https://archive.org/details/royaltours1786200000bous/page/80}}</ref> As with his older brothers, Arthur received his early education from private [[tutor]]s. It was reported that he became the Queen's favourite child.<ref>{{cite book| last=Erickson| first=Carolly| title=Her Little Majesty: The Life of Queen Victoria| publisher=Simon & Schuster| date=15 January 2002| location=New York| isbn=978-0-7432-3657-7}}</ref>

==Military career==
It was at an early age that Arthur developed an interest in the army, and in 1866 he followed through on his military ambitions by enrolling at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military College]] at [[Woolwich]], from where he graduated two years later and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the [[Royal Engineers|Corps of Royal Engineers]] on 18 June 1868.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=23391 |date=19 June 1868 |page=3431}}</ref> The Prince transferred to the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]] on 2 November 1868 and,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=23436 |date=30 October 1868 |page=5467}}</ref> on 2 August 1869, to the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|Rifle Brigade]],<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=23522 |date=3 August 1869 |page=4313}}</ref> his father's own regiment, after which he conducted a long and distinguished career as an army officer, including service in South Africa, Canada in 1869, Ireland, Egypt in 1882, and in India from 1886 to 1890.
 
In Canada, Arthur, as an officer with the [[Montreal]] detachment of the Rifle Brigade,<ref name=Bousfield80 /> undertook a year's training and engaged in defending the [[Dominion]] from the [[Fenian Raids]]; there was initially concern that his personal involvement in Canada's defence might put the Prince in danger from Fenians and their supporters in the United States, but it was decided his military duty was primary.<ref name=Bousfield80/> Following his arrival at [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Arthur toured the country for eight weeks and made a visit in January 1870 to Washington, D.C., where he met with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref name=Bousfield80 /><ref name=Bousfield81>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2010| p=81}}</ref> During his service in Canada he was also entertained by Canadian society; among other activities, he attended an investiture ceremony in [[Montreal]], was a guest at balls and garden parties, and attended the opening of parliament in Ottawa (becoming the first member of the royal family to do so),<ref name=Bousfield81/> all of which was documented in photographs that were sent back for the Queen to view. It was not, however, all social and state functions for Arthur; the Prince was on 25 May 1870 engaged in fending off Fenian invaders during the [[Battle of Eccles Hill]], for which he received the [[Canada General Service Medal|Fenian Medal]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2010| p=82}}</ref>
[[File:Prince Arthur Mohawk Chapel Canada 1869.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Arthur met with the Chiefs of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River]] at the [[Mohawk Chapel]] in 1869.]]
Arthur made an impression on many in Canada. He was given on 1 October 1869 the title ''Chief of the Six Nations'' by the [[Iroquois]] of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Grand River Reserve]] in Ontario and the name ''Kavakoudge'' (meaning the sun flying from east to west under the guidance of the [[Great Spirit]]), enabling him to sit in the tribe's councils and vote on matters of tribe governance. As he became the 51st chief on the council, his appointment broke the centuries-old tradition that there should only be 50 chiefs of the Six Nations.<ref name=Bousfield83>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2010| p=83}}</ref> Of the Prince, Lady Lisgar, wife of then Governor General of Canada [[John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar|the Lord Lisgar]], noted in a letter to Victoria that Canadians seemed hopeful Prince Arthur would one day return as governor general.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hubbard| first=R.H.| title=Rideau Hall| publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press| year=1977| location=Montreal and London| page=[https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/17 17]| isbn=978-0-7735-0310-6| url=https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/17}}</ref>

Arthur was promoted to the honorary rank of colonel on 14 June 1871,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=23751|page=3006| date=30 June 1871}}</ref> substantive lieutenant-colonel in 1876,<ref name=Bousfield80 /> colonel on 29 May 1880 and,<ref name=gazette29May80>{{London Gazette| issue=24849| date=29 May 1880|page=3269}}</ref> on 1 April 13 years later, was made a general.<ref name=Bousfield80 /> He gained military experience as Commander-in-Chief of the [[Bombay Army]] from December 1886 to March 1890.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VQTAAAAYAAJ| last=India Office| title=The India List and India Office List| year=1819| publisher=Harrison| location=London| accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> He went on to be General Officer Commanding [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern District]], at [[Portsmouth]], from September 1890<ref name=commands>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Army%20Commands%201860-.pdf|title=Army Commands|accessdate=21 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=26084|page=4775|date=2 September 1890}}</ref> to 1893.<ref>{{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=26458|page=6356|date=14 November 1893}}</ref> The Prince had hoped to succeed his first cousin once-removed, the elderly [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]], as [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[British Army]], upon the latter's forced retirement in 1895. But this desire was denied to Arthur, and instead he was given, between 1893<ref>{{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=26446|page=5554|date=3 October 1893}}</ref> and 1898, command of the [[Aldershot Command|Aldershot District Command]].<ref name=commands/>

In August 1899 the 6th Battalion, Rifles of the Canadian [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]], located in Vancouver, British Columbia, asked Prince Arthur to give his name to the regiment and act as its honorary colonel. The regiment had recently been converted to the infantry role from the 2nd Battalion, 5th British Columbia Regiment of Canadian Artillery. With the Prince's agreement the unit was renamed 6th Regiment, Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles (DCORs) on 1 May 1900. He was subsequently appointed colonel-in-chief of the regiment, then known as [[The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own)]], in 1923. He held that appointment until his death.

On 26 June 1902 he was promoted to the post of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]], and thereafter served in various important positions, including [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland|Commander-in-Chief of Ireland]], from January 1900<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27154 |date=16 January 1900 |page=289 }}</ref> to 1904, with the dual position of commander of the [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|Third Army Corps]] from October 1901,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27360 |date=1 October 1901 |page=6400}}</ref> and Inspector-General of the Forces, between 1904 and 1907.

==Peerage, marriage, and family==
On his mother's birthday (24 May) in 1874, Arthur was created a royal [[Peerage|peer]], being titled as the [[Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] and [[Earl of Sussex]].<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=24098| date=26 May 1874|page=2779}}</ref> Some years later, Arthur came into the direct line of succession to the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in Germany, upon the death in 1899 of his nephew, [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred of Edinburgh]], the only son of his elder brother, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]]. He decided, however, to renounce his own and his son's succession rights to the duchy, which then passed to his other nephew, [[Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Charles Edward]], the posthumous son of [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]].<ref>{{cite web|title=House Laws of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/HGSachsen-CG.htm#1899|website=Heraldica.org}}</ref>
[[File:ArthurConnaughtfamille.jpg|thumb|upright|The Duke and [[Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia|Duchess of Connaught]] with their three children, 1893.]]
At [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St. George's Chapel]] in [[Windsor Castle]], on 13 March 1879, Arthur married [[Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia]], the daughter of [[Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia|Prince Frederick Charles]] and a great-niece of the German Emperor, Arthur's godfather, Wilhelm I. The couple had three children: [[Princess Margaret of Connaught|Princess Margaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah]] (born 15 January 1882), [[Prince Arthur of Connaught|Prince Arthur Frederick Patrick Albert]] (born 13 January 1883), and [[Princess Patricia of Connaught|Princess Victoria Patricia Helena Elizabeth]] (born 17 March 1886), who were all raised at the Connaughts' country home, [[Bagshot Park]], in [[Surrey]], and after 1900 at [[Clarence House]], the Connaughts' London residence. Through his children's marriages, Arthur became the father-in-law of [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]]; [[Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife]]; and [[Alexander Ramsay (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Alexander Ramsay]]. Arthur's first two children predeceased him; Margaret while pregnant with his sixth grandchild.{{#tag:ref|Through Princess Margaret, the reigning monarchs of [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]] are descended from the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn.|group=n|name=Descent}} For many years, Arthur maintained a liaison with [[Sir John Leslie, 2nd Baronet|Leonie, Lady Leslie]], sister of [[Jennie Churchill]], while still remaining devoted to his wife.<ref>{{Cite book| last=King| first=Greg| title=Twilight of Splendor: The Court of Queen Victoria During Her Diamond Jubilee| publisher=John Wiley & Sons| year=2007| location=Hoboken| page=59| isbn=978-0-470-04439-1}}</ref>

Alongside his military career, he continued to undertake royal duties beyond, or vaguely associated with, the army. On the return from a posting in India, he again, this time with his wife, toured Canada in 1890, stopping in all major cities across the country.<ref name=Bousfield83 /> He also toured Canada in 1906.<ref>Edmonton Bulletin, 9 March 1906</ref> In 1910, Arthur travelled aboard the [[Union-Castle Line]] ship ''Balmoral Castle'' to South Africa, to open the first parliament of [[Union of South Africa|the newly formed union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimematters.com/union-castle.html |title=Union-Castle Line – A brief Company History |last=Cox |first=Martin |publisher=Maritime Matters |accessdate=28 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917135535/http://www.maritimematters.com/union-castle.html |archive-date=17 September 2008 }}</ref> and in [[Johannesburg]] on 30 November he laid a commemorative stone at the [[South African National Museum of Military History|Rand Regiments Memorial]], dedicated to the British soldiers that died during the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allatsea.co.za/cems/anglomemorial.htm| title=The Anglo-Boer War Memorial at the Museum of Military History| publisher=The All at Sea Network| accessdate=28 September 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918224019/http://www.allatsea.co.za/cems/anglomemorial.htm| archive-date=18 September 2008| df=dmy-all}}</ref> When his brother was obliged to resign the office upon his accession in 1901 as [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], Prince Arthur was elected as [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] and was subsequently re-elected as such an additional 37 times before 1939, when the Prince was nearly 90 years of age.

==Governor General of Canada==
It was announced on 6 March 1911 that [[George V|King George V]] had, by commission under the [[royal sign-manual]], approved the recommendation of his British prime minister, [[H.H. Asquith]], to appoint Arthur as his representative.<ref name=GGConn>{{cite web| url=http://archive.gg.ca/gg/fgg/bios/01/connaught_e.asp| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=Governor General > Former Governors General > Field Marshal His Royal Highness the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=30 April 2009}}</ref> His brother-in-law, [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|the Duke of Argyll]], had previously served as the country's governor general, but when Arthur was sworn in on 13 October 1911 in the ''[[Legislative Council of Quebec|salon rouge]]'' of the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|parliament buildings of Quebec]],<ref name=Bousfield85>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2010| p=85}}</ref> he became the first [[Governor General of Canada]] who was a member of the [[British royal family]].<ref name=GGConn />

To Canada, Arthur brought with him his wife and his youngest daughter, the latter of whom would become an extremely popular figure with Canadians. The Governor General and his viceregal family travelled throughout the country, performing such constitutional and ceremonial tasks as opening parliament in 1911 (to which Arthur wore his field marshal's uniform and the Duchess of Connaught wore the gown she had worn at the King's coronation the previous year) and,<ref name=Bousfield85 /> in 1917, laying at the newly rebuilt [[Centre Block]] on [[Parliament Hill]] the same cornerstone his older brother, the late King Edward VII, had set on 1 September 1860, when the original building was under construction. The family crossed the country a number of times and the Governor General made another trip to the United States in 1912, when he met with President [[William Howard Taft]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2010| p=86}}</ref>

When in Ottawa, Connaught maintained a routine of four days each week at his office on [[Parliament Hill]] and held small, private receptions for members of all political parties and dignitaries. The Duke learned to [[Ice skating|ice skate]] and hosted skating parties at the royal and viceroyal residence{{mdash}} [[Rideau Hall]]{{mdash}} to which the Connaughts made many physical improvements during Arthur's term as governor general. The royal family also took to [[camping]] and other outdoor sports, such as hunting and fishing.<ref>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2010| p=87}}</ref>
[[File:Postcard of Vice-Regal Visit to Valcartier Military Base 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Arthur and his viceregal party visit the [[CFB Valcartier|Valcartier military base]] in 1914.]]
In 1914, the First World War broke out, with Canadians called to arms against Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]]. Arthur maintained a wider role in [[British Empire|the empire]]{{mdash}} for instance, from 1912 until his death, serving as [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Cape Town Highlanders Regiment]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cthighlanders.co.za/cth/history.htm| title=History – Past Royal Connections| publisher=Cape Town Highlanders Website (Unofficial)| accessdate=28 August 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008154156/http://www.cthighlanders.co.za/cth/history.htm| archive-date=8 October 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{mdash}} but the Connaughts remained in Canada after the beginning of the global conflict, with Arthur emphasising the need for military training and readiness for Canadian troops departing for war, and giving his name to Connaught Cup for the [[Royal Northwest Mounted Police]], to encourage pistol marksmanship for recruits. He was also active in auxiliary war services and charities and conducted hospital visits. Though well intended, upon the outbreak of the war, Arthur immediately donned his field marshal's uniform and went, without advice or guidance from his ministers, to training grounds and barracks to address the troops and to see them off before their voyage to Europe. This was much to the chagrin of Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]], who saw the Prince as overstepping [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Hubbard| first=R.H.| title=Rideau Hall| publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press| year=1977| location=Montreal and London| pages=[https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/8 8–9]| isbn=978-0-7735-0310-6| ref=CITEREF_Hubbard_1977| url=https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/8}}</ref> Borden placed blame on the military secretary, Edward Stanton (whom Borden considered to be "mediocre"), but also opined that Arthur "laboured under the handicap of his position as a member of the royal family and never realised his limitations as Governor General."<ref>{{Cite book| last=Borden| first=Robert| author-link=Robert Borden| title=Memoires| publisher=McClelland and Stewart| date=1 January 1969| location=Toronto| pages=601–602| volume=1}}</ref> At the same time, the Duchess of Connaught worked for the [[Red Cross]] and other organisations to support the war cause. She was also Colonel-in-Chief of the Duchess of Connaught's Own Irish Canadian Rangers battalion, one of the regiments in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and Princess Patricia also lent her name and support to the raising of a new Canadian army regiment{{mdash}} [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].

His term as Canada's Governor General ended in 1916.

Following the war, Arthur commissioned in memory of Canada's fallen a [[stained glass]] window which is located in [[St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church (Ottawa)|St. Bartholomew's Church, Ottawa]], next to Rideau Hall, and which the family attended regularly.

==Later life==

After his years in Canada, the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn held no similar public offices but undertook a number of public engagements. In 1920, he travelled to South Africa to open [[Chapman's Peak Drive]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Drive|first=Chapman's Peak|title=History|url=https://www.chapmanspeakdrive.co.za/the-drive/history.html|access-date=2020-07-01|website=Chapmans Peak Drive|language=en-gb}}</ref> The following year he travelled to India, where he officially opened the new [[Central Legislative Assembly]], [[Council of State (India)|Council of State]], and [[Chamber of Princes]].<ref>{{Citation|contribution=Arthur, Prince, first duke of Connaught and Strathearn|year=2004|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|editor-last=Harrison|editor-first=Brian|volume=I|place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>  During his time in India, the [[Indian National Congress]]'s [[Non-cooperation movement|first satyagraha]] was ongoing; as part of this, shops were closed and few Indians attended the official ceremonies when he visited [[Calcutta]] in the same year.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Searching for rights and freedoms in the 20th century|authors=Jane Shuter, Rosemary Rees, William Beinart, Edward Teversham, Rick Rogers|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2015|isbn=978-1-447-98533-4|location=London|pages=196}}</ref> As president of the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts Association]] and one of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell]]'s friends and admirers, he performed the official opening of the [[3rd World Scout Jamboree]] at [[Arrowe Park]].

The Duke also returned to military service and continued well into the Second World War,<ref>{{Citation|last=Bell|first=Edward|title=Letter to Mrs. E.I.J.

The Duchess, who had been ill during their years at Rideau Hall, died in March 1917, and Arthur mostly withdrew from public life in 1928; his last formal engagement was the opening of the Connaught Gardens in Sidmouth, Devon, on 3 November 1934.

==Death==
He died on 16 January 1942 at [[Bagshot Park]], at the age of 91 years, 8 months and 16 days, the same age as his elder sister, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]], who had died two years and one month before. A funeral service for the Duke was held at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]] on 23 January, after which his body was placed temporarily in the Royal Vault beneath St. George's Chapel in Windsor.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Late Duke of Connaught|day_of_week=Friday |date=20 March 1942 |page_number=7 |issue=49189 }}</ref> He was buried on 19 March 1942 in the [[Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Duke Of Connaught Dead In England, 91.
