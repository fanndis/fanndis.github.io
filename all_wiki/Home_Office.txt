{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}

==Priorities==
The Department outlined its aims for this Parliament in its Business Plan, which was published in May 2011, and superseded its Structural Reform Plan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Business Plan|url=http://www.HomeOffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/corporate-publications/business-plan/ho-business-plan-2011-15/|website=www.HomeOffice.gov.uk|publisher=Home Office|access-date=12 April 2012}}</ref>  The plan said the department will:

::1. Empower the public to hold the police to account for their role in cutting crime
:::*Introduce directly elected [[Police and Crime Commissioner]]s and make police actions to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour more transparent.
::2. Free up the police to fight crime more effectively and efficiently
:::*Cut police bureaucracy, end unnecessary central interference and overhaul police powers in order to cut crime, reduce costs and improve police value for money.  Simplify national institutional structures and establish a [[National Crime Agency]] to strengthen the fight against organised crime (and replace the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]).
::3. Create a more integrated criminal justice system
:::*Help the police and other public services work together across the criminal justice system.
::4. Secure our borders and reduce immigration
:::*Deliver an improved migration system that commands public confidence and serves our economic interests.  Limit non-EU economic migrants, and introduce new measures to reduce inflow and minimise abuse of all migration routes, for example the student route.  Process asylum applications more quickly, and end the detention of children for immigration purposes.
::5. Protect people's freedoms and civil liberties
:::*Reverse state interference to ensure there is not disproportionate intrusion into people's lives.
::6. Protect our citizens from terrorism
:::*Keep people safe through the Government's approach to counter-terrorism.
::7. Build a fairer and more equal society (through the [[Government Equalities Office]])
:::*Help create a fair and [[labour market flexibility|flexible labour market]].  Change culture and attitudes.  Empower individuals and communities.  Improve equality structures, frontline services and support; and help Government Departments and others to consider equality as a matter of course.

The Home Office publishes progress against the plan on the [[10 Downing Street]] website.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Business Plan: Home Office|url=http://Transparency.Number10.GOV.uk/transparency/srp/view-srp/40|website=Transparency.Number10.GOV.uk|publisher=[[10 Downing Street]]|access-date=12 April 2012}}</ref>

==History==
On {{Start date and age|1782|03|27|df=yes}}, the Home Office was formed by renaming the existing [[Southern Department (England)|Southern Department]], with all existing staff transferring.  On the same day, the [[Northern Department]] was renamed the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]].

To match the new names, there was a transferring of responsibilities between the two Departments of State.  All domestic responsibilities were moved to the Home Office, and all foreign matters became the concern of the Foreign Office.

Most subsequently created domestic departments (excluding, for instance, those dealing with education) have been formed by splitting responsibilities away from the Home Office.

The initial responsibilities were:
*Answering [[petition]]s and addresses sent to the King
*Advising the King on
**Royal grants
**[[Warrant (law)|Warrant]]s and [[letter patent|commissions]]
**The exercise of [[Royal Prerogative (United Kingdom)|Royal Prerogative]]
*Issuing instructions on behalf of the King to officers of [[the Crown]], [[Lord-lieutenant|lords-lieutenant]] and [[magistrates]], mainly concerning law and order
*Operation of the secret service within the UK
*Protecting the public
*Safeguarding the rights and liberties of individuals
*Colonial matters

Responsibilities were subsequently changed over the years that followed:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.Casbah.ac.uk/cats/archive/138/PROA00008.htm|title=Changes to Home Office responsibilities|website=Casbah.ac.uk|access-date=19 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.Archive.org/web/20110709220106/http://www.Casbah.ac.uk/cats/archive/138/PROA00008.htm|archive-date=9 July 2011}}</ref>

==Recent incidents==
===Union action===
On 18 July 2012, the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]] announced that thousands of Home Office employees would go on [[Strike action|strike]] over jobs, pay and other issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.BBC.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18889900|title=Home Office staff vote to strike over jobs and pay|website=www.BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]] – [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=18 July 2012|access-date=28 July 2013}}</ref>  However, the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]] (PCSU) called off the strike before it was planned; it claimed the department had, subsequent to the threat of actions, announced 1,100 new border jobs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://Union-News.co.uk/2012/07/pcs-calls-off-home-office-olympic-strike-after-extra-staff-are-posted-in/|title=PCS calls off Home Office olympic strike after extra staff are posted in|website=Union-News.co.uk|publisher=[[Union News]]|date=July 2012|access-date=24 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.Archive.org/web/20140324170948/http://Union-News.co.uk/2012/07/pcs-calls-off-home-office-olympic-strike-after-extra-staff-are-posted-in/|archive-date=24 March 2014}}</ref>

===Windrush scandal===
The first allegations about the unfair targeting of pre 1973 [[Caribbean]] migrants started in 2013.  In 2018, the allegations were put to the Home Secretary in the [[House of Commons]], and resulted in the resignation of the then Home Secretary.  The [[Windrush scandal]] resulted in British citizens being wrongly deported, and being refused life critical medical treatment, along with a further compensation scheme for those affected, and a wider debate on the [[Home Office hostile environment policy]].

[[File:Lunar House 86.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Lunar House]] in [[Croydon]], which holds the headquarters of [[UK Visas and Immigration]]]]

==Location==
Until 1978, the Home Office had its offices in what is now the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building]] on King Charles Street, off [[Whitehall]].  From 1978 to 2004, the Home Office was then located at [[102 Petty France|50 Queen Anne's Gate]], a [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] office block in [[Westminster]] designed by Sir [[Basil Spence]], close to [[St. James's Park tube station]].  Many functions, however, were devolved to offices in other parts of London, and the country, notably the headquarters of the [[Immigration and Nationality Directorate]] in Croydon.

In 2005, the Home Office moved to a new main office designed by [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Sir Terry Farrell]] at [[2 Marsham Street]], Westminster, on the site of the demolished [[Marsham Towers]] building of the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.TerryFarrell.co.uk/projects/finishing/finish_marsham.html|title=New Home Office building|website=www.TerryFarrell.co.uk|publisher=[[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]]|archive-url=https://web.Archive.org/web/20060926144808/http://www.TerryFarrell.co.uk/projects/finishing/finish_marsham.html|archive-date=26 September 2006}}</ref>

For external shots of its fictional Home Office, the TV series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' uses an aerial shot of the [[Government Offices Great George Street]] instead, serving as stand-in to match the distinctly less modern appearance of the fictitious accommodation interiors the series uses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.GOV.uk/government/history/1-horse-guards-road|title=History of 1 Horse Guards Road - GOV.UK|website=www.GOV.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom]]|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>

==Research==
To meet the UK's five-year science and technology strategy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.HomeOffice.gov.uk/documents/PoliceST_S2_part11.pdf?view=Binary|title=Police Science and Technology Strategy: 2004 – 2009|website=www.HomeOffice.gov.uk|publisher=Home Office|access-date=27 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.Archive.org/web/20070205105335/http://www.HomeOffice.gov.uk/documents/PoliceST_S2_part11.pdf?view=Binary|archive-date=5 February 2007}}</ref> the Home Office sponsors research in [[police science]]s, including:
*[[Biometrics]] – including face and voice recognition
*[[Cell type]] analysis – to determine the origin of cells (e.g. hair, skin)
*[[Chemistry]] – new techniques to recover latent fingerprints
*[[DNA]] – identifying offender characteristics from DNA
*Improved [[Forensic profiling|profiling]] – of illicit drugs to help identify their source
*[[Raman Spectroscopy]] – to provide more sensitive drugs and explosives detectors (e.g. roadside drug detection)
*[[Terahertz imaging]] methods and technologies – e.g. image analysis and new cameras, to detect crime, enhance images and support anti-terrorism

==Devolution==
Most front-line law and order policy areas, such as policing and criminal justice, are devolved in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], but the following [[reserved and excepted matters]] are handled by Westminster.

===Scotland===
Reserved matters:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.OPSI.GOV.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_14#sch5-pt1|title=Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part I|website=www.OPSI.GOV.uk|access-date=19 June 2010}}</ref>
*[[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]
*[[Extradition]] legislation, but the Scottish Ministers (through the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]]) have executive responsibility for all aspects of mutual legal assistance
*Most aspects of [[firearms]] legislation, but Scottish Ministers have some executive responsibilities for the licensing of firearms; further powers are transferred under the [[Scotland Act 2012]]
*[[Immigration]] and [[nationality]]
*[[Animal experiments|Scientific procedures]] on live animals.

The [[Scottish Government Justice and Communities Directorates]] are responsible for devolved justice and home affairs policy.

===Northern Ireland===
Excepted matters:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.OPSI.GOV.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980047_en_11#sch2|title=Northern Ireland Act 1998, Schedule 2|website=www.OPSI.GOV.uk|date=4 November 1950|access-date=19 June 2010}}</ref>
*[[Extradition]] (as an [[international relations]] matter)
*[[Immigration]] and [[nationality]]

The following matters were not transferred at the devolution of policing and justice on 12 April 2010, and remain reserved:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.NIAssembly.gov.uk/record/reports2009/100309.htm#4|title='&#39;Policing and Justice'&#39; motion, Northern Ireland Assembly, 12 April 2010|website=www.NIAssembly.gov.uk|publisher=[[Northern Ireland Assembly Information Office]]|access-date=19 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.Archive.org/web/20101216025255/http://www.NIAssembly.gov.uk/record/reports2009/100309.htm#4|archive-date=16 December 2010}}</ref>

==Criticism==
In March 2019, it was reported that in two unrelated cases, the Home Office denied asylum to converted Christians by misrepresenting certain [[Bible]] quotes.  In one case, it quoted selected excerpts from the Bible to imply that [[Christianity]] is not more peaceful than [[Islam]], the religion the asylum-seeker converted from.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home Office refuses Christian convert asylum by quoting Bible passages that 'prove Christianity is not peaceful'|url=https://www.Independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/home-office-christian-convert-asylum-refused-bible-not-peaceful-a8832026.html|website=www.Independent.co.uk|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=20 March 2019|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>  In another incident, an [[Iran]]ian Christian application for asylum was rejected because her faith was judged as "half-hearted", for she did not believe that Jesus could protect her from the Iranian regime.<ref>{{Cite web|title='Illiterate' Home Office quotes Jesus in asylum rejection letter|url=https://www.TheTablet.co.uk/news/11523/-illiterate-home-office-quotes-jesus-in-asylum-rejection-letter|website=www.TheTablet.co.uk|access-date=4 April 2019|date=27 March 2019}}</ref>  As outrage grew on social media, the Home Office distanced itself from the decision, though it confirmed the letter was authentic.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rejecting asylum claim, U.K. quotes Bible to say Christianity is not 'peaceful'|url=https://www.NYTimes.com/2019/03/21/world/europe/britain-asylum-seeker-christianity.html|website=www.NYTimes.com|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=21 March 2019|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>  The Home Secretary admitted that it was "totally unacceptable" for his department to quote the Bible to question an Iranian Christian convert's asylum application, and ordered an urgent investigation into what had happened.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home Secretary orders urgent investigation into asylum rejection letter which criticised Bible|url=https://www.Premier.org.uk/News/UK/Home-Secretary-orders-urgent-investigation-into-asylum-rejection-letter-which-criticised-Bible|website=www.Premier.org.uk|access-date=4 April 2019|date=2 April 2019}}</ref>

The treatment of Christian asylum seekers chimes with other incidents in the past, like the refusal to grant [[Travel visa|visas]] to the [[Archbishop]] of [[Mosul]] to attend the consecration of the UK's first [[Syriac Orthodox]] Cathedral.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Britain bans heroic bishops: persecuted Christian leaders from war zones refused entry|url=https://www.Express.co.uk/news/uk/739563/Christians-leaders-persecuted-bishops-Iraq-Syria-visas-UK|website=www.Express.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Express]]|access-date=4 April 2019|date=4 December 2016}}</ref>  In a 2017 study, the Christian [[Barnabas Fund]] found that only 0.2% of all Syrian refugees accepted by the UK were Christians, although Christians accounted for approximately 10% of Syria's pre-war population.<ref>{{Cite web|title=UK government discriminates against Christian refugees from Syria|url=https://BarnabasFund.org/news/UK-government-discriminates-against-Christian-refugees-from-Syria|website=BarnabasFund.org|publisher=[[Barnabas Fund]]|access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>

In 2019, the Home Office admitted to multiple breaches of data protection regulations in the handling of its Windrush compensation scheme.  The department sent emails to Windrush migrants which revealed the email address of other Windrush migrants to whom the email was sent.  The data breach concerned five different emails, each of which was sent to 100 recipients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.BBC.co.uk/news/uk-47855428|title=Windrush: Home Office admits data breach in compensation scheme|website=www.BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]] – [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=8 April 2019}}</ref>  In April 2019, the Home Office admitted to revealing 240 personal email addresses of EU citizens applying for settled status in the UK.  The email addresses of applicants were incorrectly sent to other applicants to the scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.BBC.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47888214|title=Brexit: Home Office sorry for EU citizen data breach|website=www.BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]] – [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=11 April 2019}}</ref>  In response to these incidents, the Home Office pledged to launch an independent review of its data protection compliance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.CivilServiceWorld.com/articles/news/home-office-launch-independent-review-data-protection-compliance|title=Home Office to launch independent review of data protection compliance|website=www.CivilServiceWorld.com|publisher=[[Civil Service World]]|date=12 April 2019}}</ref>

In 2019, the [[Court of Appeal]] issued a judgement which criticised the Home Office's handling of immigration cases.  The judges stated that the "general approach [by the home secretary, [[Sajid Javid]]] in all earnings discrepancy cases [has been] legally flawed".  The judgement relates to the Home Office's interpretation of Section 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.TheGuardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/16/court-says-home-office-use-immigration-rule-legally-flawed |title=Court castigates Home Office over misuse of immigration law|website=www.TheGuardian.com|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 April 2019}}</ref>

In November 2020, the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]], a statutory body that investigates breaches of the [[Equality Act 2010]] published a report concluding that the Home Office had a "lack of organisation-wide commitment, including by senior leadership, to the importance of equality and the Home Office's obligations under the equality duty placed on government departments". The report noted that the Home Office's purusit of the "hostile environment" policy from 2012 onwards "accelerated the impact of decades of complex policy and practice based on a history of white and black immigrants being treated differently". Caroline Waters, the interim chair of the EHRC, described the treatment of Windrush immigrants by the Home Office as a "shameful stain on British history".<ref name="BBC-EHRC">{{Cite news|date=2020-11-25|title=Windrush generation: UK 'unlawfully ignored' immigration rules warnings|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-55065061|access-date=2020-11-25}}</ref>
