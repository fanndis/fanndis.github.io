==History==
On May 28, 1984, Soros signed a contract between the Soros Foundation ([[New York City|New York]]) and the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], the founding document of the Soros Foundation Budapest.<ref>{{Citation | first = Nóvé Béla | last = Tény | title = Soros | publisher = KKA | place = [[Hungary|HU]] | url = http://www.kka.hu/_Kozossegi_Adattar/Azadatt.nsf/02001425b1246fe38525664000665c75/560c780eb85cfd4ac12571aa0042dd56/$FILE/T%C3%A9ny_soros.pdf}}.</ref> This was followed by several foundations in the region to help countries move away from communism.<ref name="Hoduski-Abbott, Bernadine E. 2003. p75">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/lobbyingforlibra00abbo/page/n81 |title=Lobbying for Libraries and the Public's Access to Government Information |location=Lanham |publisher=Scarecrow |last=Hoduski-Abbott |first=Bernadine E. |isbn=9780810845855 |year=2003 |page=75 }}</ref>

In 1991, the foundation merged with the Fondation pour une Entraide Intellectuelle Européenne, an affiliate of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], created in 1966 to imbue 'non-conformist' Eastern European scientists with anti-totalitarian and capitalist ideas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guilhot|first=Nicolas|title=A Network of Influential Friendships: The Fondation Pour Une Entraide Intellectuelle Européenne and East-West Cultural Dialogue, 1957-1991|date=January 1, 2006|jstor=41821373|journal=Minerva|volume=44|issue=4|pages=379–409|doi=10.1007/s11024-006-9014-y}}</ref>

Open Society Institute was created in the [[United States]] in 1993 to support the Soros foundations in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] and the former [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=callahan/>

In August 2010, it started using the name Open Society Foundations (OSF) to better reflect its role as a benefactor for civil society groups in countries around the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schrier |first1=H.

Soros believes there can be no absolute answers to political questions because the same principle of [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] applies as in financial markets.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/sorosonsorosstay00soro |title=Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve |publisher=John Wiley  |first1=George|last1=Soros|first2=Byron|last2=Wien|first3=Krisztina|last3=Koenen |isbn=978-0-471-11977-7 |location=New York |year=1995 |accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Christopher Stone (criminal justice expert)|Christopher Stone]] joined the OSF as the second president. He replaced [[Aryeh Neier]], who served as president from 1993 to 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/business/christopher-stone-to-lead-soros-open-society-foundations.html |title=Criminal Justice Expert Named to Lead Soros Foundations |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> Stone announced in September 2017 that he was stepping down as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2017/9/14/what-just-happened-at-the-open-society-foundations-and-what-comes-next |title=What Just Happened at the Open Society Foundations?

In 2016, the OSF was reportedly the target of a [[cyber security attack|cyber security breach]]. Documents and information reportedly belonging to the OSF were published by a website. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with Russian-linked [[cyberattack]]s that targeted other institutions, such as the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|Democratic National Committee]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-11/russian-hackers-of-dnc-said-to-scoop-up-secrets-from-nato-soros |title=Russian Hackers of DNC Said to Nab Secrets From NATO, Soros |last1=Riley |first1=Michael |publisher=Bloomberg |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref>

The OSF became a partner of the [[National Democratic Institute]],<ref>https://www.ndi.org/partners</ref> a charitable organization which partnered with pro-democracy groups like the Gov2U project<ref>http://www.gov2u.org/index.php/our-network</ref> run by [[Scytl]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130609022607/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/scytl-acquires-gov2us-software-division-expanding-its-edemocracy-solutions-portfolio-2013-04-30</ref>

==Reception and influence==
In 2007, Nicolas Guilhot (a senior research associate of [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]]) wrote in ''[[Critical Sociology (journal)|Critical Sociology]]'' that the Open Society Foundations serve to perpetuate institutions that reinforce the existing social order, as the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation]] have done before them. Guilhot argues that control over the [[social sciences]] by moneyed interests has depoliticized this field and reinforced a capitalist view of [[modernization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Guilhot|first1=Nicolas|title=Reforming the World: George Soros, Global Capitalism and the Philanthropic Management of the Social Sciences|journal=Critical Sociology|date=May 2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=447–477|doi=10.1163/156916307X188988}}</ref>
 
An OSF effort in 2008 in the [[African Great Lakes]] region aimed at spreading human rights awareness among [[prostitution in Uganda|prostitutes in Uganda]] and other nations in the area was not received well by the Ugandan authorities, who considered it an effort to legalize and legitimize prostitution.<ref>{{cite news|title=Uganda prostitute workshop banned|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7313310.stm|accessdate=November 20, 2015|publisher=BBC|date=March 25, 2008}}</ref>

Open Society Foundation has been criticized in pro-Israel editorials, [[Tablet Magazine]], [[Arutz Sheva]] and [[Jewish Press]], for including funding for the activist groups [[Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel|Adalah]] and [[Haneen Zoabi#Political career|I'lam]], which they say are [[anti-Israel]] and support the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement. Among the documents released by [[DCleaks]], an OSF report reads "For a variety of reasons, we wanted to construct a diversified portfolio of grants dealing with [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], funding both Israeli Jewish and PCI (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) groups as well as building a portfolio of Palestinian grants and in all cases to maintain a low profile and relative distance—particularly on the advocacy front."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/210826/soros-hack-reveals-evidence-of-systemic-anti-israel-bias|title=Soros Hack Reveals Evidence of Systemic Anti-Israel Bias|date=August 14, 2016|website=Tablet Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/dc-leaks-publishes-george-soros-files-showing-millions-contributed-to-anti-israel-causes/2016/08/14/ |title=DC Leaks Publishes George Soros' Files Showing Millions Contributed to Anti-Israel Causes |work=Jewish Press |author=David Israel |date=August 14, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901101523/http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/dc-leaks-publishes-george-soros-files-showing-millions-contributed-to-anti-israel-causes/2016/08/14 |archive-date=September 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/216382 George Soros hacked, documents posted online] Rachel Kaplan, 14/08/16</ref>

[[NGO Monitor]], an Israeli NGO, produced a report which says, "Soros has been a frequent critic of [[Israeli government]] policy, and does not consider himself a Zionist, but there is no evidence that he or his family holds any special hostility or opposition to the existence of the state of Israel. This report will show that their support, and that of the Open Society Foundation, has nevertheless gone to organizations with such agendas." The report says its objective is to inform OSF, claiming: "The evidence demonstrates that Open Society funding contributes significantly to anti-Israel campaigns in three important respects:

# Active in the [[Durban strategy]];
# Funding aimed at weakening United States support for Israel by shifting public opinion regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran;
# Funding for Israeli political opposition groups on the fringes of Israeli society, which use the rhetoric of human rights to advocate for marginal political goals."

The report concludes, "Yet, to what degree Soros, his family, and the Open Society Foundation are aware of the cumulative impact on Israel and of the political warfare conducted by many of their beneficiaries is an open question."<ref>[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/books/bad_investment_the_philanthropy_of_george_soros_and_the_arab_israeli_conflict/ ''Bad Investment: The Philanthropy of George Soros and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: How Soros-funded Groups Increase Tensions in a Troubled Region''], Alexander H. Joffe, Professor Gerald M. Steinberg, May 1, 2013</ref>

In 2015, [[Russia]] banned the activities of the Open Society Foundations on its territory, declaring "It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the [[Russian Federation]] and the security of the state".<ref>Reuters.

November 30, 2015.</ref>

In 2017, Open Society Foundations and other NGOs that promote open government and help refugees have been targeted for crackdowns by authoritarian and populist governments who have been emboldened by encouraging signals from the [[Trump Administration]]. Several politicians in eastern Europe, including [[Liviu Dragnea]] in [[Romania]] and typically right-wing figures [[Szilard Nemeth (politician)|Szilard Nemeth]]  in [[Hungary]], [[Republic of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]]'s [[Nikola Gruevski]], who called for a "de-Sorosization" of society, and [[Poland]]'s [[Jaroslaw Kaczynski]], who has said that Soros-funded groups want "societies without identity", regard many of the NGO groups to be irritants at best, and threats at worst.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|title=After Trump Win, Anti-Soros Forces Are Emboldened in Eastern Europe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/europe/after-trump-win-anti-soros-forces-are-emboldened-in-eastern-europe.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 3, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=March 1, 2017}}</ref> Some of those Soros-funded advocacy groups in the region say the renewed attacks are harassment and intimidation, which became more open after the election of [[Donald Trump]] in the United States. Stefania Kapronczay of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, which receives half of its funding from Soros-backed foundations, claims that Hungarian officials are "testing the waters" in an effort to see "what they can get away with."<ref name="NYT"/>

In May 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they will move its office from Budapest to [[Berlin]], amid Hungarian government interference.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/george-soros-foundation-close-office-repressive-hungary-180515160314017.html | title=George Soros foundation to close office in 'repressive' Hungary |work=al Jazeera}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44082976 | title=Soros foundation to leave Hungary| work=BBC News| date=May 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/15/soros-foundation-close-office-budapest-hungarian-governments/ | title=Soros foundation to close office in Budapest over Hungarian government's 'repressive' policies| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph| date=May 15, 2018}}</ref>

In November 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they are ceasing operations in [[Turkey]] and closing their [[İstanbul]] and [[Ankara]] offices due to "false accusations and speculations beyond measure", amid pressure from Turkish government and governmental interference through detainment of Turkish intellectuals and liberal academics claimed to be associated with the foundation and related NGOs, associations and programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Açık Toplum Vakfı Türkiye'deki faaliyetlerini sonlandırıyor |url=https://www.dw.com/tr/a%C3%A7%C4%B1k-toplum-vakf%C4%B1-t%C3%BCrkiyedeki-faaliyetlerini-sonland%C4%B1r%C4%B1yor/a-46457377 |accessdate=November 27, 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle Türkçe |date=November 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/soros-foundation-close-turkey-bashed-erdogan-181127061557606.html|title=Soros foundation to close in Turkey after being bashed by Erdogan|date=November 27, 2018|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/26/george-soross-open-society-foundation-to-pull-out-of-turkey|title=George Soros's Open Society Foundations to pull out of Turkey|last=Reuters|date=November 26, 2018|work=The Guardian}}</ref>
