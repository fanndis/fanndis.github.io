==History==
On December 11, 2015, [[DuPont (1802–2017)|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], commonly known as "DuPont", announced a merger with Dow Chemical Company, in an [[Stock swap|all-stock]] transaction. The combined company, DowDuPont, had an estimated value of $130 billion, being equally held by both companies’ shareholders, while also maintaining its two headquarters. The merger of the two largest U.S. chemical companies closed on August 31, 2017.<ref name="cne"/><ref name="miradio"/><ref name="blmberg">{{cite web |last1 = Kaskey |first1 = Jack |title = DuPont CEO Gives Investors Confidence Dow Deal Is on Track |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-24/dupont-earnings-top-estimates-on-sales-of-plastics-to-carmakers |work = Bloomberg |accessdate = June 2, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170901112201/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-24/dupont-earnings-top-estimates-on-sales-of-plastics-to-carmakers |archive-date = September 1, 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref>

Both companies' boards of directors decided that following the merger, DowDuPont would pursue a separation into three independent, publicly traded companies: an agriculture, a materials science, and a specialty products company.

The [[European Commission]] opened a probe to assess whether the proposed merger was in line with the EU's respective regulations.

Ed Breen said the companies were negotiating possible [[divestiture]]s in their [[pesticide]] operations to win approval for the deal.

==Reception==
According to former United States Secretary of Agriculture during the Clinton administration, [[Dan Glickman]], and former [[Governor of Nebraska]], [[Mike Johanns]], by creating a single, independent, U.S.-based and - owned pure agriculture company, Dow and DuPont would be able to compete against their still larger global peers.<ref name="Foreign Competition">{{cite web |last1 = GLICKMAN |first1 = Dan |last2 = JOHANNS |first2 = Mike |title = Bush, Clinton Ag Secretaries: U.S. Needs American Ag Company to Counter Foreign Competition |url = https://morningconsult.com/opinions/bush-clinton-ag-secretaries-u-s-needs-american-ag-company-counter-foreign-competition/ |website = Morning Consult |accessdate = June 2, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170901115211/https://morningconsult.com/opinions/bush-clinton-ag-secretaries-u-s-needs-american-ag-company-counter-foreign-competition/ |archive-date = September 1, 2017 |url-status = live }}</ref>

On the other hand, if [[Monsanto]] and [[Bayer]], the 1st and 3rd largest [[biotech]] and seed firms, together with Dow and DuPont being the 4th and 5th largest biotechnology and seed companies in the world respectively, both went through with the mergers, the so-called "Big Six" in the industry would control 63 percent of the global seed market and 76 percent of the global agriculture chemical market. They would also control 95 percent of corn, soybeans, and cotton traits in the US. Both duopolies would become the "big two" industry dominators.

The merger formed the world's largest chemical company in terms of sales.
