==Origin==

In 1982, [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], the long-time mayor of Los Angeles, ran as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Party's candidate for [[Governor of California]] against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[George Deukmejian]], who was white (of [[Armenian Americans|Armenian]] descent). Most polls in the final days before the election showed Bradley with a significant lead.<ref>Nelson, Colleen McCain. (August 10, 2002).

However, despite winning a majority of the votes cast on election day, [[California gubernatorial election, 1982|Bradley narrowly lost the overall race]] once absentee ballots were included.<ref name="tarrance"/> Post-election research indicated that a smaller percentage of white voters actually voted for Bradley than polls had predicted, and that previously undecided voters had voted for Deukmejian in statistically anomalous numbers.<ref name=Reddy20020120 /><ref>Rojas, Aurelio.

A month prior to the election, Bill Roberts, Deukmejian's campaign manager, predicted that white voters would break for his candidate. He told reporters that he expected Deukmejian to receive approximately 5 percent more votes than polling numbers indicated because white voters were giving inaccurate polling responses to conceal the appearance of racial prejudice. Deukmejian disavowed Roberts's comments, and Roberts resigned his post as campaign manager.<ref>(1982, October 13).

Henry researched the election in its aftermath and, in a 1983 study, reached the controversial conclusion that race was the most likely factor in Bradley's defeat.  However, one critic of the Bradley effect theory has charged that [[Mervin Field]] of The Field Poll had already offered the theory as explanation for his poll's errors, suggesting it (without providing supporting data for the claim) on the day after the election.<ref name="tarrance"/> [[Ken Khachigian]], a senior strategist and day-to-day tactician in Deukmejian's 1982 campaign, has noted that Field's final pre-election poll was badly timed, since it was taken over the weekend, and most late polls failed to register a surge in support for Deukmejian in the campaign's final two weeks.<ref>[[Ken Khachigian]].

In short, Khachigian argues, the "Bradley effect" was simply an attempt to come up with an excuse for what was really the result of flawed opinion polling practices.<ref>Kachigian, ''op. cit.''</ref>

Other elections which have been cited as possible demonstrations of the Bradley effect include the 1983 race for [[Mayor of Chicago]], the 1988 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election|primary]] race in [[Wisconsin]] for President of the United States, and the 1989 race for [[Mayor of New York City]].<ref name=Keeler020707 /><ref name=Polman>Polman, Dick. (January 21, 2007). "[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/dick_polman/6275597.html Barack Obama's race seems to be a second-tier issue]", ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', "The American Debate"<br>"One can also argue, however, that the wind at Obama's back might not be nearly as strong as it seems. Despite the fact that Americans seem downright bullish about backing a qualified black presidential candidate – in a December Newsweek poll, 93 percent said they would vote for such a person – there is also the nagging possibility that a lot of people don't really mean it, that they merely want to sound PC when the pollster calls.<br>
There's even a name for this kind of behavior. Actually, several names. 'The Bradley effect' is named for black Democrat Tom Bradley, who ran for governor of California in 1982 after serving as mayor of Los Angeles. Whites told pollsters they were pro-Bradley, but on election day they voted for the white Republican, costing Bradley the race. Then there is the 'Wilder effect,' named for black Virginia Democrat Doug Wilder. While running for governor in 1989, he was thought to be ahead by 10 percentage points, buoyed by a big white vote. But in the end, he won in a squeaker because most white voters bailed out.<br>
Jesse Jackson had a similar experience in 1988. As a presidential candidate, he was supposedly cruising toward a primary season win in heavily white Wisconsin. But what the white Democratic voters had told the pollsters, and what they actually did, turned out to be very different, and Jackson was beaten. Colin Powell was well-aware of this syndrome when he was weighing a candidacy in 1995; a friend reportedly warned him, 'When they go in the booth, they ain't going to vote for you.'<br>
Some analysts have assumed that the same syndrome helped doom Harold Ford Jr., the black Democrat who lost a Senate race in Tennessee in November by only three percentage points; indeed, he was apparently hurt by a GOP TV ad that implied he partied with white girls. The facts, however, suggest otherwise. His projected share of the white vote, as measured by the pre-election polls, closely tracked his share on election day."</ref><ref>[[John Derbyshire|Derbyshire, John]]. (May 15, 2007).

The common conclusion of the pollsters was that race is such a charged issue in the U.S.A. that people will lie about their intentions to vote for a black candidate all the way to the voting booth."</ref>

The 1983 race in Chicago featured a black candidate, [[Harold Washington]], running against a white candidate, [[Bernard Epton]]. More so than the California governor's race the year before,<ref>[[Jack Citrin|Citrin, Jack]] and Donald Philip Green and David O. Sears. (Spring, 1990).

In the 1988 Democratic presidential primary in Wisconsin, pre-election polls pegged black candidate [[Jesse Jackson]]—at the time, a legitimate challenger to white candidate and frontrunner [[Michael Dukakis]]—as likely to receive approximately one-third of the white vote.<ref>Peterson, Bill.

In the 1989 race for Mayor of New York, a poll conducted just over a week before the election showed black candidate [[David Dinkins]] holding an 18-point lead over white candidate [[Rudy Giuliani]].  Four days before the election, a new poll showed that lead to have shrunk, but still standing at 14 points.

Similar voter behavior was noted in the 1989 race for [[Governor of Virginia]] between Democrat [[L. Douglas Wilder]], an African-American, and Republican [[Marshall Coleman]], who was white.

==Possible diminished effects==

Analyses of recent elections suggest that there may be some evidence of a diminution in the 'Bradley Effect'. However at this stage such evidence is too limited to confirm a trend.

===2003 Louisiana gubernatorial election===
A few analysts, such as political commentator and ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' editor [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]], attributed the four-point loss by Indian American candidate [[Bobby Jindal]] in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2003|2003 Louisiana gubernatorial runoff election]] to the Bradley effect.  In making his argument, Barnes mentioned polls that had shown Jindal with a lead.<ref>Barnes, Fred. (November 17, 2003). "[http://www.weeklystandard.com/content/public/articles/000/000/003/391lpcdh.asp The Wilder Effect]", ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''<br>"Why did Jindal lose after leading his Democratic opponent, Kathleen Blanco, in statewide polls in the weeks before the election? In a word, race. What occurred was the 'Wilder effect,' named after the black Virginia governor elected in 1989. Wilder, a Democrat, polled well, then won narrowly. Many white voters, it turned out, said they intended to vote for a black candidate when they really didn't.

==Exit polling==

Inaccurate polling statistics attributed to the Bradley effect are not limited to pre-election polls.  In the initial hours after voting concluded in the Bradley-Deukmejian race in 1982, similarly inaccurate exit polls led some news organizations to project Bradley to have won.<ref>Henry, William A.

Indeed, the Los Angeles Times ran a frontpage story on election morning about the lineup of local politicians vying to succeed Bradley as the city's mayor. The San Francisco Chronicle's first election extra bannered: BRADLEY WIN PROJECTED. While ABC was predicting Deukmejian's victory, its affiliate stations in Los Angeles and San Francisco were using exit polls of their own to call the race for Bradley instead."

Republican pollster [[V.

==Causes==
The causes of the polling errors are debated, but pollsters generally believe that perceived societal pressures have led some white voters to be less than forthcoming in their poll responses.  These voters supposedly have harbored a concern that declaring their support for a white candidate over a non-white candidate will create a perception that the voter is racially prejudiced.<ref name=Rowland20061112>Rowland, Ashley.

'The support for Jackson was less when white respondents talked to white interviewers.'"<br>"Writing in The Polling Report, Mr. Brodnitz said the race of the interviewer was not a factor in their polling in 2006. Mr. Brodnitz said that problems in the final pre-election public polls had nothing to do with race, but were caused by methodology.

Brodnitz contends that the public polling in the Ford race and perhaps the earlier errors in races with black candidates can be attributed in part to polling not taking full account of the types of voters who make their decisions very late in campaigns. He said those voters tended to be older married white women who were either political moderates or conservatives."</ref>

[[Andrew Kohut]], who was the president of [[Gallup Organization|the Gallup Organization]] during the 1989 Dinkins/Giuliani race and later president of the [[Pew Research Center]], which conducted research into the phenomenon, has suggested that the discrepancies may arise, not from white participants giving false answers, but rather from white voters who have negative opinions of blacks being less likely to participate in polling at all than white voters who do not share such negative sentiments with regard to blacks.<ref>Kohut, Andrew.

In 1989, as a Gallup pollster, I overestimated the support for David Dinkins in his first race for New York City mayor against Rudolph Giuliani; Mr. Dinkins was elected, but with a two percentage point margin of victory, not the 15 I had predicted. I concluded, eventually, that I got it wrong not so much because respondents were lying to our interviewers but because poorer, less well-educated voters were less likely to agree to answer our questions. That was a decisive factor in my miscall."</ref><ref>Holmes, Stephen A. (October 12, 2008).

'The refusals come from the same class of people who tend to be the most racially intolerant.'"</ref>

While there is widespread belief in a racial component as at least a partial explanation for the polling inaccuracies in the elections in question, it is not universally accepted that this is the primary factor. Peter Brodnitz, a pollster and contributor to the newsletter ''The Polling Report'', worked on the 2006 campaign of black [[U.S. Senate]] candidate [[Harold Ford, Jr.]], and contrary to Edelman's findings in 1988, Brodnitz indicated that he did not find the race of the interviewer to be a factor in voter responses in pre-election polls.  Brodnitz suggested that late-deciding voters tend to have moderate-to-[[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] political opinions and that this may account in part for last-minute decision-makers breaking largely away from black candidates, who have generally been more [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]] than their white opponents in the elections in question.<ref name=Elder /> Another prominent skeptic of the Bradley effect is Gary Langer, the director of polling for [[ABC News]]. Langer has described the Bradley effect as "a theory in search of data." He has argued that inconsistency of its appearance, particularly in more recent elections, casts doubt upon its validity as a theory.<ref name=Koppelman>Koppelman, Alex. (January 24, 2008). "[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/01/24/white_voters/ Will whites vote for Barack Obama?]", ''[[Salon.com]]''<br />"'The argument of a specific Bradley effect,' insisted Langer, 'still looks to me to like a theory in search of data ...

And I don't know how to understand its absence in so many other black-white races – five [Senate and governors'] races in 2006 alone, as I note – in which pre-election polling was dead on.'<br />
'Newton's Law of Gravity doesn't just work on Thursdays,' Langer said. 'You want an effect to be clearly established as an effect through analysis of empirical data, and maybe in more than one election. And to call it an effect you want it to be a consistent effect, or to explain its inconsistency'".</ref><ref name="Siddique">{{cite news |first=Haroon |last=Siddique |title=Did racist voters cost Obama the primary? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uselections08/barackobama/story/0,,2237808,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=January 9, 2008 |accessdate=January 9, 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

Of all of the races presented as possible examples of the Bradley effect theory, perhaps the one most fiercely rebutted by the theory's critics is the 1982 Bradley/Deukmejian contest itself. People involved with both campaigns, as well as those involved with the inaccurate polls have refuted the significance of the Bradley effect in determining that election's outcome. Former ''Los Angeles Times'' reporter Joe Mathews said that he talked to more than a dozen people who played significant roles in either the Bradley or Deukmejian campaign and that only two felt there was a significant race-based component to the polling failures.<ref name="Mathews">Mathews, Joe (2009) "[http://www.bepress.com/cjpp/vol1/iss1/27 The Bradley Effect Was about Guns, Not Racism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925002118/http://www.bepress.com/cjpp/vol1/iss1/27 |date=September 25, 2009 }}" ''California Journal of Politics and Policy'': Vol. 1 : Iss. 1, Article 27.

"While the 1982 California gubernatorial contest is not the only race where the race of the candidate has been thought to be a factor in polling gone awry, there are a number of other reasons why the Field Poll may not have been accurate. I spoke with Mark DiCamillo, Director of the Field Poll—whose phone has been ringing off the hook about this today. He told me that there was a memo done by the polling organization shortly after the election to try to understand what had occurred (not available online as it predated the internet) that identified four possible factors:<br>
1. A late shift in voter preference after the poll, which could have reflected bias.<br>
2. A well organized GOP absentee ballot program (Bradley won the day of election results).<br>
3. The presence of a handgun initiative on the same ballot that brought out a skewed electorate different from the model used to predict likely voters.<br>
4. Lower turnout by minorities because Bradley did not turn out the base of black voters.</ref>

Prominent Republican pollster [[V. Lance Tarrance, Jr.]] flatly denies that the Bradley effect occurred during that election, echoing the absentee ballot factor cited by DiCamillo.<ref name="tarrance"/> Tarrance also reports that his own firm's pre-election polls done for the Deukmejian campaign showed the race as having closed from a wide lead for Bradley one month prior to the election down to a statistical dead heat by the day of the election. While acknowledging that some news sources projected a Bradley victory based upon Field Poll exit polls which were also inaccurate, he counters that at the same time, other news sources were able to correctly predict Deukmejian's victory by using other exit polls that were more accurate. Tarrance claims that The Field Poll speculated, without supplying supporting data, in offering the Bradley effect theory as an explanation for why its polling had failed, and he attributes the emergence of the Bradley effect theory to media outlets focusing on this, while ignoring that there were other conflicting polls which had been correct all along.<ref name="tarrance"/>

Sal Russo, a consultant for Deukmejian in the race, has said that another private pollster working for the campaign, Lawrence Research, also accurately captured the late surge in favor of Deukmejian, polling as late as the night before the election.  According to Russo, that firm's prediction after its final poll was an extremely narrow victory for Deukmejian.  He asserts that the failure of pre-election polls such as The Field Poll arose, largely because they stopped polling too soon, and that the failure of the exit polls was due to their inability to account for absentee ballots.<ref>Russo, Sal. (October 20, 2008). "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122446015501248689?mod=googlenews_wsj Tom Bradley Didn't Lose Because of Race]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''<br>
"Private, daily tracking polls showed that, with a retooled campaign, Mr. Deukmejian methodically closed the gap. On the Sunday night before the day of the election—usually the last day of tracking polls the campaign will pay for—Mr. Deukmejian had closed to less than two percentage points. The campaign polled Monday night, too. It showed Mr. Deukmejian less than 1% behind. Private pollster Lawrence Research predicted to the campaign a razor-thin victory—exactly what happened.

The public polls stopped polling too soon, missing the Deukmejian surge. Most important, they ignored the absentee ballot. Mr. Deukmejian's polling asked if people had voted absentee; other polls, including the exit polls, did not."</ref>

Blair Levin, a staffer on the Bradley campaign in 1982 said that as he reviewed early returns at a Bradley hotel on election night, he saw that Deukmejian would probably win.  In those early returns, he had taken particular note of the high number of absentee ballots, as well as a higher-than-expected turnout in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] by conservative voters who had been mobilized to defeat the handgun ballot initiative mentioned by DiCamillo.  According to Levin, even as he heard the "victory" celebration going on among Bradley supporters downstairs, those returns had led him to the conclusion that Bradley was likely to lose.<ref>Levin, Blair. (October 19, 2008). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/opinion/20levin.html?em What Bradley Effect?]", ''[[The New York Times]]''<br>
"On election night in 1982, with 3,000 supporters celebrating prematurely at a downtown hotel, I was upstairs reviewing early results that suggested Bradley would probably lose.

But he wasn't losing because of race. He was losing because an unpopular gun control initiative and an aggressive Republican absentee ballot program generated hundreds of thousands of Republican votes no pollster anticipated, giving Mr. Deukmejian a narrow victory.

Hopkins, a post-doctoral fellow in [[Harvard University]]'s Department of Government, which sought to determine whether the Bradley effect theory was valid, and whether an analogous phenomenon might be observed in races between a female candidate and a male candidate.  Hopkins analyzed data from 133 elections between 1989 and 2006, compared the results of those elections to the corresponding pre-election poll numbers, and considered some of the alternate explanations which have been offered for any discrepancies therein. The study concluded finally that the Bradley effect was a real phenomenon, amounting to a median gap of 3.1 percentage points before 1996, but that it was likely not the sole factor in those discrepancies, and further that it had ceased to manifest itself at all by 1996. The study also suggested a connection between the Bradley effect and the level of racial rhetoric exhibited in the discussion of the political issues of the day.  It asserted that the timing of the disappearance of the Bradley effect coincided with that of a decrease in such rhetoric in American politics over such potentially racially charged issues as crime and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]].  The study found no evidence of a corresponding effect based upon gender – in fact, female Senate candidates received on average 1.2 percentage points more votes than polls had predicted.<ref name=Hopkins>{{cite journal

After the [[Super Tuesday]] primaries of February 5, 2008, [[political science]] researchers from the [[University of Washington]] found trends suggesting the possibility that with regard to Obama, the effect's presence or absence may be dependent on the percentage of the electorate that is black. The researchers noted that to that point in the election season, opinion polls taken just prior to an election tended to overestimate Obama in states with a black population below eight percent, to track him within the polls' margins of error in states with a black population between ten and twenty percent, and to underestimate him in states with a black population exceeding twenty-five percent. The first finding suggested the possibility of the Bradley effect, while the last finding suggested the possibility of a "reverse" Bradley effect in which black voters might have been reluctant to declare to pollsters their support for Obama or are underpolled. For example, many general election polls in North Carolina and Virginia assume that black voters will be 15% to 20% of each state's electorate; they were around a quarter of each state's electorate in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southernpoliticalreport.com/downloads/uploaded/56_InsiderAdvantage%20Majority%20Opinion%20Research%20NC%20Pres%20Poll%20Cross-Tabulations%208%2019%2008%20rev.pdf |title=North Carolina Presidential Election Poll |date=August 19, 2008 |work=InsiderAdvantage/Majority Opinion Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909214605/http://www.southernpoliticalreport.com/downloads/uploaded/56_InsiderAdvantage%20Majority%20Opinion%20Research%20NC%20Pres%20Poll%20Cross-Tabulations%208%2019%2008%20rev.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nccivitas.org/files/NCPRESIDENT-CT-808.pdf |title=North Carolina Statewide Survey Research Report |date=August 18, 2008 |work=Tel Opinion Research, LLC |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909214601/http://www.nccivitas.org/files/NCPRESIDENT-CT-808.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref><!-- Examples of polls where blacks were between 15% and 20% of those polled for a North Carolina poll, despite being around 25% or North Carolina voters in 2004. --> That high support effect has been attributed to high black voter turnout in those states' primaries, with blacks supporting Obama by margins that often exceeded 97%.

On average, Obama received three percentage points more support in the primaries and caucuses than he did during polling; however, he also had a strong ground campaign, and many polls do not question voters with only cell phones, who are predominantly young.<ref name=Blumenthal>Blumenthal, Mark. (July 3, 2007). "[http://www.pollster.com/blogs/cell_phones_and_political_surv.php Cell Phones and Political Surveys: Part 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830013848/http://www.pollster.com/blogs/cell_phones_and_political_surv.php |date=August 30, 2008 }}", Pollster.com</ref>

Obama went on to win the election with 53% of the popular vote and a large electoral college victory.

Following the 2008 presidential election, a number of news sources reported that the result confirmed the absence of a 'Bradley Effect' in view of the close correlation between the pre-election polls and the actual share of the popular vote.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/07/politics/main4581355.shtml | publisher=CBS News | title=Poll Data Doesn't Reflect Bradley Effect | date=November 7, 2008}}</ref>

However, it has been suggested that such assumptions based on the overall share of the vote are too simplistic because they ignore the fact that underlying factors can be contradictory and hence masked in overall voting figures.  For instance, it has been suggested that an extant Bradley Effect was masked by the unusually high turnout amongst African Americans and other Democratic leaning voter groups under the unique circumstances of the 2008 election (i.e. the first serious bid for President by an African-American candidate).<ref name="aslan"/>

Although both candidates in the [[2016 United States presidential election]] were white, a similar phenomenon may have caused polls to inaccurately predict the election outcome.  According to major opinion polling, former [[United States Senator]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] was predicted<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polls-hillary-clinton-win_us_5821074ce4b0e80b02cc2a94|title=HuffPost Forecasts Hillary Clinton Will Win With 323 Electoral Votes|first=Natalie|last=Jackson|date=November 7, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 1, 2018|via=Huff Post}}</ref> to defeat businessman [[Donald Trump]]. Nevertheless, Trump won the key [[Rust Belt|Rust Belt states]] of [[United States presidential election in Ohio, 2016|Ohio]], [[United States presidential election in Michigan, 2016|Michigan]], [[United States presidential election in Pennsylvania, 2016|Pennsylvania]], and [[United States presidential election in Wisconsin, 2016|Wisconsin]], giving him more electoral votes than Secretary Clinton. [[Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016#Post election analysis|Post-election analysis]] of public opinion polling showed that Trump's base was larger than predicted, leading some experts to suggest that some "shy Trumpers" were hiding their preferences to avoid being seen as prejudiced by pollsters.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Connors |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Klar |first2=Samara |last3=Krupnikov |first3=Yanna |title=There may have been shy Trump supporters after all |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/12/there-may-have-been-shy-trump-supporters-after-all/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 March 2019 |work=The Monkey Cage |date=November 12, 2016}}</ref> There may have been also some cases in which male respondents were hiding their preferences to avoid being seen as [[sexism|sexist]], as Hillary Clinton was the first female major party candidate for President.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Connors |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Klar |first2=Samara |last3=Krupnikov |first3=Yanna |title=There may have been shy Trump supporters after all |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/12/there-may-have-been-shy-trump-supporters-after-all/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 March 2019 |work=The Monkey Cage |date=November 12, 2016}}</ref>

In a 2019 press conference, Trump estimated the effect to be between 6 and 10% in his favor. He described this effect as "I don’t know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way it is a compliment."<ref>{{cite news|url =https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/09/25/reporter_to_trump_why_is_it_appropriate_for_a_president_to_ask_a_foreign_leader_for_info_on_political_rival.html|title=Reporter to Trump: Why Is It Appropriate For A President To Ask A Foreign Leader For Info On Political Rival?|first =Ian|last= Schwartz|date= September 25, 2019|publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]]}}</ref>

However many pollsters have disputed this claim. A 2016 poll conducted by Morning Consult showed that Trump performed better in general election polls regardless of whether the poll was conducted online or by  live interviewer over the phone. This finding led Morning Consult's chief research officer to conclude that there was little evidence that poll respondents were feeling pressured to downplay their true general election preferences.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shepard |first1=Steven |title=Poll: 'Shy Trump' voters are a mirage |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/poll-shy-voters-trump-230667 |accessdate=4 March 2019 |work=Politico |date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> Harry Enten, an analyst for [[FiveThirtyEight.com]] noted that Trump generally underperformed his polling in Democratic-leaning states like California and New York — where the stigma against voting for Trump likely would have been stronger — and overperformed his polls in places like Wisconsin and Ohio. Enten concluded that, although Trump did better than the polls predicted in many states, he "didn’t do so in a pattern consistent with a 'shy Trump' effect".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Enten |first1=Harry |title='Shy' Voters Probably Aren't Why The Polls Missed Trump |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/shy-voters-probably-arent-why-the-polls-missed-trump/ |website=fivethirtyeight.com |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>

The Bradley effect–as well a variant of the so-called [[shy Tory factor]] that involves prospective voters' expressed intentions to vote for candidates belonging to the U.S. Republican Party–reportedly skewed a number of opinion polls running up to the 2018 U.S. elections.<ref>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/11/10/pollster_who_got_it_right_in_2016_does_it_again_138621.html</ref> Notably, the effect was arguably present in the [[2018 Florida gubernatorial election|Florida gubernatorial election]] between black Democrat [[Andrew Gillum]], the mayor of [[Tallahassee]], and white Republican [[Ron DeSantis]], a U.S. Congressman.
