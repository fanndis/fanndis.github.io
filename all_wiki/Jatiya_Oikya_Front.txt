==Background==

With the Grand Alliance Victory in 2008, an [[Awami League]]-led government took charge in January 2009, and abolished the caretaker government system that used to oversee the national elections since 1991.

===Abolishment of caretaker government===
{{main|Caretaker government of Bangladesh}}
Though the election, through which [[Awami League]] and their allies got elected, was conducted by an election-time technocrat [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]], the government abolished the system in 2011 following a court verdict that declared the thirteenth amendment of the constitution illegal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Caretaker system abolished|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-192303| newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The abolishment of an agreed system to oversee the national election enraged the opposition groups who boycotted the general election in 2014 and took streets demanding the restoration of the caretaker government system to oversee the election. When the government started suppressing the opposition movement, they retaliated violently that caused death to no less than three-hundred people across the country.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP’s 48-hour blockade begins|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/uncategorized/2013/11/26/bnps-48-hour-blockade-begins| newspaper=[[Dhaka Tribune]]|date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

===2014 national election===
In the election of 2014, only 12 of the 42 registered parties took part and 154 constituencies were left disenfranchised. The opposition leader of the parliament, [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] was placed under house arrest before the election that continued for another week.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh's bitter election boycott|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25588564| newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=3 January 2014}}</ref>

In March 2014, after months of turbulence, [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] called off the strike and urged to forge a national unity.<ref>{{cite news |title=Khaleda's call for national unity|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/khaledas-call-national-unity-1255708| newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=19 June 2016}}</ref>

Later, in 2015, [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] again enforced a country-wide blockade when their chairperson was not allowed to take part in a procession and put under house arrest in her office building. They demanded the restoration of neutral caretaker government system again, but to no avail.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladesh opposition leader Zia calls for blockade|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30678474| newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=5 January 2015}}</ref>

===Jatiya Oikya Prokriya floated===
In August 2016, against the backdrop of a political uncertainty, former foreign minister of Bangladesh government and eminent jurist Dr. [[Kamal Hossain]] floated the platform “Jatiya Oikya Prokriya” that loosely translates into [[National Unity Process]] in English.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kamal Hossain teams up GM Quader, Md Shahidullah and others to float new forum|url=http://archive.newagebd.net/247407/kamal-hossain-teams-gm-quader-md-shahidullah-others-float-new-forum/| newspaper=[[New Age (Bangladesh)]]|date=21 August 2016}}</ref>

The platform aimed at working to expedite a national unity among the battling political groups by reducing their differences by holding talks and seminars. Throughout 2016 to 2018, Oikya Prokriya held several seminars and invited leaders from prominent political parties aligned with the spirit of Bangladesh Liberation War.

On September 13, 2018, after months of talks Oikya Prokriya declared to work together with a newly formed political force led by former President Badruddoza Chowdhury of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh.

On September 22 of the same year, Jatiya Oikya Prokriya held a public rally at Dhaka. BNP, [[Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh|Bikalpadhara]], Nagorik Oikya, JSD, [[Gano Forum|Gono Forum]], [[Bangladesh Jatiya Party]] and some other parties shared the stage in the rally. They declared a four-point-demand in the rally. Also, a declaration to work from the same platform came from the podium that day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Greater unity taking shape|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/bnp-join-today-jatiya-oikya-prokriya-rally-1637062| newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=22 September 2018}}</ref>

==Formation==
Jatiya Oikya Prokriya spearheaded by Gono Forum arranged several meetings with BNP, Bikalpadhara, JSD and Nagorik Oikya from the last week of September to the second week of October.

Finally on October 13, 2018 the top-tier leaders of all the parties except Bikapadhara sat together and chalked out their demands and goals in a long meeting, and declared the emergence of Jatiyo Oikya Front (National Unity Front), through a press conference held at National Press Club.<ref>{{cite news |title=New alliance launched|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/politics/greater-national-unity-todays-meeting-cancelled-1646452| newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

Bikalpadhara parted ways from the front as their demands were not fully met.

==Demands and goals==
The front unanimously placed seven demands and eleven goals. The seven demands are placed to ensure a free, fair and credible election. While the eleven goals are the basic outline of how the front will run the government if elected. The front has a major focus on ensuring a balance of power among the ruling party and the opposition groups.

===Demands===

# To hold a free and fair election, the government must step down; parliament must be dissolved and an election-time neutral government must be formed following discussions. Khaleda Zia must be freed. The government must withdraw all cases against her and other BNP leaders and activists.

# Halt proceedings of all political cases between the announcement of the schedule and the election results. Police must not file any new case against politicians.
