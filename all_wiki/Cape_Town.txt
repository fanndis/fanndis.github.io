Located on the shore of [[Table Bay]], Cape Town, as [[History of Cape Town|the oldest urban area in South Africa]], was developed by the [[Dutch East India Company|United East India Company]] (VOC) as a supply station for Dutch ships sailing to [[East Africa]], [[India]], and the [[Far East]]. [[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s arrival on 6 April 1652 established the [[Dutch Cape Colony|VOC Cape Colony]], the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the [[Castle of Good Hope]], becoming the economic and cultural hub of the [[Cape Colony]]. Until the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the development of Johannesburg, Cape Town was the largest city in South Africa.

=== Early history ===
The earliest known remnants in the region were found at Peers Cave in [[Fish Hoek]] and date to between 15,000 and 12,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquityofman.com/Peers_Cave.html|title=The Antiquity of man|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|access-date=15 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301174424/http://www.antiquityofman.com/Peers_Cave.html|archive-date=1 March 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Little is known of the history of the region's first residents, since there is no written history from the area before it was first mentioned by [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1488 who was the first European to reach the area and named it "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas). It was later renamed by John II of Portugal as "Cape of Good Hope" (Cabo da Boa Esperança) because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to India and the East. [[Vasco da Gama]] recorded a sighting of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1497. In 1510, at the [[Battle of Salt River]], [[Francisco de Almeida]] and sixty-four of his men were killed and his party were defeated<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge history of South Africa: 1885-1994|last=Hamilton, Carolyn, (ed.)

The !Uriǁ’aekua were one of the so-called [[Khoekhoe]] clans of the area. In the late 16th century French, Danish, Dutch and English, but mainly Portuguese, ships regularly continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the [[East Indies|Indies]]. They traded tobacco, copper and iron with the [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]]-speaking clans of the region, in exchange for fresh meat and other provisions.

=== Dutch period ===
In 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and other employees of the [[Dutch East India Company|United East India Company]] ({{lang-nl|Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie}}, VOC) were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and the [[Fort de Goede Hoop]] (later replaced by the [[Castle of Good Hope]]). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the authorities to import slaves from [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]]. Many of these became ancestors of the first [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/2009/05/01/coloured-people-of-the-western-cape-have-the-most-diverse-ancestry-in-the-world/ |title=Cape-Slavery-Heritage " Coloured People of the Western Cape have the most Diverse Ancestry in the World :: iBlog |publisher=Cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za |date=1 May 2009 |access-date=17 March 2011}} {{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |title=Slavery and early colonisation, South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date=22 September 1927 |access-date=17 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109130722/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |archive-date=9 January 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Under Van Riebeeck and his successors as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape, an impressive range of useful plants were introduced to the Cape – in the process changing the natural environment forever. Some of these, including grapes, cereals, ground nuts, potatoes, apples and citrus, had an important and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region.<ref>Pooley, S. ‘Jan van Riebeeck as Pioneering Explorer and Conservator of Natural Resources at the Cape of Good Hope (1652–62),’ Environment and History 15 (2009): 3–33. {{doi|10.3197/096734009X404644}}</ref>

=== British period ===
The Dutch Republic being transformed in [[First French Republic|Revolutionary France's]] vassal [[Batavian Republic]], Great Britain moved to take control of its colonies. Britain captured Cape Town in 1795, but the Cape was returned to the Dutch by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]]. In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Cape Town was permanently ceded to the United Kingdom. It became the capital of the newly formed [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s. With expansion came calls for greater independence from the UK, with the Cape attaining [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|its own parliament]] (1854) and a locally accountable Prime Minister (1872). Suffrage was established according to the non-racial [[Cape Qualified Franchise]].<ref>{{cite web

In 1910, Britain established the [[Union of South Africa]], which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British [[colony of Natal]]. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the [[Republic of South Africa]].

This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the [[Cape Qualified Franchise|Cape's multiracial franchise]], as well as to the [[Group Areas Act]], which classified all areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of residents deemed unlawful by apartheid legislation or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was [[District Six, Cape Town|District Six]]. After it was declared a whites-only region in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|title=Recalling District Six|date=19 August 2003|access-date=13 June 2006|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65NcXVPzP?url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm|archive-date=11 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Many of these residents were relocated to the [[Cape Flats]]. Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a "[[Coloured]] labour preference area", to the exclusion of "[[Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa|Bantus]]", i.e. Africans. The implementation of this policy was widely opposed by trade unions, civil society and opposition parties. It is notable that this policy was not advocated for by any coloured political group, and its implementation was a unilateral decision by the apartheid government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.lib.uct.ac.za/coloured-labour-preference-area-policy-paper-presented-cape-western-region-national-conference-1983|title="The Coloured Labour Preference Area Policy"- Paper Presented by Cape Western Region to National Conference 1983|last=Sash|first=Black|date=1983-11-03|website=National texts, 1955-1994|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>

School students from Langa, Gugulethu and Nyanga in Cape Town reacted to the news of [[Soweto uprising|protests against Bantu Education in Soweto]] in June 1976 and organised gatherings and marches, which were met with resistance from the police.

Cape Town was home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. On [[Robben Island]], a former penitentiary island {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city, many famous political prisoners were held for years. In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, [[Nelson Mandela]] made his first public speech since his imprisonment, from the balcony of [[Cape Town City Hall]] hours after being released on 11 February 1990. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country, and the first [[South African general election, 1994|democratic election]], was held four years later, on 27 April 1994. Nobel Square in the [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]] features statues of South Africa's four [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winners: [[Albert Luthuli]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[F. W. de Klerk]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Ciudad del Cabo desde Cabeza de León, Sudáfrica, 2018-07-22, DD 20-23 PAN.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.65|Cape Town's "[[City Bowl]]" viewed from [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] in May (late autumn)]]
Cape Town is located at latitude 33.55° S (approx. the same as [[Sydney]] and [[Buenos Aires]] and equivalent to [[Casablanca]] and [[Los Angeles]] in the northern hemisphere) and longitude 18.25° E. Table Mountain, with its near vertical cliffs and flat-topped summit over {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and with [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] on either side, together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop enclosing the central area of Cape Town, the so-called [[City Bowl]]. A thin strip of cloud, known colloquially as the "tablecloth", sometimes forms on top of the mountain. To the immediate south, the Cape Peninsula is a scenic mountainous spine jutting {{convert|40|km}} southwards into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and terminating at Cape Point. There are over 70 peaks above {{Convert|300|m|abbr=on}} within Cape Town's official city limits.{{clarify|How are the city limits defined|date=September 2020}} Many of the city's suburbs lie on the large plain called the Cape Flats, which extends over {{convert|50|km|-1}} to the east and joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Town region is characterised by an extensive coastline, rugged mountain ranges, coastal plains, inland valleys and semi-desert fringes.
{{clear|left}}

=== Robben Island ===
[[UNESCO]] declared [[Robben Island]] in the Western Cape a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Africa|World Heritage Site]] in 1999. Robben Island is located in Table Bay, some {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} west of Bloubergstrand in Cape Town, and stands some 30m above sea level. Robben Island has been used as a prison where people were isolated, banished and exiled to for nearly 400 years. It was also used as a leper colony, a post office, a grazing ground, a mental hospital, and an outpost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/robben-island|title=Robben Island|date=14 July 2011|website=South African History Online|access-date=24 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401181709/https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/robben-island|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Visitors can only access the island via the [[Robben Island Museum]] boat service, which runs three times daily until the beginning of the peak season (1 September). The ferries depart from the Nelson Mandela Gateway at the [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront|V&A Waterfront]].

=== Climate ===

Cape Town has a warm [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] "Csb"),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Peter J.|last2=Henderson-Sellers|first2=Ann|title=Contemporary Climatology|year=1999|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|location=Harlow|isbn=9780582276314|page=123}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Rohli|first1=Robert V.|last2=Vega|first2=Anthony J.|title=Climatology|year=2011|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=9781449649548|page=250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhtZKBCv7NMC|access-date=27 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121014626/https://books.google.com/books?id=WhtZKBCv7NMC|archive-date=21 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cape Point (South Africa)|work=Global Atmosphere Watch Station Information System (GAWSIS)|publisher=Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss|url=http://gaw.empa.ch/gawsis/reports.asp?StationID=35|access-date=May 20, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827135620/http://gaw.empa.ch/gawsis/reports.asp?StationID=35|archive-date=August 27, 2013|quote=climate zone – Csb (Warm temperate climate with dry and warm summer)|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
with mild, moderately wet winters and dry, warm summers. Winter, which lasts from the beginning of June to the end of August, may see large cold fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and strong north-westerly winds. Winter months in the city average a maximum of {{convert|18|C|0}} and minimum of {{convert|8.5|C|0}}<ref name="WMO">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/035/c00138.htm |title=World Weather Information Service – Cape Town |access-date=May 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426062632/http://www.worldweather.org/035/c00138.htm |archive-date=26 April 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>
Total annual rainfall in the city averages {{convert|515|mm|in|1}} although in the southern suburbs, close to the mountains, rainfall is significantly higher and averages closer to 1000 millimetres (40&nbsp;in). Summer, which lasts from December to March, is warm and dry with an average maximum of {{convert|26|°C|0}} and minimum of {{convert|16|°C|0}}. The region can get uncomfortably hot when the [[Berg Wind]], meaning "mountain wind", blows from the [[Karoo]] interior for a couple of weeks in February or March. Spring and summer generally feature a strong wind from the south-east, known locally as the south-{{not a typo|easter}} or the [[Cape Doctor]], so called because it blows air pollution away. This wind is caused by a [[Pressure system#High-pressure system|high-pressure system]] which sits in the [[South Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] to the west of Cape Town, known as the [[South Atlantic High]]. Cape Town receives 3,100 hours of sunshine per year.<ref name=NOAA/>

Water temperatures range greatly, between {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic Seaboard, to over {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} in [[False Bay]]. Average annual Ocean temperatures are between {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as [[San Francisco]] or [[Big Sur]]), and {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}} in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as [[Nice]] or [[Monte Carlo]]).

Unlike other parts of the country the city does not have many [[thunderstorm]]s most of these storms happen around October to December and March to April.

This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is uniquely located at the convergence point of several different soil types and micro-climates.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Table Mountain has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape [[Fynbos]]. The main vegetation type is endangered [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]], but [[critically endangered]] [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Shale Renosterveld]] and [[Afromontane|Afromontane forest]] occur in smaller portions on the mountain.

Unfortunately, rapid [[population growth]] and [[Urbanisation|urban sprawl]] has covered much of these ecosystems with development. Consequently, Cape Town now has over 300 [[threatened]] plant species and 13 which are now [[extinct]]. The [[Cape Peninsula]], which lies entirely within the city of Cape Town, has the highest concentration of [[threatened species]] of any continental area of equivalent size in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perceval.bio.nau.edu/downloads/grail/climate_seminar/section2/Hannah_etal05.pdf |title=The View from The Cape: Extinction Risk, Protected Areas, and Climate Change |publisher=Perceval.bio.nau.edu |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825180525/http://perceval.bio.nau.edu/downloads/grail/climate_seminar/section2/Hannah_etal05.pdf |archivedate=25 August 2013}}</ref>

These geographic features in part divide the city into several commonly known groupings of suburbs (equivalent to districts outside South Africa), many of which developed historically together and share common attributes of language and culture.

=== City Bowl ===
{{Main|City Bowl}}
[[File:Cape Town City Aerial.jpg|thumb|An aerial panoramic of Cape Town's [[City Bowl]] taken from above [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]] looking north.]]

The City Bowl is a natural [[amphitheatre]]-shaped area bordered by Table Bay and defined by the mountains of [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]], [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]], Table Mountain and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]].

The area includes the central business district of Cape Town, the harbour, the [[Company's Garden]], and the residential suburbs of [[De Waterkant, Cape Town|De Waterkant]], [[Devil's Peak Estate|Devil's Peak]], [[District Six]], [[Zonnebloem]], [[Gardens, Cape Town|Gardens]], [[Bo-Kaap]], [[Higgovale, Cape Town|Higgovale]], [[Oranjezicht, Cape Town|Oranjezicht]], [[Schotsche Kloof, Cape Town|Schotsche Kloof]], [[Tamboerskloof]], [[University Estate, Cape Town|University Estate]], [[Vredehoek, Cape Town|Vredehoek]], [[Walmer Estate, Cape Town|Walmer Estate]] and [[Woodstock, Cape Town|Woodstock]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Safaris|first=Discover Africa|title=City Bowl {{!}} Everything to know {{!}} Discover Africa Safaris|url=https://www.discoverafrica.com/safaris/cape-town/city-bowl/|access-date=2020-07-03|website=www.discoverafrica.com|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Foreshore Freeway Bridge]] has stood in its unfinished state since construction officially ended in 1977. It was intended to be the Eastern Boulevard Highway in the city bowl, but is unfinished due to budget constraints.

=== Atlantic Seaboard ===
[[File:Hout Bay panorama.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Hout Bay]] from [[Chapman's Peak]], with Chapman's Peak Drive visible at the base of the mountain]]

The Atlantic Seaboard lies west of the City Bowl and Table Mountain, and is characterised by its beaches, cliffs, promenade and hillside communities. The area includes, from north to south, the neighbourhoods of [[Green Point, Cape Town|Green Point]], [[Mouille Point, Cape Town|Mouille Point]], [[Three Anchor Bay]], [[Sea Point]], [[Fresnaye, Cape Town|Fresnaye]], [[Bantry Bay, Cape Town|Bantry Bay]], [[Clifton, Cape Town|Clifton]], [[Camps Bay]], [[Llandudno, Cape Town|Llandudno]], and [[Hout Bay]]. The Atlantic Seaboard has some of the most expensive real estate in South Africa particularly on Nettleton and Clifton Roads in Clifton, Ocean View Drive and St Leon Avenue in Bantry Bay, Theresa Avenue in Bakoven and Fishermans Bend in Llandudno. Camps Bay is home to the highest concentration of multimillionaires in Cape Town and has the highest number of high-priced mansions in South Africa with more than 155 residential units exceeding R20&nbsp;million (or $US1.8&nbsp;million).{{when|date=September 2016}}<!-- the property value is useless without a date --><ref>{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Joan|title=Joburg has the cash, Cape Town the class|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/property/2014/01/15/joburg-has-the-cash-cape-town-the-class|work=BDLive|publisher=Business Day|access-date=15 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118092957/http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/property/2014/01/15/joburg-has-the-cash-cape-town-the-class|archive-date=18 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Cape Flats ===
{{Main|Cape Flats}}
The Cape Flats is an expansive, low-lying, flat area situated to the southeast of the city centre.

Due to the region having a [[Mediterranean climate]], the wettest months on the Cape Flats are from April to September, with 82% most of its rainfall occurring between these months. The rainfall patterns on the Cape Flats vary with longitude, such that the eastern parts get a minimum of 214mm per year and the central and western parts get 800mm per year. A significant portion of this water ends up in the Cape Flats Aquifer, which lie beneath the central and southern parts of the Cape Flats. Most of the land of the Cape Flats is used for residential areas, the majority of which are [[Suburb|formal]], but with several [[Shanty town|informal settlements]] present. Light [[Industrial park|industrial areas]] are also found in the area. A part of the land in the south-east is used for [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and contains many [[smallholding]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwa.gov.za/Documents/Other/WMA/19/Reports/Rep9-Vol5-GW%20Cape%20Flats%20Aquifer.pdf|title=Groundwater Model Report Vol. 5 Cape Flats Aquifer Model|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Water Affairs |access-date=}} {{dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

=== Helderberg ===
{{Main|Helderberg}}The Helderberg is a small region in the [[City of Cape Town|Cape Town Metropolitan area]] and is located on the north-eastern corner of False Bay. It consists of [[Somerset West]], [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]], [[Gordons Bay]] and a few other suburbs which were previously towns in the Helderberg district. The district takes its name from the imposing [[Helderberg Mountain]], which reaches a height of {{convert|1,137|m|lk=out|abbr=off}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Helderberg {{!}} Bayview Helderberg|url=https://www.bayviewhelderberg.co.za/about-helderberg/#:~:text=The%20Helderberg%20is%20made%20up,of%201137m%20at%20The%20Dome.|access-date=2020-09-30|website=www.bayviewhelderberg.co.za}}</ref>

== Government ==
{{Main|City of Cape Town}}
Cape Town is governed by a 231-member city council elected in a system of [[mixed-member proportional representation]]. The city is divided into 116 [[ward (South Africa)|wards]], each of which elects a councillor by [[first-past-the-post voting]]. The remaining 115 councillors are elected from [[party list]]s so that the total number of councillors for each party is proportional to the number of votes received by that party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Piombo|first=J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbTFAAAAQBAJ&q=%22cape+town%22+councillor+election+%22party+lists%22+first-past-the-post&pg=PA203|title=Institutions, Ethnicity, and Political Mobilization in South Africa|date=2009-08-03|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-62382-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Anciano|first1=Fiona|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yVxDwAAQBAJ&q=%22cape+town%22+116+wards&pg=PT51|title=Democracy Disconnected: Participation and Governance in a City of the South|last2=Piper|first2=Laurence|date=2018-10-03|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-79429-2|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Cape Town International Convention Centre.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]]]]
Cape Town is the economic hub of the [[Western Cape]] province, [[South Africa]]'s second main economic centre and [[Africa]]'s third main economic hub city. It serves as the regional manufacturing centre in the Western Cape. In 2011 the city's GDP was [[American dollar|US$]]56.8&nbsp;billion with a [[GDP per capita]] of US$15,721.<ref name="brookingsgdp"/> In the five years preceding 2014 Cape Town GDP grew at an average of 3.7% a year. As a proportion of GDP, the agriculture and manufacturing sectors have declined whilst finance, business services, transport and logistics have grown reflecting the growth in specialised services sectors of the local economy. Fishing, clothing and textiles, wood product manufacturing, electronics, furniture, hospitality, finance and business services are industries in which Cape Town's economy has the largest [[comparative advantage]].<ref name="edp"/>

Between 2001 and 2010 the city's [[Gini coefficient]], a measure of inequality, improved by dropping from 0.59 in 2007 to 0.57 in 2010<ref name="edp"/> only to increase to 0.58 by 2017.<ref name=":0" /> The city has the lowest rate of inequality in South Africa.<ref name=":1" />

Cape Town has recently enjoyed a booming real estate and construction market, because of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] as well as many people buying summer homes in the city or relocating there permanently. Cape Town hosted nine World Cup matches: Six first-round matches, one second-round match, one quarter final and one semifinal. The central business district is under an extensive urban renewal programme, with numerous new buildings and renovations taking place under the guidance of the [[Cape Town Partnership]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://capetownattractions.com/cape-town-guide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810021201/http://capetownattractions.com/cape-town-guide|url-status=dead|title=Cape Town Guide|archivedate=10 August 2015|website=capetownattractions.com}}</ref>

== Tourism ==
Cape Town is not only a popular international tourist destination in [[South Africa]], but [[Africa]] as a whole. This is due to its mild climate, natural setting, and well-developed infrastructure. The city has several well-known natural features that attract tourists, most notably [[Table Mountain]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecape.org/|title=Table Mountain Aerial Cableway|access-date=21 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218093401/http://thecape.org/|archive-date=18 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> which forms a large part of the [[Table Mountain National Park]] and is the back end of the [[City Bowl, Cape Town|City Bowl]]. Reaching the top of the mountain can be achieved either by hiking up, or by taking the [[Table Mountain Cableway]]. [[Cape Point]] is recognised as the dramatic headland at the end of the [[Cape Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capepoint.co.za |title=Cape Point |publisher=Cape Point |date= |access-date=1 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928071905/http://www.capepoint.co.za/ |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Many tourists also drive along [[Chapman's Peak|Chapman's Peak Drive]], a narrow road that links [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]] with [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]], for the views of the Atlantic Ocean and nearby mountains.

[[File:Clifton Beachs.jpg|thumb|[[Clifton, Cape Town|Clifton Beach]] is one of Cape Town's most famous beaches and is a significant tourist destination in its own right.]]

Though the Cape's water ranges from cold to mild, the difference between the two sides of the city is dramatic. While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual water temperatures barely above that of coastal California around {{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, the [[False Bay]] coast is much warmer, averaging between {{convert|16|and|17|C|F}} annually. This is similar to water temperatures in much of the Northern [[Mediterranean]] (for example [[Nice]]). In summer, False Bay water averages slightly over {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} a common high. Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have very cold water due to the [[Benguela current]] which originates from the [[Southern Ocean]], whilst the water at False Bay beaches may be warmer by up to {{convert|10|C-change|0}} at the same moment due to the influence of the warm [[Agulhas Current|Agulhas current]].<ref name="CTbeaches"/>{{failed verification|date=May 2019}} It is a common misconception that False Bay is part of the Indian Ocean, with Cape Point being both the meeting point of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, and the southernmost tip of Africa. The oceans in fact meet at the actual southernmost tip, [[Cape Agulhas]], which lies approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the south east. The misconception is fuelled by the relative warmth of the False Bay water to the Atlantic Seaboard water, and the many confusing instances of "Two Oceans" in names synonymous with Cape Town, such as the [[Two Oceans Marathon]], the [[Two Oceans Aquarium]], and places such as Two Oceans wine farm.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Cape Town's most popular sports by participation are [[cricket]], [[association football]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[rugby union]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Woulidge|first = Sam|title = Time Out: Cape Town|year = 2006|publisher = Time Out Publishing|isbn = 1-904978-12-6|pages = 127–130: Sports}}</ref> In rugby union, Cape Town is the home of the [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province]] side, who play at [[Newlands Stadium]] and compete in the [[Currie Cup]]. In addition, Western Province players (along with some from Wellington's [[Boland Cavaliers]]) comprise the [[Stormers]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]'s [[Super Rugby]] competition. Cape Town also regularly hosts the national team, the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]], and hosted matches during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], including the opening ceremony and game, as well as the semi-final between [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]] that saw [[Jonah Lomu]] run in four tries.

[[Association football]], which is also known as ''soccer'' in South Africa, is also popular. Two [[Football club|clubs]] from Cape Town play in the [[Premier Soccer League]] (PSL), South Africa's premier league. These teams are [[Ajax Cape Town]], which formed as a result of the 1999 amalgamation of the [[Seven Stars (South African Soccer Club)|Seven Stars]] and the [[Cape Town Spurs]] and resurrected [[Cape Town City F.C. (2016)|Cape Town City F.C.]] Cape Town was also the location of several of the matches of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|FIFA 2010 World Cup]] including a semi-final,<ref name="southafrica.info">{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/2010/2010-faq.htm|title=SA 2010: frequent questions|publisher=southafrica.info|access-date=26 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603155707/http://www.southafrica.info/2010/2010-faq.htm|archive-date=3 June 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> held in South Africa.

They take part in the [[Supersport Series|Supersport]] and [[Standard Bank Cup Series]]. The Newlands Cricket Ground regularly hosts international matches.

Cape Town has had Olympic aspirations. For example, in 1996, Cape Town was one of the five candidate cities shortlisted by the [[IOC]] to launch official candidatures to host the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although the Games ultimately went to [[Athens]], Cape Town came in third place. There has been some speculation that Cape Town was seeking the South African Olympic Committee's nomination to be South Africa's bid city for the [[2020 Summer Olympic Games]].<ref>[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=5&id=1049905279 South Africa Announces Bid For 2020 Summer Olympic Games] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613004431/http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=5&id=1049905279 |date=13 June 2008}}, Gamesbids.com</ref> That however was quashed when the [[International Olympic Committee]] awarded the 2020 Games to Tokyo.

=== Tertiary education ===
[[File:UCT Upper Campus landscape view.jpg|thumb|[[University of Cape Town]]'s main campus]]
Cape Town has a well-developed higher system of [[public university|public universities]]. Cape Town is served by three public universities: the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT), the [[University of the Western Cape]] (UWC) and the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]] (CPUT). [[Stellenbosch University]], while not in the city itself, is 50&nbsp;kilometres from the City Bowl and has additional campuses, such as the Tygerberg Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Bellville Business Park closer to the city.

Both the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University are leading universities in South Africa. This is due in large part to substantial financial contributions made to these institutions by both the public and private sector. UCT is an English-speaking institution. It has over 21,000 students and has an MBA programme that was ranked 51st by the Financial Times in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/pdf/compete.zip |title=Competitiveness factors |publisher=City of Cape Town |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927091123/http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/pdf/compete.zip |archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref> It is also the top-ranked university in Africa, being the only African university to make the world's Top 200 university list at number 146.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university/98/university-of-cape-town |title=University of cape town |publisher=Top Universities |date=12 November 2009 |access-date=2 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220022353/http://www.topuniversities.com/university/98/university-of-cape-town |archivedate=20 February 2010}}</ref> Since the [[African National Congress]] has become the country's ruling party, some restructuring of Western Cape universities has taken place and as such, traditionally non-white universities have seen increased financing, which has evidently benefitted the University of the Western Cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.at/heritage/society/index.htm|title=Cape Town Society|publisher=CapeConnected|access-date=14 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928033036/http://www.capetown.at/heritage/society/index.htm|archive-date=28 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/01/20/PAGE7.HTM |title=Education Cosas critical of education funding |publisher=Dispatch Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224155137/http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/01/20/PAGE7.HTM |archivedate=24 December 2007}}</ref>

The Cape Peninsula University of Technology was formed on 1 January 2005, when two separate institutions – [[Cape Technikon]] and [[Peninsula Technikon]] – were merged. The new university offers education primarily in English, although one may take courses in any of South Africa's official languages. The institution generally awards the [[National Diploma (South Africa)|National Diploma]].

Students from the universities and high schools are involved in the South African [[SEDS]], Students for the Exploration and Development of Space. This is the South African SEDS, and there are many SEDS branches in other countries, preparing enthusiastic students and young professionals for the growing Space industry.

Cape Town has also become a popular [[Study abroad in the United States|study abroad]] destination for many international college students. Many [[study abroad organization|study abroad providers]] offer semester, summer, short-term, and internship programs in partnership with Cape Town universities as a chance for international students to gain intercultural understanding.

=== Rail ===
The [[Shosholoza Meyl]] is the passenger rail operations of [[Spoornet]] and operates two long-distance passenger rail services from Cape Town: a daily service to and from Johannesburg via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] and a weekly service to and from Durban via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]], [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Pietermaritzburg]]. These trains terminate at [[Cape Town railway station]] and make a brief stop at [[Bellville railway station|Bellville]]. Cape Town is also one terminus of the luxury tourist-oriented [[Blue Train (South Africa)|Blue Train]] as well as the five-star [[Rovos Rail]].

[[Metrorail (Western Cape)|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Cape Town and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.

=== Road ===
Cape Town is the origin of three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]]. The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] and [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] begin in the foreshore area near the City Center and the [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]], which runs North toward [[Namibia]].

The N1 runs East-North-East through [[Edgemead, Cape Town|Edgemead]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], and [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]]. It connects Cape Town to major cities further inland, namely [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], and [[Pretoria]] An older at-grade road, the [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville.
[[File:Khayelitsha at N2 road, Cape Town (2015).jpg|thumb|[[Khayelitsha]], Township along [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] (2015)]]
The N2 runs East-South-East through [[Rondebosch]], [[Guguletu]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]] to [[Somerset West]]. It becomes a multiple-carriageway, at-grade road from the intersection with the [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] onwards. The N2 continues east along the coast, linking Cape Town to the coastal cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R102 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the suburbs of [[Kuils River]] and [[Eerste River, Western Cape|Eerste River]].

The N7 originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Edgemead. It begins, initially as a highway, but becoming an at-grade road from the intersection with the M5 onwards.

There are also a number of [[Provincial route (South Africa)|regional routes]] linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The [[R27 road (South Africa)|R27]] originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Table View, Cape Town|Table View]] and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]] and links the city to the West Coast, ending at the town of [[Velddrif]]. The [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] enters the east of the metro from the north, from [[Stellenbosch]]. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]]. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of [[Betty's Bay]] and [[Kleinmond]].

Of the three-digit routes, the [[R300 road (South Africa)|R300]], is an expressway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near [[Mitchells Plain]] and the [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The [[R302 road (South Africa)|R302]] runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through [[Durbanville]] leaving the metro to [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]. The [[R304 road (South Africa)|R304]] enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at [[Philadelphia, Western Cape|Philadelphia]] to end at [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] at a junction with the [[R307 road (South Africa)|R307]]. This R307 starts north of [[Koeberg]] from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]. The [[R310 road (South Africa)|R310]] originates from [[Muizenberg]] and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.

Cape Town, like most South African cities, uses [[Metropolitan Routes in Cape Town|Metropolitan]] or "M" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. However, the [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road.

Cape Town suffers from the worst traffic congestion in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|access-date=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201021928/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|archive-date=1 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=R750 million to fight traffic in SA's most congested city|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|access-date=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208104036/http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Buses ===
[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services in the Cape Town metropolitan area. Several companies run long-distance bus services from Cape Town to the other cities in South Africa.

=== Integrated Rapid Transit (IRT) ===
{{main|MyCiTi}}
Cape Town has a public transport system in about 10% of the city, running north to south along the west coastline of the city, comprising Phase 1 of the IRT system. This is known as the MyCiTi service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myciti.org.za/en/home/|title=MyCiTi|access-date=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225063521/http://myciti.org.za/en/home/|archive-date=25 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

MyCiTi Phase 1 includes services linking the Airport to the Cape Town inner city, as well as the following areas: [[Bloubergstrand|Blouberg]] / [[Table View]], [[Dunoon, Cape Town|Dunoon]], [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] and [[Melkbosstrand]], [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], Paarden Eiland, [[Century City, Cape Town|Century City]], [[Salt River, Cape Town|Salt River]] and [[Walmer Estate, Cape Town|Walmer Estate]], and all suburbs of the [[City Bowl]] and [[#Atlantic Seaboard|Atlantic Seaboard]] all the way to [[Llandudno, Cape Town|Llandudno]] and [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]].

The MyCiTi N2 Express service consists of two routes each linking the Cape Town inner city and [[Khayelitsha]] and [[Mitchells Plain]] on the [[Cape Flats]].

The service use high floor articulated and standard size buses in dedicated busways, low floor articulated and standard size buses on the N2 Express service, and smaller {{convert|9|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Optare]] buses in suburban and inner city areas. It offers [[Accessibility#Transportation|universal access]] through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the [[EMV]] compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from 3 mins to 20 mins in peak times to 60 minutes during quiet off-peak periods.

=== Taxis ===
Cape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.

Cape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and [[Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]]. There are about one thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre. The larger taxi companies in Cape Town are Excite Taxis, Cabnet and Intercab and single operators are reachable by cellular phone. The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.

Minibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |publisher=CapeTown.org |title=Transport |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184051/http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |archivedate=28 November 2011}}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy. These taxis make frequent unscheduled stops to pick up passengers, which can cause accidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1566/is_200209/ai_n7215423 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203204842/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1566/is_200209/ai_n7215423 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2007 |title=South Africa's minibus wars: uncontrollable law-defying minibuses oust buses and trains from transit |publisher=LookSmart}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c2es.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/transportation_in_south_africa/trans_sa_execsumm.cfm|title=Transportation in Developing Countries: Greenhouse Gas Scenarios for South Africa|publisher=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|access-date=8 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223234303/http://www.c2es.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/transportation_in_south_africa/trans_sa_execsumm.cfm|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often filled over their legal passenger allowance.
