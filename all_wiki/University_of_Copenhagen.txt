The '''University of Copenhagen''' ('''UCPH''') ({{lang-da|Københavns Universitet}}, abbr. ''KU'') is a public [[research university]] in [[Copenhagen|Copenhagen, Denmark]]. Founded in 1479, the University of Copenhagen is the second-oldest university in [[Scandinavia]], and ranks as one of the top universities in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=UCPHHistory>{{cite web|url=https://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/koebenhavns-universitet-indtil-1849/|title=History of the University of Copenhagen from 1479 to 1849|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=24 July 2020}}</ref>

Its establishment sanctioned by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], the University of Copenhagen was founded by [[Christian I of Denmark]] as a [[Catholic]] teaching institution with a predominantly [[Theology|theological]] focus. Up until the 18th century, the university was primarily concerned with educating [[Clergy|clergymen]]. Through various reforms in the 18th and 19th century, the University of Copenhagen was transformed into a modern, [[Secularism|secular]] university, with science and the humanities replacing theology as the main subjects studied and taught.<ref name=UCPHHistory>{{cite web|url=https://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/koebenhavns-universitet-indtil-1849/|title=History of the University of Copenhagen from 1479 to 1849|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=24 July 2020}}</ref>

The University of Copenhagen consists of six different [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], with teaching taking place in its four distinct campuses, all situated in Copenhagen.<ref name=UCPHFaculties>{{cite web|url=https://about.ku.dk/organisation/faculties/|title=Faculties of the University of Copenhagen|publisher=University of Copenhagen|language=English|accessdate=25 July 2020}}</ref><ref name=UCPHDepartments>{{cite web|url=https://about.ku.dk/organisation/departments/|title=Departments at the University of Copenhagen|publisher=University of Copenhagen|language=English|accessdate=25 July 2020}}</ref> The university operates 36 different departments and 122 separate [[Research centre|research centres]] in Copenhagen, as well as a number of museums and [[Botanical garden|botanical gardens]] in and outside the Danish capital.<ref>https://about.ku.dk/visit/museums/ Retrieved July 24, 2020.</ref> The University of Copenhagen also owns and operates multiple [[Research station|research stations]] around Denmark, with two additional ones located in [[Greenland]].<ref>https://research.ku.dk/areas/ Retrieved July 24, 2020. </ref><ref>https://www.science.ku.dk/fakultetet/organisation/feltstationer/ (in Danish).

==History==
[[File:Copenhagen - Rundetårn - 2013.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Round Tower]] (''Rundetårn''), used as an observatory by astronomer [[Ole Rømer]].]]
The University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479 and is the oldest [[university]] in Denmark. In 1474, [[Christian I of Denmark]] journeyed to [[Rome]] to visit [[Pope Sixtus IV]], whom Christian I hoped to persuade into issuing a papal bull permitting the establishment of [[university]] in Denmark. Christian I failed to persuade the pope to issue the bull, however, and the king returned to Denmark the same year, empty-handed.
In 1475, Christian I's wife, [[Dorothea of Brandenburg]], [[Queen of Denmark]], made the same journey to Rome as her husband did a year before. Unlike Christian I, Dorothea managed to persuade Pope Sixtus IV into issuing the papal bull. On the 19th of June, 1475, Pope Sixtus IV issued an official papal bull permitting the establishment of what was to become the University of Copenhagen.<ref name=UCPHHistory1479>{{cite web|url=https://universitetshistorie.ku.dk/overblik/1479-1788/grundlaeggelsen/|title=History of the University of Copenhagen about 1479|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=25 August 2020}}</ref>

On the 4th of October, 1478, Christian I of Denmark issued a [[royal decree]] by which he officially established the University of Copenhagen. In this decree, Christian I set down the rules and laws governing the university. The royal decree elected [[Magister degree|magistar]] Peder Albertsen as [[vice chancellor]] of the university, and the task was his to employ various learned [[Scholar|scholars]] at the new university and thereby establish its first four [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]: [[theology]], [[Legal education|law]], [[Medical education|medicine]] and [[philosophy]]. The royal decree made the University of Copenhagen enjoy [[patronage|royal patronage]] from its very beginning. Furthermore, the university was explicitly established as an [[Autonomy|autonomous]] institution, giving it a great degree of juridical freedom. As such, the University of Copenhagen was to be administered without royal interference, and it was not subject to the usual laws governing the [[Danish people]].<ref name=UCPHHistory1479>{{cite web|url=https://universitetshistorie.ku.dk/overblik/1479-1788/grundlaeggelsen/|title=History of the University of Copenhagen about 1479|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=25 August 2020}}</ref>

The University of Copenhagen was closed by the Church in 1531 to stop the spread of Protestantism, and re-established in 1537 by [[Christian III of Denmark|King Christian III]] after the [[Reformation in Denmark|Lutheran Reformation]] and transformed into an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]]-[[Lutheran]] [[seminary]]. Between 1675 and 1788, the university introduced the concept of degree examinations. An examination for [[theology]] was added in 1675, followed by law in 1736. By 1788, all faculties required an examination before they would issue a degree.

In 1807, the British [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Bombardment of Copenhagen]] destroyed most of the university's buildings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newinternational05gilm|page=[https://archive.org/details/newinternational05gilm/page/386 386]|quote=In 1807, the British fleet bombarded Copenhagen during the Bombardment of Copenhagen, destroying most of the university's buildings.|title=The new international encyclopaedia|last1=Gilman|first1=Daniel Coit|last2=Peck|first2=Harry Thurston|last3=Colby|first3=Frank Moore|date=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead|language=en}}</ref> By 1836, however, the new main building of the university was inaugurated amid extensive building that continued until the end of the century. The [[Copenhagen University Library|University Library]] (now a part of the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]]), the [[University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum|Zoological Museum]], the [[Geologisk Museum|Geological Museum]], the [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden|Botanic Garden]] with [[greenhouse]]s, and the Technical College were also established during this period.

[[File:Københavnsuniversitetsbibliotekfiolstræde.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the old university library at ''Fiolstræde'' around 1920.]]
Between 1842 and 1850, the faculties at the university were restructured. Starting in 1842, the University Faculty of Medicine and the Academy of Surgeons merged to form the [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences|Faculty of Medical Science]], while in 1848 the Faculty of Law was reorganised and became the [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Law|Faculty of Jurisprudence and Political Science]]. In 1850, the [[Mathematics|Faculty of Mathematics and Science]] was separated from the [[Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]]. In 1845 and 1862 Copenhagen co-hosted [[nordic student meeting]]s with [[Lund University]].

The first female student was enrolled at the university in 1877. The university underwent explosive growth between 1960 and 1980. The number of students rose from around 6,000 in 1960 to about 26,000 in 1980, with a correspondingly large growth in the number of employees. Buildings built during this time period include the new Zoological Museum, the [[Hans Christian Ørsted Institute|Hans Christian Ørsted]] and August Krogh Institutes, the campus centre on [[Amager|Amager Island]], and the [[Panum Institute]].

[[File:Geologisk Museum 2.jpg|thumb|300px|The Geological Museum.]]
The new university statute instituted in 1970 involved [[democratisation]] of the management of the university. It was modified in 1973 and subsequently applied to all [[higher education]] institutions in Denmark. The democratisation was later reversed with the 2003 university reforms. Further change in the structure of the university from 1990 to 1993 made a [[Bachelor's degree]] programme mandatory in virtually all subjects.

Also in 1993, the law departments broke off from the [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Social Sciences|Faculty of Social Sciences]] to form a separate [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. In 1994, the University of Copenhagen designated [[environmental studies]], north-south relations, and [[biotechnology]] as areas of special priority according to its new long-term plan. Starting in 1996 and continuing to the present, the university planned new buildings, including for the [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Humanities]] at [[Amager]] (Ørestaden), along with a Biotechnology Centre. By 1999, the student population had grown to exceed 35,000, resulting in the university appointing additional professors and other personnel.
[[File:Nyekua.jpg|thumb|left|300px|South Campus.]]

In 2003, the revised Danish university law removed faculty, staff and students from the university decision process, creating a top-down control structure that has been described as absolute monarchy, since leaders are granted extensive powers while being appointed exclusively by higher levels in the organization.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.information.dk/201197 | title= Absolut monarki på universiteterne  | date= 23 August 2009 | accessdate= 2009-11-20 }}</ref>

In 2005, the Center for Health and Society (Center for Sundhed og Samfund&nbsp;– CSS) opened in central Copenhagen, housing the Faculty of Social Sciences and Institute of Public Health, which until then had been located in various places throughout the city. In May 2006, the university announced further plans to leave many of its old buildings in the inner city of [[Copenhagen]], an area that has been home to the university for more than 500 years. The purpose of this has been to gather the university's many departments and faculties on three larger campuses in order to create a bigger, more concentrated and modern student environment with better teaching facilities, as well as to save money on rent and maintenance of the old buildings. The concentration of facilities on larger campuses also allows for more inter-disciplinary cooperation; for example, the Departments of Political Science and Sociology are now located in the same facilities at CSS and can pool resources more easily.

In January 2007, the University of Copenhagen merged with the [[Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University]] and the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Science. The two universities were converted into faculties under the University of Copenhagen, and were renamed as the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. In January 2012, the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the veterinary third of the Faculty of Life Sciences merged with the Faculty of Health Sciences forming the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences&nbsp;– and the other two thirds of the Faculty of Life Sciences were merged into the Faculty of Science.

==Campuses==
The university has four main campus areas that are located in the [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]] (three in Copenhagen and one in [[Frederiksberg]]):<ref name="map">{{cite web|url=http://cas.ku.dk/english/map/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606164123/http://cas.ku.dk/english/map/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 June 2014|title=Map and campus areas|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref>

*[[Frederiksberg Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Frederiksberg Campus]]&nbsp;– home to sections of the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.

The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences and the Faculty of Science also use the [[Taastrup Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Taastrup Campus]], which is located in [[Taastrup]] on the western outskirts of Copenhagen.<ref name="map" /> The Faculty of Science also has facilities in [[Helsingør]], [[Hørsholm]] and [[Nødebo]].<ref name="map" />

==Organisation and administration==
The university is governed by a board consisting of 11 members: 6 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 2 members are appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the university students. The rector, the prorector and the director of the university are appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints directors of the different parts of the central administration and deans of the different faculties. The deans appoint heads of 50 departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance, although there are elected Academic Boards at faculty level who advise the deans.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://bestyrelse.ku.dk/vedtaegt/ | title= Vedtægt for Københavns Universitet| accessdate= 2009-11-08 }}</ref> {{As of|2018}}, the governing body manages an annual budget of about [[Danish krone|DKK]] 8.9 billion.<ref name=Okonomi2018/>

The University is organized into six faculties and about 100 departments and research centres. The University employs about 5,600 academic staff and 4,400 technical and administrative staff. The six faculties are:
* [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences|Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences]]
* [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Humanities|Faculty of Humanities]]
* [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]
* [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]]
* [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Social Sciences|Faculty of Social Sciences]]
* [[University of Copenhagen Faculty of Theology|Faculty of Theology]]

The total number of enrolled students is about 40,000, including about 23,000 undergraduate students and 17,000 graduate students. UCPH has established an international graduate talent program which provides grants for international Ph. D, students and a tenure track carrier system. UCPH operates about fifty master’s programmes taught in English, and has arranged about 150 exchange agreements with other institutions and 800 Erasmus agreements.  Each year there are about 1,700 incoming exchange students, 2,000 outbound exchange students and 4,000 international degree-seeking students.  About 3,000 PhD students study there each year.

==Student housing==
[[File:Tietgenkollegiet.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tietgenkollegiet]].]]
Although many privately owned [[dormitories]] (''kollegier'' in Danish) exist in [[Copenhagen]], there are also five which are partially administered by the university. Only students who have passed at least two years of studies are considered for [[University and college admissions|admission]]. These are normally referred to as the ''old dormitories'', and they consist of [[Regensen]], [[Elers' Kollegium]], [[Borchs Kollegium]], [[Hassagers Kollegium]], and [[Valkendorfs Kollegium]].

Contrary to the tradition of most American dormitories, Danish dormitories in general, and the old dormitories in particular, only offer single rooms for rent, meaning no student has to share their room with others.

The University of Copenhagen Housing Foundation is a separate commercial entity<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://datacvr.virk.dk/data/visenhed?enhedstype=virksomhed&id=32139876&soeg=K%C3%B8benhavns+Universitets+Boligfond&type=Alle&language=en-gb|title=Search CVR|newspaper=Data|access-date=2017-01-10}}</ref> which provides housing for the University's international students and guest researchers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://housingfoundation.ku.dk/|title=The University of Copenhagen Housing Foundation|date=2013-11-13|website=housingfoundation.ku.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-10}}</ref>

==Seal==
The university's oldest known [[seal (device)|seal]] dates from a 1531 letter, it depicts [[Saint Peter]] with a key and a book. In a circle around him is the text

{|
:''Sigillum universitatis studii haffnensis''.
|

|}
When the university was re-established by [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] in 1537 after the [[Reformation in Denmark|Protestant Reformation]], it received a new seal, showing king Christian III with [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], [[sceptre]], and [[globus cruciger]] above a crowned [[coat of arms]] vertically divided between halved versions of the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] (to the viewer's left, ''[[Dexter and sinister|dexter]]'') and the [[coat of arms of Norway]] (to the viever's right, ''[[Dexter and sinister|sinister]]''). The text is
{|
|
:''Sigillum Universitatis Hafniensis A Christiano III Rege Restauravit''
|
:(i.e. Seal of the University of Copenhagen, reestablished by King Christian III).
|}

The 1537 seal is very similar to the current seal, which was made in 2000 and is shown at the top of this page. The text is different and the crowned shield shows the coat of arms of Denmark (as has been the case since 1820, when the [[heraldry|heraldic]] reference to Norway was removed). The text is
{|
|
:''Sigillum Universitatis Hafniensis''
:''Fundatæ 1479''
:''Reformatæ 1537''
|
:''Seal of the University of Copenhagen''
:''Founded 1479''
:''Reformed 1537''
|}

In addition to the university seal, each of the university's six faculties carry seals of their own.

==Cooperative agreements with other universities==
The university cooperates with universities around the world. In January 2006, the University of Copenhagen entered into a partnership of ten top universities, along with the [[Australian National University]], [[ETH Zürich]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[Peking University]], [[University of California Berkeley]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Yale University]]. The partnership is referred to as the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]] (IARU).
