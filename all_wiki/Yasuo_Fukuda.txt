{{nihongo|'''Yasuo Fukuda'''|福田 康夫|Fukuda Yasuo|extra=born July 16, 1936}} is a Japanese politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Japan]] from 2007 to 2008. He was previously the longest-serving [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] in Japanese history, serving in that role from 2000 to 2004 under Prime Ministers [[Yoshirō Mori]] and [[Junichiro Koizumi]].<ref name=Bloomberg>Keiichi Yamamura and Sachiko Sakamaki, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=aY0ClrGXIrYE&refer=japan "Fukuda Challenges Aso in Race to Be Prime Minister"], Bloomberg.com, 14 September 2007.</ref>

Following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]], Fukuda [[2007 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|was elected]] as President of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and became Prime Minister in September 2007. Fukuda was the first son of a former Japanese Prime Minister ([[Takeo Fukuda]]) to also take up the post.

On 1 September 2008, Fukuda announced his resignation, triggering [[2008 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|another LDP leadership election]].<ref name="Kato">{{cite news|last=Kato|first=Taku|title=Fukuda Resigns as Japan's Prime Minister Citing Gridlock|publisher=Bloomberg|date=1 September  2008|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=aGE.N_ls3m14&refer=japan|accessdate=1 September 2008}}</ref>

Although Japan hosted the [[34th G8 summit|G8 summit]] meeting without mishap during Fukuda's time in office, he himself earned little or no credit from ordinary Japanese, and when he resigned, he became the first of the G8 leaders to leave office.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12036328  "Get someone else,"] ''The Economist'', 1 September 2008.</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:Yasuo Fukuda as a child.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Yasuo Fukuda as a child]]
Fukuda was born in [[Takasaki, Gunma]], the eldest son of politician (later the 67th Prime Minister) [[Takeo Fukuda]].<ref name=Bloomberg/> He grew up in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], attending [[Azabu High School]] and graduating from [[Waseda University]] in 1959 with a degree in economics. After university, he joined Maruzen Petroleum (now part of the [[Cosmo Oil Company]]). He was only minimally involved in politics over the next seventeen years, working his way up to section chief as a typical Japanese "[[salaryman]]". He was posted to the United States from 1962-64. While his father Takeo Fukuda was prime minister from 1976–78, Yasuo became a political secretary. From 1978 to 1989, he was a director of the [[Kinzai Institute for Financial Affairs]], serving as a trustee from 1986 onward.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Fukuda also served as president of the Japanese Canoe Federation prior to his September 2007 election as Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.canoeicf.com/?page=2131&format= Appointment of Mr. Yasuo Fukada, President of Japan Canoe Federation as Prime Minister of Japan], canoeicf.com, 26 September 2007; accessed 10 October 2009.</ref>

==Political career==

Fukuda ran for the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] in 1990 and won a seat.<ref name=Bloomberg/> He was elected deputy director of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in 1997 and became Chief Cabinet Secretary to [[Yoshirō Mori]] in October 2000. He resigned his position as Chief Cabinet Secretary on 7 May 2004 amid a large political scandal related to the Japanese pension system.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Fukuda was considered a contender for the leadership of the LDP in 2006, but, on 21 July, he decided that he would not seek the nomination. Instead, [[Shinzō Abe]] succeeded [[Junichirō Koizumi]] as leader of the LDP and [[Prime Minister of Japan]]. One of his most noted policy goals is to end prime ministerial visits to [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. In June 2006, Fukuda joined 134 other lawmakers in proposing a secular alternative to the shrine, citing constitutional concerns.<ref>[http://www.shanghaidaily.com/art/2006/06/16/283371/Japan_lawmakers_seek_to_replace_war_shrine.htm Japan lawmakers seek to replace war shrine], ShanghaiDaily.com, 16 June 2006.</ref>

===Election as Prime Minister===
[[File:Yasuo Fukuda 20070925.jpg|thumb|200px|Yasuo Fukuda was designated as [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] by the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] (at the [[National Diet Building]] on 25 September 2007)]]
Following Abe's resignation in September 2007, Fukuda announced that he would run in the [[2007 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|Liberal Democratic Party leadership election]], which would also determine the prime minister, given the LDP's majority in the House of Representatives.

Fukuda received a great deal of support in his bid, including that of the LDP's largest faction, led by Foreign Minister [[Nobutaka Machimura]], of which Fukuda is a member.<ref name=Bloomberg/> Finance Minister [[Fukushiro Nukaga]], who initially had intended to run for the leadership, also backed Fukuda.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/14/asia/AS-GEN-Japan-Nukaga.php "Japan's finance chief not to run for ruling party president"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 14 September 2007.</ref> Fukuda's only competitor for the leadership, [[Tarō Asō]], publicly acknowledged the likelihood of his own defeat a week before the election.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/16/asia/AS-POL-Japan-Politics.php "Former FM Aso acknowledges probable defeat in Japan's leadership race"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 16 September 2007.</ref>

This deadlock was then resolved in favor of the lower house's choice, according to Article 67 of the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]].<ref name=Elected/><ref name=Installed>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7011596.stm "Fukuda installed as Japanese PM"], BBC News, 25 September 2007.</ref>

====Censure motion====
On 11 June 2008, a [[non-binding]] [[censure]] motion was passed by parliament's opposition-controlled upper house against Yasuo Fukuda. Filed by the Democratic Party of Japan and two other parties, it was the first censure motion against a prime minister under Japan's post-war constitution. Ahead of the [[G8 summit]], it attacked his handling of domestic issues including an unpopular medical plan and called for a snap election or his resignation.

===Sudden resignation===
[[File:George W Bush and Yasuo Fukuda 20080706 3.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[George W. Bush]] (at the [[The Windsor Hotel Toya Resort & Spa|Windsor Hotel Toya Resort and Spa]] on 6 July 2008)]]
[[File:George W Bush and Yasuo Fukuda 20080708.jpg|thumb|200px|with leaders of the [[G8]] (at the [[34th G8 summit]] on 8 July 2008)]]
On 1 September 2008, Fukuda announced his resignation, citing reasons related to improving the flow of the political process. The sudden announcement began with a call for an emergency press conference issued at 6:00&nbsp;pm, The purpose not disclosed until 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start of the press conference. The resignation was widely compared to the sudden resignation of Abe a year earlier. Fukuda said that while Abe's resignation was due to health reasons, his own resignation was motivated by a desire to remove impediments to legislative and political process due to deadlock between his party and the opposition-controlled upper house of the Diet.<ref name="Kato"/>

The resignation led to [[2008 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|another leadership election]] within the LDP. Tarō Asō was viewed as the likely front-runner to replace Fukuda, and was elected a week later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4653861.ece|title=Login|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> His popularity was hit by a controversial medical plan for elderly people, falling below 30% at one stage. He said:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/09/01/japan.pm/|title=Beleaguered Japanese PM resigns|accessdate=7 June 2015 | work=CNN|date=September 1, 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5htuAUeVI6W0hUPZZH8gUvFh-3cLg afp.google.com, Japan PM Fukuda resigns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520165144/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5htuAUeVI6W0hUPZZH8gUvFh-3cLg |date=May 20, 2011 }}</ref><blockquote>Today, I have decided to resign. We need a new line-up to cope with a new session of parliament. My decision is based on what I thought the future political situation ought to be. The Democratic Party has tried to stall every bill so it has taken a long time to implement any policies. For the sake of the Japanese people, this should not be repeated. If we are to prioritize the people's livelihoods, there cannot be a political vacuum from political bargaining, or a lapse in policies. We need a new team to carry out policies.</blockquote>

Taro Aso [[2008 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election|was elected]] to succeed Fukuda as LDP President on 22 September. Fukuda and his cabinet resigned ''[[en masse]]'' on 24 September 2008, to make way for a new Cabinet headed by Aso. Aso was elected as Prime Minister by the House of Representatives on the same day.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120911191124/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24396000-2703,00.html  Taro Aso confirmed as Japan's new Prime Minister], theaustralian.news.com; accessed 18 June 2015.</ref>

===Diplomacy===
In June 2014, Fukuda visited [[Beijing]] for secret meetings with Chinese government officials. The meeting was seen as the first after nearly 18 months between a senior Japanese political leader and Chinese officials. During the meeting, Fukuda was passed the message that President [[Xi Jinping|Xi]] wanted to meet with the Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe|Abe]]. Following this, in late July Fukuda  conveyed the details of the discussion to Abe. On getting the consent from Abe, Fukuda returned to Beijing and on 28 July informed Xi about the consent from Abe, and thus laid the groundwork for the Japan-China summit that was held in November 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/Who-wanted-a-summit-more |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208033650/http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/Who-wanted-a-summit-more |archive-date=December 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-01/ex-japan-premier-fukuda-may-have-met-xi-on-china-trip-jiji-says.html|title=Ex-Japan Premier Fukuda May Have Met Xi on China Trip, Jiji Says|author=Andy Sharp|date=1 August  2014|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>
In 2018, Fakuda met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during the 4th round of dialogue between entrepreneurs and former senior officials of China and Japan 
<ref>https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1603555.shtml</ref>

In July 2019, addressed the two-day Sino-US trade relations forum in Hong Kong,  attended by high-level attendees included former Chinese vice-premier [[Zeng Peiyan]] and other previous government heads and officials, as well as entrepreneurs and scholars from around the world. Fukuda urged China to seriously consider what role it wanted to play on the world stage, describing it as ''“the most serious issue of the era that we are faced with”...“Each step China takes not only affects relations between the United States and China, but also the entire world,”'' he said. <ref>https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3017866/could-trade-war-be-chinas-golden-opportunity-transform-economy</ref>

==Controversies==
===Statements on "Super Free"===
When Fukuda was Chief Cabinet Secretary to former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi he was reported to have made highly controversial comments during an off-the-record discussion with reporters in June 2003 regarding the victims of rape by male members of the [[Waseda University]] "[[Super Free]]" club,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/02/world/main571280.shtml|title=Rape Debate In Japan|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=2 September 2003|accessdate=19 January 2008}}</ref> according to an article in the weekly magazine ''[[Shukan Bunshun]]''.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20030704a3.html "Fukuda accused of defending rape"], ''Japan Times'', 4 July 2003.</ref>

The magazine quoted Fukuda as saying: "There are women who look like they are saying 'Do it to me'. Those who have that kind of appearance are at fault, because men are black panthers." In response, Fukuda claimed that the ''Shukan Bunshun'' had distorted his comments, stating that he had never intended to defend rape, and told a parliamentary panel afterward that rape was "a criminal act and an atrocious crime."<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3042316.stm Japan rape victims 'asking for it']," ''BBC News'', 3 July 2003.</ref><ref>"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2003_July_8/ai_104847267 Fukuda denies making remarks defending alleged gang rapists], ''Kyodo'', 8 July 2003.</ref>

===Refueling debate===
One of the major issues during Fukuda's first months in office was the status of Japan's Indian Ocean refueling mission.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7006285.stm|title=Profile: Yasuo Fukuda|publisher=BBC|date=23 September 2007|accessdate=14 June 2008}}</ref> After the [[11 September attacks]] and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan, the Diet passed a bill that allowed Japanese oil tankers to provide fuel for American ships involved in military operations. When Fukuda became Prime Minister he vowed to continue the mission, this despite the fact that the DPJ which opposed the authorization bill now had a majority in the upper house. After several months of debate and aborted attempts at compromise the upper house rejected the bill to continue the mission. However, the bill ultimately became law as Fukuda used the LDP's 2/3 majority in the lower house to win successful passage for the bill.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/11/AR2008011103378.html|title=Japan to Resume Its Mission in Indian Ocean|publisher=Associated Press (Washington Post)|date=12 January 2008|accessdate=14 June 2008|first=Eric|last=Talmadge}}</ref>

==Cabinet==
Fukuda's cabinet was formed on 26 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/hukudadaijin/070926/index_e.html|title=Members of the Abe Cabinet|accessdate=28 September 2007}} NB: Despite the title of the page it is indeed the list of members of Fukuda Cabinet.</ref> It was almost identical to Abe's.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070926a1.html|title=Fukuda elected prime minister in Diet faceoff|newspaper=The Japan Times|author=Masami Ito|date=26 September 2007|accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref> After his administration started, the Cabinet's approval rating continually declined. According to the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' newspaper, in late April 2008 the disapproval rating of the Cabinet was 60 percent and the approval rating at 25 percent. Fukuda reshuffled his cabinet on 1 August 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jPdlrPqflHTM3BzECO19WFkVYgswD929IDH80 |title=Japanese prime minister reshuffles Cabinet |agency=Associated Press |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819195144/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jPdlrPqflHTM3BzECO19WFkVYgswD929IDH80 |archivedate=August 19, 2008 }}</ref>
