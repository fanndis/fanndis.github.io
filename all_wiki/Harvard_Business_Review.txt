==Background==
===Early days===
''Harvard Business Review'' began in 1922 as a magazine for Harvard Business School. Founded under the auspices of Dean Wallace Donham, ''HBR'' was meant to be more than just a typical school publication. "The paper [''HBR''] is intended to be the highest type of business journal that we can make it, and for use by the student and the business man. It is not a school paper," Donham wrote. Initially, ''HBR''{{'}}s focus was on [[macroeconomic]] trends, as well as on important developments within specific industries.

Following [[World War II]], ''HBR'' emphasized the cutting-edge management techniques that were developed in large [[corporation]]s, like [[General Motors]], during that time period. Over the next three decades, the magazine continued to refine its focus on general management issues that affect business leaders, billing itself as the "magazine for decision makers." Prominent articles published during this period include "[[Marketing Myopia]]" by [[Theodore Levitt]] and "Barriers and Gateways to Communication" by [[Carl R. Rogers]] and Fritz J. Roethlisberger.

===1980s through 2009===
In the 1980s, Theodore Levitt became the editor of ''Harvard Business Review'' and changed the magazine to make it more accessible to general audiences. Articles were shortened and the scope of the magazine was expanded to include a wider range of topics. In 1994, Harvard Business School formed Harvard Business Publishing (HBP) as an independent entity. Between 2006 and 2008, HBP went through several reorganizations but finally settled into the three market-facing groups that exist today: Higher Education, which distributes cases, articles, and book chapters for business education materials; Corporate Learning, which provides standardized on-line and tailored off-line leadership development courses; and Harvard Business Review Group, which publishes ''Harvard Business Review'' magazine and its web counterpart (HBR.org), and publishes books (Harvard Business Review Press).

===Redesign===
In 2009, ''HBR'' brought on [[Adi Ignatius]], the former deputy managing editor of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, to be its [[editor-in-chief]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/best-business-magazines-4176680|title=The 8 Best Business Magazines of 2020|last=Delbridge|first=Emily|date=November 21, 2019|website=The Balance Small Business|publisher=Dotdash|location=New York City|at=Best for Professionals:Harvard Business Review|access-date=8 Feb 2020}}</ref> Ignatius oversees all editorial operations for Harvard Business Review Group. At the time that Ignatius was hired, the U.S. was going through an [[Great Recession|economic recession]], but ''HBR'' was not covering the topic. "The world was desperate for new approaches. Business-as-usual was not a credible response," Ignatius has recalled. During this period the frequency of ''HBR'' switched from ten times per year to six times per year.<ref>{{cite news|author=Faisal Kalim |title="Magazines are alive and well": Publishers refresh their strategies for the print format |url=https://whatsnewinpublishing.com/magazines-are-alive-and-well-publishers-refresh-their-strategies-for-the-print-format/|access-date=1 June 2020|work=WNIP|date=13 August 2019}}</ref>

As a result, Ignatius realigned ''HBR'''s focus and goals to make sure that it "delivers information in the zeitgeist that our readers are living in." ''HBR'' continues to emphasize research-based, academic pieces that would help readers improve their companies and further their careers, but it broadened its audience and improved reach and impact by including more contemporary topics.

As part of the redesigned magazine, Ignatius also led the charge to integrate the print and digital divisions more closely, and gave each edition of ''HBR'' a distinct theme and personality, as opposed to being a collection of academically superlative, yet mostly unrelated articles.

''HBR'' won the [[2020 Webby Award|2020 Webby Award for Business Blog/Website]] in the category Web.<ref name="Kastrenakes">{{cite web |last1=Kastrenakes |first1=Jacob |title=Here are all the winners of the 2020 Webby Awards |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263445/2020-webby-awards-winners-lil-nas-x-nasa-jon-krasinski |website=The Verge |access-date=22 May 2020 |language=en |date=20 May 2020}}</ref>
