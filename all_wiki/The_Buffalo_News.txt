'''''The Buffalo News''''' is the daily [[newspaper]] of the [[Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area]], located at 1 News Plaza in downtown [[Buffalo, New York]]. The paper was for decades the only paper fully owned by [[Warren Buffett]]'s [[Berkshire Hathaway]].<ref name="eandp">{{cite magazine |title=EXCLUSIVE: Warren Buffett — Newspaper Industry Got Too Complacent |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Article/EXCLUSIVE-Warren-Buffett-Newspaper-Industry-Got-Too-Complacent |magazine=[[Editor & Publisher]] |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> On January 29, 2020, the paper reported that it was being sold to [[Lee Enterprises]].<ref name="buffalonews.com">https://buffalonews.com/2020/01/29/buffalo-news-sold-to-lee-enterprises/</ref>

The ''News'' was founded in 1873 by [[Edward Hubert Butler, Sr.]] as a Sunday paper.<ref name="buffnewsfaq">[http://corp.buffalonews.com/services/contact/faq.asp#his Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328174435/http://corp.buffalonews.com/services/contact/faq.asp#his |date=2011-03-28}}, www.buffalonews.com</ref> On October 11, 1880,<ref>{{cite web |title=About Buffalo evening news.

During most of its life, the ''News'' was known as ''The Buffalo Evening News''. A gentleman's agreement between the ''Evening News'' and the ''[[Buffalo Courier-Express]]'' meant that the ''Evening News'' would be evening-only, and the ''Courier-Express'' would be morning-only. Until 1977, the ''News'' did not publish on Sundays because of the agreement, and its weekend edition appeared on Saturday evening.

The Butler family owned the ''Evening News'' until 1977, when longtime owner and publisher Katherine Butler, granddaughter of the founder, died and left no heirs. The ''Evening News'' properties were placed in a blind trust, which sold the ''Evening News'' to Berkshire Hathaway.<ref name="eandp"/> The new owners began publishing on Saturday and Sunday mornings.<ref name="buffnewsfaq"/> After a period of financial decline, the ''Courier-Express'' published its last issue on September 19, 1982. The ''Evening News'' then shortened its name to ''The Buffalo News'' and became an all-day newspaper, publishing two editions seven days a week.

On October 1, 2006, the ''News'' announced it would abandon its evening edition later that month.

''The Buffalo News'' had published three morning editions (Western New York, Final and Niagara) that appear online at BuffaloNews.com, reaching over 400,000 readers, across eight counties each day. These separate editions were eliminated in 2018 and consolidated into a single Final edition, in response to a newsprint shortage.<ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2018/05/23/nine-buffalo-news-reporters-take-buyout-offers.html</ref>

''The News'' Designated Market Area had the largest adult population in upstate New York. Counties in total circulation area: New York - Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Steuben, Wyoming; Pennsylvania - Cameron, Erie, McKean, Potter, Warren.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The newspaper founded and owned the WBEN television and radio stations, which are now [[WIVB]] (Channel 4), [[WBEN (AM)|WBEN]] (930), [[WYRK]] (106.5) and [[WTSS]] (102.5), respectively. The radio stations are now owned by separate companies (WBEN and WTSS are now held by [[Entercom]]; WYRK by [[Townsquare Media]]), but in 2014, WIVB came back under partial coownership, with the ''News'' when Buffett's [[Media General]] merged with the WIVB parent company, [[LIN Media]].

The online version of ''The Buffalo News'' operates under a soft [[paywall]] allowing a limited number of page views per week. All [[Buffalo Bills]]-related content, branded as "BN Blitz", is behind a hard paywall.

On January 29, 2020, the ''News'' reported it was being sold along with the rest of Berkshire Hathaway's newspaper portfolio to [[Lee Enterprises]], an Iowa-based owner of 50 newspapers that has had significant ties to Berkshire Hathaway since 2012 and had operated Berkshire Hathaway's newspapers since 2018.<ref name="buffalonews.com"/>

{{see also|List of Pulitzer Prizes awarded to The Buffalo News}}
Journalists for ''The Buffalo News'' and ''The Buffalo Evening News'' have won four [[Pulitzer Prize]]s:
* In 1958, [[Bruce Shanks]] received the Editorial Cartooning award for his August 10, 1957 piece, "[[:File:The Thinker by Bruce Shanks.jpg|The Thinker]]", detailing union corruption. 
* In 1961, [[Edgar May]] received the Local Reporting award for his series, "Our Costly Dilemma," concerning the need for reform of [[New York State]]'s [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] system. The series touched off debates about [[welfare reform]] nationwide. 
* In 1990, [[Tom Toles]] brought the ''News'' its second Editorial Cartooning award, for his work throughout the year (although his piece "First Amendment" has been cited as the work that merited the award). (Toles currently serves as an editorial cartoonist with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', where he succeeded the late Herbert Block, known as [[Herblock]].) 
* In 2015, [[Adam Zyglis]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]] for using, in the committee's citation, "strong images to connect with readers while conveying layers of meaning in few words". 
''News'' journalists have been finalists for three other Pulitzer Prizes, but did not win: 
* Toles (1985 and 1996, for Editorial Cartooning) and, 
* James Heaney (1993, for Investigative Reporting).
Other journalists who won awards include [[Richard J. Burke]], who in 1972 won the New York State Associated Press Award for his series of articles about bicycling around Western New York.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
