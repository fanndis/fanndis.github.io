'''Tan Choo Leng''' ({{zh|s=陈子玲|t=陳子玲|p=Chén Zǐlíng}}) is a Singaporean lawyer and the wife of Singapore's second [[Prime Minister of Singapore|prime minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]].

==Background==
Tan obtained her [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the University of Singapore (now the [[National University of Singapore]]). She is  currently an [[advocate]] and [[solicitor]] for M/s Wong Partnership.

She has given her support to many charities, and was best known for being a patron of the Singapore [[National Kidney Foundation Singapore|National Kidney Foundation]] (NKF). During the [[National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal|2005 NKF scandal]], she commented that the annual salary of S$600,000 drawn by NKF's chief executive officer [[T. T. Durai]] (the central figure in the incident) was considered "peanuts" as compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars managed by the NKF. Her remark was subsequently met with negative reactions from many Singaporeans.

Tan stepped down as a patron after Durai and the NKF's board of directors resigned under public pressure on 14 July 2005. [[Goh Chok Tong]] later told the press that his wife regretted making that comment.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/158246/1/.html | title =  Ex-NKF patron Mrs Goh Chok Tong regrets remarks about TT Durai's pay: SM Goh  |publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 16 July 2005 }}</ref>
