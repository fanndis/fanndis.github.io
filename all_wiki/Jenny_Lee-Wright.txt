'''Jenny Lee-Wright''' (born 21 February 1947 in London) is a British actress and dancer who later became a [[Foley artist]].

At age 16, she left school to train with the [[Ballet Rambert]]. Within a year, she became part of a French [[cabaret]] group that traveled the world. Upon returning to England, she joined [[Lionel Blair]]'s dance troupe, and then turned to acting, appearing with such comedians as [[Morecambe and Wise]], [[Dick Emery]], [[Spike Milligan]] (in his ''[[Q (TV series)|Q]]'' series), [[Frankie Howerd]], [[Tommy Cooper]] and, in particular, [[Benny Hill]]. Her work with Hill earned her the nickname 'The Sexiest Stooge'. Other television appearances included ''[[The Golden Shot]]'', ''[[The Protectors]]'' and ''Masterspy'' (as Miss Moneypacker).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496751/bio |title=Biography |author=Gary P. Rose |date= n.d.|publisher=IMDb }}</ref>

In 1970, she made her film debut in [[John Cassavetes]]'s ''[[Husbands (film)|Husbands]]'', in which she played the role of Pearl Billingham. Other films included [[Michael Apted]]'s ''[[The Triple Echo|Triple Echo]]'' (1972) and the [[Amicus Productions|Amicus]] production ''[[Madhouse (1974 film)|Madhouse]]'' (1974).

She began to work as a Foley artist in the 1970s between acting jobs, and in a 1976 magazine interview attributed her sense of timing in that field to her training as a dancer. Wright stood in as the hostess on ''Bruce Forsyth's Generation Game'' for several weeks when regular hostess Anthea Redfern was absent on maternity leave. By the late 1980s, she had switched completely to Foley work, including such films as ''[[My Left Foot (film)|My Left Foot]]'' (1989), ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998), ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (1996), the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (2004) based on the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical.
