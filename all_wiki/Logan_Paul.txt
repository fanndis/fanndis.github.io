In February 2017, [[Dwayne Johnson]] released on his own YouTube channel, "Logan Paul has been cut from, like, all of The Rock's movies", a video starring himself and Paul, in which Johnson informs Paul that he has been cut from all of Johnson's films, and consoles Paul by making him the "ambassador" to his upcoming ''[[Baywatch (film)|Baywatch]]'' feature film.<ref>Cohen, Ian (February 2017).

On November 23, 2017, Paul released his new single, "No Handlebars", a track that draws heavily on an interpolated sample of the song "[[Handlebars (song)|Handlebars]]" by the American alternative hip hop group [[Flobots]]. The song was heavily criticized for its perceived sexual objectification of women, including a scene in its music video where Paul rides several women like a bicycle. Flobots frontman [[Jamie Laurie]] lambasted Paul for both the "sexist" lyrical content of the song and for unauthorized use of the sample, calling him the face of "douchebag entitlement". Laurie would later go on to release a track with lyrics deriding Paul, titled "Handle Your Bars". Paul did not respond to Laurie's comments nor the backlash towards "No Handlebars"; however, he has since deleted the song from YouTube.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flobots Go to War With Vlogger Logan Paul Over 'No Handlebars' |url=http://www.westword.com/music/flobots-go-to-war-with-vlogger-logan-paul-over-no-handlebars-9810636 |website=[[Westword]] |first=Kyle |last=Harris |date=December 21, 2017 |accessdate=January 8, 2018}}</ref>

I might return the favor and kill you." He received criticism from [[United States abortion-rights movement|pro-choice abortion activists]], who described his comment as "horrific", while [[Pro Life Campaign|pro-life abortion activists]] came to his defense.

==Personal life==
Paul has [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Jewish]] and [[German people|German]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|title=A death in the family...|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAfl-h5fkc|website=YouTube (Logan Paul Vlogs)}}</ref>

In October 2015, Paul lived in the same apartment complex on [[Hollywood and Vine]] in [[Hollywood, California]] as other social media celebrities including [[List_of_Playboy Playmates of 2011#October|Amanda Cerny]], [[Juanpa Zurita]], and [[King Bach|Andrew Bachelor]], with his roommates Mark Dohner and [[Evan Eckenrode]]. This proximity facilitated various collaborations on their respective videos.<ref name="CBSNews" /> In October 2017, Paul and Eckenrode relocated to an estate in [[Encino, California]].<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube star Logan Paul snaps up a prized Encino estate for $6.55 million |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-logan-paul-encino-20171024-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

In July 2018, Paul and ''[[Marvel Studios|Marvel]]'s [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D]]'' actress [[Chloe Bennet]] confirmed that they were dating,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/news/2018/07/11/chloe-bennet-dating-logan-paul/ |title=Chloe Bennet from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. confirms she's dating Logan Paul |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 11, 2018 |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref> having been close since July 2017 after having met on the set of ''[[Valley Girl (2020 film)|Valley Girl]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chloe-bennet-logan-paul-dating-rumors |title= Chloe Bennet and Logan Paul Address Dating Rumors in Video Blog |website=Teen Vogue |first=Brianna |last=Wiest |date=July 7, 2017 |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref> They split in September 2018.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chiu |first1=Melody |last2=Stone |first2=Natalie |url=https://people.com/tv/chloe-bennet-and-logan-paul-split/ |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Chloe Bennet and YouTuber Logan Paul Split |website=People |date=October 16, 2018 |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref>

From April to November 2020, Paul dated model [[Josie Canseco]], daughter of retired MLB player [[Jose Canseco]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-16|title=Who Has Logan Paul Dated?

In episode 198 of ''Impaulsive'', [[Carl Lentz]], who was pastor of [[Hillsong Church]] [[New York City|NYC]] at the time, discussed religion with Paul, who described himself as "not overly religious". He specified that he believes in a [[Creator deity|"creator"]], but he doesn't know what this creator's role would be in human's lives. The episode garnered mockery toward Paul, who initially claimed that Jews believe in [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] as their god, before being corrected.<ref>{{cite web |title=WHAT RELIGION SHOULD YOU BELIEVE IN? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2SG--lhu1c&ab_channel=ImpaulsiveClips |website=YouTube |publisher=Impaulsive |accessdate=5 November 2020}}</ref>

===Health===
Paul claims he is [[red-green colorblind]]. However, he has been parodied and criticized by [[YouTube personalities]] such as [[h3h3 Productions|Ethan Klein]] and [[iDubbbz]] for faking his reactions in a video in which he used [[Color blindness#Lenses|color-corrective glasses]] for the first time. Paul himself admits that he "embellished" and "exaggerated his reactions" to the glasses, but added that he "did not lie" about his impairment.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dryden |first=Liam |title=Logan Paul Addresses Allegations He Faked His Colourblindness |url=http://www.wetheunicorns.com/news/logan-paul-allegations-colourblindness/ |access-date=January 21, 2018 |work=We The Unicorns |date=September 5, 2017}}</ref>

In February 2019, Paul claimed that he has long-term [[brain damage]], which he sustained from playing high school football. He claims it affects his ability to have [[empathy]] and a human connection with others.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/logan-paul-brain-damage-youtube/ |title=Logan Paul says he has brain damage that affects his empathy |date=February 25, 2019 |website=The Daily Dot |access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref>
