Bayh was elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1998 to the seat that was once held by his father. He won with 64% of the vote, the largest margin ever recorded for a Democrat in a U.S. Senate race in Indiana, defeating former [[Fort Wayne]] Mayor [[Paul Helmke]].

===Relationship between his Senate office and wife's corporate career===

[[Susan Bayh]], Evan Bayh's wife, has been described by the Fort Wayne ''[[The Journal Gazette|Journal Gazette]]'' as a "professional board member" or "professional director", having been a director of fourteen corporations since 1994 and being a director of eight as of 2006.<ref name="acrosstheboards"/>

The ''Journal Gazette'' reported that since Susan Bayh began her career as a corporate director, "Sen. Evan Bayh [has] cast more than 3,000 votes, including some on issues of keen interest to the pharmaceutical, broadcast, insurance, food-distribution and finance industries".<ref name="acrosstheboards">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Sylvia|title=Across the boards|newspaper=Fort Wayne Journal Gazette|date=December 16, 2007|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071216/LOCAL1004/712160424|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625081716/http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071216%2FLOCAL1004%2F712160424|archive-date=June 25, 2008|accessdate=2008-07-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since 2003, Bayh prohibited his staff from having [[lobbying]] contacts with his wife or representatives of the companies she directs. Bayh has insisted his wife's ties have had no bearing on his congressional actions. "The reality is I don't even know the people who run the vast majority of her companies. I've never even spoken to them," Bayh told the ''Journal Gazette''. "The reality is, we don't talk about stuff that she's involved with."<ref name="acrosstheboards"/>
