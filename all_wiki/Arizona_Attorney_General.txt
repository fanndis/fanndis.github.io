The '''Arizona Attorney General''' is the [[chief legal officer]] of the state of [[Arizona]],<ref name="AZAG-power_ARS41-192"/> in the [[United States]]. This state officer is the head of the Arizona Department of Law,<ref>{{cite web |title=A.R.S. §41-193 {{!}} Department of law; composition; powers and duties |url=https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/41/00193.htm |department=Arizona State Legislature |publisher=State of Arizona |accessdate=18 January 2019 |ref=AZAG-power_ARS41-193 | quote=The department of law shall be composed of the attorney general and the subdivisions of the department created as provided in this article [...] (A.R.S. §41-193).}}</ref> more commonly known as the Arizona Attorney General's Office. The state attorney general is a [[Arizona Constitution|constitutionally]]-established officer, elected by the people of the state to a four-year term.

==Qualifications==
The Arizona Constitution requires all of the officers in the state's executive department, including the attorney general, to be at least 25 years old, a U.S. citizen for 10 years and an Arizona resident for five years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Arizona Constitution, article 5, section 2 |url=https://www.azleg.gov/viewDocument/?docName=http://www.azleg.gov/const/5/2.htm |department=Arizona State Legislature |publisher=State of Arizona |accessdate=18 January 2019 |ref=AZAG-eligibility |quote=No person shall be eligible to any of the offices mentioned in section 1 of this article except a person of the age of not less than twenty-five years, who shall have been for ten years next preceding his election a citizen of the United States, and for five years next preceding his election a citizen of Arizona (Arizona Const., article 5, section 2).}}</ref>

Arizona law further requires the attorney general to have been a "practicing attorney before the supreme court of the state" for at least five years before taking office,<ref>{{cite web |title=A.R.S. §41-191(A) {{!}} Attorney general; qualifications; salary; assistants; fees; exceptions; outside counsel |url=https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/41/00191.htm |department=Arizona State Legislature |publisher=State of Arizona |accessdate=18 January 2019 |quote=The attorney general shall have been for not less than five years immediately preceding the date of taking office a practicing attorney before the supreme court of the state. He is entitled to receive an annual salary pursuant to section 41-190 (A.R.S. §41-191(A).}}</ref> however the [[Arizona Supreme Court]] ruled the law unconstitutional during the appointment process of [[Jack LaSota]] in 1977; LaSota had not renewed his state bar membership and was therefore not considered a practicing attorney.<ref>{{cite web |title=State ex rel.

== Powers and duties ==
While the [[Arizona Constitution|state constitution]] establishes the office of Attorney General, it does not prescribe the powers of the office. Instead, the Arizona Constitution expressly provides that the powers and duties of the state attorney general are to be prescribed by the [[Arizona State Legislature]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Arizona Constitution, Article V, §9 |url=https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/ |department=Arizona State Legislature |publisher=State of Arizona |accessdate=4 February 2019 |quote=The powers and duties of secretary of state, state treasurer, attorney-general, and superintendent of public instruction shall be as prescribed by law.}}</ref> In pursuance of this constitutional mandate, the Arizona Legislature has prescribed that, under [[Arizona Revised Statutes|A.R.S.]] §41-193(A)(1) – §41-193(A)(8), the Attorney General of Arizona, through the Arizona Department of Law, shall:
