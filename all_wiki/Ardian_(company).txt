==History==

Originally a subsidiary of [[Axa]], the company operated under the name AXA Private Equity until 2013, when the firm achieved independent status and was renamed to Ardian.

In 1996, [[Claude Bébéar]], founder and former Axa CEO, tasked Dominique Senequier with the creation of a [[private equity]] entity at Axa. Based in Paris, Axa Private Equity started off with ten clients and €100 million worth of assets.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.lesechos.fr/15/10/2010/LesEchos/20785-621-ECH_dominique-senequier-le-private-equity-a-la-francaise.htm | newspaper=Les Echos | title=Dominique Senequier Le private équity à la française | language=fr | date=15 October 2010}}</ref> The first investment took place in 1998 in the GSI Banque company Linedata.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linedata.com/about-us/our-history/ | publisher=Linedata | title=Our history | access-date=9 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012065821/http://www.linedata.com/about-us/our-history/ | archive-date=12 October 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
