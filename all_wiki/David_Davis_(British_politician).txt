'''David Michael Davis''' [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] (born 23 December 1948) is a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician who served as [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]] from July 2016 to July 2018 and has served as [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]. He was previously elected to the House of Commons for [[Boothferry (UK Parliament constituency)|Boothferry]] in [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], and reelected in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]. Davis was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in the [[1997 New Year Honours]], having previously been [[Minister of State for Europe]] from 1994 to 1997.

He was brought up on the Aboyne Estate, a [[council estate]] in [[Tooting]], [[List of sub regions used in the London Plan|South West London]]. After attending [[Bec Grammar School]] in Tooting, he went on to gain a master's degree in business at the age of 25, and went into a career with [[Tate & Lyle]]. Having entered Parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, he was appointed Europe Minister by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] in July 1994. He held that position until the 1997 general election. He subsequently was [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Conservative Party Chairman]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government|Shadow Secretary of State for the Office of Deputy Prime Minister]].

Between 2003 and 2008, he was the [[Shadow Home Secretary]] in the Shadow Cabinets of both [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. Davis had previously been a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in [[2001 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2001]] and [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2005]], coming fourth and second respectively. On 12 June 2008, Davis unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as an MP, and was immediately replaced as Shadow Home Secretary; this was in order to force a [[by-election]] in his seat for which he intended to seek re-election by mounting [[David Davis by-election campaign, 2008|a specific campaign]] designed to provoke wider public debate about the erosion of [[civil liberties in the United Kingdom]]. Following his [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|formal resignation as an MP]] he became the Conservative candidate in the [[2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election|resulting by-election]], which he won a month later. In 2012, together with [[Liam Fox]], he founded [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] pressure group Conservative Voice to amplify the voice of grassroots members, which Davis thought was getting lost in the party.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9535377/David-Davis-and-Liam-Fox-form-new-Conservative-Voice-group-to-promote-traditional-values.html |title=David Davis and Liam Fox form new Conservative Voice group to promote traditional values |accessdate=15 January 2018 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227191451/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9535377/David-Davis-and-Liam-Fox-form-new-Conservative-Voice-group-to-promote-traditional-values.html |archive-date=27 December 2017|date=11 September 2012 |last1=Prince |first1=Rosa }}</ref>

In July 2016, following a [[Referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union|referendum]] in which a majority of those voting supported leaving the [[European Union]], he was appointed by new Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] to the brand-new [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] (DExEU) as Secretary of State, with responsibility for negotiating the UK's prospective exit from the EU. He was sidelined mid-way through the talks, with the [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Europe Adviser]] [[Olly Robbins]] taking charge of negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/olly-robbins-resign-left-brexit-negotiator-thersea-may-a8980981.html|work=The Independent|last=Rahim|first=Zamira|date=30 June 2019|title=Olly Robbins: UK's lead Brexit negotiator 'set to quit role this summer'|accessdate=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630135243/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/olly-robbins-resign-left-brexit-negotiator-thersea-may-a8980981.html|archive-date=30 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-davis-sidelined-as-brussels-tries-to-undermine-him-zw2vvhd7s|work=The Times|last=Wright|first=Oliver|date=28 December 2017|title=David Davis sidelined as Brussels tries to undermine him|accessdate=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701163834/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-davis-sidelined-as-brussels-tries-to-undermine-him-zw2vvhd7s|archive-date=1 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/6086dd60-834f-11e8-96dd-fa565ec55929|work=Financial Times|last=Parker|first=George|date=9 July 2018|title= David Davis departure comes after sidelining by Theresa May|accessdate=9 January 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

His maternal grandfather, Walter Harrison, was the son of a wealthy [[Fishing trawler|trawlerman]] but was disinherited after joining the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]; he led a [[Hunger marches|'hunger march']] to London shortly after the more famous [[Jarrow March]], which did not allow Communists to participate.<ref>{{cite news |last=Norfolk |first=Andrew |date=7 October 2005 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article575777.ece |title=Davis's grandfather and the Jarrow crusade that wasn't |work=The Times |accessdate=7 July 2008 |location=London}} {{subscription required}}</ref> His father, whom he met once after his mother's death, is Welsh.<ref name="DIDiscs DD" /> After his mother married Ronald Davis, the family moved to London, where they lived initially in a flat in [[Wandsworth]] which Davis has described as "a terrible little slum". Later, after his half-sister was born, the family moved to a council estate in Tooting, his stepfather being a shop steward at [[Battersea Power Station]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Bower |first=Tom |title=The New Thatcher? |date=11 July 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/11/conservatives.daviddavis |work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 September 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927202345/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/11/conservatives.daviddavis |archive-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>

On leaving Bec Grammar School in Tooting, his [[A Level]] results were not good enough to secure a university place, so Davis worked as an insurance clerk and became an [[infantry]] soldier in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]'s [[Artists' Rifles|21 SAS (Artists)]] Regiment, in order to earn the money to retake his examinations. After doing so, he was able to win a place at the [[University of Warwick]] (BSc [[British undergraduate degree classification|Joint Hons]] Molecular Science/Computer Science 1968â€“71). Whilst at Warwick, he was one of the founding members of the student radio station, [[Radio Warwick|University Radio Warwick]] and he founded a men's choir.<ref name="men's choir">{{cite news |title=Choir university of Warwick |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/musiccentre/ensembles/vocal/chamberchoir/ |date=29 August 2017 |location=Warwick |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602170720/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/musiccentre/ensembles/vocal/chamberchoir |archive-date=2 June 2017}}</ref> He went straight on from there to [[London Business School]], where he earned a master's degree in business (1971â€“73), and later attended [[Harvard Business School]]'s six-week Advanced Management Program (1984â€“85).

Davis worked for [[Tate & Lyle]] for 17 years, rising to become a senior executive, including restructuring its troubled Canadian subsidiary, [[Redpath Sugar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/08/24/cntory24.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=What worked on the sugar beat... |accessdate=7 July 2008 |location=London |first=George |last=Trefgarne |date=24 August 2005}}</ref> He wrote about his business experiences in the 1988 book ''How to Turn Round a Company''.

== Political career ==
Whilst a student, Davis was active in the [[Federation of Conservative Students]], becoming national chairman in 1973.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article534245.ece |title=The backstreet bruiser hoping to knock sense into the Tories |newspaper=The Times |date=17 June 2005 |location=London |first=Andrew |last=Pierce |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523090318/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article534245.ece |archive-date=23 May 2011}}</ref>

Davis was first elected to Parliament in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] as the MP for [[Boothferry (UK Parliament constituency)|Boothferry]] which, in 1997, became the constituency of [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]]. He was a government [[Whip (politics)|whip]] when parliament voted on the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1992, angering many of the [[Maastricht Rebels]] on his own right-wing of the party. Davis's progression through the Conservative ranks eventually led to him becoming a Minister of State at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (1994â€“97).

He rejected a shadow ministerial position under [[William Hague]], opting instead to chair the Public Accounts Committee.<ref name="indy2005">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Colin |title=David Davis: 'I was dead lucky ... now opportunities are shrinking' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/david-davis-i-was-dead-lucky-now-opportunities-are-shrinking-296664.html |accessdate=22 July 2016 |newspaper=Independent |date=3 July 2005 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820063615/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/david-davis-i-was-dead-lucky-now-opportunities-are-shrinking-296664.html |archive-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>
In 1999, Davis presented the Parliamentary Control of the Executive Bill to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], in which he proposed to transfer ministerial exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative]] to the Commons in the following areas: the signing of treaties, the diplomatic recognition of foreign governments; European Union legislation; the appointment of ministers, peers and ambassadors; the establishment of Royal Commissions; the proclamation of [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] unless subject to resolutions of the Commons; the exercise of the powers of the executive not made by statute; the declarations of states of emergency; the [[dissolution of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990622/debtext/90622-06.htm |title=Points of Order |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=7 July 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424162607/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990622/debtext/90622-06.htm |archive-date=24 April 2006}} See also: {{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmbills/123/1999123.htm |title=Parliamentary Control of the Executive Bill |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=7 July 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207064009/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmbills/123/1999123.htm |archive-date=7 December 2008}}</ref>

Davis used his first interview as [[Shadow Home Secretary]] in November 2003 to state his personal support for a reintroduction of the death penalty for people convicted of multiple murder "where there is clear evidence and no doubt" surrounding the offender's guilt, citing "Yorkshire Ripper" [[Peter Sutcliffe]] and [[Moors Murders|Moors Murderer]] [[Ian Brady]] as examples of offenders who would fall into this category. This interview came almost 40 years after the abolition of the death penalty for murder.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bring-back-death-penalty-says-tory-spokesman-78687.html |title=Bring back death penalty says Tory spokesman |work=The Independent |location=London |first=Andy |last=McSmith |date=16 November 2003 |accessdate=13 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820080202/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bring-back-death-penalty-says-tory-spokesman-78687.html |archive-date=20 August 2016 }}</ref> As Shadow Home Secretary, Davis turned the Conservatives away from the Labour Party's plan to reintroduce identity cards,<ref name="handp">{{cite journal |last=Agar |first=Jon |url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-33.html |title=Identity cards in Britain: past experience and policy implications |journal=History and Policy |date=November 2005 |accessdate=7 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517225108/http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-33.html |archive-date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> citing spiralling costs and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] issues. He turned initial Conservative support into one of concern and abstention, making the final change to one of opposition much easier. Davis believed that once the true cost and unreliability of the ID card scheme was explained to the general public, they would turn against it. He was also credited by some commentators with "claiming the scalps" of two Labour ministers, [[David Blunkett]] and [[Beverley Hughes]], after both were forced to resign.<ref name="indy2005" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Contender: David Davis |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4636559.stm |accessdate=22 July 2016 |publisher=BBC |date=24 October 2005 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729100047/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4636559.stm |archive-date=29 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/david-davis-profile-the-brawler-date-with-destiny/|title=The Brawler|date=13 December 2017|work=POLITICO|accessdate=9 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910014721/https://www.politico.eu/article/david-davis-profile-the-brawler-date-with-destiny/|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 2005 leadership contest ===
At the time of the [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2005 Conservative leadership contest]], David Davis was Shadow Secretary of State for the Home Department. His Campaign Manager in the leadership contest was Conservative MP and Davis's deputy as Shadow Home Secretary, [[Andrew Mitchell]] (who in 2010 became [[Secretary of State for International Development]] in Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]'s Cabinet).

In the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 18 October 2005, Davis came top with 62 votes. As this was less than the number of his declared supporters, it became clear that the Davis bid was losing momentum. The elimination of former Chancellor [[Kenneth Clarke]] left the bookmakers' favourite, [[David Cameron]], without a rival in the centre of the party. In the second ballot, held two days later on 20 October 2005, Cameron polled 90 votes, Davis 57 votes and [[Liam Fox]] was eliminated with 51 votes,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4360662.stm |title=Cameron and Davis top Tory poll |work=BBC News |date=20 October 2005 |accessdate=13 June 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215183539/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4360662.stm |archive-date=15 December 2006}}</ref> so Davis went through to the next stage with David Cameron.

In spite of a strong performance in a BBC ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' head-to-head debate in the final stage of the leadership contest, Davis could not match his rival's general popularity. Conservative party members voted to elect Cameron the new Conservative leader, Davis losing with 64,398 votes against Cameron's 134,446 votes. Cameron chose to re-appoint his rival as Shadow Home Secretary following his victory.

===Alleged leaking of government documents===

Davis is alleged to have played a role in the leaking of sensitive government documents when he was Shadow Home Secretary in 2007.

On 12 June 2008, Davis resigned from the Shadow Cabinet and announced his [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation as an MP]], in order to force a by-election, and cause a wider debate on the single issue of what he believed to be the erosion of [[civil liberties]].

At the time of Davis's resignation, the Labour MP [[Andy Burnham]] made a speech which was widely interpreted as falsely implying an inappropriate relationship between Davis and the then Director of [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], [[Shami Chakrabarti]].

=== Torture ===
During a House of Commons debate on 7 July 2009, Davis accused the UK government of [[outsourcing torture]], by allowing [[Rangzieb Ahmed]] to leave the country (even though the government had evidence against Ahmed, upon which Ahmed was later convicted for terrorism) to Pakistan, where it is said the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] was given the go-ahead by the British intelligence agencies to torture Ahmed. Davis further accused the government of trying to gag Ahmed, stopping him coming forward with his accusations after he had been imprisoned back in the UK.

He said, there was "an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's Contest strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice."<ref>{{cite hansard |house=House of Commons |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 07 July 2009 (pt 0020) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/debtext/90707-0020.htm |date=7 July 2009 |column=940 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709045503/http://www.publications.parliament.uk//pa//cm200809//cmhansrd//cm090707//debtext//90707-0020.htm |archivedate=9 July 2009 }}</ref>

In a November 2012 speech, he urged David Cameron to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU by 2014. He suggested to hold two votes, the first where voters would be asked whether they wanted to renegotiate current EU arrangements, and a second where they would be asked to either accept a renegotiated deal or leave the EU altogether.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9688281/David-Cameron-is-told-to-call-an-EU-referendum-by-2014.html|title=David Cameron is told to call an EU referendum by 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Tim|last=Ross|date=19 November 2012|access-date=25 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225223854/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9688281/David-Cameron-is-told-to-call-an-EU-referendum-by-2014.html|archive-date=25 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following [[George Osborne]]'s budget in 2014, Davis wrote for ''The Conservative Woman'', calling on Osborne to make the personal allowance fully transferable for single-earner families.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddavismp.com/david-davis-mp-writes-for-the-conservative-woman-end-the-bias-against-one-earner-families-make-the-10500-tax-allowance-fully-transferable/ |title=Rt Hon David Davis MP "David Davis MP writes for The Conservative Woman: End the bias against one-earner families.

In November 2017, Davis acknowledged that the negotiations with the EU were difficult, but appealed to European countries not to "put politics above prosperity", implying that by doing so, countries like Germany would harm their own economies.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/16/david-davis-warns-eu-not-to-put-politics-above-prosperity-in-brexit-talks |title=David Davis warns EU not to put 'politics above prosperity' in Brexit talks |last1=Mason |first1=Rowena |date=17 November 2017 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 November 2017 |last2=Boffey |first2=Daniel |issn=0261-3077 |last3=Oltermann |first3=Philip |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116215738/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/16/david-davis-warns-eu-not-to-put-politics-above-prosperity-in-brexit-talks |archive-date=16 November 2017}}</ref> He blamed Germany and France for blocking trade negotiations.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/17/david-davis-blames-germany-france-brexit-talks-deadlock |title=David Davis blames Germany and France for Brexit talks deadlock |last1=Weaver |first1=Matthew |date=17 November 2017 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 November 2017 |last2=McDonald |first2=and Henry |issn=0261-3077 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117094840/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/17/david-davis-blames-germany-france-brexit-talks-deadlock |archive-date=17 November 2017}}</ref> Davis also argued that the UK and the EU should agree a free trade deal more comprehensive in scope than "any the EU has agreed before."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/david-davis-trade-brexit-to-eu-dont-put-politics-before-prosperity/ |title=David Davis to EU: 'Don't put politics before prosperity' |date=16 November 2017 |work=POLITICO |accessdate=17 November 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117000345/https://www.politico.eu/article/david-davis-trade-brexit-to-eu-dont-put-politics-before-prosperity/ |archive-date=17 November 2017}}</ref>

Some politicians were angry because reports about the potential effect of Brexit on 58 economic sectors were severely edited before Davis gave them to the [[Exiting the European Union Select Committee]].

On 8 July 2018, Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary as he did not "believe" in the Prime Minister's [[Chequers plan|Brexit plan]].<ref name="resignation" /> Following that [[Steve Baker (politician)|Steve Baker]] also resigned.

=== Brexit transition negotiations ===
In January 2018, former [[Ireland|Irish]] prime minister, [[Bertie Ahern]], said Davis did not understand the implications of Brexit for Ireland's border with [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Merrick |first1=Rob |title=David Davis doesn't 'understand' Brexit's implications for Ireland's border, warns former Irish PM Bertie Ahern |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-davis-brexit-northern-ireland-border-customs-eu-bertie-ahern-dublin-prime-minister-a8177866.html |accessdate=8 February 2019 |work=The Independent |date=25 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209180030/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-davis-brexit-northern-ireland-border-customs-eu-bertie-ahern-dublin-prime-minister-a8177866.html |archive-date=9 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
