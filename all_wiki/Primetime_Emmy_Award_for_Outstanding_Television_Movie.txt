This is a list of the winners of the '''[[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Made for Television Movie''', which is awarded since 1992.

In 1991, '''Outstanding Drama or Comedy Special''' category was merged with '''[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series|Outstanding Miniseries]]''' category to form '''Outstanding Drama or Comedy Special and Miniseries''' and the number of nominations increased from five to six.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1991 |title=43rd Primetime Emmys Nominees and Winners |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]}}</ref> For this year, two miniseries had competed with four "made for television movies".
