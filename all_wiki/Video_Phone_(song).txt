"'''Video Phone'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] from her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The track was released as the eighth [[single (music)|single]] from the album on September 22, 2009. A remixed version featuring [[Lady Gaga]] was released on November 17, 2009. Musically, the song consists of simple lyrics and hidden innuendos, with Gaga and Beyoncé trading verses with each other in the song's remix. The lyrics refer to putting up a sexy display to be recorded on a video phone.

The song received generally mixed reviews from most music critics. Some noted that Gaga's featured appearance in the song's remix failed to add anything to the tune. The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its [[urban music]] chart, Spain, the United Kingdom and on the [[R&B]] charts in the United States. The remixed version charted at number sixty-five on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart in the country. The remix also charted in Australia and its urban music chart, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, while it bubbled under the main music charts of Belgium.

A music video was created to accompany the remix featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles in a number of costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) and [[pin-up model|pin-up]] legend [[Bettie Page]]. It received mixed feedback from critics, who called it un-interesting, and felt that it did not present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. In the United States, the video went on to win the [[BET]] award for Video of the Year.

==Critical reception==
The song received mixed reviews.  [[Alexis Petridis]] from ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared the song to "[[Diva (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Diva]]", stating that "Video Phone" is "Almost equally weird, but much better, [and it] introduces us to the unlikely figure of Beyoncé Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked?

For the collaboration, Fraser McAlpine from [[BBC Radio 1]] reviewed the song negatively, writing: "So anyway, this brings me to 'Video Phone' – and what exactly is the point of Gaga featuring in this song? I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and [[Rihanna]] put together), perhaps she should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs."<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2009/12/beyonc_lady_gaga_video_phone.shtml|title=Beyoncé & Lady GaGa – 'Video Phone'|last=McAlpine|first=Fraser|date=December 19, 2009|publisher=[[BBC Online]].

<blockquote>
"Needless to say, the pair work their superstar pulling power for all it's worth. Over sparse and eerie beats, they deliver innuendo-laced lyrics, groan near-orgasmically and generally tease us with the prospect of doing all sorts of naughty things on, well, your video phone. While the promo clip offers some of the intended thrill, the track itself - single number eight from ''I Am...'' - lacks the sparkle of previous offerings.

Let's do a real girl-power collaboration where we support one another.' I said, 'I want to do you in your video, and I want to tribute you. I want to dress up like you'. And Hype Williams ... was so excited. He was like, 'Gaga I want no makeup on your face.' It was really stripped down — real Beyoncé hair, and we wore the same outfit in the video, and I [paid tribute to] her. [...] I wanted to [work with her] because this was an era for her in her career where she defined herself aesthetically. And that should be applauded that a woman did that.

===Synopsis===
The video begins with Knowles walking down an alley, accompanied by several men in suits, an homage to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 1992 film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''.<ref name="mtvvid">{{cite news|first=James |last=Montgomery|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626404/20091116/knowles_beyonce.jhtml |title=Beyoncé And Lady Gaga's 'Video Phone' Clip: A Brightly Colored Fantasy Set To Life|publisher=MTV News.

When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and fires arrows at a cameraman who's strapped to a rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga wearing a pair of yellow [[Christian Louboutin|Louboutins]] heels. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to [[Bettie Page]], while handling several different [[firearm]]s.<ref name="mtvvid"/><ref name="nyd"/> Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images from the start of the video.<ref name="mtvvid"/>

===Reception===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="Now, because Gaga is just a guest in B[eyoncé]'s world, she has to tone down the crazy, which gives us a glimpse at what she would look like if she were just a normal pop star: No over-the-top costumes, silly makeup or razor sunglasses—just a good old wind machine, long perfect blond weave and leotard. Pretty underwhelming. But this is really Beyoncé's music video, so let's not forget about her. While the song is not 'Single Ladies' catchy, that doesn't stop B[eyoncé] from bringing the fierce, even when it means ripping off Rihanna's style at the beginning or Bettie Page in the middle. And she does look cute all '40s pinup style, so no complaints here."|source=&nbsp;—Jennifer Cady of E! Online talking about the video for "Video Phone".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/beyonceacute_lady_gaga_join_forces_meh/154106|title=Beyoncé and Lady Gaga Join Forces.

James Montgomery from MTV commented that "it's a little surprising that the just-released clip for Beyoncé's 'Video Phone' has nary a flame or fish-eye shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't make the mistake of thinking this video is by any means straightforward&nbsp;— it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. And neither is this video, for that matter. Especially not when you're watching Beyoncé snap her gum and shake her hips and grope an AK-47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool-Aid red."<ref name="mtvvid"/> Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry."<ref name="geeyonce">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626441/lady-gaga-paid-tribute-beyonce-video-phone-clip.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Paid Tribute To Beyonce In 'Video Phone' Clip|publisher=MTV.
