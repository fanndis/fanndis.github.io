The two main parties in the election were the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP), led by [[Khaleda Zia]], and the [[Bangladesh Awami League Party]], led by [[Sheikh Hasina]].

==Main political parties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
On 11 December, [[Bangladesh Awami League]] formed a coalition with the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] led by [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] once deposed through mass uprising. The coalition included some other minor parties. The [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], BNP in short, continued with its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami formed for the national election of 2001 to participate in the 2008 election. If Jatiyo Party wins more than 35 seats, it will be able to negotiate a better deal with Awami League on sharing of power and in forming government.

===Awami League-led coalition (Grand Alliance)===
The Bangladesh Awami League (AL) decided to participate in the 2008 parliamentary election under the name of "Grand Alliance" with the Jatiya Party led by General Ershad as its main partner. The AL contested the polls for 245 constituencies. Awami League conceded as many as 46 out of 300 parliamentary constituencies to Jatiya Party (JP).

[[Workers Party of Bangladesh|Workers Party]] president [[Rashed Khan Menon]] contested for Dhaka-8, its general secretary Bimal Biswas for Narail-1, its politburo member [[Fazle Hossain Badsha]] for Rajshahi-2, [[Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal]] president Hasanul Haq Inu for [[Kushtia-2]], its leaders Moinuddin Khan Badal for Chittagong-8, Rezaul Karim Tansen for Bogra-4, Shah Ahmed Jikrul for Brahmanbaria-5 and Gias Uddin for Mymensingh-9.

The Awami League kept the Noakhali-1 constituency reserved, where the election has been postponed following the death of Ganatantri Party leader Mohammad Nurul Islam in a mysterious fire. The alliance has kept three more seats (Nilphamari-4, Khulna-3 and Sylhet-3) open for both AL and JP candidates to contest for. Notably, as of 18 December 2008, some candidates were allowed by the High Court of the country notwithstanding a contrary decision from the Election Commission.

===BNP-led coalition (4-Party Alliance)===
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies contested for 296 out of 300 in the 2008 election. The Election Commission cancelled candidacy of nominees of BNP in four constituencies. The BNP and its allies could not reach a consensus on sharing six constituencies. [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh|Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]] contested in the election in 38 constituencies although BNP agreed to offer Jamaat 34 seats. BNP conceded two seats each to its three smaller allies which were [[Bangladesh Jatiya Party-BJP]], [[Islami Oikya Jote]] and Jamiat-e-Olama-e-Islam. BNP was able to place any candidate for four constituencies which were Barisal-1, Moulvibazar-2, Sirajganj-5 and Narail-2. However, two BNP rebels emerged as valid independent candidates in Barisal-1 and Moulvibazar-2. They were Jahiruddin Swapan in Barisal-1 and former lawmaker MM Shaheen in Moulvibazar-2. Notably, as of 18 December 2008, some candidates were allowed by the High Court of the country notwithstanding a contrary decision of the Election Commission.

==Formation of the caretaker government==
The BNP-Jamat led coalition government attempted to run an election in 2006. Awami League and other parties arranged various processions and strikes, protesting that the election result was pre-arranged in the government's favour. In course of time the clash between the Government and Opposition became very violent and in the Care-taker Government's period violence engulfed the nation. The President proclaimed his authority as the chief of the Care-Taker Government and eventually had to fall to the demand of the people. With the intervention of the Army the President had to resign from his Chief-Advisor's post and [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] was appointed as the new chief adviser.<ref>{{cite news |date=12 January 2007 |title=Bangladesh president appoints head of a new caretaker government |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-12-bangladesh_x.htm |work=USA Today |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The media referred to Ahmed's government as "military-backed".<ref>{{cite news |title=McCain hails Bangladesh elections |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7762328.stm |work=BBC News |date=3 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Stir against Islamist parties contesting Bangladesh polls |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/stir-against-islamist-parties-contesting-bangladesh-polls_100131436.html |newspaper=Thaindian News |agency=Indo-Asian News Service |date=16 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Das |first=Antara |date=10 December 2008 |title=The other general |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/the-other-general/396351/ |newspaper=The Indian Express}}</ref> The military-controlled government worked on a ''minus-two'' formula which meant ousting Hasina and Zia, who were two popular political leaders of the country. While all political activities were suspended under the state of emergency, the government ployed to recast the political system of the country with people of high national and international stature. In accordance with this plan, [[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] announced the foundation of a new party called [[Citizens' Power]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7006502326 |title=Bangladesh Nobel Laureate Announces His Political Party's Name (archived) |work=All Headline News |date=18 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220050932/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7006502326 |archivedate = 20 February 2007}}</ref> However, soon Yunus rejected entering politics, claiming a lack of support.

==Struggle for new elections==
[[File:National Assembly of Bangladesh (07).jpg|thumb|[[Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban]] (2014)]]
On 5 April 2007, the country's Chief Election Commissioner, ATM Shamsul Huda, declared that the elections would need to be pushed back at least eighteen months.<ref>{{cite news |title=No B'desh polls 'for 18 months' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6529517.stm |work=BBC News |date=5 April 2007}}</ref> On 12 April, Ahmed announced in a televised speech to the nation that the next parliamentary election would be held before the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007035048 |title=Chief Advisor Says Election In Bangladesh To Be Held Before End Of 2008 |work=All Headline News |date=13 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103021/http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007035048 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> On 15 July 2007, the [[Bangladesh Election Commission]] published a road map for the election, promising a compilation of voter lists by October 2008 and an official election call before the end of that year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Liton |first=Shakhawat |date=16 July 2007 |title=Voter list by Oct '08, poll by Dec |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/07/16/d7071601011.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> The [[constitution of Bangladesh]], however, provides holding election within 120 days of the formation of a [[caretaker government]].

After the election, the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]] will have to elect the next [[President of Bangladesh]]. The presidential election should have taken place by 5 September 2007 when [[Iajuddin Ahmed]]'s term expired. But the election was postponed as the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] permits to delay the presidential election until a new [[Jatiyo Sangshad]] is formed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dummet |first=Mark |date=5 September 2007 |title=Bangladesh president to continue |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6979350.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> On 9 September 2007, President Ahmed addressed the nation and recalled indoor politics with strict conditions to facilitate preparation for the election and reaffirmed his commitment to hold the election on time or earlier.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ban on indoor politics relaxed |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=3437 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=10 September 2008}}</ref> In early October, the [[Chief Election Commissioner of Bangladesh|Chief Election Commissioner]] Huda stated elections could be held by October 2008 if the electoral roll could be compiled by July 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/6279766.html |title=Bangladesh's elections may be held before October 2008 |work=People's Daily |date=10 October 2007 }}</ref>

[[File:Bangladeshi election, 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|Election banners of candidates promoted across many cities in Bangladesh]]
The BNP called for a delay of the election until January 2009, while the [[Awami League]] was against such a delay. As a compromise, the election was postponed from 18 to 29 December.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dummett |first=Mark |date=24 November 2008 |title=Bangladesh election is deferred |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7745188.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> In a response to the demand of the major political parties, on 17 December 2008, the two-year-long [[state of emergency]] was lifted.<ref>{{cite news |work=People's Daily |date=11 December 2008 |title=Bangladesh gov't to fully withdraw state of emergency from Dec. 17 |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6551177.html }}</ref>

==Supreme Court ruling==
Notably, as of 20 December, as many as 35 prospective candidates were allowed by the High Court of the country to contest in the election notwithstanding a contrary decision of the Election Commission. A winner among them will lose a seat in the parliament if the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] turns down the High Court decision.{{clarify|date=December 2011}}<!--what does thismean?-->
