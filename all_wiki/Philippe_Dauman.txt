===Legal issues===
On May 20, 2016, Dauman and George S. Abrams were removed from the trust that will control Redstone's media empire. Dauman said in a statement: "These steps are invalid and illegal.

Sumner Redstone would never have summarily dismissed Philippe Dauman and George Abrams, his trusted friends and advisers for decades".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/business/media/sumner-redstone-removes-viacom-chief-from-trust-and-parent-board.html|title=Viacom Chief Says Sumner Redstone Has Removed Him From Trust|date=21 May 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/viacom-ceo-says-he-has-been-removed-from-sumner-redstones-trust-1463802091|title=Viacom CEO Calls Attempt to Remove Him from Redstone Trust 'Illegal'|author=Keach Hagey|date=21 May 2016|work=WSJ|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-21/viacom-s-dauman-calls-removal-from-redstone-trust-illegal|title=Redstone's Empire Shaken as Viacom CEO Fights Ouster From Trust|author1=Lucas Shaw|author2=Edvard Pettersson|date=21 May 2016|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/20/exclusive-sumner-redstone-moves-to-oust-viacom-ceo-from-trust-that-will-control-viacom-and-cbs/|title=Redstone Ousts Viacom CEO from Trust That Will Control Viacom, CBS - Fortune|author=Peter Elkind|date=20 May 2016|work=Fortune|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> The statement also said that Dauman and Abrams' removal is "...a shameful effort by [[Shari Redstone]] to seize control by unlawfully using her ailing father Sumner Redstone’s name and signature."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-redstone-trust-idUSKCN0YC02K|title=Sumner Redstone removes Viacom CEO and board member from trust|author=Jessica Toonkel|date=21 May 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> Dauman filed suit against Shari Redstone in an effort to keep his position on the Trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-viacom-redstone-trust-idUSKCN0YE1NM|title=Viacom CEO Dauman sues to stay on Sumner Redstone trust|author=Jessica Toonkel|date=23 May 2016|work=Reuters|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Steel|first1=Emily|title=Viacom Chief Challenges Sumner Redstone's Competency in Lawsuit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/business/viacom-ceo-sumner-redstone-competency-lawsuit-philippe-dauman.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=23 May 2016|language=English|date=23 May 2016}}</ref> The suit was settled and Dauman stepped down in August, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/viacom-ceo-philippe-dauman-agrees-to-step-down-1471644446|title=Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman to Step Down in Settlement With National Amusements|author1=Joe Flint|author2=Sarah Rabil|date=19 Aug 2016|work=WSJ|accessdate=14 Aug 2020}}</ref>
