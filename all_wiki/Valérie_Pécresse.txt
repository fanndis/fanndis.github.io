== Political career ==
===Early beginnings===
In June 2002, Pécresse was elected deputy for [[Yvelines]] (2nd constituency). She was also elected [[Regional councils of France|regional counselor]] of [[Île-de-France]] in 2004. Pécresse was also the spokeswoman of the party in [[Yvelines]].

===Career in national politics===
In addition to her activities in local politics, Pécresse served as a Member of the [[National Assembly of France]] from 2002 until 2007.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-ministers/factbox-results-for-ministers-in-french-election-idUSL1045477020070610 FACTBOX: Results for ministers in French election] ''[[Reuters]]'', June 10, 2007.</ref> In parliament, she was a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (2002-2005) and the Committee on Cultural Affairs (2005-2007).<ref>[http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/deputes/fiche/OMC_PA267605 Valérie Pécresse] [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].</ref> In 2004, she became the spokeswoman for [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who was then leader of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]].<ref>[[D.

From 2007 until 2011, Pécresse served as Minister of Higher Education and Research in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[François Fillon]]. During her time in office, she launched many reforms in an effort to give universities a greater degree of autonomy over their resources and open the way for more private sector financing. The reforms caused a [[2007–09 university protests in France|wave of strikes]].<ref>Anna Willard (November 27, 2007), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-students/french-students-hold-fresh-protests-against-reform-idUSL2652256420071127 French students hold fresh protests against reform] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Esther Bintliff (May 15, 2009), [https://www.ft.com/content/886924dc-417d-11de-bdb7-00144feabdc0 French students rue wasted semester] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In 2009, the [[Académie de la Carpette anglaise]], an organization that opposes the spread of the English language in Francophone countries, gave Pécresse the Prix de la Carpette Anglaise ("English Doormat Prize") for having refused to speak French at international meetings in [[Brussels]], Belgium; Pécresse had stated that English was the easiest means of communication.<ref name="carpette">{{cite web | first=Hugh | last=Schofiel | date=22 January 2009 | accessdate=25 January 2009 | title=New lingua franca upsets French |work=BBC News   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7844192.stm}}</ref>

At the same time, Pécresse was described by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as one of the most successful of Sarkozy’s ministers and considered as a candidate to succeed [[Christine Lagarde]] as [[Ministry of the Economy and Finance (France)|Minister of the Economy and Finance]] in 2011.<ref>Peggy Hollinger (June 29, 2011) [https://www.ft.com/content/ff6f4f5a-a19f-11e0-b9f9-00144feabdc0 Sarkozy prepares to name Lagarde successor] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> 

From 2011 until 2012, Pécresse served as the government's spokeswoman and as Minister of Budget, Public Accounts and State Reform in Fillon's [[Third Fillon government|third cabinet]], succeeding [[François Baroin]].<ref>Nicholas Vinocur (June 29, 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/france-government/french-sarkozy-to-name-replacement-finance-minister-idUSLDE75S07E20110629 French Sarkozy to name replacement finance minister] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Emmanuel Jarry (June 29, 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/france-government-baroin/french-govt-names-baroin-as-new-finance-minister-idUSP6E7HO00R20110629 French govt names Baroin as new finance minister] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In this capacity, she opposed increases in the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]] for 2013.<ref>Toby Vogel (April 25, 2012) [https://www.politico.eu/article/meps-prepare-to-call-for-greater-budget-increase/ MEPs prepare to call for greater budget increase] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref> In the 2011 local elections, she notably went against official [[Party line (politics)|party line]], led by then UMP leader [[Jean-François Copé]], not to direct the party’s supporters how to vote; instead, she said she would rather vote for the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) in the case of a runoff against the [[National Rally|National Front]] (FN).<ref>Angelique Chrisafis (March 21, 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/21/french-local-elections-sarkozy-pen French local elections leave Sarkozy party in disarray] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> 

After the defeat of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in the [[2012 French presidential election]], Pécresse remained a key member of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) and its successor, the Republicans (LR). She returned to the National Assembly, where she served on the Finance Committee from 2012 until 2016.<ref>[http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/deputes/fiche/OMC_PA267605 Valérie Pécresse] [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].</ref> In September 2014, she joined Fillon, [[Étienne Blanc]], [[Éric Ciotti]] and [[Pierre Lellouche]] on an official trip to [[Iraq]].<ref>Brune Jeudy (August 31, 2014) [https://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/Francois-Fillon-en-Irak-pour-soutenir-les-chretiens-d-Orient-683702 Fillon en Irak pour soutenir les chrétiens d'Orient] ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]''.</ref>

===President of the Regional Council of Île-de-France===
In December 2015, Pécresse led a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] parties, which narrowly won the [[Île-de-France]] [[2015 French regional elections|regional election]], defeating the Union of the Left, a coalition of socialists and ecologists. She became the first woman to hold the office of president of the Regional Council of Île-de-France. 

In the party’s [[2016 The Republicans (France) presidential primary|2016 presidential primaries]] Pécresse endorsed former prime minister [[Alain Juppé]].<ref>Nicholas Vinocur (November 3, 2016) [https://www.politico.eu/article/alain-juppe-faces-toughest-test-yet-in-french-tv-debate-francois-hollande-party-conservative/ Alain Juppé faces toughest test yet in French TV debate] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref> Amid the [[Fillon affair]], in March 2017, she joined [[Xavier Bertrand]], [[Christian Estrosi]] and others in calling for Juppé to replace [[François Fillon]] as the party’s candidate.<ref>John Irish (March 5, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN16C0JC French conservative party heavyweights to push for Fillon alternative, says senior politician] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>John Irish and Andrew Callus (March 5, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN16C0G5 French conservatives in disarray as Fillon clings on] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Ahead of the Republicans’ [[2017 The Republicans (France) leadership election|2017 leadership elections]], Pécresse founded her own political movement ''[[Soyons Libres|Libres!]]'' in July 2017. She also publicly opposed newly elected LR chairman [[Laurent Wauquiez]], warning against his possible “porosity” to the far-right [[National Rally|National Front]]’s (FN) ideas.<ref>Ingrid Melander (September 3, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1BE0YR 'The right is back,' says frontrunner to lead French conservatives] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Kim Willsher (December 10, 2017) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/10/france-opposition-set-to-lurch-toward-far-right-by-electing-new-leader French opposition elects hard-right leaning leader] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> She later announced her resignation from LR on 5 June 2019, three days after Wauquiez’s resignation from the presidency of the party.<ref>{{cite news|author=Marion Mourgue|title=Valérie Pécresse annonce sa démission des Républicains|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/valerie-pecresse-annonce-sa-demission-des-republicains-20190605|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=5 June 2019|accessdate=5 June 2019}}</ref>

In response to the [[Brexit]] vote in 2016, Pécresse helped launch an initiative of corporate leaders and politicians – including [[Anne Hidalgo]], [[Gérard Mestrallet]] and [[Christian Noyer]] – to attract business from London.<ref>Michael Stothard (October 31, 2016), [https://www.ft.com/content/26f385c6-9e8b-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 France sets up team in Brexit push to lure business from London] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref><ref>Mark Deen (November 3, 2016), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-03/weekend-in-frankfurt-france-courts-british-firms-fleeing-brexit France Sets Up One-Stop Shop for British Firms Fleeing Brexit] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> She has since been saying publicly that France was rolling out the “red-white-and-blue carpet” for UK bankers.<ref>Michael Stothard (July 7, 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/464c67d8-630e-11e7-91a7-502f7ee26895 Paris rolls out ‘red-white-and-blue carpet’ for banks] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In 2019, Pécresse announced plans to boost the number of people in the Paris region who cycle to work by investing 100 million euros ($113 million) in new cycle lanes and infrastructure and a subsidized electric bike rental scheme before 2021.<ref>Geert De Clercq (March 13, 2019), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-paris-bicycles-idUSKCN1QU2KO Paris region to boost cycle commuting with bike parks and e-bikes] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

== Political positions ==
In response to the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks]], Pécresse said France needed its own version of the [[Patriot Act]].<ref>Matt Apuzzo and Steven Erlanger (January 16, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/world/europe/patriot-act-idea-rises-in-france-and-is-ridiculed.html Patriot Act Idea Rises in France, and Is Ridiculed] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In a 2016 [[op-ed]] published by Sunday newspaper ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'', Pécresse joined sixteen other high-profile women from across the political spectrum – , including [[Élisabeth Guigou]], [[Christine Lagarde]], and [[Fleur Pellerin]] – in making a public vow to expose “all sexist remarks, inappropriate gestures and behaviour.”<ref>Kim Willsher (May 15, 2016) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/15/french-former-ministers-launch-attack-on-sexism-in-politics French former ministers launch attack on sexism in politics] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref><ref>Arnau Busquets Guàrdia (May 16, 2016) [https://www.politico.eu/article/christine-lagarde-ministers-warn-sexual-harassment-immunity-in-france-is-over-denis-baupin/ Christine Lagarde, ministers warn sexual harassment ‘immunity’ in France is over] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

When founding ''Libres!'' in 2017, Pécresse told Sunday newspaper ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'' she would seek to position her grouping between those who had joined Macron’s [[First Philippe government|government]] – including [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Édouard Philippe]] – and those who would follow a line she called “aggressive opposition,” and which has gathered around the party’s right wing.<ref>Emmanuel Jarry and Maya Nikolaeva (July 9, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-politics/french-conservative-heavyweight-pecresse-to-lead-political-splinter-group-idUSKBN19U0LH French conservative heavyweight Pecresse to lead political splinter group] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Following the [[murder of Samuel Paty]] in 2020, Pécresse argued for lifting restrictions on [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] and using artificial intelligence to fight terrorism on public transport networks.<ref>Nicholas Vinocur (October 30, 2020), [https://www.politico.eu/article/french-politicians-urge-deployment-of-surveillance-technology-after-series-of-attacks/ French politicians urge deployment of surveillance technology after series of attacks] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

Also in 2020, Pécresse expressed her opposition against [[Postal voting|mail-in voting]] to facilitate voting during the public health crisis caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in France]].<ref>Pierre-Paul Bermingham (November 16, 2020), [https://www.politico.eu/article/france-is-split-over-american-mail-in-ballots-2021-regional-election/ France split over ‘American’ mail-in ballots for 2021 regional elections] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

==Personal life==
Pécresse has been married to former investment banker and [[Alstom]] manager Jérôme Pécresse since 1994.
