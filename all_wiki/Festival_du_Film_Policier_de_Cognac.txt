The '''Festival du Film policier de Cognac''' ({{lang-en|'''Cognac Crime Film Festival'''}}) was an annual film festival that took place in [[Cognac, France]] from 1982 to 2007 (with no festival being held in 1991).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Cognac_Festival_du_Film_Policier/ Cognac Festival du Film Policier] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> The festival focused on the police/crime genre and also featured a short and a television film competition after 1993.<br />
Capitalizing on the notoriety of the film festival, an unrelated crime book convention named Polar : Le Festival was inaugurated in 1996.

In 2007, the wine syndicate Bureau National Interprofessionel du Cognac announced that it was withdrawing its support of the 25-year-old film event.
Without its main backer, the festival's days in Cognac came to an end.<br />
However another famed wine city, [[Beaune|Beaune, Côte d'Or]], saw value in the format and launched a successor in 2009, the Festival international du Film policier de Beaune.<br />
Since 2010, the Cognac-based Polar : Le Festival - originally a strictly literary event - has incorporated a film competition, albeit on a much smaller scale, to compensate for the loss of the original film festival to Beaune.
