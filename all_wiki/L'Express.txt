When founded during the [[First Indochina War]], it was modelled on the [[United States|US]] magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref name=chs/> and the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.<ref name=wleaks>{{cite web|title=Weekly Magazines: Second in a Series on French Media|url=https://cablegatesearch.wikileaks.org/cable.php?id=06PARIS7635|work=Wikileaks|accessdate=1 November 2014|date=1 December 2006}}</ref> ''L'Express'' is published weekly.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christoph Fiedler|title=Processing for direct marketing in the context of the trade journal, magazine and newspaper sector|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201303/20130318ATT63404/20130318ATT63404EN.pdf|publisher=European Magazine Media Association|accessdate=7 December 2014|location=Brussels|date=17 December 2012}}</ref>

The magazine was supportive of the policies of [[Pierre Mendès-France]] in Indochina, and in general had a [[left-wing politics|left-of-centre]] orientation. The magazine opposed the war in [[Algerian War|Algeria]], and especially the use of [[Torture during the Algerian War|torture]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/nov/09/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber] The Guardian, 9 November 2006</ref> In March 1958, as a result of an article of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] reviewing the book ''[[La Question]]'' by [[Henri Alleg]], the magazine was prevented from being published by the French Government. In order to resume publication, ''L'Express'' had to print a new issue without the incriminated article. [[François Mauriac]] was a regular contributor with his ''Bloc-Notes'' column but left ''L'Express'' when [[Charles De Gaulle]] returned to power.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1964, a number of journalists, including [[Jean Daniel]] and [[André Gorz]], quit ''L'Express'' to found ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. Servan-Schreiber turned ''L'Express'' into a less politically engaged publication, and the circulation rose from 150,000 to 500,000 copies in three years.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1971, as a result of Servan-Schreiber's political activities as a deputy of the Radical Party, nine journalists of ''L'Express'', including [[Claude Imbert]], left the magazine and created ''[[Le Point]]'' to counter what they perceived as the "current breed of French intellectuals in the press and elsewhere, with their leftist dogmas and complacent nihilism".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944545-1,00.html "Making Le Point"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 27 November 1972.</ref>

In 1977, Servan-Schreiber sold his magazine to [[Jimmy Goldsmith]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article628663.ece Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber] ''The Times'', 8 November 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914906,00.html Sir Jimmy's Cross-Channel Fiefdom] ''TIME Magazine'', 18 April 1977</ref>

[[Jean-François Revel]] became director in October 1978. He was replaced by [[Yves Cuau]] in May 1981. The same year the magazine had a circulation of 507,000 copies.<ref name=kuhn>{{cite book|author=Raymond Kuhn|title=The Media in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t-KAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA68|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=7 April 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-98053-6|page=68}}</ref>

In 1986, ''L'Express'' started a news exchange cooperation with the [[Belgium]]-based French language news magazine ''[[Le Vif/L’Express]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Vif/L'Express|url=http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/source-information/564521-le-vifl-express|work=VoxEurop|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>

In 1995, ''L'Express'' was sold to CEP communications, a filial of [[Havas]]. Then [[Denis Jeambar]] became the new director.

In 1998, after Vivendi took control of Havas, the magazine returned under its control. After the collapse of Vivendi, ''L'Express'' was sold in 2002 to [[Socpresse]] (80% owned by [[Dassault Group]]).

In the period of 2001-2002 ''L'Express'' had a circulation of 424,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 50 Finance/Business/News magazines worldwide (by circulation) |url=http://www.magazine.org.tw/events/school/report/wmt/top50finance.pdf |work=Magazine Organization |accessdate=13 December 2014 |format=Report |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213185512/http://www.magazine.org.tw/events/school/report/wmt/top50finance.pdf |archivedate=13 December 2014 }}</ref> It was 548,195 copies during the period of 2003-2004.<ref>{{cite book|author=E.
