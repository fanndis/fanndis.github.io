==Early life and broadcasting career==
De Castro was born in the town of [[Pola, Oriental Mindoro|Pola]], [[Oriental Mindoro]] at 4:00 pm on July 6, 1949.<ref name="ABS-CBN profile"/> He is the fifth child of Manuel de Castro Sr. (born c. 1909) and Demetria (née Leuterio, born c. 1911).<ref name="site2"/><ref name="site3"/> He studied at the [[University of the East]] in 1971 with a degree in Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in Banking and Finance, and a doctorate degree ''[[Honoris causa]]'' from the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]].

De Castro began his career as a broadcaster during the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos dictatorship]], when press freedom was suppressed. He worked as a field reporter for Johnny de Leon, a popular radio announcer at the time. He later became a radio announcer in [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]]'s [[DWWW]] station from 1982 to 1986.

After the [[People Power Revolution|ouster]] of Marcos in 1986, de Castro joined [[ABS-CBN]]. He got his break into television as the segment host for "At Your Service" of [[Magandang Umaga Po|Good Morning, Philippines]]. He also joined [[DZMM]], a radio station of ABS-CBN, as the anchorman of ''Kabayan''. It was because of the popularity of the program that he gained the nickname "''Kabayan'' Noli."

In 1987, de Castro became an anchor on ''[[Magandang Gabi, Bayan]]'' (''Good Evening, Nation'') and anchorman of the news and public affairs hit, ''[[TV Patrol]]''. In July 1996, he became the sole anchor of the newscast and in January 1999 he became the newscast's overall head of production and became the vice president of DZMM.

In the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine election]], de Castro ran for vice president. He won by a narrow margin over Senator [[Loren Legarda]], but an electoral protest was filed by the latter. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], acting as the [[Presidential Electoral Tribunal]] (PET), dismissed the protest.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=106049 Abs-Cbn Interactive, PET junks Loren's VP electoral protest]</ref><ref>{{Cite court|litigants=Loren B.

As HUDCC Chair, Vice President de Castro also serves as ex official Chairman of the [[Home Development Mutual Fund]] (HDMF or Pag-IBIG Fund), the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), the [[National Housing Authority]] (NHA), the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC) and the Social Housing Finance Corporation (SHFC) as well as ex officio Vice Chairman of the Home Guaranty Corporation (HGC).  He has also been designated as concurrent Presidential Adviser on Overseas Filipino Workers, as Alternate Chairman of the National Anti-Poverty Commission, Head of the Task Force Against Illegal Recruitment, Price Monitoring Czar and Cabinet Officer for Regional DevelopmPalawan).

Serge Osmeña III]</ref> Throughout his vice presidency, de Castro had minimal limelight and was regarded only as "backup" for the then incumbent party coalition if ever President Arroyo was ousted.

===2010 presidential election===
De Castro was initially a front runner in the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 presidential election]]. Being the Vice President, he was a popular choice among older voters to replace outgoing president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. However, his lead was taken by [[Benigno Aquino III]] (who later won) after Aquino declared his intent to run for president.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090113-183098/Survey-De-Castro-top-choice-for-2010 Survey: De Castro top choice for 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220234310/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20090113-183098/Survey-De-Castro-top-choice-for-2010 |date=February 20, 2009 }}.

==Return to television==
In November 2010, he returned as an anchor of ''TV Patrol''. He had been a staunch critic of almost all programs of President [[Noynoy Aquino]], who has criticized former President Arroyo, de Castro's running mate in the 2004 elections. He has been known to fire tirades against Aquino throughout Aquino's presidency which ended in May 2016. During the administration of [[Rodrigo Duterte]], however, he became meek as former President Arroyo had close ties with Duterte. De Castro has been criticized for perceived [[misogyny]], [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Netizens question Noli de Castro for 'discriminatory' remark|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/132667-noli-de-castro-discriminatory-remark-netizens|last=|first=|date=2016-05-11|website=Rappler|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref> in live television.<ref name="opinion.inquirer.net">{{cite web|title=Dengvaxia, fear, and (mis)trust &#124; Inquirer Opinion|url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/110866/dengvaxia-fear-mistrust|date=2018-02-08|publisher=Opinion.inquirer.net|accessdate=2019-09-28}}</ref> In 2018, he was being eyed by the Duterte administration for a possible return in politics under the new administration.

It was later proven by the [[World Health Organization]] and the Philippine Department of Health that Dengvaxia is safe and that the initial deaths of children were not connected with Dengvaxia.
