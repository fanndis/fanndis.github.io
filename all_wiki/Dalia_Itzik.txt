==Biography==
Itzik was born in [[Jerusalem]]. Her parents were [[Iraqi Jews]] who had immigrated to Israel. Her family was poor; her father was an alcoholic and at times her mother had to steal food for the family to survive. She attended a religious high school, and afterwards, avoided conscription to the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by declaring herself religious. She then attended a teacher training course, and went on to obtain a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Literature and History from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and a BA in Law from [[Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya|IDC Herzliya]]. She worked as a teacher, during which she headed the teacher's union in Jerusalem, worked as a deputy to Jerusalem mayor [[Teddy Kollek]], and served as a member of the executive committee of the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]].<ref name=nrg>http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART/863/595.html</ref>

On 26 October 1988, she was involved in a car accident that killed Knesset member [[Michael Reisser]], who was driving to Jerusalem, when Reisser's car crashed into hers. Reisser was fatally wounded and died the following day, while Itzik was seriously injured.<ref name=nrg/>

She is married to Danny, an employee of the Israel Electric Corporation. They have three children, Ran, Uri and Adi. The family lives in Jerusalem's [[Ramat Sharett]] neighborhood.<ref>{{cite news |author=Naama Lanski |date=13 September 2007 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-quality-of-dalia-1.229320 |title=The Quality of Dalia |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>

==Political career==
Before being elected to the [[1992 Israeli legislative election|13th Knesset]] in 1992, Itzik served as the deputy mayor of Jerusalem.

After being re-elected in 1996 and 1999, she was appointed [[Environmental Protection Minister of Israel|Minister of the Environment]] in Ehud Barak's government, serving from 1999 until 2001. In 2001 she became [[Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel|Minister of Industry and Trade]], before leaving the cabinet in 2002.

Re-elected in 2003, Itzik served as [[Communications Minister of Israel|Minister of Communications]] in 2005. In 2006 she defected to [[Ariel Sharon]]'s newly formed party, Kadima.

Following the [[2006 Israeli legislative election|2006 elections]] she became Knesset speaker. On 25 January 2007, Israeli President [[Moshe Katzav]] took a three-month leave of absence, and on 1 July of that year, resigned the office in a plea bargain.  The speaker of the Knesset stands first in the [[line of succession]], making Itzik acting president. She served as the official head of State until [[Shimon Peres]] formally took over on 15 July 2007.

After winning third place on the party's list, Itzik retained her seat in the [[2009 Israeli legislative election|2009 elections]] and later became the chairperson of the party. On 5 December 2012, in the days leading up to the [[2013 Israeli legislative election|2013 elections]] while polls showed Kadima either barely getting into the Knesset or not even passing the threshold, Itzik announced she was taking a break from politics and dropping out of the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000803780 |script-title=he:בחירות 2013: דליה איציק פורשת מהחיים הפוליטיים |language=Hebrew|trans-title=Elections 2013: Dalia Itzik resigns from the political arena |date=5 December 2012|accessdate=5 December 2012 |last=Weisman|first=Leilach |publisher=Globes}}</ref>

Itzik contested in the [[2014 Israeli presidential election]], coming third with 28 votes. Her supporters came from across the political spectrum.
