'''Energy liberalisation''' refers to the [[liberalisation]] of [[electricity market|energy market]]s, with specific reference to [[electricity generation]] markets, by bringing greater competition into electricity and gas markets in the interest of creating more [[competitive market]]s and reductions in price by [[Privatization|privatisation]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Energy Liberalisation from Financial Times Lexicon|url = http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=energy-liberalisation|website = lexicon.ft.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160809212422/http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=energy-liberalisation|archive-date = 2016-08-09|url-status = dead}}</ref> As the supply of electricity is a [[natural monopoly]], this entails complex and costly systems of [[regulation]] to enforce a system of [[competition]].<ref name=thomas2004>{{cite web|title=Electricity liberalisation: The beginning of the end |author=Steve Thomas |publisher=PRSIRU |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url=http://www.psiru.org/reports/2004-09-E-WEC.doc |date=2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717040912/http://www.psiru.org/reports/2004-09-E-WEC.doc |archivedate=17 July 2012 }}</ref>

A strong drive for liberalisation occurred in [[European Union]] energy markets at the turn of the millennium, directed by [[European Commission]] directives favouring market liberalisation promulgated in 1996, 2003, and 2009.<ref name=thomas2004 /><ref>{{cite web |title=DIRECTIVE 2009/72/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL |date=13 July 2009 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:211:0055:0093:EN:PDF |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union |author=European Parliament}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = European Commission - Competition - Energy - Overview|url = http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/energy/overview_en.html|website = ec.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}</ref> These programmes were supported with the interest of increasing the interconnectedness of European energy markets and building the common market.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Similar initiatives, to varying degrees, have been pursued in nations around the world, such as Argentina, Chile, and the United States.<ref name=":2" />

==British model==
A standard model for electricity liberalisation is the "British model", a reform plan of which consists of six reforms: (1) creation of a competitive market for electricity, (2) the breakup of monopolized supply such that each consumer can select their provider, (3) separation of network maintenance from generation, (4) separation of direct supply from the generation of electricity, (5) creation of an incentive structure to set market prices in monopolistic competition, and (6) the privatisation of formerly state-owned assets.<ref name=thomas2005>{{cite journal |title=British Experience of Electricity Liberalisation: A Model for India? |jstor=4417518 |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |author=Stephen Thomas |date=December 2005}}</ref> It was implemented under the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] years as part of a mass privatisation campaign of many of the industries nationalised by previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments in the preceding decades. The risks involved for both [[Electricity generation|generators]] and [[Electricity distribution|distributors]] have led to vertical re-integration.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Benefits of liberalisation==
The main benefit of liberalisation comes from the increased competition afforded to the market. This increases the availability and distribution of energy in supply situations by building transparent price signals and diversifying the production of electricity between [[Natural gas|gas]]-turbine technologies to [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/LessonsNet.pdf|title = Lessons from Liberalised Electricity Markets|date = 2005|accessdate = 2015-10-28|website = |publisher = International Energy Agency|last = |first = }}</ref> It has also led to the elimination of unnecessary overhead supply in formerly nationalised markets, allowing for capital resources to be utilised more effectively on things such as network infrastructure instead of maintaining idle power stations.<ref name=":2" /> These increases in efficiency have led to lower prices paid by consumers in nations, such as the [[United Kingdom]], which have more heavily pursued [[deregulation]].<ref name=":3">{{cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/node/5492109|title = The politics of power|date = 9 February 2006|access-date = 28 October 2015|newspaper = [[The Economist]]}}</ref>

The creation of pooled energy sources per the British model and other systems adopted in Chile and Texas have led to greater demand [[Elasticity (economics)|price-response]], allowing for the more efficient use of electricity and increasing the response of consumers to prices so fewer costs are afforded to them.<ref name=":4" /> Furthermore, the greater interconnectedness of networks has allowed for markets to be more able to respond to peak energy demand and thereby increase the security of energy networks.<ref name=":2" />

By increasing price-response, providing for more efficient companies, and increasing the visibility of price signals, governments have also been able to reduce the pollution from fossil-fuel power stations by concurrently securing greater environmental protections. Further progress has been made in shaving overcapacity such that less emissions are emitted whilst still maintaining energy security and building the transmission infrastructure necessary to better exploit wind and solar resources.<ref name=":2" />

==Problems with liberalisation==
Liberalisation of electricity tends to substantially benefit large consumers (mainly industrial users), but benefits for domestic consumers compared with a public monopoly or a regulated private monopoly are questionable, as liberalisation has been shown to pass on supply costs onto consumers.<ref name=":4">{{cite web |title=
Electricity liberalisation in Britain: the quest for a satisfactory wholesale market design |url=http://www.uea.ac.uk/~e680/energy/energy_links/electricity/D13.2_Newbery.pdf |publisher=University of East Anglia |accessdate=27 October 2015 |author=David Newbery}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Energy liberalisation leads to higher prices|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/29869d28-7fe1-11dc-b075-0000779fd2ac.html|newspaper = [[Financial Times]]|date = 2007-10-21|access-date = 2015-10-28|issn = 0307-1766|first = Philip|last = Wright}}</ref> There are also doubts over whether the system can ensure long-term security of supply through providing sufficient incentives to begin building generation capacity in time for when it is needed, an issue which has started to plague Britain in the mid-2010s as spare capacity has decreased significantly to just over 1.2 percent in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-33527967 |title=Electricity blackouts risk up, says National Grid |accessdate=27 October 2015 |author=John Moylan |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=July 2015}}</ref>

Furthermore, the experience of electricity liberalisation in [[developing countries]] has proven problematic, as many large multinationals withdrew support for power plant construction projects in the start of the 21st century, leaving countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uganda to pick up the bill for the expansion of their electric networks.<ref name=thomas2004 /> The privatisation of electricity favoured by liberal economists mirroring the British model have also led to increased expenditure on advertising and power switching incentives for consumers.<ref name="thomas2004" /><ref name=thomas2005 />

The nature of the [[natural monopoly]] coming from electricity generation is also an issue which has gone unaddressed. Because of the monopolistic competition inherent to the energy market, there are significant issues with [[collusion]] by firms to raise prices.<ref name=":3" /> To prevent these issues as well as those associated with direct intervention to build new generation capacity, governments have had to step in to further regulate and build such capacity directly,<ref name="thomas2004" /><ref name=":3" /> effectively defeating the point of liberalisation. These issues have been compounded with growing geopolitical instability in Eastern Europe and [[Ukraineâ€“European Union relations|concerns]] over gas pipelines in Ukraine.<ref name=":3" />
