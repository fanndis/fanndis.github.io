'''Lee Teng-hui''' ({{zh|t=李登輝}}; 15 January 1923{{spnd}}30 July 2020) was a Taiwanese statesman and economist who was the fourth [[president of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]] under [[Constitution of the Republic of China|the 1947 Constitution]] and chairman of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) from 1988 to 2000. He was the first president of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] to be born in Taiwan and the first to be directly elected. During his presidency, Lee oversaw the end of martial law and the full democratization of the ROC, advocated the [[Taiwanese localization movement]], and led an ambitious foreign policy to gain allies around the world. Nicknamed "Mr. Democracy", Lee was credited as the president who initiated Taiwan's transition to the democratic era.

After leaving office, he remained active in Taiwanese politics. Lee was considered the "spiritual leader" of the pro-independence [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] (TSU),<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Melody|title=Japan's criticism of referendum has Lee outraged|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/01/01/2003085914|accessdate=30 September 2014|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=1 January 2004}}</ref> and recruited for the party in the past.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lin|first1=Mei-chun|title=Lee Teng-hui seeks KMT legislators|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2001/12/28/0000117627|accessdate=30 September 2014|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=28 December 2001}}</ref> After Lee campaigned for TSU candidates in the [[2001 Taiwanese legislative election]], he was expelled by KMT. Other activities that Lee engaged in included maintaining relations with former Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian and Japan.

After [[World War II]] ended, and the [[Republic of China]] took over Taiwan, Lee enrolled in the [[National Taiwan University]], where in 1948 he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[agricultural science]].

In 1953, Lee received a master's degree in [[agricultural economics]] from the [[Iowa State University]] (ISU) in the United States.<ref name=":0" /> Lee returned to Taiwan in 1957 as an economist with the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]] (JCRR), an organization sponsored by the U.S. which aimed at modernizing Taiwan's agricultural system and at land reform.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/15/world/man-in-the-news-lee-teng-hui-taiwan-s-leader-and-son-of-the-soil.html|title=MAN IN THE NEWS: Lee Teng-hui; Taiwan's Leader and Son of the Soil |last=Haberman|first=Clyde |date=15 January 1988|newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=18 November 2018 }}</ref> During this period, he also worked as an adjunct professor in the Department of Economics at [[National Taiwan University]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsai|first=Shih-shan Henry |title=Lee Teng-Hui and Taiwan's Quest for Identity|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9781403977175|pages=85–86 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ge_FAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 }}</ref> and taught at the Graduate School of [[East Asian Studies]] at [[National Chengchi University]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Teng-hui: From scholar to statesman |url = http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=13325&CtNode=122 |access-date=3 November 2014 |newspaper=Taiwan Today|date=16 June 1995 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141104023315/http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=13325&CtNode=122 |archive-date=4 November 2014 }}</ref>

In the mid-1960s Lee returned to the United States, and earned a [[doctorate of Philosophy|PhD]] in agricultural economics from [[Cornell University]]<ref name="Jennings"/> in 1968.

His doctoral dissertation, ''Intersectoral Capital Flows in the Economic Development of Taiwan, 1895–1960''  (published as a book under the same name) was honored as the year's best doctoral thesis by the American Association of Agricultural Economics and remains an influential work on Taiwan's economy during the Japanese and early KMT periods.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilde|first=Parke|title=TRANSFORMING AGRICULTURE AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IN TAIWAN: LEE TENG-HUI AND THE JOINT COMMISSION ON RURAL RECONSTRUCTION (JCRR)|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/121165/2/Cornell%20SP%2097-03.pdf|access-date=4 November 2014|publisher=Cornell University Press|date=May 1997}}</ref>

Shortly after returning to Taiwan, Lee joined the KMT in 1971<ref>{{cite news |author1=Han Cheung |title=Taiwan in Time: The former president's reversal |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2018/09/02/2003699637 |accessdate=1 September 2018 |work=Taipei Times |date=2 September 2018}}</ref> and was made a [[Executive Yuan|cabinet]] [[minister without portfolio]] responsible for agriculture.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Soul of a Statesman |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=4334 |accessdate=31 July 2018 |work=Taiwan Today |date=1 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsai |first1=Shih-shan Henry |title=Lee Teng-hui and Taiwan's Quest for Identity |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave Macmilllan |doi=10.1057/9781403977175 |isbn=978-1-4039-7717-5 |page=xiv |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-1-4039-7717-5%2F1.pdf}}</ref>

In 1978 Lee was appointed mayor of [[Taipei]],<ref name="Kagan">Richard Kagan. ''Taiwan's Statesman: Lee Teng-hui and Democracy in Asia.'' Naval Institute Press, 2014. p. 91-93. {{ISBN|9781612517551}}</ref> where he solved water shortages and improved the city's irrigation problems. In 1981, he became governor of [[Taiwan Province]]<ref name="Kagan"/> and made further irrigation improvements.

As a skilled [[technocrat]], Lee soon caught the eye of President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] as a strong candidate to serve as vice president. Chiang sought to move more authority to the ''[[bensheng ren]]'' (residents of Taiwan before 1949 and their descendants) instead of continuing to promote ''[[waisheng ren]]'' (mainland Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan after 1949 and their descendants) as his father had.<ref name="Kagan"/> President Chiang nominated Lee to become his [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]].<ref name="Kagan"/> Lee was formally elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] in 1984.<ref name="Kagan"/>

==Presidency==
[[Chiang Ching-kuo]] died in January 1988 and Lee succeeded him as president.<ref name="Roy180">Denny Roy. ''Taiwan: A Political History.''

With the help of [[James Soong]]—himself a member of the Palace Faction—who quieted the hardliners with the famous plea "Each day of delay is a day of disrespect to Ching-kuo," Lee was allowed to ascend to the chairmanship unobstructed.<ref>{{Cite web|date=15 March 2000|title=The many faces of James Soong – Taipei Times|url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/insight/archives/2000/03/15/0000027929|access-date=31 July 2020|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}</ref> At the [[13th National Congress of Kuomintang]] in July 1988, Lee named 31 members of the Central Committee, 16 of whom were ''bensheng ren'': for the first time, ''bensheng ren'' held a majority in what was then a powerful policy-making body.<ref>Denny Roy.

Lee, in an interview that same year, expressed his view that a [[special state-to-state relations]]hip existed between Taiwan and the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) that all negotiations between the two sides of the Strait needed to observe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Beijing fears Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/china.50/inside.china/profiles/lee.tenghui/|accessdate=4 November 2014|publisher=CNN}}</ref> As president, he attempted to further reform the government.

Lee, observing constitutional term limits he had helped enact, stepped down from the presidency at the end of his term in 2000.

==South China Sea dispute==
Under Lee, it was stated that "legally, historically, geographically, or in reality", all of the South China Sea and Spratly islands were the territory of the Republic of China and under ROC sovereignty, and denounced actions undertaken there by Malaysia and the Philippines, in a statement on 13 July 1999 released by the foreign ministry of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite news |author= STRATFOR's Global Intelligence Update |date=14 July 1999 |title= Taiwan sticks to its guns, to U.S. chagrin |url= http://www.atimes.com/china/AG15Ad01.html |newspaper= Asia Times Online|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref> The claims made by both the PRC and the Republic of China "mirror" each other.<ref name="Sisci 2010">{{cite news |last= Sisci |first= Francesco |date=29 June 2010 |title= US toe-dipping muddies South China Sea |url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/LG29Ad01.html |newspaper=Asia Times Online |accessdate= 14 May 2014}}</ref> During international talks involving the Spratly islands, the PRC and ROC have sometimes made efforts to coordinate their positions with each other since both have the same claims.<ref name="Sisci 2010"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=szcywfgKySAC&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q&f=false Pak 2000], p. 91.</ref>

==Post-presidency==
Since resigning the chairmanship of the KMT, Lee stated a number of political positions and ideas which he did not mention while he was president, but which he appeared to have privately maintained. After Lee endorsed the candidates of the newly-formed [[Pan-Green Coalition|Pan-Green]] [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], a party established by a number of his KMT allies, Lee was expelled from the KMT on 21 September 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan's KMT expels former president|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1556562.stm|accessdate=1 June 2016|agency=BBC|date=21 September 2001}}</ref>

Lee publicly supported the Name Rectification Campaigns in Taiwan and proposed changing the name of the country from the Republic of China to the [[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Lee urges 'Taiwan' name change|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2003/08/24/40574/Lee-urges.htm|accessdate=19 February 2016|work=China Post|date=24 August 2003}}</ref> He generally opposed unlimited economic ties with the PRC, placing restrictions on Taiwanese wishing to invest in the mainland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1488551.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=31 July 2020 |date=13 August 2001 |title=Taiwan to free up China investment}}</ref>

After Chen Shui-bian succeeded Lee in the [[2000 Taiwanese presidential election|2000 election]], the two enjoyed a close relationship despite being from different political parties. Chen regularly asked Lee for advice during his first term in office. In Chen's 2001 book,<!-- 世紀首航: 政黨輪替500天的沉思 (translation needed)--> he called Lee the "Father of Taiwanese Democracy" and also named himself the "Son of Taiwan" with respect to Lee. However, the two's relationship began to worsen when Lee questioned Chen's reform of the fisheries branch of the [[Council of Agriculture]]. Though Lee was present in the [[228 Hand-in-Hand rally]] orchestrated by the Pan-Green Coalition before the [[2004 Taiwanese presidential election|2004 election]], the two's relationship broke apart after Chen asked James Soong to be the [[President of the Executive Yuan]] in 2005, which Lee disagreed with. Lee also publicly criticized Chen in 2006 by calling him incapable and corrupt.<ref>{{cite news |author1=張文馨 |title=政壇恩怨／李登輝、陳水扁從水乳交融 到水火不容 |url=https://udn.com/news/story/121543/4738624 |accessdate=31 July 2020 |agency=[[United Daily News]] |date=30 July 2020 |language=zh-tw}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=許雅慧 |title=【李登輝病逝】與陳水扁情同父子曾鬧翻 愛恨糾葛12年 |url=https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%9D%8E%E7%99%BB%E8%BC%9D%E7%97%85%E9%80%9D-%E8%88%87%E9%99%B3%E6%B0%B4%E6%89%81%E6%83%85%E5%90%8C%E7%88%B6%E5%AD%90%E6%9B%BE%E9%AC%A7%E7%BF%BB-%E6%84%9B%E6%81%A8%E7%B3%BE%E8%91%9B12%E5%B9%B4-121200211.html |accessdate=31 July 2020 |agency=上報 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

In February 2007 Lee shocked the media when he revealed that he did not support [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence]], when he was widely seen as the spiritual leader of the pro-independence movement.<ref>"[https://chinapost.nownews.com/20070202-132089 Lu 'astonished' by Lee's about-face on Taiwan independence]", ''China Post''</ref> Lee also said that he supported opening up trade and tourism with the mainland, a position he had opposed before. Lee later explained that Taiwan already enjoys ''de facto'' independence and that political maneuvering over details of expressing it is counterproductive. He maintains that "Taiwan should seek 'normalization' by changing its name and amending its constitution."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207073927/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/archives/front/200725/101740.htm Chen shouldn't fear dealing with China: Lee] ''The [[China Post]]'' 31 May 2007.</ref>

===Relations with Japan===
Lee enjoyed a warm relationship with the people and culture of Japan. Taiwan was [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]] from 1895 to 1945 and natives of the island who grew up in that period, such as Lee, attended schools where Japanese language, songs, and stories were taught. Lee's father was a middle-level Japanese police aide; his elder brother died serving in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in [[World War II]] and is listed in the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo. During his youth Lee had a Japanese name, {{jp||岩里政男|Iwasato Masao}}.<ref>{{cite news |author=Han Cheung |title=From Lee to Iwasato back to Lee|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/02/07/2003639001|accessdate=8 February 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=7 February 2016}}</ref> Lee spoke fondly of his upbringing and his teachers and was welcomed in visits to Japan since leaving office.
