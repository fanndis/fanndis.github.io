[[File:Lozenge demo.svg|thumb|200px|Escutcheon showing ''Argent, a lozenge gules'']]
The '''lozenge''' in [[heraldry]] is a diamond-shaped [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] (an object that can be placed on the [[field (heraldry)|field]] of the shield), usually somewhat narrower than it is tall. It is to be distinguished in modern heraldry from the [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Mobile subordinaries|fusil]], which is like the lozenge but narrower, though the distinction has not always been as fine and is not always observed even today. A '''mascle''' is a voided lozenge—that is, a lozenge with a lozenge-shaped hole in the middle—and the rarer '''rustre''' is a lozenge containing a circular hole in the centre. A field covered in a pattern of lozenges is described as lozengy; similar fields of mascles are masculy, and fusils, fusily (see [[Variation of the field]]). In civic heraldry, a lozenge [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] is often used in coal-mining communities to represent a lump of [[coal]].

A lozenge shaped [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is used to depict heraldry for a female (in continental Europe especially an unmarried woman), but is also sometimes used as a shape for mural monuments in churches which commemorate females.<ref>For example the lozenge shaped monument to Arabella Morgan (1741-1828) in [[St Andrew's Church, High Ham]], Somerset, see image [[:File:St Andrew's Church, High Ham2.jpg]]</ref> [[Funerary hatchment]]s are generally shown within lozenge shaped frames, for both male and female deceased.

The blason ''Lozengy'' is a form of [[variation of the field]] or of another charge (for example ''a chevron lozengy'') which consists of lozenges ''semée'', or sown like seeds (Latin: ''semen'', a seed), or strewn across the field, but in an organised contiguous pattern.  The arms granted to the Canadian John Francis Cappucci bring an example of ''lozengy voided'', the same as "lozengy" but with a smaller lozenge-shaped hole cut out of each segment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges|url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=2746&ProjectElementID=9609}}</ref>
