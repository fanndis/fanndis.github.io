The '''Rhodesian Security Forces''' were the military forces of the [[Rhodesia]]n government. The Rhodesian Security Forces consisted of a ground force (the Rhodesian Army), the [[Rhodesian Air Force]], the [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP), and various personnel affiliated to the [[INTAF|Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (INTAF). Despite the impact of economic and diplomatic sanctions, Rhodesia was able to develop and maintain a potent and professional military capability.<ref name="Rogers 1998, p. 41">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1998|p=41}}</ref>

The Rhodesian Security Forces of 1964–80 traced their history back to the [[British South Africa Company]] armed forces, originally created during [[company rule in Rhodesia|company rule]] in the 1890s. These became the armed forces of the British [[self-governing colony]] of [[Southern Rhodesia]] on its formation in 1923, then part of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] military in 1953. After the break-up of the Federation at the end of 1963, the security forces assumed the form they would keep until 1980.

As the armed forces of [[Rhodesia]] (as Southern Rhodesia called itself from 1964), the Rhodesian Security Forces remained loyal to the [[Harare|Salisbury]] government after it [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from Britain on 11 November 1965. Britain and the United Nations refused to [[list of states with limited recognition|recognise]] this, and regarded the breakaway state as a rebellious British colony throughout its existence.

The security forces fought on behalf of the unrecognised government against the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA)—the military wings of the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] black nationalist [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) and [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) respectively—during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] of the 1960s and 1970s.

The [[Lancaster House Agreement]] and the return of Rhodesia to de facto British control on 12 December 1979 changed the security forces' role altogether; during the five-month interim period, they helped the [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia|British governor]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Monitoring Force to keep order in Rhodesia while the [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|1980 general election]] was organised and held. After the internationally recognised independence of [[Zimbabwe]] in April 1980, the Rhodesian security forces, ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated to form the new [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]].

The majority of the [[Southern Rhodesia Volunteers]] were disbanded in 1920 for reasons of cost, the last companies being disbanded in 1926. The Defence Act of 1927 created a Permanent Force (the Rhodesian Staff Corps) and a Territorial Force as well as national compulsory military training.<ref>Wilson, Graham ''Cap badges of the Rhodesian Security Forces'' ''Sabretache'', June 2000</ref> With the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers disbanded in 1927, the [[Rhodesia Regiment]] was reformed in the same year as part of the nation's Territorial Force.

The [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP) were trained as both policemen and soldiers until 1954.<ref>[http://abc.gov.au/wa/anzac/allied.htm#ra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020718064841/http://abc.gov.au/wa/anzac/allied.htm#ra|date=18 July 2002}}</ref>

About 10,000 [[White people in Zimbabwe|white Southern Rhodesians]] (15% of the white population) mustered into the British forces during the [[Second World War]], serving in units such as the [[Long Range Desert Group]], [[No. 237 Squadron RAF]] and the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS). ''Pro rata'' to population, this was the largest contribution of manpower by any territory in the [[British Empire]], even outstripping that of Britain itself.<ref name=galetimeline>{{Harvnb

Southern Rhodesia's own units, most prominently the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] (made up of black rank-and-filers and [[warrant officers]], led by white officers; abbreviated RAR), fought in the war's [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] and [[Burma Campaign|in Burma]].<ref>{{Harvnb
|Binda
|2007
|pp=41–42, 59–77}}</ref> During the war, Southern Rhodesian pilots proportionally earned the highest number of decorations and ace appellations in the Empire. This resulted in the [[Royal Family]] paying an unusual state visit to the colony at the end of the war in thanks to the efforts of the Rhodesian people.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[Southern Rhodesia Air Force]] (SRAF) was re-established in 1947 and, two years later, [[Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia|Prime Minister]] [[Godfrey Huggins, 1st Viscount Malvern|Sir Godfrey Huggins]] appointed a 32-year-old South African-born Rhodesian [[Spitfire]] pilot, [[Ted Jacklin]], as air officer commanding tasked to build an air force in the expectation that British African territories would begin moving towards independence, and air power would be vital for land-locked [[Southern Rhodesia]]. The threadbare SRAF bought, borrowed or salvaged a collection of vintage aircraft, including six [[Tiger Moth (plane)|Tiger Moth]]s, six [[North American Harvard]] trainers, an [[Avro Anson]] freighter and a handful of [[De Havilland Rapide]] transport aircraft, before purchasing a squadron of 22 Mk. 22 war surplus [[Supermarine Spitfire]] from the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) which were then flown to Southern Rhodesia.<ref>Moss (n.d.); Petter-Bowyer (2003) p. 16</ref>

In April 1951, the defence forces of Southern Rhodesia were completely reorganised.<ref>Extracted from 'The Development of Southern Rhodesia's Military System, 1890–1953 by L. H. Gann, M.A., B.LITT., D.PHIL.'</ref> The Permanent Force included the BSAP as well as the [[Southern Rhodesia Staff Corps]], charged with training and administering the Territorial Force. The SRAF consisted of a communication squadron and trained members of the Territorial Force as pilots, particularly for artillery observation. During the [[Malayan Emergency]] of the 1950s, Southern Rhodesia [[Southern Rhodesian military involvement in the Malayan Emergency|contributed]] two units to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]'s counter-insurgency campaign: the newly formed [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]] served a two-year tour of duty in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] starting in March 1951,<ref>{{Harvnb

|pp=19–20}}</ref> then the Rhodesian African Rifles operated for two years from April 1956.<ref>{{Harvnb

|pp=127–128}}</ref>

The colony also maintained women's auxiliary services (later to provide the inspiration for the Rhodesia Women's Service), and maintained a battalion of the RAR, officered by members of the Staff Corps. The Territorial Force remained entirely white and largely reproduced the [[Second World War]] pattern. It consisted of two battalions of the [[Royal Rhodesia Regiment]], an Armoured Car Regiment, Artillery, Engineers, Signal Corps, Medical Corps, Auxiliary Air Force and Transport Corps. In wartime the country could also draw on the Territorial Force Reserve and General Reserve. Southern Rhodesia, in other words, reverted more or less to the organisation of the Second World War.

Matters evolved greatly over twenty years. The regular army was always a relatively small force, but by 1978–79 it consisted of 10,800 regulars nominally supported by about 40,000 reservists. While the regular army consisted of a professional core drawn from the white population (and some units, such as the Rhodesian SAS and the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]], were all-white), by 1978–79 the majority of its complement was actually composed of black soldiers. The army reserves, in contrast, were largely white.<ref name="lohman3">{{Harvnb

The Rhodesian Army HQ was in Salisbury and commanded over four infantry brigades and later an HQ Special Forces, with various training schools and supporting units. Numbers 1,2, and 3 Brigade were established in 1964 and 4 Brigade in 1978.<ref name="freewebs.com">[http://www.freewebs.com/dudleywall/combinedoperations.htm Combined Operations – Brothers in Arms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122213926/http://www.freewebs.com/dudleywall/combinedoperations.htm |date=22 November 2010 }}</ref>

== Rhodesian Air Force ==
{{main|Rhodesian Air Force}}

The [[Royal Rhodesian Air Force]] (RRAF), as it was named in 1954, was never a large air force. In 1965, it consisted of only 1,200 regular personnel. It was renamed as the [[Rhodesian Air Force]] (RhAF) in 1970. At the peak of its strength during the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]], it had a maximum of 2,300 personnel of all races, but of these, only 150 were pilots actively involved in combat operations. These pilots, however, were rotated through the various squadrons partly to maintain their skills on all aircraft and partly to relieve fellow pilots flying more dangerous sorties.

{{main|British South Africa Police}}
The [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP) were the first line of defence in both [[Southern Rhodesia]] and, later, [[Rhodesia]], with the specific responsibility of maintaining law and order in the country.<ref name="freewebs.com"/>

==INTAF==
{{main|INTAF}}
While not a part of the Security Forces, [[INTAF|Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (INTAF) officers were heavily involved in implementing such civic measures as the protected villages programme during the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]].

== Prison Services ==
{{main|Rhodesia Prison Service}}
The [[Rhodesia Prison Service]] (RPS) was the branch of the Rhodesian Security Forces responsible for the administration of Rhodesian prisons.

== Guard Force ==
This was the fourth arm of the Rhodesian Security Forces. It consisted of both black and white troops whose initial role was to provide protection for villagers in the Protected Village system. During the latter stages of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] they provided a role in the protection of white-owned farmland, tribal purchase lands and other strategic locations. They also raised two infantry Battalions and provided troops in every facet of the war in each of the Operational Areas. It was a large component of the Security Forces, with a strength of over 7,200 personnel. Its headquarters were in North Avenue, [[Salisbury, Rhodesia|Salisbury]]. Its training establishment was based at Chikurubi in Salisbury.

The guard force cap badge was a castle on top of a dagger, below the castle was a scroll reading 'Guard Force'

The [[Rhodesian Bush War]] required that each of the security forces work in a combined effort to combat the enemy. Therefore it became essential to establish an organisation known as Combined Operations (COMOPS) in Salisbury to co-ordinate the efforts of each service. The Rhodesian army took the senior role in Combined Operations and was responsible for the conduct of all operations both inside and outside Rhodesia. COMOPS had direct command over the Joint Operational Centres (JOCs) deployed throughout the country in each of the Operational Areas. There was a JOC per Operational Area.<ref name="freewebs.com"/>

The operational areas were known as:
*''Operation Hurricane'' – North-east border, started in December 1972
*''Operation Thrasher'' – Eastern border, started in February 1976
*''Operation Repulse'' – South-east border, started in May 1976
*''Operation Tangent'' – Matabeleland, started in August 1976
*''Operation Grapple'' – Midlands, started in August 1977
*''Operation Splinter'' – Kariba, started in June 1978
*''Salops'' – Operations in and around Salisbury, started in 1978
