'''''The Mercury News''''' (formerly '''''San Jose Mercury News''''', often locally known as ''The Merc'') is a morning [[daily newspaper]] published in [[San Jose, California]], in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It is published by the [[Bay Area News Group]], a subsidiary of [[Digital First Media]]. {{As of|2013|3}}, it was the [[List of newspapers in the United States#Top 25 newspapers by circulation, late 2012 through early 2013|fifth largest daily newspaper in the United States]], with a daily circulation of 611,194.<ref name="AAM">{{cite web|title=Top 25 U.S. Newspapers for March 2013|publisher=[[Alliance for Audited Media]]|accessdate=June 21, 2018|url=http://auditedmedia.com/news/blog/top-25-us-newspapers-for-march-2013.aspx|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016155148/http://auditedmedia.com/news/blog/top-25-us-newspapers-for-march-2013.aspx|archivedate=October 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Carey circulation">{{cite news|title=Mercury News scores circulation gain|first=Pete|last=Carey|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=Bay Area News Group|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2018|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/04/30/mercury-news-scores-circulation-gain/}}</ref> {{As of|2018}}, the paper has a circulation of 324,500 daily and 415,200 on Sundays.<ref name="Bay Area News Group" />

First published in 1851, the ''Mercury News'' is the last remaining English-language daily newspaper covering the [[Santa Clara Valley]]. It became the ''Mercury News'' in 1983 after a series of mergers. During much of the 20th century, it was owned by [[Knight Ridder]]. Because of its location in [[Silicon Valley]], the ''Mercury News'' has covered many of the key events in the history of computing, and was a pioneer in delivering news online.<ref name="Ridder Park history" /> It was the first American newspaper to publish in three languages (English, Spanish, and Vietnamese).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mercury News Changes Along with San Jose|work=750 Ridder Park Drive|publisher=History San José|url=http://mercurynews.historysanjose.org/750-ridder-park-drive-the-mercury-news-changes-along-with-san-jose/}}</ref>

==Name==
[[File:New Alm smelter.jpg|thumb|left|The New Almaden mercury mine near San Jose]]

The paper's name derives from the ''San Jose Mercury'' and ''San Jose News'', two daily newspapers that merged to form the ''Mercury News''.

The ''San Jose Mercury''{{'}}s name was a [[double entendre]]. The word "mercury" refers to the importance of the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] industry during the [[California Gold Rush]]. At the time, the nearby [[New Almaden]] mine (now [[Almaden Quicksilver County Park]]) was North America's largest producer of mercury, which was needed for [[Hydraulic mining|hydraulic gold mining]]. In addition, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is the Roman messenger of the gods as well as the god of commerce and thieves, known for his swiftness, so [[List of newspapers named Mercury|the name ''Mercury'' is commonly used for newspapers]] without the quicksilver association.<ref name="Ridder Park welcome">{{cite web|title=Welcome to 750 Ridder Park Drive|first=Jessica|last=Day|work=750 Ridder Park Drive|publisher=[[History San José]]|date=July 26, 2016|accessdate=June 18, 2018|url=http://mercurynews.historysanjose.org/}}</ref>

==Coverage==
The paper's local coverage and circulation is concentrated in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] and [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]]. With the ''Mercury News'', ''[[East Bay Times]]'', ''[[Marin Independent Journal]]'', and ''Silicon Valley Community Newspapers'', the [[Bay Area News Group]] covers much of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] with the notable exception of [[San Francisco]] itself.

The ''Mercury News''{{'}}s predecessor, the ''Weekly Visitor'', began as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] paper in the early 1850s but quickly switched its affiliation to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name="Beales">{{cite journal|title=The San Jose 'Mercury' and the Civil War|first=Benjamin Bronston|last=Beales|journal=California History|publisher=[[California Historical Society]]|volume=22|issue=3|date=September 1943|pages=223–234|doi=10.2307/25155794|jstor=25155794|url=http://ch.ucpress.edu/content/22/3/223}}</ref> The paper remained a conservative voice through the mid 20th century, when it supported pro-growth city leaders and pursued a staunchly pro-growth, anti-union agenda.<ref name="Ridder Park history">{{cite web|title=History of 750 Ridder Park Drive|work=750 Ridder Park Drive|publisher=History San José|url=http://mercurynews.historysanjose.org/history-of-750-ridder-park-drive/}}</ref> It became considerably more moderate in the 1970s, reflecting new ownership and changes to the local political landscape.{{sfn|Christensen|2015|p=14}} It endorsed [[John B.

==History==
===Early history===
The newspaper now known as the ''Mercury News'' began in 1851 or 1852.{{refn|group=note|An issue from June 4, 1852, is numbered as volume 1, issue 1, but there an issue from February 20 earlier that year was numbered as issue 36.<ref>{{cite web|title=About San Jose weekly visitor.

A group of three businessmen led by John C. Emerson bought the papers' presses to found the ''San Jose Weekly Visitor''.<ref name="Ridder Park welcome" /> The ''Weekly Visitor'' began as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] paper but quickly switched its affiliation to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. It was renamed the ''Santa Clara Register'' in 1852. The following year, F.&nbsp;B. Murdoch took over the paper, merging it into the ''San Jose Telegraph''.<ref name="Beales" />{{sfn|Munro-Fraser|1881|p=392}}<ref>{{cite web|title=About San Jose telegraph.

Slocum assumed control of the ''Telegraph'' in 1860 and merged it with the ''San Jose Mercury'' or ''Weekly Mercury'' to become the ''Telegraph and Mercury''. William N. Slocum soon dropped ''Telegraph'' from the name.<ref>{{cite web|title=About San Jose mercury. (San Jose, Calif.) 18??-1869|work=Chronicling America|publisher=National Digital Newspaper Program|accessdate=June 16, 2018|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016393/}}</ref>{{sfn|Munro-Fraser|1881|pp=392, 418, 537}} By this point, the ''Mercury'' was one of two newspapers publishing in San Jose.<ref name="Beales" />

===Owen ownership===
[[File:San Jose Moonlight Tower Postcard 1.jpg|thumb|right|A postcard depicting the San Jose electric light tower]]

[[James J. Owen|James Jerome Owen]], a [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|forty-niner]] and former Republican [[80th New York State Legislature|New York assemblyman]], became the ''Mercury''{{'}}s publisher in the spring of 1861, later acquiring a controlling interest in the paper along with a partner, Benjamin H.

In 1881, Owen proposed to light San Jose with a [[moonlight tower]]. The [[San Jose electric light tower]] was dedicated that year. The ''Mercury'' boasted that San Jose was the first town west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] lighted by electricity.<ref>''San Jose Mercury'', December 25, 1881, cited in {{cite book|first=Ernest|last=Freeberg|title=The Age of Edison: Electric Light and the Invention of Modern America|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofedison00erne|url-access=registration|series=Penguin History of American Life|location=New York City|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2013|isbn=978-0-14-312444-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofedison00erne/page/50 50]–51}}</ref>

The ''Mercury'' merged with the Times Publishing Company in 1884.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Daily morning times.

===Hayes ownership===
In late 1900, [[Everis A. Hayes]] and his brother Jay purchased the ''Mercury''. Then, in August 1901, they purchased the ''San Jose Daily Herald'', an evening paper, and formed the Mercury Herald Company.<ref>{{cite news|title=Herhold: The woman behind San Jose's Hayes Mansion|first=Scott|last=Herhold|work=The Mercury News|publisher=Bay Area News Group|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=June 19, 2018|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/06/14/herhold-the-woman-behind-san-joses-hayes-mansion/}}</ref> In 1913, the two papers were consolidated into a single morning paper, the ''San Jose Mercury Herald''.<ref name="Mercury Herald">{{cite web|title=About San Jose Mercury herald.

In 1942, the Mercury Herald Company purchased the ''San Jose News'' (which was founded in 1851) but continued to publish both papers, the ''Mercury Herald'' in the morning and the ''News'' in the evening, with a combined Sunday edition called the ''Mercury Herald News''.<ref name="Mercury Herald" /> The ''Herald'' name was dropped in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|title=About San Jose Mercury.

===Ridder ownership===
[[Herman Ridder]]'s Northwest Publications (later Ridder Publications) purchased the ''Mercury'' and ''News'' in 1952.<ref>{{cite news|title=The history of the Mercury News downtown|first=Scott|last=Herhold|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=MediaNews Group|date=June 16, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2018|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/06/16/herhold-the-history-of-the-mercury-news-downtown/}}</ref> During the mid 20th century, the papers took largely conservative, pro-growth positions. Publisher Joe Ridder was a vocal proponent of San Jose City Manager [[A. P. Hamann]]'s development agenda, which emphasized [[urban sprawl]] within an ever-expanding city limits. Ridder counted on increasing population to lead to increased newspaper subscriptions and advertising sales. The paper supported a series of [[general obligation bond]]s worth ${{format price|134000000}} (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|134000000|1969}}}} in {{inflation/year|US-GDP}}), most of it spent on capital improvements that benefited real estate developers. It also supported a revision to the city charter that introduced a [[Mayor–council government|direct mayoral elections]] and abolished the [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] for city manager.{{sfn|Christensen|2015|p=8}} By 1967, the ''Mercury'' had risen to rank among the top six largest morning newspapers in the country by circulation, boosted by unabated growth into the suburbs, while the ''News'' ran the most advertising of any evening newspaper in the country.<ref name="Ridder Park history" />

[[File:San Jose Mercury News HQ.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Mercury News'' headquarters from 1967 to 2014 is now [[Super Micro Computer, Inc.#Supermicro Green Computing Park|Supermicro Green Computing Park]].]]

In February 1967, the ''Mercury'' and ''News'' moved from a cramped former grocery store in downtown San Jose to a {{convert|36|acre|adj=on}} campus in suburban North San Jose. A {{convert|185000|sqft|adj=on}} main building could contain more presses to serve a booming population. The newly built complex cost ${{format price|1000000}} (equivalent to ${{format price|{{inflation|US-GDP|1000000|1967}}}} in {{inflation/year|US-GDP}}) and was called the largest one-story newspaper plant in the world. Civic leaders criticized the move as emblematic of the [[urban decay]] that downtown San Jose was experiencing.<ref name="Pizarro">{{cite news|title=Pizarro: A bittersweet farewell to the old Mercury News building|first=Sal|last=Pizarro|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=Bay Area News Group|date=September 26, 2014|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/News/ci_26615094/Pizarro:-A-bittersweet-farewell-to-the-old-Mercury-News-building}}</ref><ref name="Carey move" /><ref name="Carey sell">{{cite news|title=Mercury News announces it plans to sell headquarters building|first=Pete|last=Carey|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=MediaNews Group|date=April 15, 2013|accessdate=June 18, 2018|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/04/15/mercury-news-announces-it-plans-to-sell-headquarters-building/}}</ref>

===Knight Ridder ownership===
In 1974, Ridder merged with Knight Newspapers to form [[Knight Ridder]]. Joe Ridder was forced to retire in 1977. His nephew, P.&nbsp;Anthony "Tony" Ridder, succeeded him as publisher. Tony Ridder placed an emphasis on improving the papers' reportage, to better reflect Knight's reputation for investigative journalism.<ref name="Ridder Park history" />

Under Knight Ridder ownership, the papers moderated their formerly staunch pro-growth, anti-union agenda, and coverage of local issues became more balanced. The editorial board expressed only minimal opposition to a 1978 measure that abolished [[at-large]] city council elections, seen as favorable to deep-pocketed developers, in favor of council districts.{{sfn|Christensen|2015|p=14}} It supported the desegregation of [[San Jose Unified School District]] and in 1978 argued against [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13]]. In the 1980s, Ridder and the [[Knight Foundation]] supported Mayor [[Tom McEnery]]'s efforts to redevelop the downtown area, including the construction of [[SAP Center|San Jose Arena]] and [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]].<ref name="Ridder Park history" />{{sfn|Christensen|2015|p=21}}

[[File:San Jose Mercury News.svg|thumb|right|Logo of the ''San Jose Mercury News'' from 1983 to 2016]]

In 1983, the ''Mercury'' and ''News'' became morning and afternoon editions of the ''San Jose Mercury News'', respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=About San Jose Mercury-news.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the ''Mercury News'' published ''[[San Jose Mercury News West Magazine|West]]'' magazine as a Sunday insert.

====Coverage of ethnic communities====
In the 1990s, the ''Mercury News'' expanded its coverage of the area's ethnic communities, to national acclaim,<ref name="Grade Stoll">{{cite web|title=Mercury News will shed 2 ethnic papers, 5 local 'Guide' editions|first=Michael|last=Stoll|work=Grade the News|publisher=[[San Jose State University]] School of Journalism and Mass Communications|date=October 21, 2005|accessdate=June 17, 2018|url=http://gradethenews.org/2005/nmclosure.htm}}</ref> hiring Vietnamese-speaking reporters for the first time.<ref name="Ridder Park history" /> In 1994, it became the first of two American dailies to open a [[News bureau|foreign bureau]] in Vietnam after the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Việt Mercury có chủ nhiệm mới|trans-title=Viet Mercury has a new editor|work=Vietnam Daily News|date=February 7, 2002|accessdate=June 17, 2018|url=http://www.vietnamdaily.com/index.php?c=article&p=7246|language=vi}}</ref><ref name="Delevett">{{cite news|title=Viet Merc stirs emotions|first1=Peter|last1=Delevett|first2=Alastair|last2=Goldfisher|work=[[Silicon Valley Business Journal]]|publisher=American City Business Journals|date=February 28, 1999|accessdate=June 17, 2018|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/1999/03/01/story1.html}}</ref><ref name="NYT Glaberson">{{cite news|title=The Media Business; Press Notes|first=William|last=Glaberson|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 10, 1994|accessdate=June 19, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/10/business/the-media-business-press-notes.html}}</ref><ref name="Bùi Văn Phú">{{cite web|title=Khai sinh và khai tử của một tờ báo Việt chủ Mỹ|trans-title=The birth and death of an American-owned Vietnamese newspaper|author=Bùi Văn Phú|work=Talawas|date=November 7, 2005|accessdate=June 22, 2018|url=http://www.talawas.org/talaDB/showFile.php?res=5721&rb=0401|language=vi}}</ref> A [[foreign correspondent]] stationed at the [[Hanoi]] bureau held an annual [[town hall meeting]] with the Vietnamese-American community in San Jose.

====Growth alongside the technology industry====
The ''Mercury News'' benefited from its status as the major daily newspaper in [[Silicon Valley]] during the [[dot-com bubble]]. It led the news industry in business coverage of the valley's high tech industry, attracting readers from around the world. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called the ''Mercury News'' the most technologically-savvy newspaper in the country.<ref name="Ridder Park history" /> The tech industry's growth fueled growth in the paper's [[classified advertising]], particularly for employment listings. For 20 years, the ''Mercury News'' was one of the country's top newspapers in the amount of advertising it ran.<ref name="CJR Shapiro">{{cite journal|title=The Newspaper That Almost Seized the Future|first=Michael|last=Shapiro|journal=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|publisher=[[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]]|date=November 2011|accessdate=June 18, 2018|url=https://archives.cjr.org/feature/the_newspaper_that_almost_seized_the_future.php}}</ref>

The ''Mercury News'' was one of the first daily newspapers in the United States to have an online presence, and was the first to deliver full content and breaking news online. It launched a service called Mercury Center on [[AOL|America Online]] in 1993, followed by the country's first news website in 1995 (see {{section link||Online presence}}).

[[File:KnightRidder.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The ''Mercury News''{{'}}s parent company was headquartered at the Knight-Ridder Building in downtown San Jose from 1998 to 2006.]]

At its peak in the late 1990s, the ''Mercury News'' had 400 employees in its newsroom, 15 bureaus, ${{format price|288000000}} in annual revenue, and profit margins above 30%. In 1998, Knight Ridder moved its headquarters from [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] to the [[Fairmont Plaza|Knight-Ridder Building]] in San Jose, which was seen as an acknowledgement of the central role that online news would play in the company's future. Mercury Center ended its paywall in May 1998, after posting 1.2&nbsp;million monthly unique visitors the previous year. By 2000, the paper had a Sunday circulation of 327,000 and ${{format price|341000000}} in annual revenue, ${{format price|118000000}} of it from job listings.<ref name="CJR Shapiro" /> In 2001, circulation rose to 289,413 daily and 332,669 Sundays.<ref name="Ridder Park history" />

====Flush times come to an end====
The collapse of the dot-com bubble impacted the classified advertising that sustained the newspaper's business operations. Additionally, newspapers across the industry faced serious competition to their job listings from websites such as [[Monster.com]], [[CareerBuilder]], and [[Craigslist]]. Knight Ridder instituted several rounds of layoffs at its papers, prompting Harris to resign as publisher in 2001.<ref name="CJR Shapiro" /><ref name="Ridder Park history" />

Cost-cutting began affecting the initiatives the paper had started in the 1990s. In June 2005, the ''Mercury News'' closed its Hanoi bureau.<ref name="Bùi Văn Phú" /> On October 21, it also announced the closure of {{lang|es|Nuevo Mundo}} and sale of ''Viet Mercury'' to a group of Vietnamese-American businessmen; however, the deal fell through, and ''Viet Mercury'' published its final issue on November 11, 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sale of Viet Mercury Troubles Bay Area Vietnamese|first=Andrew|last=Lam|work=[[Berkeley Daily Planet]]|agency=[[Pacific News Service]]|date=October 28, 2005|accessdate=June 17, 2018|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2005-10-28/article/22640}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Phỏng vấn nhà văn Nguyễn Xuân Hoàng về tờ báo Viet Tribune mới ra mắt tại San Jose|author=Hoàng Khởi Phong|publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]]|date=May 28, 2006|accessdate=June 17, 2018|url=https://www.rfa.org/vietnamese/in_depth/InterviewWriterNguyenXuanHoang_HKPhong-20060528.html|language=vi}}</ref> {{lang|es|Nuevo Mundo}} was effectively replaced by {{lang|es|Fronteras de la Noticia}}, which consisted of content syndicated from Knight Ridder–owned ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' and translated into Spanish by an [[outsourcing]] firm in Mexico.<ref name="Grade Stoll" />

By March 2006, the ''Mercury News''{{'}}s profit margins had fallen to nine percent, with ${{format price|235000000}} in annual revenue, ${{format price|18000000}} of it from job listings, and ${{format price|22000000}} in profits.<ref name="Ridder Park history" />

In 2013, MediaNews Group and [[21st Century Media]] merged to form [[Digital First Media]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=MediaNews Group and 21st Century Media Transaction Has Been Finalized|publisher=Digital First Media|date=2013-12-30|access-date=2018-05-02|url=http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/medianews-group-21st-century-media-transaction-finalized/}}</ref> In April 2013, MediaNews announced that it would sell the ''Mercury News'' campus on Ridder Park Drive in North San Jose.

Originally, the ''Mercury'' and ''News'' published from various locations in downtown San Jose. From February 1967 to September 2014, the papers were headquartered in a {{convert|36|acre|adj=on}} campus in suburban North San Jose, abutting the Nimitz Freeway (then State Route 17, now [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]]).<ref name="Pizarro" /> The Web staff was originally co-located with the newsroom staff but moved to downtown San Jose in December 1996.<ref name="CJR Shapiro" /> Following the ''Mercury News''{{'}} return to the downtown area, Digital First Media sold the suburban campus to [[Super Micro Computer, Inc.]], which renamed it "[[Super Micro Computer, Inc.#Supermicro Green Computing Park|Supermicro Green Computing Park]]".<ref name="Ridder Park welcome" />

Older ''San Jose Mercury News'' newsboxes have black, white, and green stripes, while newer ''Mercury News'' newsboxes bear the paper's logo in white against a blue background.

[[File:Welcome to Mercury Center, 1993.png|thumb|left|The original Mercury Center service on America Online. Despite the popularity of premium features such as the "News Library", Mercury Center gave more prominence to content from the print paper, such as news and sports headlines.<ref name="CJR Shapiro" />]]

The ''Mercury News'' was one of the first daily newspapers in the United States to have an online presence and was the first to deliver full content and breaking news online. In 1990, editor Robert Ingle sent a report to Tony Ridder, then the head of [[Knight Ridder]], on the company's future in electronic media after the failure of [[Viewtron]] four years earlier. Ingle proposed a '''Mercury Center''' online service that would use the newspaper's content to bring together [[Community of interest|communities of interest]].<ref name="CJR Shapiro" /> It launched as part of [[AOL|America Online]] on May 10, 1993, at AOL keyword {{kbd|MERCURY}}. It was the second news service on AOL, after the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' opened Chicago Online in 1992.<ref name="Carlson" /><ref name="books.google.com"/><ref name="NYT Glaberson" />

The paper sent [[floppy disk]]s to subscribers for accessing Mercury Center. The service featured a large amount of content for free: the print paper's full content, supplementary material such as documents and audio clips, stock quotes, and about 200 stories that did not make the print edition. A [[Internet forum|forum]] enabled readers to converse with each other and give feedback to reporters. However, the service's most popular content lie behind a [[paywall]]: back issues from 1985 onward and a "NewsHound" clipping service were popular with business users.<ref name="CJR Shapiro" /><ref>{{cite news|title=A Sign-on, a Mouse, Voila--It's Your Newspaper! : Information: The future is now at the San Jose Mercury News with an array of features by way of a personal computer.|first=Amy|last=Harmon|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=January 17, 1994|accessdate=June 19, 2018|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-17/news/mn-12676_1_san-jose-mercury-news}}</ref> Readers could enter alphanumeric codes, which appeared throughout the print paper, to quickly access online versions of articles that did not make print. Examples included {{kbd|N620}} for an article in the news section or {{kbd|B770}} for a press release in the business section. The Mercury Center staff comprised both news reporters and business "senders", who posted [[press release]]s online in addition to vetted content.<ref name="NYT Glaberson frontier">{{cite news |title= The Media Business; In San Jose, Knight-Ridder Tests a Newspaper Frontier |first= William |last=Glaberson |work= The New York Times |date= Feb 7, 1994 |accessdate= June 20, 2018 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/07/business/the-media-business-in-san-jose-knight-ridder-tests-a-newspaper-frontier.html}}</ref>

Initially, the service had difficulty attracting users, prompting the paper to add a telephone and fax hotline, News Call, in November 1993. By early 1994, Mercury Center had added 5,100 subscribers to AOL, representing less than 20% of AOL's 30,000 subscribers in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] or less than two percent of the ''Mercury News''{{'}}s 282,488 daily subscribers.<ref name="NYT Glaberson frontier" /><ref name="WWW">{{cite press release|title=San Jose Mercury News Now Publishing on the World Wide Web|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=January 18, 1995|accessdate=June 20, 2018|url=http://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/impact/w95/RN/jan27news/merc-cntr}}</ref>

In December 1994, the ''Mercury News'' began beta-testing a companion website, Mercury Center Web,<ref name="Carlson" /> which on January 20, 1995, became the country's first news website.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Online Timeline, 1995-99|first=David|last=Carlson|work=David Carlson's Virtual World|date=2009|accessdate=June 18, 2018|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/carlson/1995s.shtml}}</ref> Subscribers no longer needed AOL to access the ''Mercury News''{{'}}s online content, and the paper no longer had to share advertising revenue with AOL.<ref name="CJR Shapiro" /> The site ran on [[Netscape]]'s Netsite Web server, with connectivity provided by [[Netcom (United States)|Netcom]].<ref name="WWW" /> Access to the site cost $4.95 per month, with a discount for print subscribers. In October 1995, CareerBuilder.com launched as a partnership between the ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''Mercury News'', ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]''. Mercury Center shut down its AOL service in July 1996, leaving only the website.<ref name="CJR Shapiro" />

In August 1996, the ''Mercury News'' published "Dark Alliance", a series of investigative articles by reporter [[Gary Webb]] that claimed [[CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking]] (see {{section link||Controversies}}). The ''Mercury News'' promoted the upcoming series on [[Usenet newsgroup]]s weeks in advance. Mercury Center published reporting and supporting material online simultaneously with the print edition. The robust online production drew significant national attention to the series. Within days, more than 2,500 websites linked to Mercury Center's "Dark Alliance" section, and the site received 100,000 daily page views over the usual traffic for weeks. Executive editor [[Jerome Ceppos]] eventually distanced the paper from the series, but it continued to receive attention, especially from online conspiracy theorists.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Apology Not Accepted|first=Karenna|last=Gore|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=May 16, 1997|accessdate=June 18, 2018|url=http://www.slate.com/business/2018/06/the-labor-shortage-and-wage-reaction-puzzle-solved-with-one-graph.html}}</ref>

On October 26, 1999, technology columnist [[Dan Gillmor]] began writing a [[blog]], ''eJournal'', on the ''Mercury News''{{'}} SiliconValley.com website. It is believed to have been the first blog by a journalist at a traditional media company.<ref>{{cite book|title=Say Everything: How Blogging Began, What It's Becoming, and Why It Matters|first=Scott|last=Rosenberg|authorlink=Scott Rosenberg (journalist)|location=New York City|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishers]]|year=2009|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sayeverythinghow00rose/page/134 134–135]|isbn=978-0-307-45136-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sayeverythinghow00rose/page/134}}</ref><ref name="Bayosphere">{{cite web|title=Welcome to My Old Blog|first=Dan|last=Gillmor|work=Bayosphere|date=October 26, 2009|accessdate=June 22, 2018|url=http://bayosphere.com/2009/10/26/welcome-to-my-old-blog/}}</ref> In the 2000s, he was joined by columnists-turned-bloggers [[Tim Kawakami]] and [[John Paczkowski]].

==Awards==
The newspaper has earned several awards, including two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, one in 1986 for reporting regarding political corruption in the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] administration in the [[Philippines]], and one in 1990 for their comprehensive coverage of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]].

Various staff writers and designers have received awards for their contributions to ''[[San Jose Mercury News West Magazine|West]]'' magazine, a Sunday insert published by the ''Mercury News'' in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Controversies==
In August 1996, the ''Mercury News'' published "Dark Alliance", a series of investigative articles by reporter [[Gary Webb]]. The series claimed that members of the Nicaraguan [[Contras]], an anti-government group organized with the help of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], had been involved in smuggling cocaine into America to support their struggle, and as a result had played a major role in creating the crack-cocaine epidemic of the 1980s. The series sparked three federal investigations, but other newspapers such as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later published articles alleging that the series' claims were overstated. Executive editor Jerry Ceppos, who had approved the series, eventually published a column that suggested shortcomings in the series' reporting, editing, and production, while maintaining the story was correct "on many important points".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ceppos |first=Jerry |title=To readers of our 'Dark Alliance' series |work=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=2015-02-11 |date=1997-05-11 |url=http://www.sjmercury.com/drugs/column051197.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971119070955/http://www.sjmercury.com/drugs/column051197.htm |archivedate=November 19, 1997 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Storm over 'Dark Alliance'|first=Peter|last=Kornbluh|authorlink=Peter Kornbluh|journal=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|publisher=Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|date=January 1997|accessdate=June 22, 2018|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/storm.htm|via=[[National Security Archive]]}}</ref> The series was turned into a 1998 [[Dark Alliance (book)|a book by the same name]], also by Webb, and an account of the controversy surrounding the series was published as ''[[Kill the Messenger (Schou book)|Kill the Messenger]]'' in 2006. Both were the basis for the 2014 film ''[[Kill the Messenger (2014 film)|Kill the Messenger]]''.
