==Background==
[[Siddharth Varadarajan]] resigned from his position as editor at ''[[The Hindu]]'' citing the return of the editorship of the paper to being family run in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/hh3F4srDSuGG7aQaQWqckL/Former-editor-of-The-Hindu-to-launch-news-website.html|title=Former editor of 'The Hindu' to launch news website|last=Choudhary|first=Vidhi|date=8 May 2015|website=Livemint|language=en|access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref> On 11 May 2015, ''The Wire'' was started by Siddharth Varadarajan, Sidharth Bhatia and M.&nbsp;K. Venu who had initially funded the website. Later, it was made part of the Foundation for Independent Journalism, a non-profit [[India]]n company.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/60255/how-the-wire-is-funded/|title=How The Wire is Funded - The Wire|last=Staff|first=The Wire|website=thewire.in|language=en-GB|access-date=4 July 2017}}</ref> The Independent and Public Spirited Media Foundation (IPSMF) has provided ''The Wire'' with funding as well.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ipsmf.org/|title=IPSMF {{!}} The Independent and Public-Spirited (IPS) Media Foundation|website=ipsmf.org|language=en-US|access-date=5 July 2017}}</ref> 

Varadarajan claims that the publication was created as a "platform for independent journalism",<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Consumer/hh3F4srDSuGG7aQaQWqckL/Former-editor-of-The-Hindu-to-launch-news-website.html|title=Former editor of 'The Hindu' to launch news website|last=Choudhary|first=Vidhi|date=8 May 2015|work=livemint.com|access-date=5 July 2017}}</ref> and that its non-corporate structure and funding sources aim to free it from the "commercial and political pressures" that supposedly afflict mainstream Indian news outlets.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/special_report/india_digital_revolution_startups_scoopwhoop_wire_times.php|title=Can the digital revolution save Indian journalism?|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=5 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jay-shah-files-criminal-defamation-case-against-the-wire/articleshow/61009272.cms|title=Jay Shah files criminal defamation case against 'The Wire'|date=9 October 2017|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=15 October 2017}}</ref> ''The Wire''{{'}}s founding is construed to be a result of, and reaction to, a political environment that has "discouraged dissent" against the present Indian ruling [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].<ref name=":2" /> 

A story published in the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' in late 2016 identified ''The Wire'' as one of several independent and recently founded internet-based media platforms - a group that also included ''[[Newslaundry]]'', [[Scroll.in]], ''[[The News Minute]]'', ''[[The Quint]]'' and [[ScoopWhoop]] - that were attempting to challenge the dominance of India's traditional print and television news companies and their online offshoots.<ref name=":2" />

''The Wire''{{'}}s coverage principally focuses on the topics of "politics, foreign policy, political economy, science and development", according to an article published on ''[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]''.<ref name=":1" />

A December 2019 article by [[Dexter Filkins]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', noted ''The Wire'' is one of the few small outfits and the most prominent (other than [[The Caravan]]), to have engaged in providing aggressive coverage of the current [[Government of India|Indian Govt]] ruled by [[Bharatiya Janata Party | BJP]] at a time when mainstream media is failing to do so.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india|title=Blood and Soil in Narendra Modi's India|last=Filkins|first=Dexter|journal=The New Yorker|date=2 December 2019|access-date=3 December 2019|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

===Jay Shah===
[[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) chief [[Amit Shah]]'s son Jay Shah filed a criminal defamation case against the editors of ''The Wire'' for printing an article titled 'The Golden Touch of Jay Amit Shah'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/business/amit-shah-narendra-modi-jay-shah-bjp|title=The Golden Touch of Jay Amit Shah|website=The Wire|accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>, an investigative story by Rohini Singh. A BJP-led coalition had formed the government at the centre following their win in the [[2014 Indian general election]], and [[Narendra Modi]] had become the Prime Minister. The article alluded to possible irregularities in Jay Shah's business dealings, claiming that the turnover of a company owned by him increased 16,000 times over in the year following the election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/jay-shah-files-criminal-defamation-case-against-the-wire/article9895618.ece|title=Jay Shah files criminal defamation case against 'The Wire'|last=PTI|date=9 October 2017|website=TheHinduBusinessLine.com|access-date=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://pen-international.org/app/uploads/PEN-Int-India-Report-2018.pdf|title=India : Pursuing truth in the face of intolerance|last=Kumar|first=Raksha|publisher=[[PEN International]]|year=2018|location=London|pages=11|chapter=Criminal Defamation : An effective legal gag on free speech}}</ref>

Jay Shah filed the case in court 13 of the Ahmedabad Metropolitan Magistrate against four editors/reporters of ''The Wire''. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate SK Gadhvi ordered a court inquiry into the matter under CrPC section 202 to inquire into the case to decide whether or not there is sufficient ground for a case to be filed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/61009272.cms|title=Jay Shah files criminal defamation case against 'The Wire'|date=9 October 2017|access-date=15 October 2017|newspaper=The Economic Times}}</ref> Observing that "prima facie it seems there is a case" against ''The Wire'' for its defamatory article against Shah, a metropolitan court issued summons to the reporter of the article and editors of the website to appear before it on 13 November in the criminal defamation case filed against them. The order also mentions Shah's contention that "the news portal didn't give enough time to him to send his response, the article didn't include the loss incurred by his company in the year 2015-2016, and created confusion over the turnover to defame him."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jay-shah-defamation-case-citing-prima-facie-case-court-summons-reporter-editors-4905168|title=Jay Shah defamation case: Citing prima facie case, court summons reporter, editors|date=25 October 2017|access-date=25 October 2017|via=The Indian Express}}</ref>

The Ahmedabad civil court on 23 December vacated the ex parte and interim injunction. The court lifted all restrictions except the use of words (after) "Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister/elected as Prime Minister." ''The Wire'' called the lifting of the injunction a "victory for The Wire", and that the "decision by the civil court is a vindication of ''The Wire''{{'}}s fundamental stand that its article had been a legitimate exercise of the freedom of expression in the public interest."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newslaundry.com/shorts/court-lifts-stay-jay-shah-injunction-wire|title=Court lifts stay on The Wire's story on Jay Shah|date=23 December 2017|access-date=3 January 2018|via=newslaundry.com}}</ref> However, the [[Gujarat High court]] later reinstated the gag order and refused to quash the criminal defamation case filed by Jay Shah.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/latest/869344/jay-shah-defamation-case-gujarat-high-court-restores-gag-order-on-the-wire|title=Jay Shah defamation case: Gujarat High Court restores gag order on The Wire|last=Staff|first=Scroll|work=Scroll.in|access-date=17 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> ''The Wire'' had appealed in the [[Supreme Court of India]] against this order.

The Wire pleaded for the withdrawal of its plea seeking quashing of the defamation proceedings against it. The portal said they were ready for further proceedings in the Gujarat trial Court. The Supreme Court bench allowed the withdrawal on 27 August 2019. The court remarked that, "''it has become a fashion to serve notice to a person for explanation and even before it can be answered, the articles are published within five to six hours"'' expressing its anguish and also ordered that the trial be completed "''as expeditiously as possible''."<ref>{{Cite web|date=28 August 2019|title=Jay Shah defamation case: SC allows The Wire to withdraw plea|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jay-shah-defamation-case-supreme-court-allows-news-portal-to-withdraw-plea-5942893/|access-date=4 June 2020|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=27 August 2019|title=SC allows The Wire to withdraw appeal in defamation case filed by Jay Shah|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/sc-allows-the-wire-to-withdraw-appeal-in-defamation-case-filed-by-jay-shah-1566920923364.html|access-date=4 June 2020|website=livemint|language=en}}</ref>
