'''Fisher Island''' is a [[census-designated place]] in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], located on a [[barrier island]] of the same name. As of 2015, Fisher Island had the highest [[per capita income]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/america-richest-zip-code-100000530.html|title=This Is America's Richest Zip Code|website=Yahoo.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> of any place in the United States. The [[census-designated place|CDP]] had only 218 households and a total population of 467.

Named for automotive parts pioneer and beach real estate developer [[Carl G. Fisher]], who once owned it,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Fisher Island is three miles off shore of [[mainland]] [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]]. No road or causeway connects to the island, which is accessible by private [[boat]], [[helicopter]], or [[ferry]]. Once a one-family island home of [[Vanderbilt family|the Vanderbilts]], and later several other millionaires, it was sold for development in the 1960s.  The property sat vacant for well over 15 years before development began for very limited and restrictive multi-family use.

==History==
Fisher Island was separated from the barrier island which became Miami Beach in 1905, when [[Government Cut]] was dredged across the southern end of the island.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/08/us/big-island-near-miami-being-developed.html?auth=link-dismiss-google1tap|title=Big Ilands Near Miami Being Developed|last=Stuart|first=Reginald|date=July 8, 1983|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 2, 2019}}</ref> Construction of Fisher Island began in 1919 when [[Carl G. Fisher]], a land developer, purchased the property from businessman and real estate developer [[Dana A. Dorsey]], southern Florida's first African-American millionaire. In 1925 [[William Kissam Vanderbilt II]] traded a luxury [[yacht]] to Fisher for ownership of the island.

After Vanderbilt's death in 1944, ownership of the island passed to [[U.S. Steel]] heir Edward Moore. Moore died in the early 1950s, and [[Gar Wood]], the millionaire inventor of hydraulic construction equipment, bought it. Wood, a speedboat enthusiast, kept the island a one-family retreat. In 1963, Wood sold to a development group that included local [[Key Biscayne]] millionaire [[Charles Rebozo|Bebe Rebozo]], Miami native and [[United States Senator]] [[George Smathers]] and then former U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who had promised to leave politics. During his subsequent presidency from 1968–1973, and during the [[Watergate scandal]], Nixon maintained a home on nearby Key Biscayne known as the "Key Biscayne Whitehouse" that was the former residence of Senator Smathers and next door to Rebozo, but none of the three ever resided on Fisher Island.

The [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]] (RSMAS) of the [[University of Miami]] maintained the Comparative Sedimentology Laboratory on Fisher Island from 1972 to 1990 under the leadership of Robert Ginsburg.

After years of legal battles and changes in ownership, further development on the island was finally started in the 1980s, with architecture matching the original 1920s [[Spanish architecture|Spanish style]] mansions. Although no longer a one-family island, in 2005, Fisher Island still remains somewhat inaccessible to the public and uninvited guests, and is as exclusive by modern standards as it was in the days of the Vanderbilts, providing similar refuge and retreat for its residents. The island contains [[mansion]]s, a hotel, several apartment buildings, an observatory, and a private [[marina]]. [[Boris Becker]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], and [[Mel Brooks]] are among the [[celebrity|celebrities]] with homes on the island.

In 2005, the island attempted to incorporate as a town, but the Miami-Dade County Commission did not support this initiative.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fisherislandvillage.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125143323/http://www.fisherislandvillage.org/ |archive-date=2007-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Controversies===
In 2006, the [[Service Employees International Union]]  began organizing the workers on Fisher Island in preparation for a petition for recognition as those employees' bargaining representative. The campaign culminated on June 15, 2007 with a march to the mainland ferry terminal that ended with a worker's arrest.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/460/story/141673.html] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}</ref>  ''The New York Times'' wrote an exposé on the situation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/business/01fisher.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=An Island of Moguls Is Latest Front in Union Battle | first=Eduardo | last=Porter | date=2007-02-01 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> In the article, residents were portrayed as not caring about the welfare of the community, but residents dispute this characterization, insisting that the island includes financially successful, compassionate people who have established several charitable activities on the island, provide health insurance to their employees and are involved in various arts organizations in the Miami-Dade area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The union argues that the wages provided by the island are too low for employees to care for their families and that the health insurance provided is out of the reach of most island employees.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===The Fisher Island bankruptcy case===
One of the last developable parcels of land on the island, a 15-acre site approved for residential development facing the shipping channel that separates the island from Miami Beach, was for a number of years subject to a protracted legal battle between [[Inna Gudavadze]], the widow of the late [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] billionaire [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]], and investors aligned with his distant relative and former business associate, Joseph Kay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/realestate/fisher-island-a-gilded-island-swirling-with-intrigue.html|title=Fisher Island: A Gilded Island, Swirling With Intrigue|first=Alexei|last=Barrionuevo|date=27 December 2012|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>

A judgement handed down by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida<ref>[In re: Fisher Island Investments, Inc., and Little Rest Twelve, Inc., United States District Court For The Southern District of Florida, Case No. 12-cv-20939-KMW, 10/16.2013]</ref> on 16 October 2013 upheld in the US a previous 2010 judgement from the Supreme Court of Gibraltar that comprehensively dismissed the "wholly unconvincing" case brought by Joseph Kay.<ref>[IN THE MATTER of the trusts known as The Valmore Trust and The Summit Trust, Mr Justice Dudley, The Supreme Court of Gibraltar, Claim No. 2008 M No 70, 17 December 2009]</ref> The development is now being completed under the supervision of Inna Gudavadze and the Patarkatsishvili family.
