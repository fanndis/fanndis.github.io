An '''honorary degree'''{{NoteTag|Although the spelling '''''honorary''''' is correct in all instances, the term for such an award is spelled ''honor'' in [[American English]] and ''honour'' in [[British English]]; see [[American and British English spelling differences#-our, -or|spelling differences]].}} is an [[academic degree]] for which a [[university]] (or other degree-awarding institution) has waived all of the usual requirements, such as [[matriculation]], attendance, [[course credit]]s, a [[dissertation]], and the passing of [[comprehensive examinations]]. It is also known by the [[Latin]] phrases ''honoris causa'' ("for the sake of the honour") or ''ad honorem'' ("to the honour"). The degree is typically a doctorate or, less commonly, a [[master's degree]], and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Honorary Degree|url=http://honorarydegrees.wvu.edu/history|journal=honorarydegrees.wvu.edu|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330034606/http://honorarydegrees.wvu.edu/history|archive-date=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> or no previous postsecondary education. An example of identifying a recipient of this award is as follows: Doctorate in Business Administration (''Hon. Causa'').

The degree is often conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished visitor's contributions to a specific field or to society in general.<ref name="Brandeis University">{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/trustees/hdr/|title=Honorary Degrees: A Short History|publisher=Brandeis University}}</ref>

It is sometimes recommended that such degrees be listed in one's [[curriculum vitae]] (CV) as an award, and not in the education section.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commencement.msu.edu/general-information/honorary-degrees|title=Honorary Degrees}}</ref> With regard to the use of this honorific, the policies of institutions of higher education generally ask that recipients "refrain from adopting the misleading title"<ref name="McNeilage">{{cite news|last=McNeilage|first=Amy|title=Ian Thorpe now Dr Thorpedo, man of letters|access-date=4 October 2014|url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/ian-thorpe-now-dr-thorpedo-man-of-letters-20141002-10ozg8.html|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=4–5 October 2014|page=31}}</ref> and that a recipient of an honorary doctorate should restrict the use of the title "Dr" before their name to any engagement with the institution of higher education in question and not within the broader community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usq.edu.au/~/media/USQ/About-USQ/About%20us/Honorary%20Doctorate%20Guidelines%20FINAL_29%20May%202012.ashx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725094013/https://www.usq.edu.au/~/media/USQ/About-USQ/About%20us/Honorary%20Doctorate%20Guidelines%20FINAL_29%20May%202012.ashx|archive-date=2017-07-25|title=Honorary Doctorate Guidelines|date=2012|publisher=University of Southern Queensland}}</ref> Rev.

==Historical origins==
The practice dates back to the [[Middle Ages]], when for various reasons a university might be persuaded, or otherwise see fit, to grant exemption from some or all of the usual statutory requirements for the awarding of a degree. The earliest honorary degree on record was awarded to [[Lionel Woodville]] in the late 1470s by the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name=buxton /> He later became [[Bishop of Salisbury]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Woodville, Lionel, bishop of Salisbury|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/29938|journal=oxforddnb.com}}</ref>

In the latter part of the 16th century, the granting of honorary degrees became quite common, especially on the occasion of royal visits to Oxford or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref name="buxton">Buxton, L. H. Dudley and [[Strickland Gibson|Gibson, Strickland]], ''Oxford University Ceremonies'', Oxford University Press (1935)</ref> On the visit of [[James I of England|James I]] to Oxford in 1605, for example, forty-three members of his retinue (fifteen of whom were [[earl]]s or [[baron]]s) received the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]], and the Register of Convocation explicitly states that these were full degrees, carrying the usual privileges (such as voting rights in [[Convocation]] and [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]]).<ref name=buxton />

==Modern practice==
Honorary degrees are usually awarded at regular [[graduation]] ceremonies, at which the recipients are often invited to make a speech of acceptance before the assembled [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] and graduates – an event which often forms the highlight of the ceremony. Generally, universities nominate several persons each year for honorary degrees; these nominees usually go through several [[committee]]s before receiving approval. Those who are nominated are generally not told until a formal approval and invitation are made; often it is perceived that the system is shrouded in secrecy, and occasionally seen as political and controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |title=What are Honorary Doctorate Degrees?|url=http://education-portal.com/articles/What_are_Honorary_Doctorate_Degrees.html|journal=education-portal.com}}</ref>

The term ''honorary degree'' is a slight misnomer: ''honoris causa'' degrees are not considered of the same standing as substantive degrees earned by the standard academic processes of courses and original research, except perhaps where the recipient has demonstrated an appropriate level of academic scholarship that would ordinarily qualify him or her for the award of a substantive degree.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Doctorates a dime a dozen?|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2008/11/11/fea07.asp|journal=archives.dailynews.lk|date = 11 November 2008}}</ref> Recipients of honorary degrees typically wear the same [[academic dress]] as recipients of substantive degrees, although there are a few exceptions: honorary graduates at the [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|University of Cambridge]] wear the appropriate full-dress gown but not the hood, and those at the [[Academic dress of the University of St Andrews|University of St Andrews]] wear a black [[cassock]] instead of the usual full-dress gown.

An ''[[ad eundem degree|ad eundem]]'' or ''jure officii'' degree is sometimes considered honorary, although they are only conferred on an individual who has already achieved a comparable qualification at another university or by attaining an office requiring the appropriate level of scholarship. Under certain circumstances, a degree may be conferred on an individual for both the nature of the office they hold and the completion of a dissertation. The "dissertation et jure dignitatis" is considered to be a full academic degree. See [[#Customary_degrees_.28Ad_eundem_degrees.29|below]].

Although [[higher doctorate]]s such as DSc, DLitt, etc., are often awarded ''honoris causa'', in many countries (notably England and Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand) it is possible formally to earn such a degree.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Doctorates of the University|url=http://universidadazteca.net/grados_propios/doctor_universitario|journal=universidadazteca.net}}</ref> This typically involves the submission of a portfolio of peer-refereed research, usually undertaken over a number of years, which has made a substantial contribution to the academic field in question. The university will appoint a panel of examiners who will consider the case and prepare a report recommending whether or not the degree be awarded. Usually, the applicant must have some strong formal connection with the university in question, for example full-time academic staff, or graduates of several years' standing.

Some universities, seeking to differentiate between substantive and honorary doctorates, have a degree (often DUniv, or Doctor of the University) which is used for these purposes, with the other higher doctorates reserved for formally examined academic scholarship.

The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] has the authority to award degrees. These "[[Lambeth degrees]]" are sometimes, erroneously, thought to be honorary; however the archbishops have for many centuries had the legal authority (originally as the representatives of the [[Pope]], later confirmed by [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations|a 1533 Act]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]), to award degrees and regularly do so to people who have either passed an examination or are deemed to have satisfied the appropriate requirements.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Archbishop of Canterbury awards Lambeth Degrees|url=http://rowanwilliams.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/2649/archbishop-of-canterbury-awards-lambeth-degrees|journal=rowanwilliams.archbishopofcanterbury.org|date = 16 October 2012}}</ref>

Between the two extremes of honoring celebrities and formally assessing a portfolio of research, some universities use honorary degrees to recognize achievements of intellectual rigor. Some institutes of higher education do not confer honorary degrees as a matter of policy—see [[#Institutions_not_awarding_honorary_degrees|below]]. Some learned societies award honorary fellowships in the same way as honorary degrees are awarded by universities, for similar reasons.

===Practical use===
[[File:Ezra Stiles George Washington Honorary Degree.jpg|thumb|Letter from [[Ezra Stiles]] to [[George Washington]] announcing the awarding of an honorary degree to Washington by the president and fellows of [[Yale College]] (1781).]]

A typical example of university regulations is, "Honorary graduates may use the approved post-nominal letters. It is not customary, however, for recipients of an honorary doctorate to adopt the prefix 'Dr.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookes.ac.uk/uniregulations/current/acadregulations/specific/b3procedure_for_award_of_honorary_degrees.pdf |title=Oxford Brooks University Regulations |format=PDF |access-date=2012-04-03}}</ref> In some universities, it is however a matter of personal preference for an honorary doctor to use the formal title of "Doctor", regardless of the background circumstances for the award. Written communications where an honorary doctorate has been awarded may include the letters "h.c." after the award to indicate that status.

The recipient of an honorary degree may add the degree title [[postnominal]]ly, but it should{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} always be made clear that the degree is honorary by adding "honorary" or "honoris causa" or "h.c." in [[Bracket#Parentheses ()|parentheses]] after the degree title. In some countries, a person who holds an honorary doctorate may use the title "Doctor" [[prenominal]]ly, abbreviated "Dr.h.c." or "Dr.(h.c.)". Sometimes, they use "Hon" before the degree letters, for example, "Hon DMus".

In recent years, some universities have adopted entirely separate postnominal titles for honorary degrees. This is in part due to the confusion that honorary degrees have caused. For example, an honorary doctorate from the [[Auckland University of Technology]] takes the special title ''HonD'' since it is now common in certain countries to use certain degrees, such as LLD or HonD, as purely honorary. Some universities, including the [[Open University]], grant Doctor of the University (DUniv) degrees to selected nominees, while awarding PhD or EdD degrees to those who have fulfilled the academic requirements.

Most{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} American universities award the degrees of LLD ([[Doctor of Laws]]), LittD ([[Doctor of Letters]]), LHD ([[Doctor of Humane Letters]]), ScD ([[Doctor of Science]]), PedD (Doctor of Pedagogy) and DD ([[Doctor of Divinity]]) only as honorary degrees. American universities do not have the system of "higher doctorates" used in the UK and some other universities around the world.

Some universities and colleges have the custom of awarding a master's degree to every scholar appointed as a full professor, who had never earned a degree there. At the universities of Oxford, [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] and Cambridge, many senior staff are granted the degree of Master of Arts after three years of service,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/so/2011/chapter02-section6.html|author=[[University of Cambridge]]|title=Statutes and Ordinances II.6: Status of Master of Arts|access-date=2013-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/registrar/assets/pdf/MA%20jo%20Form.pdf|title=Master in Arts (jure officii) form|publisher=[[University of Dublin]]|access-date=19 April 2015}}</ref> and at [[Amherst College]] all tenured professors are awarded a Master of Arts degree at an academic convocation in the autumn, even though the school only offers an earned [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree (Amherst awards honorary doctorates at commencement in the spring to notable scholars and other special invitees). Schools such as [[Brown University]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Harvard University]] also award tenured faculty, who do not have a degree from their respective schools, the AM ''[[ad eundem]]''.

These ''ad eundem'' or ''jure officii'' degrees are earned degrees, not honorary, because they recognize formal learning.

Similarly, a ''jure dignitatis'' degree is awarded to someone who has demonstrated eminence and scholarship by being appointed to a particular office. Thus, for example, a DD (Doctor of Divinity) might be conferred upon a bishop on the occasion of his consecration, or a judge created [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] (Legum Doctor) or [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] (Doctor of Civil Law) upon his or her appointment to the judicial bench. These, also, are properly considered substantive rather than honorary degrees.

Some universities and colleges have been accused of granting honorary degrees in exchange for large donations. Honorary degree recipients, particularly those who have no prior academic qualifications, have sometimes been criticized if they insist on being called "Doctor" as a result of their award, as the [[honorific]] may mislead the general public about their qualifications. It can be similarly misleading when respected individuals are referred to as "Professor", especially in a university or government context.<ref name="Mannheim">{{cite news|last1=Mannheim|first1=Markus|title=Universities tell Finance Department head Jane Halton to stop calling herself 'professor'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/public-service/universities-tell-finance-department-head-jane-halton-to-stop-calling-herself-professor-20141119-11pk93.html|access-date=19 November 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 November 2014}}</ref>

The Philosophy Faculty at Cambridge courted controversy among the academic community in March 1992, when three of its members posed a temporary veto against the awarding of an honorary doctorate to [[Jacques Derrida]];<ref name="Francis06p77">{{cite book|last=Wheen|first=Francis|title=''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World''|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2006|isbn=0-00-714097-5|page=77}}</ref> they and other non-Cambridge proponents of [[analytic philosophy]] protested against the granting on the grounds that Derrida's work "did not conform with accepted measures of academic rigor." Although the University eventually passed the motion, the episode did more to draw attention to the continuing antipathy between the analytic (of which Cambridge's faculty is a leading exponent) and the post-[[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] [[continental philosophy|continental]] philosophical traditions (with which Derrida's work is more closely associated).

In 1996, [[Southampton College]] at [[Long Island University]] (now a campus of [[Stony Brook University]]) awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Amphibious Letters to [[Muppet]] [[Kermit the Frog]]. Although some students objected to awarding a degree to a Muppet, Kermit delivered an enjoyable commencement address and the small college received considerable press coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.liu.edu/news/commence/1996/kermit.htm|title=Southampton College News: Kermit's Commencement Address at Southampton College|publisher=Southampton.liu.edu|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130032057/http://www.southampton.liu.edu/news/commence/1996/kermit.htm|archive-date=30 January 2008|access-date=2010-09-05|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The degree was conferred in recognition of efforts in the area of environmentalism.

The awarding of an honorary degree to political figures can prompt protests from faculty or students. In 2001, [[George W.

Few people object when an honorary degree is awarded in a field that the awardee is noted for.

In 2007, protesters demanded that the [[University of Edinburgh]] revoke an honorary degree awarded to [[Zimbabwe]]an leader [[Robert Mugabe]] in 1984. The University subsequently revealed plans to review its honorary degree policy and strip certain figures of their honorary degrees who did not deserve them. When considering revoking the honorary degree of a political figure, such reasons as [[human rights abuse]] or [[political corruption]] would be considered. As a result, it was announced that Mugabe had been stripped of his honorary degree. The University also planned to have a more rigorous selection procedure regarding potential recipients of honorary degrees, in an attempt to rectify the trend of awarding degrees to celebrities.<ref>{{cite news | last = MacLeod | first = Murdo | title = Degree of anger at roll of dishonour | newspaper = The Scotsman | date = 14 January 2007 | url =http://www.scotsman.com/news/degree-of-anger-at-roll-of-dishonour-1-1425999 | location=Edinburgh |access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref> Students at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] also
