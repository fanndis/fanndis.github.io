'''''Farmer Boy''''' is a children's [[historical novel]] written by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] and published in 1933. It was the second-published one in the [[Little House series|'' Little House'' series]] but it is not related to the first, which that of the third directly continues. Thus the later ''Little House on the Prairie'' is sometimes called the second one in the series, or the second volume of "the Laura Years".{{efn|name=almanzo}}

==Plot summary==

The novel is based on the childhood of Wilder's husband, [[Almanzo Wilder]], who grew up in the 1860s near the town of [[Malone, New York]]. It covers roughly one year of his life, beginning just before his ninth birthday and describes a full year of farming.  It<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingalls Wilder|first=Laura|title=Farmer Boy|year=1933|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York NY|isbn=978-006-4400039|pages=[https://archive.org/details/farmerboy00wild_0/page/240 240]–51|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/farmerboy00wild_0}}</ref> describes in detail the endless chores involved in running the Wilder family farm, all without powered vehicles or electricity. Young as he is, he rises before 5 am every day to milk cows and feedstock. In the growing season, he plants and tends crops; in winter, he hauls logs, helps fill the ice house, trains a team of young oxen, and sometimes—when his father can spare him—goes to school. The novel includes stories of his brother, Royal, and sisters, Eliza Jane and Alice.

==Historical background==

Since Almanzo (1857–1949) was born in February 1857, the novel is set in 1866–1867, before Laura's birth (1867–1957). It features Almanzo's brother, Royal (1847–1925), and sisters, Eliza Jane (1850–1930) and Alice (1853–1892). Meanwhile, he also had a sister named Laura (1844–1899), who at the time and events in the novel was already about 22 and had presumably moved out. He later had a brother named Perley Day (1869–1934), who was not yet born at the time the novel is set.<ref>[http://www.members.tripod.com/~PennyN "The Genealogy of Almanzo and Laura Ingalls Wilder"].
