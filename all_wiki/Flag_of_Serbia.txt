The '''flag of Serbia''' ({{lang-sr|{{lang|sr-Cyrl|Застава Србије}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|zastava Srbije}}}}), also known as the '''Tricolor''' (тробојка / ''trobojka''), is a [[tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] consisting of three equal horizontal bands, [[red]] on the top and [[blue]] in the middle ([[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]]), and [[white]] on the bottom ([[Serbian Empire|Empire]]). The same tricolour, in altering variations, has been used since the 19th century as the flag of the state of [[Serbia]] and the [[Serbs|Serbian nation]]. The current form of the flag was officially adopted on 11 November 2010.<ref name="Novosti">[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:308459-Grb-Srbije-Dvoglavi-orao-menja-perje Grb Srbije: Dvoglavi orao menja perje] (in Serbian)</ref>

==Medieval flags==
===Flag of Stefan Vladislav===

The son of King [[Stefan Vladislav]] (reigned 1233–1243), ''župan'' Desa, sent delegates from [[Kotor]] to [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa (Dubrovnik)]] to bring back part of the king's treasury held at Ragusa, which they did on 3 July 1281; the inventory list included, among other things, "a flag of red and blue color".{{sfn|Stanojević|1934|p=79}} It is described as ''vexillum unum de zendato rubeo et blavo''—"a flag of fabric red and blue"; ''zendato'' ({{lang-sr|čenda}}) being a type of light, silky fabric.{{sfn|Samardžić|1983}} This is the oldest known attestation of colours of a Serbian flag; the oldest known Serbian flag was red and blue.{{sfn|Stanojević|1934|p=79}} But already in 1271 the flag colors of župan Desa, were red and white.{{sfn|Kostić|1960|p=9-12}} Although the color order is not known, the version with horizontal red and blue is sometimes used in medieval-themed events in modern Serbia.<ref>{{Cite web|date=22 July 2020|url=https://www.b92.net/zivot/vesti.php?yyyy=2020&mm=07&dd=22&nav_id=1708947|title=Nije bila trobojka: Ovako je izgledala najstarija srpska zastava|work=[[B92]]|accessdate=14 September 2020|language=sr}}</ref>

===Flag of Stefan Uroš===
Hungarian King [[Bela IV]] mentioned in his charter dated 8 April 1268, that his army had defeated King [[Stefan Uroš I]] (reigned 1243–1276), and that when he hosted some foreign rulers, his magnates brought captured Serbs and "in the sign of triumph, the flag of King Uroš before the court of Bela IV, and erected it there".{{sfn|Stanojević|1934|p=79}}

===Flag of Stefan Dečanski===
In 1326, Dečanski sent a delegate to the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in Alexandria and sought a flag in yellow colour, to be used as a war flag.<ref>{{harvnb|Kostić|1960|p=16}}, {{harvnb|Stanojević|1934|p=79}}</ref> The Byzantines mention that there were several war flags hoisted by the Serbs at the [[Battle of Velbazhd]] (1330), and the yellow one was likely one of those.{{sfn|Stanojević|1934|p=79}}

===Flags of Emperor Dušan===

The oldest known drawing of a Serbian flag is from the 1339 map made by [[Angelino Dulcert]]; Serbia, at the time ruled by King [[Stefan Dušan]], is represented by a white flag of a red [[double-headed eagle]] placed above the capital [[Skopje]] (''Scopi'').{{sfn|Solovjev|1958|pp=134–135}}{{sfn|Škrivanić|1979}} Stefan Dušan was crowned Emperor in 1346; Dušan also adopted the Byzantine ''tetragramme'' with four fire-steels, which afterwards became an element of the Serbian flag until today (the Serbian cross).{{sfn|Stanojević|1934|pp=79–80}} A flag in [[Hilandar]], seen by Dimitrije Avramović, was alleged by the brotherhood to have been a flag of Emperor Dušan; it was a [[Triband (flag)|triband]] of red at the top and bottom and white in the centre.{{sfn|Stanojević|1934|p=80}} Emperor Dušan also adopted the Imperial ''[[divelion]]'', which was purple and had a golden cross in the centre.{{sfn|Milićević|1995|p=22}} Another of Dušan's flags was the Imperial cavalry flag, kept at the [[Hilandar|Hilandar monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]; a triangular bicolor flag, of red and yellow.{{sfn|Atlagić|1997}}

==Revolutionary flags==

During the [[First Serbian Uprising]], various flags were used. Among the early flags, the one described by [[Mateja Nenadović]] could be connected with today's flag and the first Serbian flag: it was red-blue-red with a [[Serbian cross]].<ref>B. A: [http://flagspot.net/flags/rs_pr.html Principality of Serbia (1830–1882) FOTW]</ref> Regular armies of the uprising usually had light yellow flags with various symbols, while [[voivode]] flags were often red-white, and with a superimposed black [[two-headed eagle]]. There were also flags of other colors, including red-yellow, red-white-blue and red-blue. This variety of colors was followed by variety of symbols on the flags, most often taken from [[Hristofor Zhefarovich]]'s book ''Stemmatographia'' of 1741. The most common symbol on the flags were the [[Serbian cross]], followed by coat of arms of the [[Timok Valley]] (Tribalia) and various other crosses.{{sfn|Samardžić|1993}} Most of the flags were made in [[Sremski Karlovci]], designed by Serbian painters Stefan Gavrilović, Ilija Gavrilović and Nikola Apostolović.{{sfn|Samardžić|1993}}

==Modern flags==
The 1835 Sretenje Constitution described the colors of the Serbian flag as bright red, white and ''čelikasto-ugasita'' (that could be translated as ''steelish-dark'').<ref>{{cite book |script-title=sr:Уставъ Княжества Сербіє |trans-title=Constitution of the Princedom of Serbia |url=http://scc.digital.nb.rs/document/RA-ustav-1835 |accessdate=2011-06-18 |year=1835 |publisher=Princedom of Serbia |location=[[Kragujevac]] |language=Serbian |id=COBISS.SR-ID 150291719 |trans-chapter=Chapter two.

Gavrilovic, Suspendovanje prvog srpskog ustava februar-mart 1835 god., Arhiv za pravne i drustvene nauke, I, 1906, 410–412</ref> Soon afterwards, [[Miloš Obrenović]] was requesting to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] that the new constitution should contain an article about the flag and coat of arms,{{sfn|Samardžić|1983}} and subsequent [[ferman]] (1835) allowed [[Serbs]] to use their own [[maritime flag]], which will have "upper part of red, middle of blue, and lower of white",<ref>D. Matic, Javno pravo Knjazevstva Srbije, Beograd, 1851, 33</ref> which is the first appearance of the colors that are used today.

The colors are the reverse of those on the [[flag of Russia]], and various popular stories exist in Serbia which seek to explain why. An example:<ref>{{cite news| author=LJ. M. V.&nbsp;– J. Ž. S.| title=Hej, Bože pravde!| date=2006-08-01| work =[[Vecernje novosti]]| url=http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=1&status=jedna&vest=92154&datum=2006-07-25|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

{{cquote|In [[Karađorđe]]'s time, a delegation from Serbia went to Russia to seek help, and after arrival was at a celebration. When they were asked why don't they participate in the parade, they hastily entered and turned the Russian flag upside down. The citizens have thus noticed that Serbs have their flag too.}}

Serbia used the red, blue and white tricolor continuously from 1835 until 1918 when Serbia ceased to be a sovereign state after it joined the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later known as [[Yugoslavia]]. Also in 1918, a Serbian flag [[Flags at the White House|was flown over]] the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as a show of solidarity by the U.S. towards Serbia during [[World War I]].<ref>https://rs.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/day-when-the-serbian-and-u-s-flags-flew-together-over-the-white-house/</ref><ref>https://www.telegraf.rs/zanimljivosti/svastara/2977128-amerikanci-se-dive-srbima-zbog-jednog-od-vas-na-beloj-kuci-je-pre-100-godina-bila-srpska-zastava-video</ref><ref>https://www.kurir.rs/vesti/politika/3093181/srpska-zastava-vijorila-se-na-beloj-kuci-pre-tacno-100-godina-evo-kako-je-doslo-do-ovog-istorijskog-dogadjaja</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/USEmbassySerbia/status/1020952134051876865</ref>

After [[World War II]], Yugoslavia was reformed into a socialist federal republic, composed of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia#Federal subjects|six republics]], one of which was Serbia. Each republic was entitled to its own flag on the condition that it contained the socialist [[red star]].<ref name=Vesovic>Branislav Ž. Vešović: [http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/yu_wwii.html Yugoslavia during the Second World War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217215904/http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/yu_wwii.html |date=2012-02-17 }}</ref> Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], Serbia initially continued using the same flag; the 1990 [[Constitution of Serbia]] stated that flag and coat of arms of Serbia can only be changed by the same procedure used to change the constitution itself,<ref>1990 Constitution of Serbia, Article 5</ref> which required an absolute majority of voters to support it.<ref>1990 Constitution of Serbia, Article 133</ref> The [[Serbian constitutional referendum, 1992|1992 Serbian constitutional referendum]] asked the voters to choose between the flag with and without the star, with red star gaining the majority of votes, however not the absolute majority of voters. The red star was nonetheless removed from the flag in 1992 by a recommendation by the Serbian parliament;<ref name=Vesovic/><ref>Recommendation on the use of the Flag of Serbia ("Official Gazette of Serbia", No. 49/1992.)</ref> however, the coat of arms remained unchanged. In 2003, however, the government of Serbia issued a recommendation on flag and coat of arms use, that preferred using different symbols from the ones in the constitution. The 2006 [[Constitution of Serbia]] stated that state emblems would be regulated by law;<ref>2006 Constitution of Serbia, Article 7</ref> the recommendation remained in use until 11 May 2009, when the actual flag law was enacted.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009}}</ref> On 11 November 2010, a visual redesign of the coat of arms was enacted, which is currently used on the state flag.<ref name="Novosti"/>

The Serbian flag is also popular with Bosnian Serbs in the [[Republika Srpska]], who usually prefer to fly it instead of the Bosnian national flag.<ref name="balkaninsight.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnia-s-foreign-flag-still-draws-mixed-feelings-12-05-2017|date=2017|title=Bosnia's 'Foreign' Flag Still Draws Mixed Feelings|website=www.balkaninsight.com}}</ref>

[[Montenegro]] used to have a flag similar to the Serbian tricolor with varying shades of blue. It originated from Montenegrin national costume. During the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], the republics of Serbia and Montenegro had flags of the same design and colors. Montenegro changed its flag in 1993 by altering the proportion and shade of blue in its flag and used this flag until 2004.

The Serbian tricolor was also the basis for the breakaway territories of [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] and [[Republika Srpska]] during the Yugoslav Wars. The [[flag of Republika Srpska]] is still the Serbian tricolor as well as [[Flag of Serbs of Croatia]].

The Serbian tricolor defaced with a [[Serbian cross]] is used as the flag of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Srpska pravoslavna crkva|title=Законодавство Српске православне цркве|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftUmAQAAIAAJ|year=1939|page=21|publisher=Издавачко и Књижарско Предузеће Г.

==Proper flag protocol==

===State flag===
The [[state flag]] (de facto [[national flag]]) is constantly flown on the entrances of state organ buildings. The [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] flies it only when in session and during state holidays. Organs of provinces, [[Vojvodina]] and [[Kosovo and Metohija]], fly it only on national holidays.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 20}}</ref>

It can also be flown during celebrations and other solemn manifestations which mark events of importance for Serbia, and on other occasions.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 24}}</ref> During state mourning, it is flown at [[half mast]], including by the organs of provinces, local organs, and public services.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 23}}</ref> The flag must be displayed in an election room during an election for state bodies<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 22}}</ref> and in the room of [[civil registry]] dedicated for [[marriage]] (the [[marriage officiant|officiant]] has to carry a [[sash]] with flag colours as well).<ref>Family Law, article 299</ref>

===Civil flag===
The [[civil flag]] of Serbia is constantly flown on the entrance of the National Assembly and organs of provinces and public services. It must be displayed in an [[election]] room during an election for provincial or local organs.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 28}}</ref>

Also, it can be hoisted during celebrations and other [[culture|cultural]] or [[sport]] manifestations, and on other occasions.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 29}}</ref>

===Other flags===
The [[President of Serbia]] and the [[President of the National Assembly of Serbia|President (Speaker)]] of the [[National Assembly of Serbia]] use their official respective standards.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 25}}</ref>  The Serbian River Flotilla also uses its own naval ensign.

===Respect for the flag===
[[File:Flag of Serbia hv.svg|thumb|right|200px|Horizontal and vertical display of the flag.]]
Neither the state flag nor the civil flag can be hoisted so that they touch the ground, nor be used as rests, tablecloths, carpets or curtains, nor to cover vehicles or other objects, nor to attire speaker platforms or tables, except as table flags.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 33}}</ref> They must not be used if damaged or otherwise look unsuitable for use.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 6}}</ref>

The flag is not flown in bad weather conditions. Also, it is flown only in daylight, unless it is illuminated.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 32}}</ref>

If the flag is flown vertically on tables or otherwise, its top field is on the left side of the viewer. If it is flown vertically across a street or square, its top field should be on the northern side if the street has east-west orientation, and eastern side if it has north-south orientation or on a circular square.<ref>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 31}}</ref>

===Correct display===
The law defines how the flag of Serbia is displayed along with other flags, making no difference between state flags and other kinds of flags. If the flag is hoisted with another flag, it is always on the viewer's left, except during an official visit of a representative of another country or an international organization, when the flag of the visitor is on the viewer's left. If the flag is hoisted with another on crossed staffs, its staff must be the front one.<ref name=L30>{{harvnb|Republic of Serbia|2009|loc=article 30}}</ref>

If the flag of Serbia is hoisted along with two flags, it must be in the middle.<ref name=L30/>

If the flag is flown with multiple flags,
* If the flags are flown in a circle, it must be in the centre of the circle, clearly visible;
* If the flags are flown in a semicircle, it must be in its [[Vertex (curve)|vertex]];
* If the flags are flown in a column, it must be in the front of the column;
* If the flags are flown in a row, it must be in the first place, that is, on the viewer's left;
* If the flags are flown in a group, it must be in the front of the group.<ref name=L30/>
