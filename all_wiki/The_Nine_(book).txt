'''''The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court''''' is a [[2007 in literature|2007]] non-fiction book by legal analyst [[Jeffrey Toobin]]. Based in part on exclusive interviews with the justices and former law clerks, Toobin profiles the justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], the functioning of that institution, and how it has changed over the years.

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote of the book, "Toobin paints not a conservative revolution but a period of intractable moderation. The real power, he argues, belonged to supreme swing-voter [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], who decided important cases with what Toobin sees as an almost primal attunement to a middle-of-the-road public consensus. By contrast, he contends, conservative justices [[William Rehnquist]] and [[Antonin Scalia]] ended up bitter old men, their rigorous constitutional doctrines made irrelevant by the moderates' compromises."

The book spent four months on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list.<ref>{{cite press release
