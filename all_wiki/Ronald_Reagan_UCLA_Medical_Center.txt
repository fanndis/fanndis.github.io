The '''Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center''' (also commonly referred to as ''UCLA Medical Center'' or "RRMC") is a [[hospital]] located on the campus of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]], [[Los Angeles]], California, United States. It is currently ranked the 4th best hospital in the United States by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', and 1st on the West Coast.<ref>{{cite web|title=2019-20 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings|first=Ben|last=Harder|date=July 29, 2019|work=U.S.News & World Report|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview|access-date=September 19, 2017|archive-date=August 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802174741/http://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview|url-status=live}}</ref> The hospital provides tertiary care to Los Angeles and the surrounding communities.

UCLA Medical Center has research centers covering nearly all major specialties of [[medicine]] and [[nursing]] as well as [[dentistry]] and is the primary [[teaching hospital]] for the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA]] and the [[UCLA School of Nursing]]. The hospital's emergency department is a certified [[level I trauma center]] for both adult and pediatric patients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclahealth.org/emergency-department/|title=Emergency Department|website=www.uclahealth.org|access-date=2020-02-16|archive-date=February 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200216034700/https://www.uclahealth.org/emergency-department/|url-status=live}}</ref> Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is a constituent part of [[UCLA Health]], a comprehensive consortium of research hospitals and medical institutes affiliated with [[UCLA]], including Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, [[UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica]], Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA, [[UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital|'''UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital''']], and UCLA Medical Group.

Collectively, the hospitals and specialty-care facilities of the UCLA Health system make it among the most comprehensive and advanced healthcare systems in the United States. The hospital has been ranked in the top twenty in 15 of the 16 medical specialties ranked by the US News ranking. Ten of those specialties were ranked in the top ten.  In 2005, the [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]] granted the medical center "Magnet" status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nursecredentialing.org/MagnetOrg/getdetail.cfm?magnetid=1046 |title=Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center - Magnet status |publisher=American Nurses Credentialing Center |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |archive-date=July 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708083752/http://www.nursecredentialing.org/MagnetOrg/getdetail.cfm?magnetid=1046 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Architecture==
On June 29, 2008, the new Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center opened and became fully operational, replacing the older facilities across the street. The older hospital complex had suffered moderate interior structural damage in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]].<ref name="latimesJune2008">{{Citation | last = Groves | first = Martha | title = UCLA health center readies move | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | pages = B1, B6 | date = June 25, 2008 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ucla25-2008nov11,0,6746611.story}}</ref> Because numerous hospitals in the area were severely damaged during the Northridge earthquake and injured people had to be transported long distances for emergency care, the state of California passed SB1953,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/sen/sb_1951-2000/sb_1953_bill_940922_chaptered|title=BILL NUMBER: SB 1953 – CHAPTERED 09/22/94|website=California.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108194131/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/sen/sb_1951-2000/sb_1953_bill_940922_chaptered|archive-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref> an amendment to an older law requiring all hospitals to move their acute care and intensive care units into earthquake-resistant buildings by 2008.

Originally budgeted at $598 million in 1998, construction began in 1999 and was completed in 2004. Cost overruns and construction delays attributed to rising construction costs and design changes due to medical advances resulted in the price of the building increasing to $829 million. Equipment purchased for the new building increased the total cost to over $1 billion.<ref name="latimesJune2008"/> The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] contributed $432 million in earthquake relief funds to the project, and the state of California contributed $44 million. Private donations raised over $300 million for the project, including $150 million in [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]'s name. The new building was constructed to withstand an 8.0 magnitude [[earthquake]], one of the first buildings in California built to the most recent [[Earthquake engineering|seismic standards]].<ref name="latimesJune2008"/>

The new {{convert|1.05|e6sqft|m2|adj=on}} hospital is named after the President of the United States and Governor of California [[Ronald Reagan]] (1911-2004). It was designed by C.C. "Didi" Pei of [[Pei Partnership Architects]] in collaboration with his father, [[Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[I.M. Pei]].<ref name="latimesJune2008"/> The hospital will contain fewer patient beds (525) than the one it replaces. Patient beds in the intensive-care units will be accessible to nurses and physicians from 360 degrees, and surgical floor plans will be modular, allowing them to be expanded and reconfigured as medical technology evolves. The hospital is sheathed with mechanically honed, cream-colored, horizontally grained travertine marble panels sold at below-market-rate cost by Primo Marrioti, the owner of an Italian quarry whose cancer was cured at UCLA. The travertine elements were fastened to a sophisticated interlocking panelized aluminum cladding system developed by Benson Industries of Portland, Oregon. The building envelope is designed to resist and survive severe seismic events and maintain excellent resistance to air and water infiltration.

The older center itself is a sprawling 11-story [[brick]] building designed by [[Welton Becket]].  It is considered a landmark of early modern architecture. The center was built in several phases, the first of which was completed in 1953. The hospital has a "[[tic-tac-toe]]" layout of intersecting wings, creating a series of courtyards throughout the complex. The first floor is unusual in that most of its walls are completely clad in a thick layer of naturally-weathered, unfilled, [[travertine]], creating an unusual "organic" appearance. The exterior architecture is very simple (as with many Becket designs), consisting of a red brick wall with horizontal bands of stainless-steel louvers over the windows to keep direct sunlight from heating the building.

Some of the old complex will be torn down, and some of it will be renovated and turned into office space when it is no longer an operational hospital. The law does not require that all parts of a hospital be made earthquake-safe, only the most important parts. Much of the extensive travertine wall cladding from the building's interior will most likely be salvaged and re-used.

A total of 179 people were exposed to the bacteria via two duodenoscopes which were not disinfected sufficiently.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hospital-infections-20150218-story.html#page=1 |title=Superbug linked to 2 deaths at UCLA hospital; 179 potentially exposed |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 19, 2015 |archive-date=February 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219030911/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hospital-infections-20150218-story.html#page=1 |url-status=live }}</ref> The outbreak is not serious, however, as the superbug is not a serious threat to healthy patients, and cannot be transmitted easily through its own means. The risk of infection via duodenoscope is very low as well, with procedures being performed on over 500,000 individuals between 2013 and 2014, and only 135 cases of CRE being reported as a result.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/02/19/387552431/heres-why-californias-superbug-outbreak-isnt-as-scary-as-it-seems |title=Why California's Superbug Outbreak Isn't As Scary As It Seems |publisher=NPR |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |archive-date=March 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302201252/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/02/19/387552431/heres-why-californias-superbug-outbreak-isnt-as-scary-as-it-seems |url-status=live }}</ref> Some doctors believe several more outbreaks of this nature are imminent. Since the outbreak, demands have been made to the [[FDA]] to improve their regulation and sanitation of medical devices.<ref>{{citation |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2015/2/26/superbug-california.html |title=As superbug spreads, device manufacturer sued for negligence, fraud |publisher=Al Jazeera America |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |archive-date=March 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210737/http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2015/2/26/superbug-california.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
