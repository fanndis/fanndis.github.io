'''General elections''' were held in [[Denmark]] on 20 November 2001.<ref name=DN>[[Dieter Nohlen]] & Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p525 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref> For the first time since the [[1924 Danish Folketing election|1924 elections]], the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] did not win the most seats. [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] of the [[centre-right]] [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] became [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|Prime Minister]] in coalition with the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]], as the head of the [[Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen I|first Rasmussen government]], with the support from [[Danish People's Party]].

The coalition relied on the votes of other right-wing parties such as the [[Danish People's Party]], which polled better than ever before. Voter turnout was 87.1% in Denmark proper, 80.0% in the [[Faroe Islands]] and 61.5% in [[Greenland]].<ref name=NS>Nohlen & Stöver, p549</ref> The Venstre led coalition government would last until the [[2011 Danish parliamentary election|2011 election]], lasting through two intermediate elections.

The election marked a major shift in Danish politics: It was the first time that the right leaning parties held an outright majority in the parliament since the beginning of the modern democratic system in Denmark in 1901;<ref name=Lidegaard>{{cite book|last=Lidegaard|first=Bo|title=En Fortælling om Danmark i det 20. Århundrede|year=2011|publisher=Gyldendal|location=Copenhagen|page=428|language=Danish}}</ref> although right leaning parties had held power several times, they had always had to share power with more centrist or left-wing parties in coalition governments, such as the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]]. Historian [[Bo Lidegaard]] said that the vote showed a move away from broad national consensus which had existed since the 1930s regarding the style of governance in Denmark. One of the most important changes that forced the change was the rise of immigration as a political issue and the ensuing rise of the Danish People's Party.<ref name=Lidegaard /> Immigration played a central role in the 2001 campaign and was thrust into focus by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, although it had been gaining attention for years.<ref name=Lidegaard />
