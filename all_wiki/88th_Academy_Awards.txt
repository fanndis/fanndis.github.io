[[File:Chris Rock 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chris Rock]] hosted the 88th Academy Awards.|alt=Picture of actor and comedian Chris Rock in 2012.]]

=== Criticism regarding lack of diversity ===
Shortly after the nominations were announced, many media outlets observed that there was a lack of racial diversity amongst the nominees in major categories. For the second consecutive year, all twenty acting nominees and four out of the five directors nominated were [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Keegan |first1=Rebecca |last2=Zeitchik |first2=Steven |title=Oscars 2016: Here's why the nominees are so white -- again |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-all-white-oscar-acting-nominees-20160114-story.html |accessdate=June 12, 2016 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 14, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612100254/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-all-white-oscar-acting-nominees-20160114-story.html |archivedate=June 12, 2016}}</ref> Activist and former attorney April Reign, who was credited with starting the [[hashtag]] #OscarsSoWhite, tweeted, "It's actually worse than last year.

In response to the criticism, several individuals including AMPAS members voiced their opinions regarding the lack of diversity. Some members defended the Academy saying that the nominations are based on performance and merit, not race. Actress [[Penelope Ann Miller]] responded to the criticism by stating "I voted for a number of black performers, and I was sorry they weren't nominated. To imply that this is because all of us are racists is extremely offensive. I don't want to be lumped into a category of being a racist because I'm certainly not and because I support and benefit from the talent of black people in this business.

Others agreed that the Academy had a diversity problem and supported efforts towards change. Best Supporting Actress winner [[Lupita Nyong'o]] wrote, "I am disappointed by the lack of inclusion in this year's Academy Awards nominations. It has me thinking about unconscious prejudice and what merits prestige in our culture."

A week after the nominations announcement, the Academy announced several rules changes regarding membership in hopes of increasing the number of women and minorities in the membership by 2020. Beginning in 2016, new members would earn Oscar voting privileges for the next ten years. After that time period, those members may retain voting privileges for another ten years if they have remained active in the motion picture industry. Members would earn lifetime voting privileges if they have served three consecutive ten-year voting eligibility terms or have earned or won an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://oscar.go.com/news/oscar-news/the-academy-introduces-plan-to-improve-oscar-diversity |title=The Academy Introduces Plan to Improve Oscar Diversity |first=Sarah |last=Huggins |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) |date=January 27, 2016 |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126222645/http://oscar.go.com/news/oscar-news/the-academy-introduces-plan-to-improve-oscar-diversity |archivedate=January 26, 2016}}</ref> Issacs justified the Academy's decision to overhaul the membership requirements saying, "The Academy is going to lead and not wait for the industry to catch up; these new measures regarding governance and voting will have an immediate impact and begin the process of significantly changing our membership composition."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oscars.org/news/academy-takes-historic-action-increase-diversity |title=Academy Takes Historic Action To Increase Diversity |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) |date=January 22, 2016 |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123094038/http://www.oscars.org/news/academy-takes-historic-action-increase-diversity |archivedate=January 23, 2016}}</ref> Furthermore, the Academy would establish three new governor seats that will be nominated by Isaacs and confirmed by the Board.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/awards/oscars-diversity-academy-emergency-meeting-1201685630/ |title=Academy Overhauls Membership, Voting Rules to Promote Oscar Diversity |first=Tim |last=Gray |work=Variety |date=January 14, 2016 |accessdate=January 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122215745/http://variety.com/2016/film/awards/oscars-diversity-academy-emergency-meeting-1201685630/ |archivedate=January 22, 2016}}</ref> However, the Academy's actions also include taking away the membership rights of academy members who have not recently worked in the industry, such as actor [[Bill Mumy]] and award-winning screenwriter Patricia Resnick.

On the morning of the Oscars, the [[National Action Network]] led by civil rights activist [[Al Sharpton]] held a protest a few blocks from the [[Dolby Theatre]] regarding the Oscar's diversity problems. “You are out of time," Sharpton said in a rebuke to the Academy.

This will be the last night of an all-white Oscars.”<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson |first1=Ted |title=Al Sharpton at Diversity Protest: 'This Will Be the Last Night of an All-White Oscars' |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/al-sharpton-oscars-diversity-protest-1201717537/ |accessdate=May 20, 2016 |work=Variety |date=February 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525053137/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/al-sharpton-oscars-diversity-protest-1201717537/ |archivedate=May 25, 2016}}</ref> In addition, African-American filmmakers [[Ryan Coogler]] and [[Ava DuVernay]] held a charity event addressing the [[Flint water crisis|water crisis]] in [[Flint, Michigan]], called [[JusticeForFlint|#JusticeForFlint]] on the same night as the Oscars.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNary |first1=Dave |title=Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler to Headline Flint Benefit on Oscars Night |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/ava-duvernay-ryan-coogler-flint-oscar-night-event-1201712969/ |accessdate=May 22, 2016 |work=Variety |date=February 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512004017/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/ava-duvernay-ryan-coogler-flint-oscar-night-event-1201712969/ |archivedate=May 12, 2016}}</ref> Despite organizers insisting that the event was being held almost simultaneously with the Oscars, many viewed it as an alternative to watching the ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith |first1=Nigel M. |title=Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler to attend Flint benefit instead of Oscars |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/ava-duvernay-ryan-coogler-flint-water-crisis-benefit-oscars |accessdate=May 28, 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520163043/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/ava-duvernay-ryan-coogler-flint-water-crisis-benefit-oscars |archivedate=May 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== Asian accountants joke ===

During the show, Rock introduced onstage three children of Asian heritage posing as accountants for [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] saying "They sent us their most dedicated, accurate and hard working representatives... Please welcome Ming Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz." He also added "If anybody's upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roberts |first1=Randall |title=Chris Rock's Oscars joke about Asian American accountants stirs outrage |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-chris-rock-oscars-asian-american-accountants-outrage-20160229-story.html |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801175211/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-chris-rock-oscars-asian-american-accountants-outrage-20160229-story.html |archivedate=August 1, 2016}}</ref> In response to the segment, U.S. Congresswoman [[Judy Chu]] expressed her disappointment at Rock, broadcaster ABC, and AMPAS in a press release that read, "It is not right to protest the exclusion of one group by making jokes at the expense of another. I am so disappointed that the Academy and ABC would rely on such offensive characterizations, especially given the controversy over the lack of diversity."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chu |first1=Judy |title=Rep.

Instead, the Oscars show was marred by a tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Feinberg |first1=Scott |title=Ang Lee, George Takei Among 25 Academy Members Protesting Oscars' Asian Jokes |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/ang-lee-george-takei-25-875772 |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624232721/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/ang-lee-george-takei-25-875772 |archivedate=June 24, 2016}}</ref>

In a phone interview with the [[Associated Press]], Academy President Isaacs apologized for the joke stating, "I can understand the feelings and we are setting up a meeting to discuss, because as you well know, no one sets out to be offensive, and I'm very sorry that has happened. I think so much is achieved with dialogue, so much is achieved. And that is what we'll continue to do: have dialogue, listen and just keep fixing."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Deerwester |first1=Jayme |title=Academy apologizes for Asian joke at Oscars, announces new leadership roles |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/03/16/motion-picture-academy-apology-diversity-membership-leadership-changes/81860722/ |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |work=USA Today |date=March 16, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723211403/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/03/16/motion-picture-academy-apology-diversity-membership-leadership-changes/81860722/ |archivedate=July 23, 2016}}</ref>

=== Critical reception and television ratings ===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. A few media outlets reviewed the broadcast more positively with some praise for Rock. Television critic [[Mary McNamara]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked, "Rock's Oscars had some of the most powerful moments seen in the telecast's history." She concluded that, "After years of being dissed for its irrelevance, this year's Oscars took action. The results were mixed, to be sure, and Rock did not ever settle into his usual balance of outrage and humanity."<ref>{{cite news|title=Chris Rock's hot mess of an Oscars show: powerful, confounding, possibly revolutionary |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-et-mn-oscars-tv-review-20160229-column.html |first=Mary |last=McNamara |author-link1=Mary McNamara |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 28, 2016 |accessdate=March 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229222059/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-et-mn-oscars-tv-review-20160229-column.html |archivedate=February 29, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[James Poniewozik]] commented, "With Chris Rock, the Oscars find a lucky pairing of host and subject." In addition, he wrote, "His performance was an example of something the industry is still trying to learn: that you can achieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the right opportunity."<ref>{{cite news|title=Review: With Chris Rock, the Oscars Find a Lucky Pairing of Host and Subject |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/movies/chris-rock-oscars-review.html |first=James |last=Poniewozik |work=The New York Times |date=February 28, 2016 |accessdate=March 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301044131/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/movies/chris-rock-oscars-review.html |archivedate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The Denver Post]]'''s Joanne Ostrow wrote, "Chris Rock poked the elephant in the room at the 2016 Academy Awards, prodded it again and again, and never let up."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ostrow |first1=Joanne |title=Chris Rock nails Oscars 2016 focus on race |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2016/02/28/24149/24149/ |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |work=The Denver Post |date=February 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817203853/http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2016/02/28/24149/24149/ |archivedate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>

Others were more critical of the show. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' columnist Daniel Feinberg remarked, "Chris Rock led a telecast that had important things to say, but still felt endless." In addition he called the ceremony "overstuffed" and the on-screen running scroll a "total failure".<ref>{{cite news|title=The 88th Annual Academy Awards: TV Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/chris-rock-hosted-oscars-2016-871255 |first=Daniel |last=Fienberg |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 28, 2016 |accessdate=March 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301011915/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/chris-rock-hosted-oscars-2016-871255 |archivedate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> Frazier Moore of the [[Associated Press]] quipped, "When Rock was absent, languor prevailed." He added, "One other beef: The attempt to banish the names of those thanked by winners to a text crawl at the bottom of the screen. If viewers wanted to watch a channel with annoying and distracting text at the bottom of the screen, they'd just tune to a cable-news channel."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Frazier |title=Review: Rock rocks with Oscars monologue; show's a snooze |url=http://www.times-standard.com/article/ZZ/20160228/NEWS/160225518 |accessdate=February 28, 2016 |work=[[Times-Standard]] |date=March 1, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190247/http://www.times-standard.com/article/ZZ/20160228/NEWS/160225518 |archivedate=August 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' television critic Hal Boedeker gave high marks toward Rock but commented, "No host, no matter how gifted, can transform the lumbering format into a scintillating event." He ended his comments by stating, "Staging a more entertaining Oscar telecast.
