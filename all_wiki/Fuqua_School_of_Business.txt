[[File:Fuqua School of Business.JPG|thumb|290px|right|Breeden Hall, The Fuqua School of Business]]
Formed in 1969, the Graduate School of Business Administration enrolled its first class of 20 students in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Fuqua School of Business|url=http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/about/|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref> In 1974, Thomas F. Keller, a 1953 Duke graduate, became the graduate school's new dean.  In three years, Keller's capital campaign raised $24 million, $10 million of which came from businessman and philanthropist [[J.B. Fuqua]].  The graduate school's name was then changed to The Fuqua School of Business.<ref>[https://affectdm.com/heb-eng/ ]{{dead link|date=May 2019}}</ref>

J.B. Fuqua was raised by his grandparents on a tobacco farm in Prince Edward County, Virginia.  Fuqua began his relationship with Duke University when he borrowed books by mail from the Duke library.

Fuqua's cumulative giving to Duke was nearly $40 million at the time of his death on April 5, 2006.<ref name="fuqua.duke.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/about/leadership/jb_fuqua/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130142444/http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/about/leadership/jb_fuqua/|archivedate=2009-01-30|title=J.B.
