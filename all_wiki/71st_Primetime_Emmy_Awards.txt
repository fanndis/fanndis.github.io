On April 9, 2019, it was announced that ''[[American Horror Story: Apocalypse]]'', the eighth season of the horror [[anthology series]] ''[[American Horror Story]]'', and the second season of ''[[The Sinner (TV series)|The Sinner]]'' would be ineligible for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series|Limited Series]] categories unlike their previous seasons, and instead be moved to [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Drama]] due to "continuing story threads, characters and actors reprising those same character roles from previous seasons", therefore making the series less fit for an anthology format. For similar reasons, the second season of ''[[American Vandal]]'' was moved from Limited Series to [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Comedy]]. None of the shows were nominated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2019/04/09/american-horror-story-apocalypse-emmy-category-drama-series/ |title=Emmy Shake-Up: American Horror Story Booted From 2019 Limited Series Race |last=Ausiello|first=Michael |date=April 9, 2019 |publisher=[[TVLine]] |language=en |accessdate=April 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/tv-academy-reclassifies-american-horror-story-the-sinner-american-vandal-1202592264/ |title=Emmys: 'American Horror Story', 'The Sinner' & 'American Vandal' Out Of Limited Series Category |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |last2=Petski |first2=Denise |date=April 9, 2019 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |language=en |accessdate=April 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-tv-academy-reclassifies-american-horror-story-sinner-american-vandal-1200773 |title=Emmys: TV Academy Reclassifies 'American Horror Story,' 'The Sinner' and 'American Vandal' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |language=en |accessdate=April 10, 2019}}</ref>

The ceremony took place at the [[Microsoft Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]] with no host; comedian and actor [[Thomas Lennon]] served as an announcer for the ceremony, injecting with jokes and commentary as winners approached the stage to receive their Emmy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2019-emmys-tonight-start-time-date-live-stream-online-tv-channel-71st-primetime-emmy-awards/ |title=How to watch the 2019 Emmy Awards |date=September 22, 2019 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |language=en-US |url-status=live |accessdate=September 25, 2019}}</ref> Televised by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], the ceremony began with a ruse where [[Homer Simpson]] appeared in an [[Augmented reality|augmented-reality]] stage to host the event, before an animated piano dropped from the ceiling to land on ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki/>' character. With the event now "host-less", [[Anthony Anderson]] rushed on stage in a skit where he insisted that "We’re going to go without a host tonight!"<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/arts/television/emmys-no-host.html |title=Emmys 2019: Homer Simpson and Friends Fill the Host Void |last=Salam |first=Maya |date=September 22, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 25, 2019 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and pushed the first presenter [[Bryan Cranston]] to the stage to welcome the audience<ref name=":1">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49791350 |title=6 highlights from the Emmys ceremony |last=McIntosh |first=Steven |date=September 23, 2019 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=September 25, 2019 |language=en-GB}}</ref> and introduce a montage of video clips. The ceremony continued in such fashion with only Lennon and montages and clips filling the time between presenters.<ref name=":0" />

Several winners made notable "statement speeches" while accepting their awards. After winning the award for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', [[Alex Borstein]] said:<ref name=":1" />

The winner for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or movie, [[Patricia Arquette]] (''[[The Act (TV series)|The Act]]''), in her acceptance speech said "I'm grateful at 50 to be getting the best parts of my life" and paid tribute to her sister, [[Alexis Arquette]], who had died in 2016.<ref name=":1" /> [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], after winning the award for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for ''[[Fosse/Verdon]]'', made references to the [[Gender pay gap in the United States|gender]] and [[Racial wage gap in the United States|racial wage gaps]] in the [[film industry]], as well as the [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up movement]]:<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/emmys-2019-michelle-williams-acceptance-speech-video.html |title=Michelle Williams Tells Industry to Treat Actresses of Color Like Michelle Williams in Emmys Speech |last=Kiefer |first=Halle |date=September 23, 2019 |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |url-status=live |accessdate=September 26, 2019}}</ref>
