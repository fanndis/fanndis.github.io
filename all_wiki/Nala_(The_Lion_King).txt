'''Nala''' is a lioness heroine in Walt Disney Pictures' [[The Lion King (franchise)|The Lion King]] film franchise. Introduced in the animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994), Nala subsequently appears as a less prominent character in the film's sequels ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' (2004), and serves as a recurring character in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' (2015–2019). In the original film, the adult Nala is voiced by American actress [[Moira Kelly]]. Young Nala's speaking voice is provided by actress Niketa Calame, while singers Laura Williams and [[Sally Dworsky]] provide the singing voices of young and adult Nala respectively.

Nala is introduced as the best friend of [[Simba]], and ultimately becomes his wife by the end of ''The Lion King''. Several years after Simba's uncle [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] has killed Simba's father [[Mufasa]] and taken the throne, Nala desperately ventures into the [[jungle]] to find help. Upon unexpectedly reuniting with a adult Simba, who she had long been tricked by Scar into presuming dead, Nala encourages him to return to Pride Rock, overthrow his uncle and ultimately become king. As Simba's queen, Nala has a son, [[Kopa (The Lion King)|Kopa]], an adventurous cub in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'', a daughter, [[Kiara (The Lion King)|Kiara]], whose story is explored in ''The Lion King: Simba's Pride'' and another son named [[List of The Lion King characters#Kion|Kion]], who serves as the protagonist of ''The Lion Guard''.

Nala is the most significant female character in ''The Lion King''<nowiki/>. As the film <nowiki/>was inspired by [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragedy ''[[Hamlet]]'', Nala is considered to be ''The Lion King''<nowiki/>'s equivalent of [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]'s love interest [[Ophelia]], although differences remain between the two characters. Many early concepts first developed for Nala were eventually abandoned, including a brother and father for the character, as well as her being romantically pursued by Scar. While critical reception towards Nala has been generally mixed, Kelly's vocal performance has been praised.

Nala appears in the [[The Lion King (musical)|Broadway musical adaptation of the film]], first played by singer [[Heather Headley]]. The character also appears in the television series ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', with [[Gabrielle Union]] replacing Kelly as the voice of Nala. [[Beyoncé]] and [[Shahadi Wright Joseph]] voice the character in [[The Lion King (2019 film)|the 2019 CGI live adaptation]] of [[The Lion King|the original film]] directed by [[Jon Favreau]].

==Development==
===Conception and creation===
Screenwriter [[Linda Woolverton]] conceived Nala "as part of a gradual progression ... which have driven recent public conversation about what young girls should be able to expect from their cinematic role models."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/2798136/maleficent-beauty-beast-writer/|title=The Same Woman Wrote Maleficent and Beauty and the Beast—Here's How They're Linked|last=Rothman|first=Lily|date=May 30, 2014|website=Time|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}</ref> In early versions of the screenplay, Nala has a younger brother named Mheetu, who enjoys accompanying her and her best friend Simba on their adventures.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://thefw.com/mheetu-the-lion-king-lost-disney-characters/|title=Mheetu, 'The Lion King' — Lost Disney Characters|last=Franks-Allen|first=Sara|website=TheFW|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref> Pronounced "me too", the character's name is a reference to this personality trait.<ref name=":7" /> Simba was intended to save the cub from a wildebeest stampede,<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/57386/30-facts-about-lion-king|title=30 Facts About 'The Lion King'|last=Baker|first=Craig S|date=June 24, 2014|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}</ref> and Nala would eventually become responsible for protecting Mheetu from Simba's tyrannical uncle Scar.<ref name=":7" /> Nala also had a fox friend named Bhati.<ref name=":8" /> According to Woolverton, Mheetu and Bhati were eventually written out of the film because their stories were beginning to distract from Simba's, in addition to the Mheetu-Scar subplot making the film too dark when combined with the death of Simba's father Mufasa.<ref name=":7" /> At one point, Nala also had a named father; the character was similarly abandoned. In addition, in another script, Sarafina (then named Naanda) was Sarabi's younger sister, and Mufasa was implied to be her mate, and thus Nala's Father. This implication was censored in the final draft as it would lead to incest between Simba and Nala as half siblings as well as first cousins.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/24/the-lion-king-turns-20-every-crazy-weird-fact-about-the-disney-classic.html|title='The Lion King' Turns 20: Every Crazy, Weird Fact About the Disney Classic|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=June 24, 2014|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}</ref>

Because ''The Lion King'' was originally conceived as a much more mature and adult-oriented film, Nala was intended to have been [[banish]]ed from the Pride Lands as punishment for rejecting Scar's romantic advances.<ref name=":3" /> This idea was to have been further explored in Scar's song "[[Be Prepared (song)#Deleted reprise|Be Prepared (Reprise)]]", during which Scar demands that Nala become his queen, but the musical number was ultimately cut from the final film because the scene was considered too "creepy."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Acuna|first=Kirsten|title=The 'Lion King' remake has a new scene that will make you see Scar's vendetta against his brother in a new light|url=https://www.insider.com/the-lion-king-scar-wants-sarabi-as-his-queen-2019-7|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Insider}}</ref> Matthew Roulette of TheFW believes that the scene was abandoned because of the significant [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|age difference]] between Nala and Scar.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://thefw.com/be-prepared-reprise-disney-songs-youve-never-heard/|title='Be Prepared (Reprise),' 'The Lion King' — Disney Songs You've Never Heard|last=Roulette|first=Matthew|website=TheFW|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref>

Ella Ceron of ''[[Thought Catalog]]'' observed that "At [Simba's] return, she's not exactly the friendliest little kitten, either ... but is willing to overlook her own hurt ego in the spirit of their friendship. She believes in Simba, and doesn't understand why he wouldn't want to fight for his right to rule."<ref name=":9" />

===Voice and music===
The speaking voice of adult Nala is provided by American actress [[Moira Kelly]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-lion-king/cast/129956/|title=The Lion King – Cast & Crew|website=TV Guide|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> Kelly (who rose her fame in [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] film ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'') learned that Disney was auditioning actresses for the role of Nala from her agent.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url = http://goseetalk.com/interview-the-lion-king-star-moira-kelly/|title = Interview…'The Lion King' Star Moira Kelly|date = September 14, 2011|accessdate = November 2, 2015|website = GoSeeTalk.com|last = Ciafardini|first = Marc}}</ref> Despite having not been the directors' first choice for the role, Kelly was allowed to audition because the filmmakers were interested in hearing different voices at the time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/moirakelly-interview.html|title=Moira Kelly Interview: The Lion Queen|last=Wallace|first=Aaron|date=December 5, 2006|website=DVDizzy.com|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}</ref> Kelly believes the directors had been searching for a specific "quality of voice ... a sort of authoritative voice but with a lot of warmth" to complement Nala's sensible yet nurturing personality.<ref name=":1" /> After attending a series of callbacks, during which Kelly returned to Disney several times to re-read the character's lines, Kelly was selected as one of two finalists.<ref name=":1" /> Kelly would not officially be offered the part until several months after her audition; Disney's first choice for the role remains undisclosed.<ref name=":0"/> Actor [[Matthew Broderick]], voice of Simba, had already begun recording alongside another actress who had been cast as Nala before that actress was replaced with Kelly.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/at-the-movies.html|title=At the Movies|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=December 27, 2002|website=The New York Times|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> Broderick was not informed that his original co-star had been recast, and only learned that Nala was voiced by Kelly at the film's premiere.<ref name=":14" />

The film's entire recording process took approximately three years to complete, during which Kelly's sessions were held in both the United States and Canada, while her co-stars Broderick and [[Jeremy Irons]], voice of Scar, were recording in the United States and England, respectively.<ref name=":0" /> Each main cast member recorded their dialogue separately,<ref name=":0" /> which took Kelly some time to get used to because she had grown accustomed to working with several other actors at a time on the sets of her live-action films.<ref name=":1" /> For ''The Lion King'', a director would often take the place of another actor for Kelly to act opposite of.<ref name=":1" /> Vocally, Kelly decided to approach the role as though she were reading to a child, explaining, "it's kind of fun to play with different voices and try to color the lines for the child so they can imagine it more fully", which she admitted is different than how the actress would approach a live-action role.<ref name=":0" /> Because Nala is a "very [[Straight man|straight character]]", determining what kind of voice she would use for her was not a particularly challenging task.<ref name=":1"/> Additionally, the filmmakers would also film Kelly's performances in order to incorporate her own facial expressions into her character's design, the process of which impressed the actress.<ref name=":0" /> In her film debut, actress Niketa Calame voices young Nala.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url = http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html|title = "The Lion King" – Production Information|date = May 25, 1994|accessdate = November 2, 2015|website = The Lion King WWW Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/niketa-calame-57383606/|title=Niketa Calame|website=Hollywood.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910105803/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/niketa-calame-57383606/|archive-date=2015-09-10|url-status=dead|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref> According to Calame's official website, Nala remains the actress' "biggest role to date".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://niketacalame.weebly.com/bio.html|title = Bio – Niketa Calame|accessdate = November 5, 2015|website = Niketa Calame}}</ref>

A classically trained pianist and chorister, Laura Williams provides the singing voice of young Nala, which can be heard in the song "[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]";<ref name=":2" /> the singer was 15 years old at the time.<ref name=":2" /> Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Sally Dworsky provides the singing voice of adult Nala, which is heard during the song "Can You Feel the Love Tonight".<ref name=":2" /> The lyrics of the film's [[Theme song|love theme]], "Can You Feel the Love Tonight", were re-written approximately 15 times, according to lyricist [[Tim Rice]], who wrote the song alongside composer [[Elton John]].<ref name=":2" /> At one point, the producers wanted the song to be a comical duet performed by supporting characters [[Timon and Pumbaa]],<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-lion-king#.aj0eAP47r|title = 20 Things You Didn't Know About "The Lion King"|date = May 29, 2013|accessdate = November 6, 2015|website = BuzzFeed|publisher = BuzzFeed, Inc|last = Galindo|first = Brian}}</ref> despite the fact that John had originally composed the song with Nala and Simba in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://dopeandfamous.com/2014/05/10-unknown-facts-lion-king/|title = 10 Unknown Facts About The Lion King|date = May 2, 2014|accessdate = August 6, 2015|website = Dope & Famous|publisher = Dope and Famous}}</ref> However, John lobbied in favor of "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" being a [[love song]] performed as a duet by Nala and Simba, with which the filmmakers ultimately agreed.<ref name=":2" />

When asked by Disney if she was interested in reprising her role as Nala in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', Kelly immediately accepted, joking, "Sure, you wanna do a third, fourth, fifth?

==Appearances==
===Film and television===
A young Nala debuted in ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994) as the daughter of Sarafina and the best friend of [[Simba]], who she often accompanies on his adventures throughout the Pride Lands. Simba invites Nala to visit the forbidden Elephant Graveyard with him, despite his father [[List of characters in The Lion King#Mufasa|Mufasa]]'s orders. The cubs are soon [[ambush]]ed by [[List of characters in The Lion King#Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Shenzi, Banzai and Ed]], a trio of hyenas chosen by Simba's treacherous uncle [[Scar (Disney)|Scar]] to kill Simba in order to improve his own chances of becoming king, but are ultimately rescued by Mufasa. The following day, however, Nala is devastated to learn from Scar that both Simba and Mufasa have perished during a wildebeest stampede. With both Simba and Mufasa dead, Scar usurps the throne and becomes king. Several years into Scar's tyrannical rule, which has left the kingdom barren and starving, a desperate Nala ventures into the jungle in search of help, where she attempts to eat a warthog named Pumbaa; little does she know that the warthog is actually a friend of Simba's, who is, in fact, alive and well. While defending Pumbaa from Nala, Simba recognizes Nala, and the two finally reunite only to argue over why Simba is refusing to face his responsibilities and return to Pride Rock. Upon learning that Simba has eventually decided to return to Pride Rock and face Scar, Nala travels back to the Pride Lands to assist him. Surprised to find Simba alive, Scar forces his guilt-ridden nephew to "admit" to the pride that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, which was in fact caused by Scar himself by throwing Mufasa off a cliff into the stampede. Upon learning the truth, Simba forces his uncle to admit his crime to the pride, and a battle ensues between the pride and Scar's army of hyenas. Simba eventually defeats Scar and becomes king, with Nala ultimately becoming his queen.<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=The Lion King|date=June 24, 1994|last=[[Roger Allers|Allers, Roger]] (director); [[Rob Minkoff|Minkoff, Rob]] (director)|type=Motion picture|publisher=Buena Vista Pictures}}</ref>

In the film's first direct-to-video sequel ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' (1998), Nala appears in a less prominent role as Queen of the Pride Lands and mother of Kiara, the spirited daughter of her and Simba. Nala observes that Kiara, of whom Simba is very [[Helicopter parent|protective]], has inherited her father's rebellious personality and love of adventure. When Kiara befriends [[Zira (The Lion King)|Zira]]'s son Kovu, a young lion from an exiled pride of Scar's followers known as the Outsiders, Nala is much more tolerant of their relationship than Simba, and convinces him to offer Kovu a chance to prove himself trustworthy.<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=The Lion King II: Simba's Pride|date=October 27, 1998|last=[[Darrell Rooney|Rooney, Darrell]] (director)|type=Motion picture|publisher=Walt Disney Home Video}}</ref> At the end of the film, Nala gains Kovu as her son-in-law after he marries Kiara. In ''The Lion King 1½'' (2004), which focuses instead on Timon and Pumbaa's friendship, Nala's role is virtually identical to that of her appearance in ''The Lion King'' because filmmakers reused most of the character's footage from the first film.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite AV media|title=The Lion King 1½|date=February 10, 2004|last=[[Bradley Raymond|Raymond, Bradley]] (director)|type=Motion picture|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref>

On November 1, 2017, it was confirmed that [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles-Carter<!--DON'T CHANGE LINK PER [[WP:NOPIPE]]-->]] would voice adult Nala in [[Jon Favreau]]'s ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', which was released on July 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Verhoeven|first1=Beatrice|title=Beyonce Will Voice Nala in Live-Action Adaptation of 'The Lion King'|url=https://www.thewrap.com/beyonce-will-voice-nala-live-action-adaptation-lion-king/|website=[[TheWrap]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> Favreau felt that "part of [her joining the film] is that she's got young kids, part of it is that it's a story that feels good for this phase of her life and her career, and she really likes the original very much.

Nala's role in the 2019 remake is slightly expanded. As a cub, Nala is portrayed as more wary and reluctant when venturing the Elephant Graveyard with Simba, sensing the danger lurking in the place. During Scar's reign, adult Nala develops a rivalry with Shenzi due to their first encounter. She also suggests to Sarabi that they should fight back or leave Pride Lands, but Sarabi turns down both suggestions. This leads Nala to sneak out of Pride Rock the following night so she can get help. Zazu uses himself as a diversion to allow Nala to leave without being caught by Scar and the hyenas. She reunites with Simba at the jungle like in the original but leaves immediately after Simba refuses to return, only for Simba to follow her soon after changing his mind. During the climax, Nala fights against Shenzi and emerges victorious. She then marries Simba and gave birth to a cub like in the original film.

===Musical===
In the Broadway musical adaptation of ''The Lion King'', the role of Nala was originated by Trinidadian-American singer Heather Headley. Her Broadway debut,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rGNr-5QGb2oC&q=nala&pg=PA124|title = The Lion King|last = Kinnon|first = Joy Bennett|work = Ebony|access-date = January 19, 2016 |date=July 1998 |pages=121–124}}</ref> at first auditioning for the role proved a challenge for the singer due to her ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' contract, which her agent was eventually successful in getting her released from.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.londontheatre1.com/news/57574/interview-with-heather-headley/|title = Interview with Heather Headley|date = June 28, 2014|accessdate = December 21, 2015|website = LondonTheatre1|publisher = London Theatre One|last = Cheesman|first = Neil}}</ref> Director [[Julie Taymor]] felt that Nala's journey in the film was underdeveloped and among the story's weaker elements, and thus decided to "strengthen" the character's narrative for Broadway.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/2014/04/25/julie_taymor_queen_of_the_lion_king.html|title = Julie Taymor, queen of The Lion King|date = April 25, 2014|accessdate = December 21, 2015|website = The Toronto Star|publisher = Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd|last = Ouzounian|first = Richard}}</ref>

Her role in the musical remains the same as the film except for a scene where during the song "The Madness of King Scar", Nala comes to Scar to urge him to do something about the drought in the Pride Lands, only for Scar to try and seduce her into becoming his queen and mother of his children. Nala refuses since she's already been betrothed to Simba, prince of the Pride Lands as an infant by their parents, Sarafina, Mufasa and Sarabi and flees the Pride Lands to find help.

==Reception==
Critical reception towards Nala has been generally mixed; both film and feminist critics have accused the film of lacking [[Women's empowerment|empowering]] roles for female characters, including Nala.<ref name=":20" /><ref name=":21" /><ref name=":22">{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E0DE163DF936A25755C0A962958260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes|title = The Lion King (1994) Review/Film; The Hero Within The Child Within|date = June 15, 1994|accessdate = November 8, 2015|website = The New York Times|publisher = The New York Times Company|last = Maslin|first = Janet}}</ref> James Berardinelli of ''[[ReelViews]]'' appreciated the fact that "after three animated motion pictures centered upon the love of two people from different worlds", the love story between Nala and Simba has been relegated to that of "a [[subplot]]."<ref name=":17">{{Cite web|url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/l/lion_king.html|title = The Lion King|accessdate = September 28, 2017|website = ReelViews.net|publisher = ReelViews|last = Berardinelli|first = James}}</ref> [[Desson Howe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' advised parents to remind their daughters that despite the fact that Nala "pads in the supportive shadows, awaiting her inevitable marriage to Simba, it doesn't mean human girls can't grow up to be monarchs too."<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/lionkinghowe.htm|title = The Lion King|date = June 24, 1994|accessdate = November 3, 2015|website = The Washington Post|publisher = The Washington Post Company|last = Howe|first = Desson}}</ref>

Nala's role and demeanor during the film's romantic "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" sequence has drawn criticism in regards to her "submissive behaviour".<ref name=":21" /> ''[[The New York Times]]''<nowiki/>' [[Janet Maslin]] cited the film's lack of a strong heroine among its weaknesses, dismissing Nala and Simba's interaction throughout "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" as "obligatory" and "gratuitous".<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E0DE163DF936A25755C0A962958260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes|title = The Lion King (1994) Review/Film; The Hero Within The Child Within|date = June 15, 1994|accessdate = November 8, 2015|website = The New York Times|publisher = The New York Times Company|last = Maslin|first = Janet}}</ref> Joel W.

Playing one day, they literally tumble down a hillside in the jungle, and he ends up on top of her. This time, she does not bear her teeth, but instead, shows 'bedroom eyes'". Martin ultimately accused the scene's "reversal of positions" of "establish[ing] male dominance."<ref name=":16" /> Criticizing the film for "being merely distracting when it could have been both meaningful and instructive", Robert Humanick of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wrote, "Small potatoes, then, when Simba's former childhood friend and betrothed queen Nala ... unexpectedly reappears in his duty-free, protein-rich life, demanding he return to his kingly responsibilities and coaxing the lion to sleep tonight with arguably the most blatant 'fuck me now' face to ever appear in a PG-rated film."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-lion-king-5750|title = The Lion King|date = September 12, 2011|accessdate = November 3, 2015|website = Slant Magazine|last = Humanick|first = Rob}}</ref> Kathryn LeBey Davidson of [[Her Campus]] believes that Nala's reputation is harmed by her limited screen time and role, ranking her the 19th greatest Disney heroine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hercampus.com/school/davidson/definitive-ranking-disney-heroines|title=A Definitive Ranking of Disney Heroines|last=Davidson|first=Kathryn LeBey|date=March 13, 2018|website=Her Campus|access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref>
More recently, the possibility of an [[incestuous]] relationship involving Simba, his mate Nala, Scar and Mufasa has surfaced. According to Johnson Cheu, author of ''Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability'', the fact that Mufasa, Scar, and Simba appear to be the only male lions present in ''The Lion King ''suggests the possibility that either Mufasa or Scar is Nala's father, which would in turn make Nala either Simba's half-sister or cousin.<ref>{{cite book|first=Johnson|last = Cheu|title = Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability|publisher = [[McFarland Publishing]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date = 2013|isbn = 9781476600093|pages = 138|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yAjjxpvxVDAC&q=scar+the+lion+king&pg=PA138}}</ref> However, ''The Lion Guard'' identifies Nala's father as a red-maned unnamed lion who-in his youth-resembled his grandson (and Scar's great-nephew) Kion.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahDYZy4-yPU</ref> This lion was likely kicked out of the pride upon coming of age, as happens to real male lions, though not before impregnating Sarafina (Nala's mother).

However, the character has garnered positive reviews as well. Sara Franks-Allen of ScreenCrush wrote that "If being a Disney princess is about being a good role model for little girls, then Nala has a lot in her favor", elaborating, "She's strong enough to take down Simba, ventures out on her own to find help for her pride and calls Simba out for ignoring his responsibilities."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://screencrush.com/forgotten-disney-princesses/|title = 10 Forgotten Disney Princesses|date = July 29, 2013|accessdate = December 19, 2015|website = ScreenCrush|publisher = Townsquare Media, Inc|last = Franks-Allen|first = Sara}}</ref> Meanwhile, Ella Ceron of ''[[Thought Catalog]]'' ranked Nala 14th on her list of "The 16 Most Awesome Female Characters From Disney Movies".<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url = http://thoughtcatalog.com/ella-ceron/2014/02/the-16-most-awesome-female-characters-from-disney-movies/|title = The 16 Most Awesome Female Characters From Disney Movies|date = February 24, 2014|accessdate = November 6, 2015|website = Thought Catalog|publisher = The Thought & Expression Co|last = Ceron|first = Ella}}</ref> Responsible for introducing the seasoned actress to a younger audience,<ref name=":13" /> Kelly's vocal performance as Nala has garnered critical acclaim.

Review of Beyonce's Nala in 2019 remake is generally positive. Brandon Zachary from CBR Exclusive praised Nala's growth in the film is better than the original due to her unexpected rivalry with Shenzi. He enjoys the final fight between Nala and Shenzi at the climax, commenting it "has more weight than any of the other nameless fights that happen in the frenzy" and gives bigger moment for Nala's character.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbr.com/lion-king-2019-makes-shenzi-major-villain/|title = Lion King Remake Turns a Minor Character Into a Major Villain|date = July 18, 2019|accessdate = December 28, 2019|website = CBR|last = Zachary|first = Brandon}}</ref> Brian Truitt from USA Today praised Beyoncé's performance as Nala for bringing "all the necessary fire as Nala, a lion willing to do anything to protect her pride."
