 |ShortSummary = At a public school in Monterey, California, a murder suddenly occurs on trivia night, but neither the victim nor the murderer is revealed. Backtracking to the first day of school, the families of five first-graders are introduced. Madeline Martha Mackenzie is a strong-willed, wealthy, and feared [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha female]] in town with a first-grade daughter and teenaged daughter from an earlier marriage. Secrets are revealed, including that Madeline is struggling to cope with her ex-husband Nathan's marriage to a yoga instructor named Bonnie, and also trying to build a relationship with her older daughter. Her friend, Celeste Wright, is a retired lawyer and the mother of twin sons, who are also beginning at the same school. New to town is Jane Chapman, a young single mother raising her son, Ziggy. Madeline and Celeste befriend Jane. The equally wealthy and feared Renata Klein's daughter Amabella accuses Ziggy of attempting to choke her, which he denies. Celeste appears to have a very happy life with her husband Perry, but he starts to show signs of being violent. Jane's motives for moving to Monterey are unknown.

 |ShortSummary = Perry lashes out at Celeste when he discovers he missed orientation at the school, but she lets it slide. Jane looks for work with little success, and Madeline goes on the warpath against Renata when Renata did not invite Ziggy to Amabella's birthday party. Ed questions Madeline's devotion to him when she continues to complain about seeing Nathan with Bonnie all the time, and Madeline is further disturbed when Bonnie takes Abigail, Madeline's oldest daughter, to [[Planned Parenthood]]. Nathan tries to come to a peaceful resolution with Ed about their parenting of Abigail, but Ed senses Nathan is trying to intimidate him, and stands firm. Madeline's younger daughter, Chloe, and Bonnie's daughter, Skye, attempt to mend the wounds between Ziggy and Amabella, but it leads to an incident of unwanted affection, and the parents of the four children are called into the principal's office, leading Jane to have a flashback of an unwanted episode.

 |ShortSummary = Perry chokes Celeste when he believes she deliberately left him out of a family gathering, after which Celeste threatens to leave him. Renata's party for Amabella is a huge success, but she is ultimately upset when Madeline invited Amabella's closest friends and Ziggy to [[Disney on Ice]] on the same day. At therapy, Perry claims his outbursts are out of fear that Celeste does not love him, which Celeste attempts to deny. When Abigail's academic performance begins to decline, her guidance counselor suggests it is being caused by stress at home, so she decides to live with Nathan, much to Madeline's dismay. Jane gets Ziggy involved with more extracurricular activities and helps him construct a family tree for school with Madeline's help. However, Jane opposes Ziggy’s insistence upon putting his father's name on the tree, and she ultimately confides to Madeline that Ziggy was the result of rape by a man named Saxon Banks, whom she has not seen since.

Celeste legally represents Joseph and Madeline in a meeting with the mayor regarding the controversial ''[[Avenue Q]]'', and successfully persuades the Mayor to allow the play to proceed. In the process, Celeste realizes her desire to return to work. She asks her therapist how to best convince Perry, but Dr. Reisman is more concerned with why she is afraid to do so. At home, Perry tells Celeste not to attend any future meetings. When she refuses, he grabs her by the throat, but quickly relinquishes when one of their boys enters the room. Joseph and Madeline kiss, and they are revealed to have had an affair a year ago. Madeline locates a man online whom she believes to be Saxon Banks. She informs Jane and Celeste, and they plan to travel to [[San Luis Obispo]] to confront him. Ms. Barnes, the teacher, suspects Amabella is still being bullied. Despite Amabella's assertions that  Ziggy and she are friends, Ms. Barnes requests Jane to have Ziggy psychologically evaluated, but the psychologist believes that Ziggy is innocent and that he may actually be being bullied himself.

 |ShortSummary = Following another beating, Celeste decides to leave Perry the day after trivia night. Ziggy confesses to Jane that  Max, one of Celeste's sons, was who choked Amabella. Madeline talks to Joseph about his wife knowing about their affair, and Jane woefully tells Celeste that her son is the bully. Celeste realizes that Max was emulating Perry's abuse, having overheard it while he was playing a video game. When preparing to leave for trivia night, Perry sees a text message on Celeste's phone from the landlady of her new apartment. He confronts her on the way to the party, but is interrupted by Renata. At the party, Celeste tells Renata that Max is the bully and Amabella framed Ziggy out of fear of Max. Meanwhile, a drunk Madeline runs away during Ed's singing performance after realizing just how much he loves her and how little she gives him in return. Jane goes after her and finds her atop stairs at the back of the venue. Madeline tells Jane that she cheated on Ed. Renata also goes after them and apologizes to Jane for having blamed Ziggy. Celeste joins the women, followed by Perry. Bonnie follows them and watches the group from afar. Jane sees Perry and realizes that he is Saxon Banks. Perry pleads with Celeste to come back home with him, and when she declines, he viciously attacks her. The group unsuccessfully fights Perry off until Bonnie rushes in and pushes him down the stairs, killing him. In police interviews, the women confirm that  a fight with Perry happened, but claim he fell accidentally. Later, the five women and their children lounge at the beach, where Detective Quinlan continues to watch them.

 |ShortSummary = Celeste and Mary Louise go to trial to battle for the custody of Max and Josh. Celeste is completely shocked and hurt when Mary Louise's lawyer asks her a wide array of personal questions. Celeste explains that she is coping with grief and intends to improve herself and get better. Just before the judge announces the verdict, Celeste interrupts to say that Mary Louise never took the stand and that is not fair. Celeste herself wants to question Mary Louise, and the judge agrees. Ed meets with Tori, who comes on to him and tells him that she has fantasized about him. Madeline approaches Ed again, and says that she wants to try to work it out. Jane questions Corey about his presence at the police station, and he tells her that he was just called in for questioning by the detective, who asked him if Jane has ever talked with him about the night Perry died. Corey claims that he told the detective nothing. Though mildly reassured, Jane stops answering his calls and texts because she says she is not ready for something new just yet. Bonnie confesses everything (including pushing Perry and her resentment towards her mother) to her mom, while she is in a coma, as she thinks her mother is going to die soon and that this may be her last chance to say anything.

The show was initially conceived of and billed as a miniseries{{r|moreau20190226}} of seven episodes. In the wake of the Emmy nominations, Reese Witherspoon said: "As of right now, I think it's pretty whole. I feel really good about where it is, and if this is all it ever was, it's a beautiful thing we all accomplished together",<ref name="breakrules"/> while Vallée came out strongly against the idea of producing a second season: "There's no reason to make a season two.

The announcement of the second season, and—specifically—its timing, enraged the producers of rival shows that were competing for award nominations in the limited series category, particularly since the announcement was made after voting for the Critics' Choice Awards and Golden Globe Awards had ended. The [[Producers Guild of America]] restarted voting for the 2018 [[PGA Awards]], reclassifying the show from a limited series to a [[drama series]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/big-little-lies-moved-limited-series-to-drama-series-category-pga-awards-hbo-renewal-1202223387/ |title='Big Little Lies' moved from Limited Series to Drama Series category by PGA Awards following HBO renewal |work=Deadline Hollywood |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=December 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |archive-date=December 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209072112/http://deadline.com/2017/12/big-little-lies-moved-limited-series-to-drama-series-category-pga-awards-hbo-renewal-1202223387/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/big-littles-lies-sequel-announcement-sparks-outrage-awards-categorization-1065999 |title='Big Little Lies' sequel announcement sparks outrage about its awards categorization |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Scott |last=Feinberg |date=December 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 10, 2017 |archive-date=December 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209084852/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/big-littles-lies-sequel-announcement-sparks-outrage-awards-categorization-1065999 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In July 2019, it was reported by ''[[IndieWire]]'' that director Andrea Arnold lost creative control after filming had completed, and it was given to season 1 director Jean-Marc Vallée in an attempt to unify the style between the seasons. Arnold was initially promised by HBO that the show would be done in her vision, including post-production, and was unaware that Vallée would edit the footage she had shot. Once Vallée completed his work on ''[[Sharp Objects (miniseries)|Sharp Objects]]'', he took over the editing process along with his own editorial team in Montreal. HBO also ordered 17 more days of additional photography, to be filmed by Arnold, but overseen by Vallée. Significant reworking of the episodes also took place, where episodes were shortened.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-andrea-arnold-lost-creative-control-jean-marc-vallee-1202156884/ |title='Big Little Lies' Season 2 Turmoil: Inside Andrea Arnold's Loss of Creative Control |website=[[IndieWire]] |first=Chris |last=O'Falt |date=July 12, 2019 |accessdate=July 15, 2019 |archive-date=July 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715012004/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-andrea-arnold-lost-creative-control-jean-marc-vallee-1202156884/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In response, HBO programming president Casey Bloys stated, "There's a lot of misinformation around that subject" and "the director typically does not have final creative control".

===Future===
HBO president Casey Bloys said a third season of the show was "not realistic" due to scheduling the show's actors, but Bloys mentioned that HBO is more than willing to greenlight a third season if the cast is able to work out their schedules.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2019/07/11/big-little-lies-season-3-renewed-returning/ |title=Big Little Lies Season 3: Will It Happen? |website=TVLine |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |date=July 11, 2019 |accessdate=July 16, 2019 |archive-date=July 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711165107/https://tvline.com/2019/07/11/big-little-lies-season-3-renewed-returning/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In October 2020, Nicole Kidman revealed during a press interview for ''[[The Undoing (miniseries)|The Undoing]]'' that author Liane Moriarty is writing the plot for a potential third season and that the cast is excited to reunite for a third season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsfm.com.au/entertainment/nicole-kidman-confirms-that-big-little-lies-3-is-in-the-works/ |title=Nicole Kidman CONFIRMS That 'Big Little Lies 3' Is In The Works |website=WSFM |first=Jenna |last=Benson |date=October 25, 2020 |accessdate=October 25, 2020 |archive-date=November 15, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115012424/https://www.wsfm.com.au/competition/win-tickets-to-pure-gold-live-2020/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
