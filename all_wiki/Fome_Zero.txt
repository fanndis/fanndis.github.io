'''Fome Zero''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈfɔmi ˈzɛɾu}}, ''Zero Hunger'') is a program of the [[Federal government of Brazil|Government of Brazil]] introduced by President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] in 2003, with the goal to eradicate [[hunger]] and [[extreme poverty]] in the country.

==Contents of the program==
The program is co-ordinated by the Ministry of Social Development and Hunger Combat (''Ministério do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate à Fome'') and was intended to put into action the government's strategy to guarantee the right of access to basic food. The program takes a number of forms, ranging from direct financial aid to the poorest families (with the ''[[Bolsa Família]]'' card) to diverse strategies such as creating water [[cisterns]] in Brazil's [[Sertão|semi-arid]] areas, creating low-cost restaurants, educating people about healthy eating habits, distributing vitamins and iron supplements, supporting subsistence [[family farm]]ing and giving access to [[microcredit]].

''Fome Zero'' is thought to be the biggest initiative to date by a Brazilian government to combat hunger in the history of the country, and builds on similar assistance programs implemented by previous governments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Effects==
The program is believed to have contributed to Brazil's recent reported improvements in its fight against poverty, according to research promoted by some universities and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). An [[ex ante]] [[econometric]] evaluation of Bolsa Escola did find significant effects on both school attendance rates and the number of children involved in [[child labor]].<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=358407 SSRN-Ex-ante Evaluation of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: The Case of Bolsa Escola by Francois Bourguignon, Francisco Ferreira, Phillippe Leite<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=WBANKRESULTS>{{Cite web |url=http://go.worldbank.org/L7RZYL07J0 |title=RAWLINGS, Laura B. e RUBIO, Gloria M.

The [[World Bank]], which created on June 2005 a ''Bolsa Família Project''<ref name=BFP>[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64193027&piPK=64187937&theSitePK=523679&menuPK=64187510&searchMenuPK=64187283&siteName=WDS&entityID=000160016_20040610095010''Brazil - Bolsa Familia Project'', The World Bank]</ref> to assist the Brazilian government in managing the Bolsa Família Program, declared that "Although the program is relatively young, some results are already apparent, including: (...) contributions to improved education outcomes, and impacts on children’s growth, food consumption, and diet quality".<ref name=WBANK>[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:20702063~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html ''Brazil’s Bolsa Familia Program Celebrates Progress in Lifting Families out of Poverty'', News & Broadcast, The World Bank, Brasilia, Brazil, December 19, 2005]</ref>

A study by the [[UNDP]] Poverty Centre found that over 80% of the Bolsa Familia benefits went to families in poverty (making under half the minimum wage per capita), thus most of the benefits were going to the poor.<ref name=IPC>[http://www.ipc-undp.org/pub/IPCEvaluationNote1.pdf International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (UNDP/IPC-IG) ''Evaluation Note'']</ref> BF was also claimed to have been responsible for about 20% of the drop in [[Economic inequality|inequality]] in Brazil since 2001, which is welcome in one of the most [[Brazil#Poverty|unequal]] countries on the planet.<ref>[http://www.undp-povertycentre.org/newsletters/WorkingPaper21.pdf untitled<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013151653/http://www.undp-povertycentre.org/newsletters/WorkingPaper21.pdf |date=October 13, 2008 }}</ref>
Research promoted by the [[World Bank]] showed a significant reduction in [[child labor]] exploitation among children benefited by the Bolsa Família program.<ref name=CHILDLABOR>YAP, Yoon-Tien, Guilherme Sedlacek and Peter Orazem. 2001.

The program has also been reported to have made a significant impact on the ability of the poorest families to eat.  Children in public school receive one free meal a day—two in the poorest areas—and so less of their family's limited income is needed to pay for food.  In a survey of Bolsa Familia recipients, 82.4% reported eating better; additionally, it was reported to increase the incomes of the poorer families by about 25%.<ref>[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/icct06/DOCS/English/Day1/Mutzig_CCTs%20in%20MIC_Brazil.pdf Microsoft PowerPoint - Mutzig_CCTs in MIC_Brazil_06-26_III.b.ppt<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Criticism==
In 2003, David de Ferranti,<ref name="IBRD">[http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/0/237BE2B1B975FD4985256B1F005334E7?OpenDocument BIRD] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070813044848/http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/0/237BE2B1B975FD4985256B1F005334E7?OpenDocument |date=2007-08-13 }}</ref> the World Bank [[World Bank Group|IBRD]] representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, criticized the program,<ref name="Folha">[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u47524.shtml ''Governo recebe novas críticas aos principais pontos do Fome Zero'' - Folha Online (March 31, 2003)]</ref> due to its lack of clear focus, saying the program did not combat the country's poverty and income inequality. He also criticised the mechanisms for money donation and food gathering and distribution.

Fome Zero is considered by the opposition (especially the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]] and [[Democrats (Brazil)|DEM]] parties) as a failure, due to what they believe is the government's inability to manage the program effectively. Murilo Zauith, a PFL federal deputy, in March 2005, said the program was faulty, citing as an example the death of several [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] children due to malnutrition in the city of Dourados, [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]. However, Humberto Costa, the Minister of Health at the time, considered the death count average and not alarming.<ref name="Correio">[http://www.correiodoestado.com.br/exibir.asp?chave=97363,1,8,11-03-2005 ''Murilo Zauith considera Fome Zero programa fracassado'' - Correio do Estado (March 11, 2005]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})</ref>

Another criticism is that the program turned mostly in a money-transfer program, subject to corruption, and did not completely solve the problem.<ref name="Coha">[http://www.coha.org/the-fome-zero-program-%E2%80%93-brazil%E2%80%99s-losing-struggle-to-help-the-hungry-lula%E2%80%99s-leadership-fading/ ''The Fome Zero Program – Brazil’s Losing Struggle to Help the Hungry: Lula’s Leadership Fading '' - Council on Hemispheric Affairs(July, 2005)]</ref> Data from 2014-2015 showed that malnutrition is still a problem in Brazil and responsible by 4.3 deaths per 100,000 people per year, linked to the fact that 3.8% of the population (7.6 million people) still earns less than US$1 a day.<ref name="WHR">[http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/malnutrition/by-country/ ''Malnutrition Death Rate Per 100,000'' - WORLD HEALTH RANKINGS(Who, 2014)]</ref><ref name="WHO">[http://apps.who.int/nutrition/landscape/report.aspx?iso=bra ''Nutrition Landscape Information System (NLiS)'' - World Health Organization(March, 2017)]</ref>
