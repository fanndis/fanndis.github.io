The Parliament is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs), elected for four-year terms under the [[additional member system]]: 73 MSPs represent individual geographical [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]] elected by the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] (‘first-past-the-post’) system, while a further 56 are returned from eight [[Additional Member System|additional member]] regions, each electing seven MSPs.<ref name="ScotParlWorks">{{Cite web |date=October 2014 |title=How the Scottish Parliament works |url=http://www.parliament.scot/PublicInformationdocuments/SP_HTSPW_English_Oct_14_web.pdf |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> The most recent [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|general election]] to the Parliament was held on 5 May 2016, with the [[Scottish National Party]] winning a plurality.

The original [[Parliament of Scotland]] was the national legislature of the independent [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and existed from the early 13th century until the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the [[Kingdom of England]] under the [[Acts of Union 1707]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref name="HistoricalConnection">{{Cite web |title=The Scottish Parliament – Past and Present |url=http://www.parliament.scot/EducationandCommunityPartnershipsresources/TimelineEnglishSept_2013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820113753/http://www.parliament.scot/EducationandCommunityPartnershipsresources/TimelineEnglishSept_2013.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2016 |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> As a consequence, both the Parliament of Scotland and the [[Parliament of England]] ceased to exist, and the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which sat at [[Westminster]] in London<ref name="HistoricalConnection" /> was formed.

Following a [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum in 1997]], in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution, the powers of the [[devolution|devolved]] legislature were specified by the [[Scotland Act 1998]]. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make [[Scots law|laws]] – by explicitly specifying powers that are "[[reserved and excepted matters|reserved]]" to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scotland Act 1998: Scottish Parliament Reserved Issues |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--t.htm#sch5 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519074917/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--t.htm#sch5 |archive-date=19 May 2007 |access-date=14 November 2006 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI)}}</ref> The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws.<ref>Murkens, Jones & Keating (2002), p. 11.</ref> The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report – 12 May 1999 |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or010104.htm#Col7 |access-date=5 November 2006 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> The competence of the Scottish Parliament has been amended numerous times since then, most notably by the [[Scotland Act 2012]] and [[Scotland Act 2016]], with some of the most significant changes being the expansion of the Parliament's powers, especially over taxation and welfare.

== History of the Scottish Parliament ==
{{main|History of Scottish devolution}}
Before the [[Treaty of Union 1707]] united the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[Kingdom of England]] into a new state called "[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]", Scotland had an [[independence|independent]] parliament known as the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. Initial Scottish proposals in the negotiation over the Union suggested a devolved Parliament be retained in Scotland, but this was not accepted by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] negotiators.<ref>{{Cite news |year=1997 |title=The Last Parliament of Scotland 1703–1707 |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/1707.shtml#last |access-date=15 October 2006}}</ref>

For the next three hundred years, Scotland was directly governed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] and the subsequent [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], both seated at Westminster, and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in [[Scottish national identity]].<ref name="Devolution">{{Cite news |title=The Devolution Debate (1997) – This Century |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/c20scot.shtml |access-date=13 October 2006}}</ref> Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name="Devolution" /> A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of [[devolution|home rule]] or complete [[Scottish independence|independence]], and in 1969 prompted the incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Harold Wilson]] to set up the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]] to consider the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]].<ref name="Devolution" /> One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom.<ref name="Devolution" /> Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected [[Scottish Assembly]] to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1 January 2005 |title=Papers reveal devolution warnings |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4137765.stm |access-date=24 November 2006}}</ref>

During this time, the discovery of [[North Sea oil|oil]] in the [[North Sea]] and the following "[[It's Scotland's oil]]" campaign of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP. The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should.<ref name="Devolution" /> The combined effect of these events led to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974.<ref name="Devolution" /> However, it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament.

Under the terms of the [[Scotland Act 1978]], an elected assembly would be set up in Edinburgh provided that a referendum be held on 1 March 1979, with at least 40% of the total electorate voting in favour of the proposal. The [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum]] failed:  although the vote was 51.6% in favour of a Scottish Assembly, with a turnout of 63.6%, the majority represented only 32.9% of the eligible voting population.<ref>{{Cite news |year=1997 |title=The 1979 Referendums |publisher=The Holyrood Inquiry |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/79referendums.shtml |access-date=21 August 2006}}</ref>

[[File:Scottish Parliament logo.svg|thumb|Official logo of the Scottish Parliament]]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, demand for a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because the government of the United Kingdom was controlled by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs.<ref name="Devolution" /> In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the [[Campaign for a Scottish Assembly]] was initiated as a [[Advocacy group|pressure group]], leading to the 1989 [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] with various organisations such as [[Religion in Scotland|Scottish churches]], [[List of political parties in Scotland|political parties]] and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Peter Fraser |date=15 October 2004 |title=Events Prior to 1 May 1997 |url=http://scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/inquiry/sp205-02.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024190756/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/inquiry/sp205-02.htm |archive-date=24 October 2004 |access-date=17 November 2006 |publisher=The Holyrood Inquiry}}</ref>

Devolution continued to form part of the platform of the Labour Party which won power under [[Tony Blair]] in May 1997.<ref name="Devolution" /> In September 1997, the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|Scottish devolution referendum]] was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Past Referendums – Scotland 1997 |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/referendums/Scotland1997.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207062754/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/referendums/Scotland1997.cfm |archive-date=7 December 2006 |access-date=17 November 2006 |publisher=The Electoral Commission}}</ref> An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Morgan |first=Bryn |date=8 October 1999 |title=House of Commons Research Paper – Scottish Parliament Elections: 6 May 1999 |url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP99-50 |access-date=2 July 2016 |publisher=House of Commons Library}}</ref>

== Building and grounds ==
{{main|Scottish Parliament Building}}
[[File:ScottishParliamentFront.JPG|thumb|The public entrance of the Scottish Parliament building, opened in October 2004.]]

Since September 2004, the official home of the Scottish Parliament has been a new [[Scottish Parliament Building]], in the Holyrood area of Edinburgh. The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect [[Enric Miralles]] in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm [[RMJM]] which was led by Design Principal [[Tony Kettle]]. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and [[gabion]] walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on [[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn's]] [[The Skating Minister|Skating Minister]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Charles Jencks |date=January 2005 |title=Identity parade: Miralles and the Scottish parliament: On the architectural territories of the EMBT/RMJM parliament building |url=http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/Articles/view.php?id=23084 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009045338/http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/Articles/view.php?id=23084 |archive-date=9 October 2007 |access-date=7 January 2007 |publisher=Architecture Today no.154 p.32–44}}</ref> [[Crow-stepped gable]]s and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique<ref>{{Cite news |title=Gallery – The Scottish Parliament at Holyrood |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/gall/0,,1299023,00.html |access-date=25 October 2006}}</ref> architecture. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] opened the new building on 9 October 2004.

In March 2006, one of the Holyrood building's roof beams slipped out of its support and was left dangling above the back benches during a debate.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 March 2006 |title=Holyrood business halted by beam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4766552.stm |access-date=16 August 2017 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC}}</ref> The debating chamber was subsequently closed, and MSPs moved to [[The Hub (Edinburgh)|The Hub]] for one week, whilst inspections were carried out.<ref>{{Cite news |date=9 March 2006 |title=MSPs face further beam disruption |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4791594.stm |access-date=16 October 2006}}</ref> During repairs, all chamber business was conducted in the Parliament's committee room two.

=== Temporary accommodation 1999–2004 ===
While the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed, a temporary home for the Parliament was found in Edinburgh.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sengupta |first=Kim |date=21 March 1998 |title=Parliament kept out in double blow for Glasgow |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/parliament-kept-out-in-double-blow-for-glasgow-1151377.html |access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref> The [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly Hall]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] on the [[Royal Mile]] was chosen to host the Parliament.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1 July 1999 |title=Kirk's home hosts moment of history |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/scottish_parliament_opening/378263.stm |access-date=14 November 2006}}</ref> Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Assembly Hall, which is part of the [[New College, Edinburgh|School of Divinity]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]].

In May 2000, the Parliament was temporarily relocated to the former [[Strathclyde Regional Council]] debating chamber in Glasgow,<ref>{{Cite news |date=13 January 2000 |title=Glasgow's miles better for parliament |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/601940.stm |access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref> and to the [[University of Aberdeen]] in May 2002.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Urquhart |first=Frank |date=12 September 2001 |title=Aberdeen first city outside central belt to host parliament |work=The Scotsman |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/aberdeen-first-city-outside-central-belt-to-host-parliament-1-575634 |access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref>

== Officials ==
{{main|Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament}}

[[File:Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at the opening of the Scottish Parliament.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] at the opening of the Scottish Parliament on 1 July 1999 alongside then [[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Donald Dewar]] and then Presiding Officer [[David Steel, Baron Steel of Aikwood|Lord Steel of Aikwood]]]]
After each election to the Scottish Parliament, at the beginning of each parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]], the equivalent of the speaker in other legislatures, and two MSPs to serve as deputies<!--(currently [[Elaine Smith (Scottish politician)|Elaine Smith]] and [[John Scott (Scottish politician)|John Scott]])-->. The Presiding Officer (currently [[Ken Macintosh]]) and deputies (currently [[Linda Fabiani]] and [[Christine Grahame]]) are elected by a [[secret ballot]] of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the [[Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the Parliament: The Presiding Officer |url=http://www.parliament.scot/abouttheparliament/presiding-officer.aspx |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial.<ref name="PresidingOfficer">{{Cite web |title=About the Parliament: The Presiding Officer: The Presiding Officer |url=http://www.parliament.scot/abouttheparliament/99449.aspx |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the [[Rules of order|standing orders]] that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.<ref name="Chamber">{{Cite web |title=The Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/publicInfo/documents/Chamber.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029074244/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/publicInfo/documents/Chamber.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2006 |access-date=13 October 2006 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |format=PDF}}</ref>

As a member of the [[Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body]], the Presiding Officer is responsible for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the Parliament: Corporate Governance: Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB): SPCB Remit |url=http://www.parliament.scot/abouttheparliament/18324.aspx |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity.<ref name="PresidingOfficer" />

The Presiding Officer controls debates by calling on members to speak. If a member believes that a rule (or standing order) has been breached, he or she may raise a "[[point of order]]", on which the Presiding Officer makes a ruling that is not subject to any debate or appeal. The Presiding Officer may also discipline members who fail to observe the rules of the Parliament.<ref name="PresidingOfficer" />

The [[Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations]], supported by the [[Minister for Parliamentary Business]], is responsible for steering the Scottish Government's executive business through Parliament.

The [[debating chamber]] of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a [[Hemicycle (chamber)|hemicycle]], a design which is common across European legislatures, intended to encourage consensus and compromise.<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 November 1997 |title=Horseshoe chamber shapes up Dewar says Scottish parliament design will not follow the confrontational template of Westminster |work=The Herald |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12350379.Horseshoe_chamber_shapes_up_Dewar_says_Scottish_parliament_design_will_not_follow_the_confrontational_template_of_Westminster/ |access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Lockhart |first=David |date=19 February 2014 |title=Westminster and Holyrood: A tale of two parliaments |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25776433 |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and two are seats for the Scottish Law Officers—the [[Lord Advocate]] and the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]], who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government. As such, the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote.

Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings.<ref name="Chamber" /> The First Minister, Scottish [[List of Scottish Governments|cabinet ministers]] and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side.<ref name="Chamber" /> The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.

In front of the Presiding Officers' desk is the parliamentary [[ceremonial mace|mace]],<ref name="bbc mace">{{Cite news |date=1 July 1999 |title=A symbol of authority |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/scottish_parliament_opening/377090.stm}}</ref> which is made from silver and [[inlay|inlaid]] with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: ''Wisdom'', ''Compassion'', ''Justice'' and ''Integrity''.<ref name="mace">{{Cite web |date=15 July 1999 |title=Parliament Mace to go on display at the Museum of Scotland |url=http://scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-99/pa0029.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907080409/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-99/pa0029.htm |archive-date=7 September 2006 |access-date=12 October 2006 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> The words ''There shall be a Scottish Parliament'', which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around the head of the mace,<ref name="bbc mace" /><ref name="mace" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Donald Dewar's speech at the opening of the Scottish Parliament 1 July 1999 |url=http://www.parliament.scot/EducationandCommunityPartnershipsresources/The_New_Parliament_Levels_A-F.pdf |access-date=23 June 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws.<ref name="mace" /> Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid.

Parliament typically sits Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from early January to late June and from early September to mid December, with two-week recesses in April and October.<ref name="Brief">{{Cite web |title=Issue Briefs – Scottish Parliament guide |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/issuebrief/domestic-policy/scotland/scottish-parliament-guide-$447876.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230053/http://www.politics.co.uk/issuebrief/domestic-policy/scotland/scottish-parliament-guide-%24447876.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=16 October 2006 |publisher=Politics.co.uk}}</ref> Plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on Wednesday afternoons from 2&nbsp;pm to 6&nbsp;pm and on Thursdays from 9:15&nbsp;am to 6&nbsp;pm.<ref name="Brief" /> Chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public. Entry is free, but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space. Parliament TV is a webcast and archive of Parliamentary business back to 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Parliament TV: Home |url=http://www.scottishparliament.tv |access-date=30 September 2016 |website=scottishparliament.tv}}</ref> and on the [[BBC]]'s parliamentary channel [[BBC Parliament]]. Proceedings are also recorded in text form, in print and online, in the ''Official Report'', which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Official Report terms of Reference |url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/98008.aspx |access-date=1 July 2016 |website=Parliamentary Business: Official Report: About the Official Report |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref>

Since September 2012, the first item of business on Tuesday afternoons is usually Time for Reflection<ref name="Reflection">{{Cite web |title=Contributors to Time for Reflection – Session 4 |url=http://www.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/Factsheets/Contributors_to_Time_for_Reflection_Session_4(1).pdf |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |format=PDF}}</ref> at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes, sharing a perspective on issues of [[faith]]. This contrasts with the formal style of "Prayers", which is the first item of business in meetings of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Speakers are drawn from across Scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the [[Census in the United Kingdom|Scottish census]].<ref name="Reflection" /> Invitations to address Parliament in this manner are determined by the Presiding Officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau. Faith groups can make direct representations to the Presiding Officer to nominate speakers. Before September 2012, Time for reflection was held on Wednesday afternoons.<ref name="Reflection" />

The Presiding Officer (or Deputy Presiding Officer) decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak.<ref name="PresidingOfficer" /> Normally, the Presiding Officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak.<ref name="Chamber" /> Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time.<ref name="Chamber" /> The Presiding Officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems.<ref>Burrows, N. (1999), pp. 241–260.</ref> Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping is allowed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament: Chapter 7: Conduct of Meetings |url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/26516.aspx |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> Speeches to the chamber are normally delivered in English, but members may use [[Scots language|Scots]], [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], or any other language with the agreement of the Presiding Officer.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2004 |title=Scottish Parliament Corporate Body |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/lang-pol.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903001940/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/lang-pol.htm |archive-date=3 September 2006 |access-date=11 October 2006 |website=Scottish Parliament Language Policy |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> The Scottish Parliament has conducted debates in the Gaelic language.<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 February 2000 |title=Scottish Parliament Corporate Body |url=http://scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-00/pa00-013.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051114132632/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-00/pa00-013.htm |archive-date=14 November 2005 |access-date=11 October 2006 |website=Scottish Parliament-Parliamentary Business |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref>

Each sitting day, normally at 5&nbsp;pm, MSPs decide on all the [[motion (democracy)|motions]] and amendments that have been moved that day. This "Decision Time" is heralded by the sounding of the division bell, which is heard throughout the Parliamentary campus and alerts MSPs who are not in the chamber to return and vote.<ref name="Chamber" /> At Decision Time, the Presiding Officer puts questions on the motions and amendments by reading out the name of the motion or amendment as well as the proposer and asking "''Are we all agreed?''", to which the chamber first votes orally. If there is audible dissent, the Presiding Officer announces "''There will be a division''" and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks. Each MSP has a unique access card with a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] which, when inserted into the console, identifies them and allows them to vote.<ref name="Chamber" /> As a result, the outcome of each division is known in seconds.

The outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote. Parties entrust some MSPs, known as [[whip (politics)|whips]], with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line.<ref>{{Cite web |date=12 February 2003 |title=Evidence from the Minister for Parliamentary Business – Scottish Parliament |url=http://www.comisiwnrichard.gov.uk/content/evidence/oral/scottishferguson/index-w.htm |access-date=14 November 2006 |publisher=Richard Commission}}</ref> MSPs do not tend to vote against such instructions, since those who do are unlikely to reach higher political ranks in their parties.<ref>Kingdom, J. (1999), p. 373.</ref> Errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections, and, in serious cases, may be expelled from their parties outright.<ref name="Kingdom2">Kingdom, J. (1999), p. 374.</ref> Thus, as with many Parliaments, the independence of Members of the Scottish Parliament tends to be low, and backbench rebellions by members who are discontent with their party's policies are rare.<ref name="Kingdom2" /> In some circumstances, however, parties announce "free votes", which allows Members to vote as they please. This is typically done on [[morality|moral]] issues.<ref>Kingdom, J. (1999), p. 375.</ref>

Immediately after Decision Time a "Members Debate" is held, which lasts for 45 minutes.<ref name="Chamber" /> Members Business is a debate on a motion proposed by an MSP who is not a [[Scottish Executive|Scottish minister]]. Such motions are on issues which may be of interest to a particular area such as a member's own constituency, an upcoming or past event or any other item which would otherwise not be accorded official parliamentary time. As well as the proposer, other members normally contribute to the debate. The relevant minister, whose department the debate and motion relate to "winds up" the debate by speaking after all other participants.

== Committees ==
{{main|Committees of the Scottish Parliament}}

[[File:Entrance Plazza, National Galleries of Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|Private Bill Committees are set up to deal with the legislation required for major [[public sector]] infrastructure projects, such as the underground extensions to the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in 2003.]]

Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in [[committee]]. The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government<ref>Dardanelli (2005), p. 185.</ref> and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation.<ref name="Committee">{{Cite web |title=The Scottish Parliament Committees |url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/committees.aspx |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Finance Committee to meet in Perth |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-comm-01/cfin01-002.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321205926/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-comm-01/cfin01-002.htm |archive-date=21 March 2005 |access-date=22 November 2006 |publisher=Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe)}}</ref>

Committees comprise a small number of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament.<ref name="Committee" /> There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways. Mandatory Committees are committees which are set down under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings.<ref name="CommitteeInfo">{{Cite web |date=December 2014 |title=Scottish Parliament committees – what are they and what do they do? |url=http://www.parliament.scot/PublicInformationdocuments/SP_WDCD_-_English_-_December_2014.pdf |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public [[Audit]]; Equal Opportunities; [[Politics of Europe|European]] and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.<ref name="Committee" />

Subject Committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session, and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament. Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government. The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; [[Education in Scotland|Education and Culture]]; [[NHS Scotland|Health and Sport]]; [[Scots Law|Justice]]; [[Local government in Scotland|Local Government and Regeneration]]; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and [[Transport in Scotland|Infrastructure and Capital Investment]].<ref name="Committee" />

A further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise [[private bill]]s submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property.<ref name="PrivateBillCommitteeMeetings">{{Cite web |title=Bills explained: Private Bills |url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/29669.aspx |access-date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref> Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the [[Edinburgh Tram Network]], the [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link]], the [[Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link]] and extensions to the [[National Gallery of Scotland]].<ref name="PrivateBillCommitteeMeetings" />

The specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act as [[reserved and excepted matters|reserved matters]]. All matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the Scottish Parliament.<ref name="devolvedmatters" /> Most importantly, this includes agriculture, fisheries and forestry, [[Economy of Scotland|economic development]], education, environment, food standards, consumer advocacy, health, home affairs, [[Scots law|legal system]], [[Courts in Scotland|courts]], legal profession, police and fire services, prisons, control of air guns, local government, [[Sport in Scotland|sport]] and the arts, many aspects of transport (including rail franchising), training, [[Tourism in Scotland|tourism]], research and statistics, social work, and some powers over social security.<ref name="devolvedmatters" /> In terms of tax powers, the Scottish Parliament has full control over income tax rates and thresholds on all non-savings and non-dividend income liable for tax by taxpayers resident in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite news |date=30 October 2016 |title=Income tax powers officially devolved to Holyrood |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38150285}}</ref> The Scottish Parliament also has full control over [[Land and Buildings Transaction Tax]] and [[Scottish Landfill Tax]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Douglas Fraser |date=2 February 2016 |title=Scotland's tax powers: What it has and what's coming? |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35470086 |access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref>

Reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the Scotland Parliament.<ref name="powers" /> The Scottish Parliament is unable to legislate on such issues that are reserved to, and dealt with at, Westminster (and where Ministerial functions usually lie with UK Government ministers). These include [[Media of the United Kingdom|broadcasting]] policy, [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil service]], common markets for UK goods and services, [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution]], [[Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom|electricity]], coal, oil, gas, [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|nuclear energy]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|defence]] and national security, [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|drug policy]], employment, foreign policy and relations with Europe, welfare, reserved tax powers, most aspects of [[Transport in the United Kingdom|transport]] safety and regulation, [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], protection of borders, most aspects of [[National Insurance|social security]] and stability of UK's fiscal, [[Economy of the United Kingdom|economic]] and [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|monetary]] system.<ref name="devolvedmatters" />

Members of the public take part in Parliament in two ways that are not the case at Westminster: a public [[petition]]ing system, and cross-party groups on policy topics which the interested public join and attend meetings of, alongside MSPs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How the Scottish Parliament will work |url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/article/1001141.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004144012/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/article/1001141.aspx |archive-date=4 October 2006 |access-date=14 November 2006 |publisher=Law Society of Scotland}}</ref> The Parliament is able to debate any issue (including those reserved to Westminster) but is unable to make laws on issues that are outside its legislative competence.

=== Bills ===
{{main|Act of the Scottish Parliament}}

[[File:Scottish Parliament Act.JPG|thumb|After a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] has passed through all legislative stages, it becomes an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]].]]

As the Scottish Parliament is able to make laws on the areas constitutionally devolved to it, the legislative process begins with [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] (draft laws) which are presented to Parliament.<ref name="Bills">{{Cite web |title=Parliamentary Business: Bills: Bills Explained |url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/30590.aspx |access-date=15 December 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref>

Bills can be introduced to Parliament in a number of ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a [[private bill]] can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer.<ref name="Bills" /> Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become [[Acts of the Scottish Parliament]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bills: Bills Explained: Public, Private & Hybrid Bills Guidance: Guidance on Public Bills: Part 2: Stages of Bills – the general rules |url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/25685.aspx |access-date=15 December 2016 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref>

The party, or parties, that hold the majority of seats in the Parliament forms the [[Scottish Government]].

Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years ([[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]], [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]], [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007]] and so on).<ref name="ScotlandAct2">{{Cite web |title=Scotland Act 1998 – Section 2 Ordinary General Elections |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--a.htm#2 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519073825/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--a.htm#2 |archive-date=19 May 2007 |access-date=14 November 2006 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI)}}</ref> The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer.<ref name="ScotlandAct2" /> If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scotland Act 1998 – Section 46 Choice of the First Minister |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--d.htm#46 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031023519/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/80046--d.htm#46 |archive-date=31 October 2007 |access-date=10 May 2007 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI)}}</ref> the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by [[royal proclamation]].

Several procedures enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government.<ref name="Cairney 2014" /> The First Minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jack McConnell |title=Statement by First Minister on the government's Legislative Programme |url=http://www.thescottishstandard.net/history/scottish-parliament-legislative-programme-2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117070535/http://www.thescottishstandard.net/history/scottish-parliament-legislative-programme-2005 |archive-date=17 November 2017 |access-date=14 November 2006 |publisher=Scottish Government |df=dmy-all}}</ref> After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Debate on Scottish Government's Programme |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-05/sor0906-02.htm#Col18773 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703034039/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-05/sor0906-02.htm#Col18773 |archive-date=3 July 2007 |access-date=14 November 2006 |publisher=Scottish Parliament Official Report, 6 September 2005}}</ref>

Parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber. A "General Question Time" takes place on a Thursday between 11:40&nbsp;a.m. and noon where members can direct questions to any member of the Scottish Government.<ref name="Brief" /> At 2:30&nbsp;pm, a 40-minute-long themed "Question Time" takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport.<ref name="Brief" /> Between noon and 12:30&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, [[First Minister's Question Time (Scotland)|First Minister's Question Time]] takes place.<ref name="Brief" /> This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction.

Members who wish to ask general or themed questions, or questions of the First Minister, must lodge them with parliamentary clerks beforehand and selections are made by the Presiding Officer.

The first session of Leaders’ Virtual Question Time, or virtual First Minister's Questions, was held on 9 April 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland|COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-08 |title=Scottish Parliament to hold Leaders’ Virtual Question Time |url=https://www.parliament.scot/newsandmediacentre/114963.aspx |access-date=2020-04-09 |website=The Scottish Parliament}}</ref>

== Members, constituencies and voting systems ==
[[File:MSP Group Shot Dec2004-lg.jpg|right|thumb|The 2003 election's 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament; 73 represented individual constituencies and 56 represented eight additional member regions]]

Elections for the Scottish Parliament were amongst the first in Britain to use a [[mixed member proportional representation]] (MMP) system.<ref name="PR">{{Cite web |title=Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive |url=http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/devolution/parliament-and-executive.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004074201/http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/devolution/parliament-and-executive.html |archive-date=4 October 2006 |access-date=8 November 2006 |publisher=Scotland Office}}</ref> The system is a form of the [[Additional Member System|additional member]] method (AMS) of [[proportional representation]], and is better known as such in Britain. Under the system, voters are given two votes: one for a specific candidate and one for a political party.

Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent [[plurality voting system|first past the post]] [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]] and are known as "Constituency MSPs".<ref name="ScotParlWorks" /> Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the [[United Kingdom constituencies|UK Parliament constituencies]] in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish <!--Westminster--> MPs, with the exception of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors.<ref name="Constituency">{{Cite web |date=2 April 2002 |title=Close of Consultation on Scottish Parliament size |url=http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/our-communications/release.php?id=3231 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004081816/http://www.scotlandoffice.gov.uk/our-communications/release.php?id=3231 |archive-date=4 October 2006 |access-date=17 October 2006 |publisher=Scotland Office}}</ref> Given the geographical distribution of [[Demographics of Scotland|population in Scotland]], this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the [[Central Lowlands]], where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the [[Western Isles (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]] comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population.<ref name="Constituency" /> If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.<ref name="PR" />

[[File:Scottish_Election_Results_2016.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Scottish elections are divided into two tiers.]]

The remaining 56 MSPs, called "List MSPs", are elected by an additional members system, which seeks to make the overall results more proportional, countering any distortions in the constituency results. Seven List MSPs are elected from each of eight [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and electoral regions from 2011#Electoral regions|electoral regions]], of which constituencies are sub-divisions:<ref>{{Cite web |title=MSPs |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/msp/index.htm |access-date=17 October 2006 |publisher=Scottish Parliament}}</ref>

* [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|North East Scotland]]
* [[South Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|South Scotland]]
* [[West Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|West Scotland]]
Each political party draws up a list of candidates standing in each electoral region, from which the List MSPs are elected.<ref name="AMSSystem">{{Cite news |date=2 April 2003 |title=Electoral System – How it works |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2840087.stm |access-date=22 October 2006}}</ref> When a List MSP resigns, the next person on the resigning MSPs' party's list takes the seat.<ref>{{Cite news |date=6 May 2005 |title=Labour loses out in key Marginals |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/scotland/4514791.stm |access-date=14 November 2006}}</ref>

The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the [[d'Hondt method]]. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats). The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated [[Iterated function|iteratively]] until all available list seats are allocated.<ref name="AMSSystem" /> As the allocation of seats to parties mirrors the popular vote, it is commonplace for the most successful party in the election not to win an outright majority of the seats, thereby requiring them to  seek some form and level of cross-party support for their initiatives in government. Nonetheless, the 2011 election saw the SNP become the first–and to date, only–party to win a majority government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SNP wins majority in Scottish elections |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/alex-salmonds-snp-wins-majority-in-scottish-elections |access-date=12 July 2011 |publisher=channel4.com}}</ref>

As in the House of Commons, a number of qualifications apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the [[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]] and the [[British Nationality Act 1981]].

=== West Lothian question ===
{{main|West Lothian question}}

A procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]] have been able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland – whilst English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament. This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Oonagh Gay |date=26 June 2007 |title=The West Lothian Question |publisher=House of Commons Research Paper |format=PDF |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-02586.pdf |access-date=9 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102063652/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-02586.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=2 January 2007}}</ref> Following the Conservative victory in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 UK election]], [[Parliamentary procedure|standing orders]] of the House of Commons were changed to give MPs representing English constituencies a new "veto" over laws only affecting England, known as [[English votes for English laws]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=2 July 2015 |title=New 'veto' announced for English MPs |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33351688 |access-date=4 July 2015}}</ref>
