==Journals==

===Economic Inquiry===
Published since 1962, (formerly Western Economic Journal), EI is a highly regarded scholarly journal in economics, publishing articles of general interest across the profession.<ref name="digital impact factors">[http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/DigitalJournalRankings2011.pdf Fullbrook, E. (2011), Digital Impact Factors and Rankings of English Economics Journals 2011.

Over twenty Nobel Laureates are among Economic Inquiry's long list of prestigious authors. EI was one of the first journals to publish humor papers (now called Miscellany) with the still highly downloaded article "Life Among the Econ" by [[Axel Leijonhufvud]],<ref name="life">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1973.tb01065.x | volume=11 | issue=3 | year=1973 | journal=Economic Inquiry | pages=327–337 | last1 = Leijonhufvud | first1 = Axel| title=Life Among the Econ }}</ref> and more recently "The Theory of Interstellar Trade: by [[Paul Krugman]].<ref name="trade">{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.2009.00225.x | volume=48 | issue=4 | year=2010 | journal=Economic Inquiry | pages=1119–1123 | last1 = Krugman | first1 = Paul| title=The Theory of Interstellar Trade }}</ref> In 2007, then editor [[Preston McAfee|R.

Published in cooperation with [[Wiley-Blackwell]], EI's worldwide circulation is approximately 15,800. Wesley W. Wilson, University of Oregon, is the current editor.

===Contemporary Economic Policy===
First published in 1982 as Contemporary Policy Issues, <nowiki>Contemporary Economic Policy</nowiki> publishes scholarly research and analysis on important policy issues facing society. The journal provides insight into the complexity of policy decisions and communicates evidence-based solutions in a form accessible to economists and policy makers. CEP provides a forum for debate by enhancing our understanding of key issues and methods used for policy analysis. CEP publishes essays analyzing specific policy issues, surveys of important general subject areas, and research articles devoted to developing new methods for policy analysis. Published in cooperation with [[Wiley-Blackwell]], CEP's worldwide circulation is approximately 15,400. Brad Humphreys, West Virginia University, is the current editor.

==Conferences==

===Annual Conferences===
Held each summer between mid-June and mid-July, WEAI Annual Conferences provide the opportunity for more than 1,000 economists from around the world to meet and exchange ideas. An average of 300 concurrent sessions are held with participants presenting individual research papers, serving as discussants for papers, chairing sessions, and also organizing entire sessions on the topics of their choice. Other academic societies with similar objectives to WEAI participate as Allied Societies regularly holding sessions and sometimes their own annual meetings<ref name="NAASE bylaws">[http://byuresearch.org/NAASE/bylaws.pdf NAASE Bylaws], Article IV, Section 3.</ref> in conjunction with WEAI conferences. Conference highlights include the Annual WEAI Presidential Address as well as the Association's newest member-sponsored program, the Graduate Student Dissertation Workshop.

===International Conferences===
Held since 1994 in cities like Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, Sydney, Beijing, Kyoto, Brisbane, Santiago, Singapore, Newcastle, Shanghai, and Tokyo, the International Conferences have become a highly successful marketplace of ideas for economists from around the world. Partnerships have been established in the organizing of these conferences with universities and organizations such as [[Fudan University]], [[Keio University]], [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]], [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]], [[Brisbane Graduate School of Business|Queensland University of Technology School of Business]], [[Ryukoku University]], [[Guanghua School of Management]] Peking University, [[Academia Sinica]], and [http://www.hkea.org.hk/ Hong Kong Economic Association]. A smaller format than the Annual Conference, the International Conference program generally consists of 80 to 100 sessions including 300 to 600 economists serving as paper presenters, discussants, chairs, and session organizers. Keynote speakers include Nobel Laureates such as [[James Heckman]], [[Ken arrow|Ken Arrow]], [[Robert F. Engle|Robert Engle]], [[Daniel McFadden]], and [[Peter Diamond]].
