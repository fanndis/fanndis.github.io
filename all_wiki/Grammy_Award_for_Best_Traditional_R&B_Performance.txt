The '''Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance''' is an accolade presented at the [[Grammy Award]]s, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally named the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref> to performers of quality traditional [[R&B]] vocal performances. The award was first given in 1999; until 2003, only albums were nominated, now just [[Single (music)|singles]] or tracks are. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/recording_academy/ |title=Overview |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027163924/http://www.grammy.com/recording_academy/ |archive-date=October 27, 2009 }}</ref>

Between 1999 and 2002, this accolade was originally known as '''Best Traditional R&B Vocal Album'''. It was renamed in 2003 as  '''Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance'''. Since 2012, the category has been known as '''Best Traditional R&B Performance'''.

The award goes to the artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/bluebook_awards_certs_and_grammy_tickets.pdf Grammy Blue Book (edition 2021)]</ref>
