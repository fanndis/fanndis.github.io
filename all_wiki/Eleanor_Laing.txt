'''Dame Eleanor Fulton Laing''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DBE|size=100%}} (''née'' '''Pritchard''', born 1 February 1958) is a British politician serving as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Epping Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping Forest]] constituency since [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], she has served as [[Chairman of Ways and Means]] and [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]] since 2020.

In 2013, her fellow MPs elected her as a [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Deputy Speaker]] and First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, replacing Conservative MP [[Nigel Evans]]. 

Laing was a candidate in the [[2019 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|2019 Speakership election]], but was eliminated in the third round of voting having received fewer votes than her two competitors, [[Lindsay Hoyle]] and [[Chris Bryant]]. She was elected as [[Chairman of Ways and Means]] and the most senior Deputy Speaker to [[Sir Lindsay Hoyle]] in January 2020, becoming the first woman in the role.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eppingforestguardian.co.uk/news/18147524.eleanor-laing-elected-principal-commons-deputy-speaker/|title=Epping MP elected as principal Commons deputy speaker|website=Epping Forest Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>

==Early life==

Laing was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]], and raised in the nearby village of [[Elderslie]], where her father was a councillor. She attended the local fee paying [[St Columba's School, Kilmacolm|St Columba's School]]. Later, she graduated from [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] with [[Master of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Laws]] degrees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-columbas.org/UserFiles/COLUMBAN%20DECEMBER%2008(1).pdf |title=The Columbian |volume=23 |date=December 2008 |website=St-columbus.org |accessdate=6 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306171913/http://www.st-columbas.org/UserFiles/COLUMBAN%20DECEMBER%2008%281%29.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> She was the first female President of the [[Edinburgh University Students' Association]]. She worked as a solicitor in [[Edinburgh]] and the [[City of London]].

==Parliamentary career==

Laing contested [[Paisley North (UK Parliament constituency)|Paisley North]] in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], but was defeated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] incumbent [[Allen Adams]]. In 1995, she sought selection for the [[Southend West (UK Parliament constituency)|Southend West]] seat, but was defeated in the selection process by [[David Amess]], the sitting MP for [[Basildon (UK Parliament constituency)|Basildon]].<ref> http://internetserver.bishopsgate.org.uk/files/Parliamentary%20Profiles%20Archive/A-D%5CAMESS,%20David/AMESS,%20David.pdf</ref> Laing was later selected for the [[Epping Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping Forest]] seat, when the incumbent MP [[Steven Norris|Steve Norris]] decided to leave the House to focus on his business career.

When Laing was first elected as the MP for Epping Forest at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the previously safe seat was reduced to [[Marginal seat|marginal status]] by the Labour landslide. Before her election, she had been offered support by <!-- Knighted in John Major's resignation honours, announced in August 1997. -->[[Malcolm Rifkind]] and was generally considered to be a [[Europhile]].

Once in Parliament, she appeared to sign up to the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of the party, first supporting [[Michael Howard]] then [[William Hague]] for the Conservative leadership. After the election, she was selected for the Education and Employment Committee, chaired by Labour's [[Margaret Hodge]]. She was seen as a rising star in her early career, with good performances in the Commons and strong attacks against Labour.

She was a strong critic of [[Devolution for Scotland|devolution]], and attacked the [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Blair government]] on many of the details of the transfer of power. In December 2000, she was appointed as opposition Scottish spokeswoman.

In [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], her constituency returned to [[safe seat|safe]] seat status with a 19.8% majority. In [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], she increased that majority to 32%. She has an interest in education, transport, economic policy, constitution and devolution.

===Gay rights===

Laing sponsored the motion for lowering the [[homosexual]] age of consent to 16 in 1998: "Nothing that is being proposed tonight is in any way encouraging physical sexual activity among young people before they are sufficiently mature". She differed with many of her Conservative colleagues: "It is nonsense to say that there cannot be equality between 16-year-old boys and 16-year-old girls. Young people need protection, but young people are not protected by being made into criminals". She opposed fellow Tories such as [[Nicholas Winterton]], who said that "a homosexual act is unnatural", by replying that the Bill did not challenge Christian teaching, and that it would not legalise anything that did not already happen. She, however, went on to vote against the repeal of [[Section 28]] in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?mpn=Eleanor_Laing&mpc=Epping_Forest&house=commons&display=allvotes#divisions |title = The Public Whip — Voting Record - Eleanor Laing MP, Epping Forest (10348)}}</ref>

When bishops were told to vote against an equal gay rights law in March 2007, Laing spoke in favour of the law arguing that "her brand of Christianity" preached "live and let live".

Laing, however, criticised the manner in which the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] was introduced by arguing "social change should come about by evolution, not by diktat from the top of government" and subsequently abstained from voting on it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Watt|first1=Nicholas|title=Cameron's 'social change by diktat' hurting Conservatives, Tory warns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/01/cameron-social-change-diktat-hurting-conservatives|accessdate=1 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 March 2013}}</ref>

===2010–present===

After the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], and the return of the Conservatives to power, Laing did not receive a post in the Government. On 16 October 2013, she was elected as the First Deputy [[Chairman of Ways and Means]], the holder of which post is one of the Deputy [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]s.<ref>{{cite web

In January 2016, Laing publicly criticised [[Tulip Siddiq]], who was seven months pregnant at the time, for breaking the customs of the House by leaving a debate shortly after speaking. Siddiq had already been in the debate for two hours and left at 14:30 to eat. According to witnesses, Laing told Siddiq not to use her pregnancy as an excuse for her behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Swinford|first1=Steven|last2=McCann|first2=Kate|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12089377/Heavily-pregnant-MP-allegedly-accused-of-bringing-down-whole-of-womankind-by-leaving-debate-to-eat.html|title=Heavily pregnant MP allegedly accused of 'bringing down womankind' by leaving debate to eat|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 January 2016|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref>

Laing voted to leave in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union membership referendum]] and was happy with the result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/14579044.hard-work-needed-pleasing-eu-result-says-eleanor-laing/|title=Hard work needed after 'pleasing' EU result, says Eleanor Laing|website=East London and West Essex Guardian Series|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>

Laing was re-elected at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] with an increased majority. She said it had been a "very nasty election".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/E14000693|title=Epping Forest parliamentary constituency - Election 2019|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==MPs expenses scandal==

{{main|United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal}}
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2020}}

In 2007, Laing voted against MPs' expense claims being made public.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10348/eleanor_laing/epping_forest |title=Eleanor Laing MP, Epping Forest |website=TheyWorkForYou.com |accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref> In 2008 she was one of 172 MPs who voted to preserve what critics called a lax and over-generous system of Parliamentary expenses, which permits Members of Parliament to claim for expenses without producing receipts.

After details of MPs' expense claims were released by the press it was shown that Laing had avoided paying £180,000 [[HM Revenue and Customs|capital gains tax]] on the sale of her [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] flat by declaring it as her primary [[house|residence]]. This was due to its having a higher value than her constituency home, making it her primary residence under CGT rules. However she had registered the flat as her second home with the Parliamentary Fees Office, and by doing so had claimed through her Additional Costs Allowance some of the interest due on her mortgage.

Her constituency is [[Epping Forest]], which is close to [[London]] and less than an hour's journey by [[London Underground|tube]]. When questioned, she said that prior to the sale of the flat she had sought the advice of her solicitor.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5410704/MPs-expenses-Eleanor-Laing-didnt-pay-capital-gains-tax-on-second-home.html MPs expenses: Eleanor Laing didn't pay capital gains tax on second home], ''The Telegraph'', 30 May 2009</ref> Laing was cleared by the Legg Inquiry; nonetheless, she voluntarily repaid £25,000 as a "moral gesture".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6875270.ece|title=MPs expenses repaid | location=London | newspaper=[[The Times]] | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}{{subscription required|date=January 2016}}</ref> As a result of the [[scandal]], an unsuccessful attempt was made to deselect her by her constituency party, led by the Leader of [[Epping Forest District]] Council.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/6442038/MPs-expenses-Eleanor-Laing-reselected.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Jon | last=Swaine | title=MPs expenses: Eleanor Laing reselected | date=27 October 2009}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Laing is divorced with 1 son (b. 2001).
