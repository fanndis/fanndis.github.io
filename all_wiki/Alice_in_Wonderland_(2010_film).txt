'''''Alice in Wonderland''''' is a 2010 American [[Live-action animated film|live-action/animated]] [[dark fantasy]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]] from a screenplay written by [[Linda Woolverton]]. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Crispin Glover]], [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]], and [[Mia Wasikowska]], and features the voices of [[Alan Rickman]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Michael Sheen]], and [[Timothy Spall]]. Loosely inspired by [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy novels, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', and [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|1951 animated film of the same name]], the film tells the story of a nineteen-year-old [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]], who is told that she can restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] to her throne, with the help of the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]]. She is the only one who can slay the [[Jabberwocky]], a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]] and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants. In this situation, Alice fights against the Red Queen to protect the world.

''Alice in Wonderland'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and shot in the United Kingdom and the United States. The film premiered in London at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on February 25, 2010, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States through the [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] formats as well as in conventional theaters on March 5, 2010. It is also the [[2010 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 2010]].

''Alice in Wonderland'' received mixed reviews upon release; although praised for its visual style, costumes, musical score, and special effects, the film was criticized for its lack of narrative coherence and sombre tone. It received three nominations at the [[68th Golden Globe Awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;– Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]]. At the [[83rd Academy Awards]], ''Alice in Wonderland'' won [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The film generated over $1.025&nbsp;billion in ticket sales and became the [[List of highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of all time]] during its theatrical run.<ref name="Time">Corliss, Richard (May 13, 2012).

==Plot==
In [[London]], 1871, troubled by a strange recurring dream and mourning the loss of her father, 19-year-old [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]] attends a garden party at Lord Ascot's estate. There, she is confronted with an unwanted marriage proposal by Lord Ascot's son, Hamish, and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed, she pursues and follows a rabbit wearing a blue waistcoat and carrying a [[pocketwatch]] and falls into a deep rabbit hole under a tree. She enters a small door by drinking from a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' (called Pishsalver) and emerges to a forest in a magical place called Wonderland where she is greeted by a [[White Rabbit]], a [[the Dormouse|Dormouse]], a [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]], [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Live Flowers|Talking Flowers]], and identical twins named [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Tweedledee and Tweedledum]] who all apparently know her. Alice suggests that it is all a dream while the others argue over whether Alice is "the right Alice" who must slay the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]]'s [[Jabberwocky]] on Frabjous Day and restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] (who is the Red Queen's sister) to power, as foretold by [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Absolem the Blue Caterpillar]] and his Oraculum (a scroll-like calendar which tells Wonderland's history and future). The group is then ambushed by a ravenous beast called a [[Bandersnatch]] and an army of playing-cards called [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Playing Cards|Red Knights]] led by the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] (the Red Queen's tall general and lover). Alice and the Tweedles escape into the woods. The Knave steals the Caterpillar's Oraculum. The Dormouse leaves the others behind with one of the Bandersnatch's eyes in her possession. The Tweedles are then captured by the Red Queen's large [[Jubjub bird]].

The Knave informs the Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, which makes her order him, the Red Knights, and a [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bloodhound]] (who has a wife and children imprisoned) to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, Alice enters the Tulgey Woods where she is greeted by a grinning vanishing [[Cheshire Cat]] who guides her to the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]], the [[March Hare]] and the Dormouse's tea party. The Hatter explains to Alice that he joined the resistance because the Red Queen destroyed his entire village and killed his family when she first ruled Wonderland. He later helps Alice to avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by the Bloodhound, but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At Salazar Grum castle, the Red Queen notices Alice when she ate Upelkuchen (a cake labeled 'Eat Me' which makes the consumer grow) during a game of [[Croquet]] with flamingos and hedgehogs but is unaware of her true identity because Alice pretended to be called "Um" and therefore welcomes her as a guest. Alice learns that the [[vorpal sword]], the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing the jealous Red Queen demanding for Alice to be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The White Queen gives Alice a potion that returns her normal size and rewards her with a suit of armor when she battles the Jabberwocky. The Cheshire Cat saves the Mad Hatter from the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Executioner|executioner]] by disguising himself as him in exchange for borrowing his beloved hat. The Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen, which all her subjects agree to by starting to shout out "Down with Bloody Big Head." The rebellion is quickly put down when the Jubjub bird begins to kill the disloyal subjects, but the resistance manages to free the Bloodhound's family and flees to the White Queen's castle; both armies prepare for battle on Frabjous Day. The Caterpillar finally gets Alice to remember that she has been to Wonderland when she was a little girl, and advises her to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a [[pupa]].

On Frabjous Day, the Queens gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among a demolished spiraling tower surrounding the battlefield. During this fight, a catapult stone kills the Jubjub bird; Alice finally defeats the Jabberwocky by jumping from the top of the tower onto its neck and beheads it. Frabjous Day has finally ended and the Red Knights turn against their ruler. As punishment for their crimes, the White Queen banishes her sister and the Knave into exile together. The Knave attempts to kill the Red Queen because he grew sick of her affections, yet the Mad Hatter protects the Red Queen from his attack. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her whatever she wishes. She decides to rejoin the everyday world after saying farewell to her friends. Back in England, Alice refuses Hamish's proposal and impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to [[Hong Kong]], inspiring him to take her as his apprentice. As Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship, a light-blue butterfly with dark vein markings lands on her shoulder, and Alice recognizes him as the former Caterpillar.

* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]]: When creating the character, screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite.<ref name="nytfeb2610"/> Wasikowska read Carroll's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role. She also watched [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]''. She said, "When we were kids, my mum would pop it in the VCR player. We would be disturbed, and wouldn't really understand it, but we couldn't look away because it was too intriguing. So I had kept that feeling about Alice, a kind of haunting feeling."<ref name="SundayTimes"/> Although facing pressures to conform to society's expectations, Alice grows into a stronger-willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path; ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as "stubborn, brave, [and] non-girlie".<ref name="nytfeb2610"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Liz |last=Hoggard |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/liz-hoggard-revenge-of-the-lifesavvy-over40s-1909603.html |title=Liz Hoggard: Revenge of the life-savvy over-40s: Burton's Alice – a role model for girls of 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=February 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227035519/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/liz-hoggard-revenge-of-the-lifesavvy-over40s-1909603.html |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six-year-old girl.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Taylor |title=Review: "Alice in Wonderland" |url=http://www.daveonfilm.com/review-alice-in-wonderland-9333.html |work=Dave On Film |date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=March 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308065147/http://www.daveonfilm.com/review-alice-in-wonderland-9333.html |archive-date=March 8, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>
* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Iracebeth, the Red Queen]]: Mirana's grumpy, stubborn, and murderous sister and the queen of Wonderland. She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters: the Red Queen and the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]].<ref name="script"/> Her first name is a play on the word [[wiktionary:irascible|irascible]] because she is easily irritated, obstreperous, impatient, and quick to anger.<ref name="usatoday.com"/> Bonham Carter's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen.<ref name="glove"/><ref name="animation"/> The character hates animals, and chooses to use them as servants and furniture.<ref name="Alice in Wonderland: The curious one that will get the kids screaming{{nbsp}}..."/> It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband, the King. The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell, a toddler, stating that, "The Red Queen is just like a toddler, because she's got a big head and she's a [[tyrant]]." Her appearance is based on England's Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].
* [[Anne Hathaway]] as [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Mirana, the White Queen]]: Iracebeth's calm and caring sister.<ref name="script"/> She was one of few characters that did not require digital manipulation.<ref name="Tim Burton Takes on ''Alice in Wonderland''"/> Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of [[It's Happy Bunny|Happy Bunny]] holding a knife; "Cute but psycho.

She really likes the dark side, but she's so scared of going too far into it that she's made everything appear very light and happy. But she's living in that place out of fear that she won't be able to control herself."<ref name="darkside"/> Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as "a [[punk rock|punk-rock]] [[veganism|vegan]] [[pacifism|pacifist]]", with inspiration drawn from [[Debbie Harry]], [[Greta Garbo]], and the artwork of [[Dan Flavin]].<ref name="darkside"/> Burton said that the White Queen's appearance was inspired by [[Nigella Lawson]].<ref name="Tim Burton's White Queen Based on Nigella Lawson"/>
* [[Crispin Glover]] as [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Ilosovic Stayne, the Knave of Hearts]]: Iracebeth's husband and assistant.<ref name="script"/> The Knave of Hearts is arrogant and tricky. While he follows the Red Queen's every order, he is the only one capable of calming her dramatic mood swings. Glover said, "The Red Queen has a fair amount of short-tempered reactions to things that people do, and so [the Knave] has to be quite diplomatic." The Red Queen believes that the Knave of Hearts is her lover, but this proves to be false.
* [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] as [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]: Two identical men and Tarrant's [[lieutenant]]s at the resistance against the Red Queen who are the Red Queen's "fat boys" during their capture. Burton commented on the mixture of animation and Lucas, saying that "It's a weird mixture of things which gives his characters the disturbing quality that they so richly deserve."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-took-a-shining-to-tweedledee-and-tweedledum-.html |title=Tim Burton took a "Shining" to Tweedledee and Tweedledum |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |date=February 9, 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Company |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213181443/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-took-a-shining-to-tweedledee-and-tweedledum-.html |archive-date=February 13, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> The characters are portrayed through a combination of CGI and live-action, with Lucas's face digitally composited to a full animated body. While performing the character, Lucas had to wear a teardrop-shaped motion capture suit and walk on stilts. In order to play both characters, Lucas was doubled by [[Ethan Cohn]].
* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Imogene: Alice's aunt.<ref name="Louisville Mojo"/> She is suffering from severe delusions and is constantly awaiting her fictional fiancé whom she believes to be a prince.
* [[Leo Bill]] as Hamish Ascot: Alice's would-be fiancé.<ref name="Louisville Mojo"/>

[[Marton Csokas]] makes a cameo appearance as Alice's deceased father in the film's opening scene and Alice's mother is played by [[Lindsay Duncan]]. Lord and Lady Ascot are played by [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] and [[Geraldine James]], respectively. [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] and Eleanor Gecks play the Cathaway sisters, who bear a strong resemblance to Tweedledum and Tweedledee. [[Jemma Powell]] appears briefly as Alice's sister, Margaret, while Margaret's unfaithful husband Lowell is played by [[John Hopkins (actor)|John Hopkins]].

===Voice cast===
* [[Michael Sheen]] as [[White Rabbit|Nivens McTwisp, the White Rabbit]]: Mirana's grand vizier and Tarrant's chief [[officer]] of the resistance.<ref name="script"/><ref name="Actor Sheen in Wonderland"/> Sheen said the character "is such an iconic character that [he] didn't feel like [he] should break the mold too much."<ref name="Michael Sheen on White Rabbit"/> Burton said the quality he wanted most in his clock-watching bunny was a twitchiness, also commenting that "[in] any incarnation of the [White Rabbit] through the years, there's that sort of nervousness of a rabbit."<ref name="Michael Sheen on White Rabbit"/>
* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Absolem, the Caterpillar]]: The head of the resistance.<ref name="script"/> Rickman was originally going to have his face composited onto the animated Caterpillar. He was filmed recording his voice in the studio, but the idea was eventually scrapped. The animators did, however, try to give Absolem's face characteristics similar to Rickman's.<ref name="animation"/>
* [[Stephen Fry]] as [[Cheshire Cat|Cheshire]]<!-- Do not change the spelling, this is how Cheshire as pronounced in the film, is spelt. -->: Tarrant's bodyguard and the [[General officer|general]] of the resistance.<ref name="script"/><ref name="Five Minutes With: Stephen Fry"/> Burton stated that the character had a creepy quality in addition to tapping into his own hatred of cats.<ref name="The Cheshire Cat taps into...my hatred of cats"/> The role was intended to be played by Sheen but he changed his role to the White Rabbit due to scheduling conflicts.
* [[Barbara Windsor]] as [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mallymkun, the Dormouse]]: Tarrant's assistant and the [[sergeant]] of the resistance.<ref name="script"/> Burton said that he sought after Windsor for the role because he was a fan of her character in the TV series ''[[EastEnders]]''. Her voice sealed the deal for her role as the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-says-wonderland-has-a-national-treasure-in-barbara-windsor-.html |title=Tim Burton says ''Alice'' has "a national treasure" in Barbara Windsor |date=February 14, 2010 |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217080655/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-says-wonderland-has-a-national-treasure-in-barbara-windsor-.html |archive-date=February 17, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>
* [[Timothy Spall]] as [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bayard Hamar]]: Stayne's former pet dog and messenger of the resistance. Although Bayard does not appear in the book, a similar character named The Puppy is likely the inspiration for the character.
* [[Paul Whitehouse]] as [[March Hare|Thackery Earwicket, the March Hare]]: Tarrant's partner and the [[admiral]] of the resistance.<ref name="script"/> Burton stated that because Whitehouse is a great comedic actor, a lot of his lines came from [[improvisation]].<ref name="Alice in Wonderland: A Visual Companion"/>
* [[Michael Gough]] as [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Uilleam, the Dodo]]: The [[navigator]] of the resistance.<ref name="script"/> Burton said that Gough was the first person he thought of for the role of Uilleam because he has "a full life quality to his voice".<ref name="Alice in Wonderland: A Visual Companion1"/> The character only speaks three lines, that Gough recorded in a day. This would be Gough's final acting role; he died a year after its release, aged 94. Gough had previously portrayed the March Hare in the [[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|1966 TV play]] of the book.
* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Jabberwock|The Jabberwocky]]: Iracebeth's pet dragon and assassin. While it only had two lines, Burton said that he felt Lee to be a good match for the iconic character because he is "an iconic guy".<ref name="Alice in Wonderland: A Visual Companion2"/> For the character, Lee had originally tried to make his voice "burble" (as described in the poem "Jabberwocky"). However, Burton convinced him to use his actual voice, as he found it more intimidating and aggressive.
* [[Imelda Staunton]] as [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Live Flowers|The Talking Flowers]]: Though there are many flowers that appear around Underland, only one of them speaks and one of them is clearly a [[caricature]] of Staunton.<ref name="presskit"/> Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard very briefly at the beginning of the film.
* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Executioner|The Executioner]]: The Executioner only speaks one line and appears extremely briefly, though Carter also voiced several other servants to the Red Queen.
[[Frank Welker]] provided additional voices and vocal effects; including roars of the [[Jabberwocky]] and [[Bandersnatch]], squawks for the [[Jubjub bird]], and Bayard's barking.<ref name="presskit"/> Rickman, Windsor, Fry, Gough, Lee, Staunton and Carter each took only a day to record their dialogue.<ref name="presskit"/>

==Production==
[[Tim Burton]] signed with [[Walt Disney Pictures]] to direct two films in [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], which included ''Alice in Wonderland''<ref name="Graser"/> and [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|his remake of ''Frankenweenie'']]. Burton developed the story because he never felt an emotional tie to [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|the original book]].<ref name="Ryder"/>

He explained "the goal is to try to make it an engaging movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of ''Alice''." On prior versions, Burton said "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." His goal with the new film is to give the story "some framework of emotional grounding" and "to try and make ''Alice'' feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events."<ref name="sdcc09"/> Burton focused on the poem "[[Jabberwocky]]" as part of his structure,<ref>{{cite news|first=Katie |last=Hasty |url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-7-23-comic-con-tim-burton-talks-alice-and-the-jabberwocky-taking-on-dark-shadows |title=Comic-Con: Tim Burton talks ''Alice'' and the Jabberwocky, taking on "Dark Shadows" |work=Hitfix |date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725043039/http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-7-23-comic-con-tim-burton-talks-alice-and-the-jabberwocky-taking-on-dark-shadows |archive-date=July 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name "Jabberwock" used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing ''Alice'' film nor as a "re-imagining".<ref name="Ryder"/> However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'', and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.

==Release==
On February 12, 2010, major UK cinema chains, [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]], [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]], and [[Cineworld]], had planned to boycott the film because of a reduction of the interval between cinema and DVD [[film release|release]] from the usual 17 weeks to 12 (possibly to avoid the release of the DVD clashing with the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which was Disney's pretext for cutting short ''Alice''{{'}}s theatrical run but UK exhibitors protested that Alice would be less threatened by the World Cup than other titles).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a202872/uk-cinemas-plan-alice-boycott.html |title=Movies – News – UK cinemas plan ''Alice'' boycott |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi]] |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215205335/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a202872/uk-cinemas-plan-alice-boycott.html |archive-date=February 15, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> A week after the announcement, Cineworld, who has a 24% share of UK box office, chose to play the film on more than 150 screens.

As the success of ''Avatar'' has shown, there is currently a huge appetite for the 3D experience".<ref name="Cineworld backs off from Alice in Wonderland boycott" /> Shortly after, the Vue cinema chain also reached an agreement with Disney, but Odeon had still chosen to boycott in Britain, Ireland, and Italy.<ref name="odeon boycott" /> On February 25, 2010 Odeon had reached an agreement and decided to show the film on March 5, 2010.<ref name="Odeon makes U-turn on ''Alice'' boycott" /> The Royal premiere took place at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on February 25, 2010 for the fundraiser [[Children & the Arts|The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts]] where the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] attended.

On June 22, 2009, the first pictures of the film were released, showing Depp as the Mad Hatter, Hathaway as the White Queen, Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum.<ref name="firstlook"/> A new image of Alice was also released.<ref name="''Alice in Wonderland'' Stills"/> In July, new photos emerged of Alice holding a white rabbit, the Mad Hatter with a hare, the Red Queen holding a pig, and the White Queen with a mouse.<ref name="Exclusive: New Alice In Wonderland Pic"/>

On July 22, 2009, a [[Teaser campaign|teaser trailer]] from the Mad Hatter's point of view was released on [[IGN]] but was shortly taken down because Disney claimed that the trailer was not supposed to be out yet. The teaser was also planned to premiere along with a trailer of [[Robert Zemeckis]]' [[film adaptation]] of ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' on July 24, 2009 for ''[[G-Force (film)|G-Force]]''. The following day, the teaser trailer premiered at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] but the trailer shown was different from the one that leaked. The ComicCon version didn't have the Mad Hatter's dialogue. Instead, it featured "[[Time to Pretend]]" by [[MGMT]], and the clips shown were in different order than in the leaked version. The leaked version was originally to be shown to one of the three Facebook groups used to promote the film that had the most members. The groups used to promote the film are "The Loyal Subjects of the Red Queen", "The Loyal Subjects of the White Queen" and "The Disloyal Subjects of the Mad Hatter".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedisneyblog.com/2009/07/21/be-the-first-to-see-the-alice-in-wonderland-teaser-trailer/ |title=Be The First To See The Alice In Wonderland Teaser Trailer! |last=Frost |first=John |publisher=The Disney Blog |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724160711/http://thedisneyblog.com/2009/07/21/be-the-first-to-see-the-alice-in-wonderland-teaser-trailer/ |archive-date=July 24, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>

Other props included the "DRINK ME" bottles, the keys, an "EAT ME" pastry and stand-in models of the White Rabbit and March Hare.<ref name="Alice in Wonderland Props Totally Rock at Comic Con"/>

A nighttime party area at the [[Disney California Adventure]] theme park was created, called "[[Mad T Party]]".

Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 51% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 276 reviews; the average score is 5.77/10. The consensus is: "Tim Burton's ''Alice'' sacrifices the book's minimal narrative coherence—and much of its heart—but it's an undeniable visual treat".<ref name="Alice in Wonderland (2010)3"/> [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 53 out of 100 based on 38 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/alice-in-wonderland|title=Alice in Wonderland|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average rating of "A-" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=March 7, 2010|title=First look: ''Alice in Wonderland'' opens to record-setting $210 million|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/alice-in-wonderland-opens-to-record-setting-210-million.html|url-status=live|accessdate=March 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309124249/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/alice-in-wonderland-opens-to-record-setting-210-million.html|archive-date=March 9, 2010|df=mdy}}</ref>

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised it for its "moments of delight, humor and bedazzlement", but went on to say, "But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along, building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years".<ref name="Alice in Wonderland Review"/> Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "Burton has delivered a subversively witty, brilliantly cast, whimsically appointed dazzler that also manages to hit all the emotionally satisfying marks", while as well praising its [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), saying "Ultimately, it's the visual landscape that makes Alice's newest adventure so wondrous, as technology has finally been able to catch up with Burton's endlessly fertile imagination."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/alice-in-wonderland-film-review-1004071135.story |title=Alice in Wonderland – Film Review |last=Rechtshaffen |first=Michael |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]] |date=February 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302144251/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/alice-in-wonderland-film-review-1004071135.story |archive-date=March 2, 2010}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "But Burton's Disneyfied 3-D ''Alice in Wonderland'', written by the girl-power specialist Linda Woolverton, is a strange brew indeed: murky, diffuse, and meandering, set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland that's like a joyless, bombed-out version of Wonderland. It looks like a CGI head trip gone post apocalyptic. In the film's rather humdrum 3-D, the place doesn't dazzle—it droops."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20348226,00.html |title=Alice in Wonderland (2010) – Movie Review |date=March 3, 2010 |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |author-link=Owen Gleiberman |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307011542/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20348226,00.html |archive-date=March 7, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars and wrote in his review that, "''Alice'' plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails."<ref name="Alice in Wonderland Review4"/>

Several reviews criticized the decision to turn Alice into a "colonialist entrepreneur" at the end of the film setting sail for China.<ref name="Alice in Wonderland review"/><ref name="''Alice in Wonderland in Digital 3-D'' clowns paying audience"/><ref name="Alice in Wonderland review5"/> Given Britain's role in the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s during the [[Victorian era]] and the foreign domination of China through "[[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]", China expert Kevin Slaten writes, "Not only is it troubling imagery, for a female role model in a Disney movie, but it's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century."<ref name="Who else might be mad at Alice? China"/>

Game developer [[American McGee]], best known for creating ''[[American McGee's Alice|Alice]]'' and ''[[Alice: Madness Returns]]'', was asked in a 2011 interview about Tim Burton's interpretation of the title character since both versions share almost similar dark and twisted tone of Wonderland. McGee praised the film's visuals and audio but criticized the lack of screen time Alice had compared to the other characters. He felt Alice did not have any purpose in the story and that she was merely used as a "tool".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Alice: Madness Returns Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8j6-jiyHCE|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref>

[[Disney Theatrical Productions|Walt Disney Theatrical]] was in early talks with Burton and screenwriter [[Linda Woolverton]] to develop the property as a [[Broadway musical]].
