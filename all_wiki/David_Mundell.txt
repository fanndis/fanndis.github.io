He was first elected as the MP for [[Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale]] in 2005 and served as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland]] from 2005–10 and [[Under-Secretary of State for Scotland]] from 2010–15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/david-mundell/32679|title=www.parliament.uk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011130659/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/david-mundell/32679|archive-date=11 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He served in the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scotland Secretary]] from 2015 until 2019; the first Conservative to hold the position since [[Michael Forsyth, Baron Forsyth of Drumlean|Michael Forsyth]] in 1997.

==Background==
Born in [[Dumfries]], Mundell grew up in [[Newton Wamphray]] and [[Lockerbie]].  He attended [[Lockerbie Academy]] before reading Law at the [[University of Edinburgh]] ([[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]]), also gaining a [[Diploma in Legal Practice]] (Dip LP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishlaw.org.uk/student/diploma.html|title=Diploma in Legal Practice – Professional Legal Studies – Postgraduate Studies|website=www.scottishlaw.org.uk}}</ref> After further studies, he graduated from [[Strathclyde Business School]] as [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]].

Having become a [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservative]] aged 14, he switched to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) while at university in 1981.  In 2002, he stated: "the [[Conservative Government 1979-1983|first Thatcher Government]] did get a bit bogged down and it wasn't really the radical government that subsequently emerged,... And the fact that you had a completely new opportunity to wipe the slate clean, with no baggage, was a very attractive thing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics/David-Torrance-Mutual-respect-is.6282340.jp|title=David Torrance: Mutual respect is crucial as Tories bid to govern Scotland|work=scotsman.com}}</ref>

He practised as a solicitor before joining [[BT Group|BT]] as [[General counsel|Group Legal Advisor]] for Scotland in 1991. He became BT Scotland's Head of National Affairs, remaining with BT until being elected as an [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]. Mundell served as an SDP [[Councillor]] for [[Annandale and Eskdale]] from 1984–86 and then for [[Dumfries and Galloway]] until 1987, while a [[postgraduate student]].

Mundell is a member of the [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet]] (WS) and of the [[Law Society of Scotland]].

==Parliamentary career==

===Scottish Parliament===
Mundell was elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] and [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]] as a [[additional member system|"list"]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] for the [[South of Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|South of Scotland]].

===House of Commons===
In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Mundell was elected as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for the [[Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale, and Tweeddale (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale]] [[constituency]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/scotland/4519915.stm|title=Conservatives hail lone success|work=BBC News|date=6 May 2005}}</ref> Following his election to [[British House of Commons|Westminster]], Mundell resigned from the [[Scottish Parliament]] in June 2005. His [[seat]] was taken by [[Derek Brownlee]], who was next on the Conservatives' South of Scotland [[Prospective parliamentary candidate|candidate list]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4120538.stm|title=Tory MSP takes place in chamber|work=BBC News|date=22 June 2005}}</ref> As the sole Conservative Scottish parliamentary representative, [[David Cameron]] (as Leader of HM Opposition) appointed him [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland]] in December 2005.

Mundell was among the 18 [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]s (either Scottish or representing Scottish constituencies) who supported the [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|Commons Motion]] stating [[association football|football]] "should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage", thereby endorsing the idea of [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Team GB]] entering a British football team in the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]]. Football's governing bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland oppose a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7818280.stm |title=GB football tops Olympic agenda |work=BBC |date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref>

Mundell represented the [[Scottish Conservative Party]] at the three [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2010#Scottish debates|Scottish Leaders' Debates]] broadcast on [[ITV1]], [[Sky News]] and [[BBC1]] during the 2010 general election campaign.

===Government minister===
Before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Mundell served as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scottish Secretary]]. Following that election, the Conservative Party formed a [[coalition government]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. He held the non-cabinet role of [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland]], since the [[Official|office]] of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] was given to Liberal Democrat MP [[Danny Alexander]] (then [[Michael Moore (UK politician)|Michael Moore]] and [[Alistair Carmichael]]), in view of the Liberal Democrats' greater representation of Scottish [[Legislative seat|seats]]. On 9 June 2010, Mundell was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]].<ref name="pc-9june2010">{{cite web

Mundell was returned to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] with a much reduced majority of 798 votes (1.5%), although the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s share of the vote increased by 1.8%.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=14585|title = UK Parliamentary Elections Results 2015 for the Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and|date = 8 May 2015|accessdate = 9 May 2015|website = dumgal.gov.uk|last = Haswell|first = Alex|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150509214410/http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=14585|archive-date = 9 May 2015}}

He succeeded Liberal Democrat [[Alistair Carmichael]] as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], and became a part-time member of the cabinet committee working on strategies for [[Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14803805.May_accused_of_treating_Scotland_with_contempt_as_Mundell_given_part_time_role_on_key_Brexit_committee/?ref=mr&lp=4 |title=May accused of treating Scotland with contempt as Mundell given part-time role on key Brexit committee|last=Settle|first=Michael|date=15 October 2016|work=Herald Scotland|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref>
He was the only Conservative MP to represent a Scottish constituency in the 56th parliament (2015–2017), but was joined by a further twelve in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 snap general election]]. Following the election of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Mundell was sacked from his role and went to the backbenches for the first time since he was elected as an MP.

Mundell retained his seat at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] with a reduced majority.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/S14000014|title=Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale & Tweeddale parliamentary constituency - Election 2019|access-date=2019-12-13|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/conservative-david-mundell-re-elected-21087724|title=Mundell re-elected Dumfriesshire MP|last=Gillespie|first=Stuart|last2=McFarlane|first2=Stuart|date=2019-12-13|website=dailyrecord|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>

===Constituency issues===
In 2015, Mundell opened a [[food bank]] in the [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] constituency, which adjoins his own and was at the time represented by the [[Scottish National Party]]'s [[Richard Arkless]]. After the opening, Mundell was escorted from an angry anti-austerity demonstration by police.<ref name=aus>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-33644000|title=David Mundell opens Dumfries foodbank amid protests| date=24 July 2015|accessdate= 28 March 2017}}</ref> Mundell, who had previously denied that welfare reform changes were behind the increased demand for food banks, was accused of hypocrisy by opponents who said the opening was "nothing to celebrate".  Mundell said he was willing to work with all local organisations who wanted to eradicate poverty.<ref name=Mun/>
