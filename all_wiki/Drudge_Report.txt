In its early days Drudge maintained the website from his home in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], with help from assistants in story selection and headline writing. His first assistant was [[Andrew Breitbart]].<ref name="sappell">{{cite news|last=Sappell|first=Joel|title=Hot links served up daily|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 4, 2007|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-drudge4aug04,0,4136919,full.story?coll=la-home-center|accessdate=August 4, 2007}}</ref> Breitbart, who described himself as "Matt Drudge's bitch",<ref name="biyatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/122048.html|title=Lists: What's Your Source for That?

Drudge occasionally publishes [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]], [[Arbitron]], and [[Nielsen BookScan|BookScan]] ratings, or early election [[exit poll]]s which are otherwise not made available to the public.

In April 2009, the [[Associated Press]] announced that it would be examining the [[fair use]] doctrine, used by sites like [[Google]] and the Drudge Report to justify the use of AP content without payment.<ref>*{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/ap_google_drudge/2009/04/07/200653.html |title=AP Worried About Google, Drudge |publisher=www.newsmax.com |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410061201/http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/ap_google_drudge/2009/04/07/200653.html |archive-date=April 10, 2009 }}

==Design==
The site's design has seen few changes since its debut in 1997. Drudge has experimented with temporary, relatively minor design tweaks, including using all [[grayscale|black-and-white]] pictures for a period in August 2017<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.axios.com/inside-drudges-new-look-2471319917.html|title=Inside Drudge's new look|first=Mike|last=Allen|work=Axios|date=August 10, 2017|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}</ref> and using colored text for holidays instead of the standard black throughout the site's existence; in all cases, the basic layout remained consistent throughout its existence.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} It remains entirely written in unscripted [[HTML]], with a mostly monochromatic color scheme of black boldface monospaced font text on a plain white background. The Drudge Report has been described by Cheryl Woodard, co-founder of ''PC'', ''[[Macworld]]'', ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' and ''Publish'' magazines, as "a big, haphazard mishmash of links and photos"<ref name="guide">{{cite book | last = Woodard | first = Cheryl |author2=Lucia Hwang | title = Every nonprofit's guide to publishing |publisher=Nolo |year=2007 | page = 185 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=npBsx7qBBr4C&pg=PA185 |isbn=978-1-4133-0658-3}}</ref> and by [[Dan Rahmel]] as "popular despite a plain appearance".<ref name="popular5">{{cite book | title=Beginning Joomla!: From Novice to Professional| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLV0bCdBIVMC&pg=PA217| last=Rahmel| first=Dan| year=2007| page=217| publisher=Apress| isbn=978-1-59059-848-1}}</ref> The Drudge Report website is simple and, according to Paul Armstrong of ''webwithoutwords.com'', [[retro]] in feel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webwithoutwords.com/blog/drudge_report/ |title=The Drudge Report |publisher=webwithoutwords.com |accessdate=April 13, 2009 |quote= Drudge Report succeeds in having that web "retro" feel of something stuck in the early 90s}}</ref> [[Jason Fried]] of [[Basecamp (company)|Basecamp]] called it "one of the best designed sites on the web".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1407-why-the-drudge-report-is-one-of-the-best-designed-sites-on-the-web |title=Why the Drudge Report is one of the best designed sites on the web |publisher=www.37signals.com |accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> It consists of a banner headline and a number of other selected headlines in three columns in [[monospaced font]]. Most link to an outside source, usually the online edition of a newspaper, which hosts the story. When no such source is available, either because the story is "developing",<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51302-2004Jul15.html |title=A Touching Moment (washingtonpost.com) |newspaper=www.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=April 13, 2009 |quote=The next day, Matt Drudge followed suit with his own 'developing' Kerry-Edwards 'story' titled, 'Can't keep hands off each other.' |date=July 15, 2004}}</ref> with little known details at the time, or is an exclusive scoop, a special page is created on the Drudge Report servers, which contains text and sometimes images.

Stories on the site are ascribed different levels of importance, which Matt Drudge rates at his editorial discretion. The ''Report'' almost always holds one major story above the masthead logo, usually just one sentence hyperlinked to the most important story of the day. Other stories surrounding the main headline can be found in the upper left-hand side of the page and link to more specific articles dealing with aspects of the headline story. The standard story, either the headline or links below the logo, is written in black. The majority of stories are laid out in three columns beneath the [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]]; at the bottom of each column are various links: newspapers and magazines in the left column, columnists in the middle column, and a collection of wire service links and miscellaneous links to archives, e-mail, site stats, and a box to submit anonymous tips at the right. "Weather Action," a static page of links to weather data; and "Quake Sheet," with [[earthquake]] monitoring, each have their own hosted page on the ''Drudge Report'' servers. The newest stories and those Drudge considers most important are in red, all under a single major headline in large bold type. For especially important breaking stories, especially if they are still emerging, Drudge places art of a flashing red light on the screen.<ref>{{cite news | last=Malone | first=Michael S. | date=March 1, 2007 | title=Silicon Insider: Surfing Upstream | publisher=[[ABC News]] | access-date=July 4, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065821/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/IndustryInfo/story?id=2915370 | archive-date=March 4, 2016 | url-status=usurped | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/IndustryInfo/story?id=2915370 | quote=On a given day, the Drudge Report may contain thirty or forty sentence-long headlines, the most important ones in red, all under a single major headline in large bold type.

Although the site initially featured very few images, it is now usually illustrated with five or six photographs. Generally the images, like the linked headlines, are [[Hotlinking|hotlinked]] from the servers of other news agencies.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Jesse Swick of ''[[The New Republic]]'' notes that the Drudge Report frequently links to stories that [[climate change denial|cast doubt]] upon global warming. "[Drudge] loves a press release from Senator [[James Inhofe|Inhofe]] almost as much as he loves taking pot shots at [[Al Gore]] ...

A study in 2005 placed the Drudge Report "slightly left of center".<ref name=ucla-groseclose/> "One thing people should keep in mind is that our data for the Drudge Report was based almost entirely on the articles that the Drudge Report lists on other Web sites", said [[Timothy Groseclose]], the head of the study.

==Business model and viewership decline==
Revenue for the Drudge Report is driven by advertising that was managed for 20 years by Intermarkets, Inc.  During the summer of 2019, after many years of being known for "changing nothing" about the website, Drudge advertising shifted to a new company by the name of Granite Cubed. The current ownership, strategy and outlook for the Drudge Report is held close as private information.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/drudge-report-ad-revenue |title=The Drudge Report Just Made A Huge Change To How It Makes Money |publisher=Buzzfeednews.com |date=2019-08-15 |accessdate=2020-04-23}}</ref>

In October 2019, the Drudge Report began linking to articles which were increasingly critical of Trump, reportedly the result of Drudge himself becoming "exasperated" by the president.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|title=Conservative news mogul Matt Drudge fires back at Trump, says his web traffic is at record levels|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/18/media/matt-drudge-trump/index.html|access-date=2020-11-25|website=CNN}}</ref> This coincided with a near 30% decrease in traffic metrics for the Drudge website in the last months of 2019&mdash;from a 90 day-ago ranking of #637 in global internet engagement as of July to #844 in December.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://disrn.com/news/drudge-report-has-lost-almost-30-of-its-traffic-since-turning-on-trump|title=Drudge Report has lost almost 30 percent of its traffic in recent months amid turn on Trump|website=Disrn}}</ref> The site's readership briefly rebounded in March 2020 as the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] escalated, but continued to decline to new record lows as the year went on.<ref>{{cite web|last=Darcy |first=Oliver |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/18/media/matt-drudge-trump/index.html |title=Conservative news mogul Matt Drudge fires back at Trump, says his web traffic is at record levels |publisher=CNN |date=2020-04-18 |accessdate=2020-04-23}}</ref>

==Influence==
Fourteen years ago, in 2006, according to [[Mark Halperin]], "Drudge's coverage affects the media's political coverage", effectively steering the media's political coverage towards what Halperin calls "the most salacious aspects of American politics".<ref name="abctone"/> In ''The Way To Win'', a book written by Halperin and [[John F.

Wallsten analyzed the data derived from a detailed content analysis of print, broadcast and blog discussions during the last five weeks of the 2008 campaign. Rather than the broad impact posited by professional political observers, Wallsten found that, even on issues where the site should be expected to have its largest impact, the stories highlighted on the Drudge Report exert a fairly inconsistent influence over what traditional media outlets chose to cover. Specifically, the time series analysis presented by Wallsten shows evidence of a "Drudge effect" on print and broadcast coverage for only five of the 10 political scandals that received the most attention on the Drudge Report between September 30 and November 3, 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sites.utexas.edu/straussinstitute/2012/09/11/the-drudge-report-has-a-limited-effect-on-what-stories-the-media-cover/ | location=Texas | first=Kevin | last=Wallsten | title=Drudge's world?

==Notable stories==
===Monica Lewinsky scandal===
The Drudge Report attained prominence when it was the first to report what came to be known as the [[Lewinsky scandal]]. It published the story on January 17, 1998, showing that ''[[Newsweek]]'' had turned down the story.<ref>[http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2002/01/17/20020117_175502_ml.htm "Newsweek Kills Story on White House Intern"], Drudge Report, January 17, 1998</ref>

===Swift Boat Veterans for Truth===
During the 2004 US presidential campaign, the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]] group made claims about [[John Kerry]]'s war record, which were mentioned by Drudge and investigated by major newspapers and TV networks.<ref name="abctone"/>  The book ''Unfit for Command: Swiftboat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry'' became a best-seller in part due to its promotion in the Drudge Report.

===Prince Harry in Afghanistan===
On February 28, 2008, Drudge published an article noting that [[Prince Harry]] was serving with his regiment in [[Afghanistan]].

The Drudge Report countered stating that "it served more than 29 million pages Monday without an e-mail complaint about 'pop ups,' or the site serving 'viruses'."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/09/senate-warns-staffers-stay-clear-drudge-report/| title=Senate Staffers Warned to Stay Clear of Drudge Report| accessdate=March 9, 2010 | publisher=Fox News| date=February 28, 2008}}</ref>

==Controversial stories, errors and questions about sourcing==
===Exclusives===
Research by the media magazine [[Brill's Content]] in 1998 cast doubt on the accuracy of the majority of the "exclusives" claimed by the Drudge Report. Of the 51 stories claimed as exclusives from January to September 1998, the magazine found that 31 (61%) were actually exclusive stories. Of those, 32% were untrue, 36% were true and the remaining 32% were of debatable accuracy.<ref name="brillscontent" />

===Sidney Blumenthal lawsuit===
In 1997, the Drudge Report reported that incoming White House assistant [[Sidney Blumenthal]] beat his wife and was covering it up. Drudge retracted the story the next day and apologized, saying that he was given bad information, but Blumenthal filed a $30 million libel lawsuit against Drudge. After four years Blumenthal dropped his lawsuit, saying that the suit had cost him tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.
He agreed to pay $2,500 to Drudge's Los Angeles attorney for travel costs, claiming that Drudge was "backed by unlimited funds from political supporters who use a tax-exempt foundation".<ref name="waposettlement">{{cite news | last =Kurtz| first =Howard| title =Clinton Aide Settles Libel Suit Against Matt Drudge – at a Cost| page =C01| newspaper =[[The Washington Post]]| date =May 2, 2001| url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A30046-2001May1| accessdate = April 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="drudgequote">{{cite web| last = Drudge| first = Matt| title = May Day: Lawsuit Against Drudge Dropped; Blumenthal Pays Cash To Get Out!| publisher = Drudge Report| date = May 1, 2001| url = http://drudgereport.com/$2500.htm | accessdate = December 15, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010506000105/http://drudgereport.com/$2500.htm |archive-date = May 6, 2001}}</ref><ref name="wimpy">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/9420.html|title=Online Matt Drudge Libel Suit Comes to 'Wimpy Conclusion'|accessdate=July 30, 2007|publisher=Newsfactor.com|year=2001|author=Tim McDonald|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823062024/http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/9420.html|archive-date=August 23, 2007}}</ref> The Individual Rights Foundation, led by [[conservative]] activist [[David Horowitz]], paid Drudge's legal fees in the Blumenthal lawsuit.

===Alleged John Kerry intern scandal===
During the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 Presidential campaign]], Drudge ran a story quoting General [[Wesley Clark]], in which Clark claimed that the [[John Kerry]] campaign would implode over an intern affair. Drudge reported that other news outlets were investigating the alleged affair, but removed it from the site shortly afterwards when the other news outlets dropped their investigations.<ref name="alexandrapolier">{{cite magazine |last=Polier |first=Alexandra |title=John Kerry intern scandal&nbsp;– Alexandra Polier's account |magazine=New York Magazine |date=June 7, 2004 |url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/national/features/9221/index5.html |accessdate = June 7, 2004}}</ref>

===Alleged Bill Clinton illegitimate child===
In 1999, the Drudge Report announced that it had viewed a videotape which was the basis of a ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' magazine and ''[[Hard Copy]]'' story.  Under the headline, "Woman Names Bill Clinton Father Of Son In Shocking Video Confession", Drudge reported a videotaped "confession" by a former prostitute who claimed that her son was fathered by [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/dsp/specialReports_pc_carden_detail.htm?reportID=%7BB5E2DC5F-DCB0-4A4A-AD05-95EF060CBA36%7D Special Reports Personal Collection.] Drudge Report Archives.

===Alleged heckling of Republican Senators by CNN reporter===
On April 1, 2007, Drudge cited an unnamed "official" source saying that [[CNN]] reporter [[Michael Ware]] had "heckled" Republican Senators McCain and Graham during a live press conference.<ref name="drudgeheckle">{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Drudge |date=April 2, 2007 |url=http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2007/04/01/20070401_175303_flash.htm | title=McCain heckled by CNN reporter |publisher= Drudge Report | accessdate =April 2, 2007 }}</ref> Drudge reported that:

===''Oprah'' and Sarah Palin===
On September 5, 2008, the Drudge Report reported that ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' staffers were "sharply divided on the merits of booking Sarah Palin". Drudge said that he obtained the information from an anonymous source. Winfrey responded in a written statement to news outlets saying, "The item in today's Drudge Report is categorically untrue. There has been absolutely no discussion about having Sarah Palin on my show. At the beginning of this presidential campaign when I decided that I was going to take my first public stance in support of a candidate, I made the decision not to use my show as a platform for any of the candidates." Oprah Winfrey's public statement came after she had already endorsed Barack Obama for president on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,417523,00.html |title=Oprah Denies Report She's Balking at Having Palin on Show |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=February 20, 2009 | date=September 5, 2008}}</ref> Drudge was accused by some commentators of planting a false story for political ends.<ref>*{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/07/uselections2008.sarahpalin1?gusrc=rss&feed=global |title=US election: Storm as Oprah says no to Palin interview |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |last=Harris |first=Paul |quote=Some experts believe the issue, initially reported on Drudge ... was a media ploy to drag Winfrey's backing of Obama into the election and show a media bias against the Republicans | accessdate=June 27, 2016 |date=September 7, 2008}}

===Ashley Todd attack hoax===
On October 23, 2008, Drudge published an unconfirmed exclusive story regarding [[Ashley Todd]], the 20-year-old employee<ref name="storm" /><ref name="todd employee">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/analysis/506|title=Ashley Todd, PA Racist Hoax "Victim," Was Paid Organizer for College Republican National Committee, Not a Volunteer|accessdate=October 29, 2008|publisher=BuzzFlash.com|author=Meg White|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030014151/http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/analysis/506|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> of the [[College Republicans|College Republican National Committee (CRNC)]] and [[John McCain]] volunteer who had allegedly been attacked by a black male for having a McCain sticker on her car in [[Pittsburgh]].

Drudge then printed a retraction of the story, including links to the news stories detailing that the attack had been a hoax, and that Ashley Todd had performed a similar "attack" on herself while volunteering in a local [[Ron Paul]] [[grassroots]] group. She was later asked to leave the group because of the hoax.

===Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign===
On August 8, 2016, Drudge Report used a photo of Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] on their website.  The photo depicted two men helping Clinton go up the stairs during her campaign in [[South Carolina]] on February 27, 2016.
