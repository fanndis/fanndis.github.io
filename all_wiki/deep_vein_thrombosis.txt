<!-- Definition, symptoms, prognosis -->
'''Deep vein thrombosis''' ('''DVT''') is the formation of a [[blood clot]] in a [[deep vein]], most commonly in the legs or pelvis.<ref name=Overview/>{{efn|Thrombosis associated with the head ([[cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]]) and the abdominal organs ([[viscera]])—such as [[portal vein thrombosis]], [[renal vein thrombosis]], and [[Budd–Chiari syndrome]]—are separate diseases excluded from the scope of this definition.}} Symptoms can include pain, swelling, redness, and enlarged veins in the affected area, but some DVTs have no symptoms.<ref name=Kruger2019/> The most common life-threatening concern with DVT is the potential for a clot (or multiple clots) to [[Embolization|detach from the veins]] (embolize), travel through the right side of the heart, and become stuck in arteries that supply blood to the lungs. This is called [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE). Both DVT and PE are considered as part of the same overall disease process, which is called [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE). VTE can occur as DVT only, as PE with DVT, or PE without DVT.<ref name=2016Epi/> The most frequent long-term [[Complication (medicine)|complication]] is [[post-thrombotic syndrome]], which can cause pain, swelling, a sensation of heaviness, itching, and in severe cases, [[ulcers]].<ref name=2017EURO/> Also, recurrent VTE occurs in about 30% of those in the ten years following an initial VTE.<ref name=2016Epi/>

<!-- Risk factors and mechanism -->
The mechanism of clot formation typically involves some combination of [[venous stasis|decreased blood flow rate]], increased [[hypercoagulability|tendency to clot]], and injury to the [[endothelium|blood vessel wall]].<ref name=PDMM/> Risk factors include recent surgery, older age, active [[cancer]], [[obesity]], personal history and [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of VTE, trauma, injuries, lack of movement, [[combined hormonal birth control|hormonal birth control]], [[pregnancy]] and the [[puerperium|period following birth]], and [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]. VTE has a strong genetic component, accounting for approximately 50 to 60% of the variability in VTE rates.<ref name=EGRF/> Genetic factors include non-O [[blood type]], deficiencies of [[Antithrombin deficiency|antithrombin]], [[Protein C deficiency|protein C]], and [[Protein S deficiency|protein S]] and the mutations of [[factor V Leiden]] and [[prothrombin G20210A]]. In total, dozens of genetic risk factors have been identified.<ref name=EGRF/><ref name=2019loci/>

<!-- Diagnosis and epidemiology -->
People suspected of having DVT can be assessed using a [[clinical prediction rule|prediction rule]] such as the [[#Diagnosis|Wells score]]. A [[D-dimer]] test can also be used to assist with excluding the diagnosis or to signal a need for further testing.<ref name=2017EURO/> Diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the suspected veins.<ref name=2017EURO/> An estimated 4–10% of DVTs affect the arms.<ref name=2017UEDVT/> About 5–11% of people will develop VTE in their lifetime, with VTE becoming much more common with age.<ref name="Lijfering"/><!--11%--><ref name=Twenty/><!--5% (up to 5% actually)--> When compared to those aged 40 and below, people aged 65 and above are at an approximate 15 times higher risk.<ref name=Elderly/> However, available data has been historically dominated by European and North American populations,<ref name=Zakai2011/> and Asian and Hispanic individuals have a lower VTE risk than whites or Blacks.<ref name=EGRF/>

<!-- Prevention and treatment -->
Using blood thinners ([[anticoagulation]]) is the standard treatment, and typical medications include [[rivaroxaban]], [[apixaban]], and [[warfarin]]. Beginning warfarin treatment requires an additional non-oral anticoagulant, often injections of [[heparin]].<ref name=2013Keeling>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keeling D, Alikhan R | title = Management of venous thromboembolism – controversies and the future | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 161 | issue = 6 | pages = 755–63 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23531017 | doi = 10.1111/bjh.12306 | doi-access = free}}</ref><ref name="Guyatt et al.">[[#CITEREFGuyattAklCrowtherGutterman2012|Guyatt et al. 2012]], p. 20S: 2.4.</ref><ref name=2019Tran/> Prevention of VTE for the general population includes avoiding obesity and maintaining an active lifestyle. Preventive efforts following low-risk surgery include early and frequent walking. Riskier surgeries generally prevent VTE with a blood thinner or [[aspirin]] combined with [[intermittent pneumatic compression]].<ref name=2019Surgery/>

==Background==

Blood has a natural propensity to clot when blood vessels are damaged ([[hemostasis]]) to minimize blood loss.<ref name=2015Chapin>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapin JC, Hajjar KA | title = Fibrinolysis and the control of blood coagulation | journal = Blood Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–24 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25294122 | pmc = 4314363 | doi = 10.1016/j.blre.2014.09.003 }}</ref> Clotting is activated by the [[coagulation cascade]] and the clearing of clots that are no longer needed is accomplished by the [[fibrinolytic system]] or fibrinolysis.<ref name=2015Chapin/> Reductions in fibrinolysis or increases in coagulation<!--not in source, verified elsewhere in article--> can increase the risk of DVT.<ref name=2015Chapin/>

The most common cause of death associated with DVT is when a blood clot (or multiple clots) [[Embolization|detach from the veins]] (embolize), travel through the right side of the heart, and become stuck in [[pulmonary arteries]] that supply deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation. This blockage of blood flow to the lungs is called [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE). PE is most common in larger DVTs that occur in the thigh or pelvis. Both DVT and PE are considered as part of the same overall disease process, [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE), which can occur as DVT or PE with or without DVT.<ref name=2016Epi/> VTE is the third most common cause of death from [[cardiovascular disease]], with the top two causes being [[coronary heart disease]] and [[ischemic stroke]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Najem MY, Couturaud F, Lemarié CA | title = Cytokine and chemokine regulation of venous thromboembolism | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 1009–1019 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 32020753 | doi = 10.1111/jth.14759 | s2cid = 211037046 }}</ref> In addition to PE, another life-threatening concern with DVT, albeit rare, is when severe cases completely block the venous outflow of a region of the body. This can cause increased pressure leading to [[compartment syndrome]] and decreased oxygenation leading to [[gangrene]].

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms of DVT, while highly variable, include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, dilation of surface veins, redness or discoloration, and [[cyanosis]] with fever.<ref name=2017EURO/> However, some with DVT have no symptoms.<ref name=2019Tran/> Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive or specific]] to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with [[#Diagnosis|pre-test probability]], can help determine the likelihood of DVT.<ref name=2019Tran/> In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation,<ref name="Diagnosis">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bates SM, Jaeschke R, Stevens SM, Goodacre S, Wells PS, Stevenson MD, Kearon C, Schunemann HJ, Crowther M, Pauker SG, Makdissi R, Guyatt GH | display-authors = 6 | title = Diagnosis of DVT: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines | journal = Chest | volume = 141 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = e351S–e418S | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22315267 | pmc = 3278048 | doi = 10.1378/chest.11-2299 }}</ref> and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as ruptured [[Baker's cyst]], [[cellulitis]], [[hematoma]], [[lymphedema]], and [[chronic venous insufficiency]].<ref name=Kruger2019/> Other [[differential diagnoses]] include tumors, venous or arterial [[aneurysm]]s, and [[connective tissue disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arumilli BR, Lenin Babu V, Paul AS | title = Painful swollen leg—think beyond deep vein thrombosis or Baker's cyst | journal = World Journal of Surgical Oncology | volume = 6 | pages = 6 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18205917 | pmc = 2244628 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7819-6-6 }}</ref>

Often, DVT begins in the valves of veins.<ref name="Saha"/> The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen concentrations in the blood ([[hypoxemia]]) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include [[hypoxia-inducible factor-1]] and [[early-growth-response protein 1]]. Hypoxemia also results in the production of [[reactive oxygen species]], which can activate these pathways, as well as [[nuclear factor-κB]], which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].<ref name="Whatis"/> Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as [[P-selectin]], prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled [[microvesicles]], which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.<ref name="Whatis"/>
