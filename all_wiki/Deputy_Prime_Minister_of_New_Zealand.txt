{{Politics of New Zealand}}

The '''deputy prime minister of New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|Te Pirimia Tuarua o Aotearoa}}) is the second most senior member of the [[Cabinet of New Zealand]]. The officeholder usually deputises for the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] at official functions. The current Deputy Prime Minister is [[Grant Robertson]].

The role existed on an informal basis for as long as the office of prime minister/premier has existed, but the office of "deputy prime minister" was formally established as a ministerial portfolio in 1954. This means that [[Keith Holyoake]] is considered as the first deputy prime minister.

==Appointment and duties==
Generally, the position is held by the deputy leader of the largest party, but now that the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] electoral system makes coalitions more likely, the role may instead go to the leader of a junior party. This occurred with [[Winston Peters]], leader of [[New Zealand First]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rt Hon Winston Peters|url=http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/winston_peters|publisher=New Zealand First|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622155249/http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/winston_peters|archive-date=22 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Jim Anderton]], leader of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Vernon Small|title=Labour leader looks to outsiders for deputy|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8052977/Labour-leader-looks-to-outsiders-for-deputy|accessdate=6 July 2017|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=7 December 2012}}</ref> The current Deputy Prime Minister, [[Grant Robertson]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], has the role even though his party's deputy leader is [[Kelvin Davis (politician)|Kelvin Davis]]. After the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 election]], Davis turned down the position,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=Kelvin Davis says he won't seek Deputy Prime Minister role |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/kelvin-davis-says-he-wont-seek-deputy-prime-minister-role |accessdate=6 November 2020 |publisher=TVNZ |date=2 November 2020}}</ref> and Robertson was appointed instead.<ref>{{cite news |title=Robertson confirmed as Deputy PM |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-national/robertson-confirmed-deputy-pm |accessdate=6 November 2020 |publisher=Otago Daily Times |date=2 November 2020}}</ref>

The post of deputy prime minister was formally established in 1954.<ref group=N>A few ministers were referred to as "deputy prime minister" before 1954, such as [[Walter Nash]]. However, this was a descriptive title and not a formal ministerial portfolio.</ref> Eighteen individuals have held the position (two of them doing so twice) and of those people: Holyoake, Marshall, Watt, Muldoon, Palmer, Clark and English have eventually served as [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]].<ref group=N>Some lists consider Hugh Watt as a New Zealand Prime Minister. Watt served as acting Prime Minister for seven days from 31 August to 6 September 1972 following the death of Norman Kirk. He is not normally counted in the official numbering of New Zealand Prime Ministers.</ref>

The duties of the deputy prime minister are to act on behalf of the prime minister in his or her absence overseas or on leave. The deputy prime minister has always been a member of the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], and has always held at least one substantive portfolio. If the prime minister were to die, become incapacitated or resign, the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] would normally appoint the Deputy Prime Minister as Prime Minister on an interim basis until the governing party elects a new leader, but is not obligated to do so.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

Little scholarly attention has focused on deputy prime ministers in New Zealand or elsewhere. In 2009, an article by Steven Barnes appeared in ''[[Political Science (journal)|Political Science]]'' where nine 'qualities' of deputy prime ministership were identified: temperament; relationships with their Cabinet and caucus; relationships with their party; popularity with the public; media skills; achievements as Deputy Prime Minister; relationship with the Prime Minister; leadership ambition; and method of succession.<ref name="Barnes">{{cite journal|first = Steven|last = Barnes|title = What About Me? Deputy Prime Ministership in New Zealand|journal = [[Political Science (journal)|Political Science]]|volume = 61|issue = 1|year = 2009|pages = 33–49|doi = 10.1177/00323187090610010401}}</ref> Barnes conducted a survey of journalists, academics, and former members of parliament to rank New Zealand's deputy prime ministers since 1960. Across the nine deputy prime minister 'qualities', Don McKinnon achieved the number one ranking, followed by Brian Talboys, Michael Cullen, and John Marshall. In a second 'overall' ranking, Cullen was ranked number one, followed by Talboys, McKinnon, and Marshall. Jim Anderton, Winston Peters, and Bob Tizard were ranked lowest in both sections of the survey.<ref name="Barnes"/>
