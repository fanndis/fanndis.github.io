{{Main|History of the Germany national football team}}

=== Early years (1899–1942) ===
[[File:German_national_team_at_its_first_official_international_match_in_1908.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|German national team at its first official international match in 1908]]
Between 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five unofficial international matches between German and English selection teams, which all ended as large defeats for the German teams. Eight years after the establishment of the [[German Football Association]] (DFB), the first official match of the Germany national football team<ref>In early times it was simply called ''"die 11 besten Spieler von Deutschland"'' or just ''"die Bundesauswahl" (the Federation XI)''. Tags like ''"National team"'' or ''"National XI"'' weren't introduced until after World War I</ref> was played on 5 April 1908, against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in [[Basel]], with the Swiss winning 5–3.<ref name="First game" />

[[Julius Hirsch]] was the first Jewish player to represent the Germany national football team, which he joined in 1911.<ref>[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Soccer_under_the_Swastika/9_7lDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Julius+Hirsch+%22jewish%22&pg=PR20&printsec=frontcover ''Soccer Under the Swastika; Stories of Survival and Resistance During the Holocaust'']</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://insidefutbol.com/2011/04/14/the-war-generation-julius-hirsch/40456/|title=The War Generation – Julius Hirsch|date=14 April 2011|work=Inside Futbol}}</ref>  Hirsch scored four goals for Germany against the Netherlands in 1912, becoming the first German to score four goals in a single match.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/may/06/remembering-the-cream-of-jewish-footballing-talent-killed-in-the-holocaust|title=Remembering the cream of Jewish footballing talent killed in the Holocaust|date=6 May 2019|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

The first match after [[World War I]] in 1920, the first match after [[World War II]] in 1950 when Germany was still banned from most international competitions, and the first match in 1990 with former East German players were all against Switzerland as well. Germany's first championship title was even won in Switzerland in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]].

At that time the players were selected by the DFB, as there was no dedicated coach. The first manager of the Germany national team was [[Otto Nerz]], a school teacher from [[Mannheim]], who served in the role from 1926 to 1936.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=12339 |title=Professor Otto Nerz |work=DFB |accessdate=13 March 2012 |language=German |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215103/http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=12339 |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref> The German FA could not afford travel to Uruguay for the first World Cup staged in 1930 during [[the Great Depression]], but finished third in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]] in their first appearance in the competition. After a poor showing at the [[Football at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]] in Berlin, [[Sepp Herberger]] became coach. In 1937 he put together a squad which was soon nicknamed the ''Breslau Elf'' ([[Breslau Eleven|the Breslau Eleven]]) in recognition of their 8–0 win over Denmark in the then German city of [[Breslau]], [[Lower Silesia]] (now Wrocław, Poland).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/article876494/Nur_Hitler_konnte_sie_stoppen.html |title=Nur Hitler konnte sie stoppen |language=German |date=16 May 2007 |first=Udo |last=Muras |accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500395&action=showMatchesByYear&lang=E&liga=Nationalmannschaft&year=1937&cHash=0435f38e6e |title=All matches of The National Team in 1937 |publisher=DFB |accessdate=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610001236/http://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500395&action=showMatchesByYear&lang=E&liga=Nationalmannschaft&year=1937&cHash=0435f38e6e |archivedate=10 June 2009 }}</ref>

After Austria became part of Germany in the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of March 1938, [[Austria national football team|that country's national team]]&nbsp;– one of Europe's best sides at the time due to professionalism&nbsp;– was disbanded despite having already qualified for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]]. [[Nazi]] politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Vienna]], [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Vienna]], and [[First Vienna FC]], to join the all-German team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons. In the 1938 World Cup that began on 4 June, this "united" German team managed only a 1–1 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2–4 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris, France. That early exit stands as Germany's worst World Cup result, and one of just two occasions the team failed to progress the group stage (the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament).

During World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942. National team games were then suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as ''Rote Jäger'' through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.

=== Three German national teams (1945–1990) ===
After World War II, Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950. The DFB was not a full member of FIFA, and none of the three new German states&nbsp;– [[West Germany]], [[East Germany]], and [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]]&nbsp;– entered the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] qualifiers.

The Federal Republic of Germany, which was referred to as West Germany, continued the DFB. With recognition by FIFA and UEFA, the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team. [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] was once again the first team that played West Germany in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit-intres.html |title=(West) Germany&nbsp;– International Results |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=1 January 2009}}</ref>
West Germany qualified for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]].

The [[Saarland]], under French control between 1947 and 1956, did not join French organisations, and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. It sent [[Saarland national football team|their own team]] to the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and to the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification|1954 World Cup qualifiers]]. In 1957, Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.

In 1949, the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) was founded. In 1952 the ''[[Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR]]'' (DFV) was established and the [[East Germany national football team]] took to the field. They were the only team to beat the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation. East Germany won the gold medal at the [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]]. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, the eastern football competition was reintegrated into the DFB.

=== 1954 World Cup victory ===

West Germany, captained by [[Fritz Walter]], met in the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. When playing favourites [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the group stage, Germany lost 3–8. West Germany met the Hungarian [[Golden Team|"Mighty Magyars"]] again in the final. Hungary had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches. In an upset, West Germany won 3–2, with [[Helmut Rahn]] scoring the winning goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1486164,00.html |title=World Cup Final, 1954: Hungary vs. West Germany |work=The Making of a World Cup Legend |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=1 April 2010 |author=Nick Amies |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref> The success is called "The Miracle of Bern" (''Das Wunder von Bern'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=1278/index.html |title=The Miracle of Bern |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref>

=== Memorable losses: Wembley goal and game of the century (1958–1970) ===
After finishing fourth in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] and reaching only the quarter-finals in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], the DFB made changes. Professionalism was introduced, and the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new [[Bundesliga]]. In 1964, [[Helmut Schön]] took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.

In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], West Germany reached the final after beating the [[USSR national football team|USSR]] in the semi-final, facing hosts [[England national football team|England]]. In extra time, the first goal by [[Geoff Hurst]] was one of the most contentious goals in the history of the World Cup: the linesman signalled the ball had crossed the line for a goal, after bouncing down from the crossbar, when replays showed it did not appear to have fully crossed the line.

West Germany in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] knocked England out in the quarter-finals 3–2, before they suffered a 4–3 extra-time loss in the semi-final against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

In the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]], Germany was eliminated in the second group stage after losing 3–2 to [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. Schön retired as coach afterward, and the post was taken over by his assistant, [[Jupp Derwall]].

West Germany's first tournament under Derwall was successful, as they earned their second European title at [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]] after defeating [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 2–1 in the final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1980/matches/round=198/match=3585/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Hrubesch turns West Germany's unlikely hero |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=4 October 2003 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> West Germany reached the final of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], though not without difficulties.

During this period, West Germany's [[Gerd Müller]] racked up fourteen goals in two World Cups (1970 and 1974). His ten goals in 1970 are the third-most ever in a tournament. (Müller's all-time World Cup record of 14 goals was broken by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] in 2006; this was then further broken by [[Miroslav Klose]] in 2014 with 16 goals).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28169062 |title=World Cup 2014: Miroslav Klose breaks finals goals record |publisher=BBC |date=8 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>

Prior to 1984, Olympic football was an amateur event, meaning that only non-professional players could participate. Due to this, West Germany was never able to achieve the same degree of success at the Olympics as at the World Cup, with the first medal coming in the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], when they won the bronze medal. It took Germany 28 years to participate at the Olympics again in [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], this time reaching the final and winning a silver medal. West Germany also reached the second round in both [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]. On the other hand, due to having an ability to field its top-level players who were classified as amateurs on a technicality East Germany did better, winning a gold, a silver and two bronze medals (one representing the [[United Team of Germany]]).

=== Berti Vogts years (1990–1998) ===
[[File:Berti Vogts 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Berti Vogts]]
In February 1990, months after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] and West Germany were drawn together in [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5]]. In November 1990, the East German association [[Deutscher Fußball-Verband]] integrated into the DFB, by which time the East German team had ceased operations, playing its last match on 12 September 1990. The unified German national team completed the European Championship qualifying group. The [[1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga|East German 1990–91 league]] continued, with a restructuring of German leagues [[1991–92 Bundesliga|in 1991–92]]. The first game with a unified German team was against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] on 10 October.<ref>[http://eu-football.info/_matches.php?id=86&year=1990 West Germany/Germany national team match results in 1990]. ''eu-football.info''</ref>

After the 1990 World Cup, assistant [[Berti Vogts]] took over as the national team coach from the retiring Beckenbauer. In [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], Germany reached the final, but lost 0–2 to underdogs [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1992/matches/round=217/match=6098/postmatch/report/index.html |title=Gatecrashing Denmark down Germany |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=5 October 2003 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>

Coming into the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], expectations of the German team were low due to poor results in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifiers]] and not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time.

Klinsmann's main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany.

Germany finished first in their qualification group for the 2014 World Cup.

They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the "team of all the talents against the team of The Talent ([[Cristiano Ronaldo]])", routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/16/portugal-cristiano-ronaldo-germany-thomas-muller |title=Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo outshone by Germany's Thomas Müller |work=The Guardian |date=16 June 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014 |first=Barney |last=Ronay}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/14/world-cup-2014-germany-portugal-cristiano-ronaldo |title=Why Germany's team ethic could be too much for even Cristiano Ronaldo |work=The Guardian |date=14 June 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014 |first=David |last=James}}</ref> In their match with Ghana, they led the game with [[Mario Götze|Götze]]'s second half goal, but then conceded two consecutive goals, then at the 71st minute Klose scored a goal to help Germany to draw 2–2 with Ghana. With that goal, Klose also nudged home his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers. They then went on to defeat the United States team 1–0, securing them a spot in the round of sixteen against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]].

The round of sixteen knockout match against Algeria remained goalless after regulation time, resulting in extra time. In the 92nd minute, [[André Schürrle]] scored a goal from a Thomas Müller pass. Mesut Özil scored Germany's second goal in the 120th minute. Algeria managed to score one goal in injury time and the match ended 2–1. Germany secured a place in the quarter-final, where they would face France.

In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#France vs Germany|quarter-final match]] against [[France national football team|France]], [[Mats Hummels]] scored in the 13th minute.

The [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final win (7–1)]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] was a major accomplishment. Germany scored four goals in just less than seven minutes and were 5–0 up against Brazil by the 30th minute with goals from Thomas Müller, [[Miroslav Klose]], Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos. Klose's goal in the 23rd minute, his 16th World Cup goal, gave him sole possession of the record for most goals scored during World Cup Finals, dethroning former Brazil national [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]].

In the second half of the game, substitute André Schürrle scored twice for Germany to lead 7–0, the highest score against Brazil in a single game. Germany did, however, concede a late goal to Brazil's [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]].

=== Euro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup ===
{{Main|UEFA Euro 2016|2017 FIFA Confederations Cup}}
After several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win, including [[Philipp Lahm]], [[Per Mertesacker]] and [[Miroslav Klose]], the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers. They defeated [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] 2–1 at home, then suffered a 2–0 loss at [[Poland national football team|Poland]] (the first in their history), a 1–1 draw against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], and a 4–0 win over [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]]. The year ended with an away 0–1 friendly win against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], the reigning European champions of 2008 and 2012.

Troubles during [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|qualifying for the 2016 European Championship]] continued, drawing at home, as well as losing away, to Ireland; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions, but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar (who competed for the first time). Eventually, however, topping their [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group D|group]] and qualifying for the tournament through a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 11 October 2015 (having won the first match against them).

On 13 November 2015, the team was playing a friendly match against [[France national football team|France]] in Paris when [[November 2015 Paris attacks|a series of terrorist attacks]] took place in the city, some in the direct vicinity of the [[Stade de France]], where the game was held.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phipps |first1=Claire |last2=Rawlinson |first2=Kevin |title=Paris attacks kill more than 120 people&nbsp;– as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/13/shootings-reported-in-eastern-paris-live |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=18 November 2015 |date=14 November 2015}}</ref> For security reasons, the team needed to spend the night inside the stadium, accompanied by the French squad who stayed behind in an act of comradery.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hills |first1=David |title=France players praised for staying with Germany team in Stade de France |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/14/france-players-praised-outstanding-camaraderie-germany-terrorist-attacks-paris |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=18 November 2015 |date=14 November 2015}}</ref> Four days later, on 17 November 2015, the German team was scheduled to face [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] at [[Hanover]]'s [[Niedersachsenstadion|HDI-Arena]], also in a friendly.

Germany began their preparations for Euro 2016 in March with friendlies against England and Italy. They gave up a 2–0 lead to England, and ended up losing 2–3. They bounced back in their match with Italy, however, winning by a score of 4–1.

Germany began their campaign for a fourth European title with a 2–0 win against Ukraine on 12 June. Against Poland, Germany was held to a 0–0 draw but concluded Group C with a 1–0 win against Northern Ireland. In the Round of 16, Germany faced Slovakia and earned a comfortable 3–0 win. Germany then faced off against [[Germany–Italy football rivalry|rivals]] Italy in the quarter-finals. [[Mesut Özil]] opened the scoring in the 65th minute for Germany, before [[Leonardo Bonucci]] drew even after converting a penalty in the 78th minute.

[[File:World Cup 2006 German fans at Bochum.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[2006 World Cup]] saw a widespread public display of the [[Flag of Germany|German national flag]].]]
The national team's home kit has always been a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The colours are derived from [[Flag of Prussia|the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weser-kurier.de/wm-2018_artikel,-Warum-spielt-Deutschland-in-schwarzweissen-Trikots-_arid,137441.html|title=Warum spielt Deutschland in schwarz-weißen Trikots?|publisher=Weser-Kurier|date=19 June 2018|language=de|access-date=5 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, the German team used white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/Regulations/01/87/54/21/1875421_DOWNLOAD.pdf |title=2014 FIFA World Cup Regulations |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours&nbsp;– though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after [[World War II]]. However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afootballreport.com/post/17361170683/why-does-germany-wear-green-the-ireland-myth-and |title=Why does Germany wear green? The Ireland myth and the truth|publisher=A Football Report |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref> Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.

A change from black to red came in 2005 on the request of [[Jürgen Klinsmann]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/traditionstrikot-vor-dem-aus-klinsmann-steht-auf-rot-a-398580.html|title=Traditionstrikot vor dem Aus: Klinsmann steht auf Rot|language=de|author1=Jürgen Zulu Tek|author2=Thomas Niklaus|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=1 February 2006|access-date=29 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> but Germany played every game at the 2006 World Cup in its home white colours. In 2010, the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts, but at the tournament, the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit. The German team next resumed the use of a green shirt on its away kit, but then changed again to red-and-black striped shirts with white stripes and letters and black shorts.

=== Home stadium ===
[[File:Olympicstadium2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)]]]]
Germany plays its home matches among various stadiums, in rotation, around the country. They have played home matches in 43 different cities so far, including venues that were German at the time of the match, such as [[Vienna]], Austria, which staged three games between 1938 and 1942.

National team matches have been held most often (46 times) in the stadiums of [[Berlin]], which was the venue of Germany's first home match (in 1908 against [[England national football team|England]]). Other common host cities include [[Hamburg]] (34 matches), [[Stuttgart]] (32), [[Hanover]] (28) and [[Dortmund]]. Another notable location is [[Munich]], which has hosted numerous notable matches throughout the history of German football, including the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final]], which Germany won against [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]].

=== Media coverage ===
Germany's qualifying and friendly matches are televised by privately owned [[RTL Television|RTL]]; [[UEFA Nations League|Nations League]] by public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]]. World Cup & European Championships matches featuring the German national team are among the most-watched events in the history of television in Germany.

Germany also has the distinction of having an [[World Football Elo Ratings|Elo football rating]] of 2196 following their victory in the 2014 World Cup, which was higher than any previous champion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eloratings.net/ |title=World Football Elo Ratings |publisher=eloratings.net |date=13 July 2014 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref>

The deciding game was a scoreless draw in [[Albania national football team|Albania]] which gave Yugoslavia the edge, having won in their neighbour country. The team finished out of top eight only in two occasions, the tournaments of [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]]<ref name="GermanyEC2000">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2000/teams/team=47/matches/index.html|title=UEFA EURO 2000 - History - Germany|website=UEFA.com}}</ref> and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]].<ref name="GermanyEC2004">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/teams/team=47/matches/index.html|title=UEFA EURO 2004 - History - Germany|website=UEFA.com}}</ref> In the other ten editions Germany participated in they reached nine times at least the semi-finals, an unparalleled record in Europe.
