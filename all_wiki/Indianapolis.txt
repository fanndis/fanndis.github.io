==History==
{{Main|History of Indianapolis|Timeline of Indianapolis}}

===Etymology===
The name Indianapolis is derived from the state's name, Indiana (meaning "Land of the Indians", or simply "Indian Land"<ref>An earlier use of the name dates to the 1760s, when it referenced a tract of land under control of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but the area's name was discarded when it became a part of that state. See {{cite journal | last= Hodgin | first= Cyrus | year=1903| title= The Naming of Indiana |journal= Papers of the Wayne County, Indiana, Historical Society| volume=1| issue=1 | pages=3–11| publisher=Wayne County, Indiana, Historical Society| format =pdf transcription| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2805.htm| access-date =January 23, 2014}}</ref>), and ''{{lang|el|polis}}'', the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "city." [[Jeremiah Sullivan]], justice of the [[Indiana Supreme Court]], is credited with coining the name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judge Jeremiah Sullivan House|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/madison/judge_jeremiah_sullivan_house.html|publisher=National Park Service (U.S. Dept. of the Interior)|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref> Other names considered were Concord, Suwarrow, and [[Tecumseh]].<ref>A plaque at the City-County Building commissioned by the Society of Indiana Pioneers in 1962 lists these as considered names: "IN AN ACT OF JANUARY 6, 1821, THE INDIANA GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THEN MEETING AT CORYDON, NAMED THE NEW CAPITAL OF THE STATE 'INDIANAPOLIS'. JEREMIAH SULLIVAN, LATER AN EMINENT HOOSIER JURIST, ACTING IN COOPERATION WITH SAMUEL MERRILL AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF GOVERNOR JONATHAN JENNINGS, PROPOSED INDIANAPOLIS AS THE NAME WHICH WAS CHOSEN IN PREFERENCE TO TECUMSEH, SUWARROW, AND CONCORD."</ref>

The availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers were [[Protestants]], a large proportion of the early [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Germans|German]] immigrants were [[Catholics]]. Few [[African American]]s lived in central Indiana before 1840.<ref>Baer, p. 10 and 58.</ref> The first [[European American]]s to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe [[George Pogue]] and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called [[Pogue's Run]]. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that [[John Wesley McCormick]], his family, and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] in February 1820.<ref>Brown, p. 2; ''Centennial History of Indianapolis'', p. 6; and Hale, p. 8.</ref>

On January 11, 1820, the [[Indiana General Assembly]] authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital.<ref>Hale, p. 9.</ref> The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821.<ref name="founding"/> In April, [[Alexander Ralston]] and [[Elias Pym Fordham]] were appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement.<ref>Hyman, p. 10, and {{cite journal|author=William A.

A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. [[Samuel Henderson (Indianapolis mayor)|Samuel Henderson]], the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded.<ref>Brown, pp. 8, 46 and 49; ''Centennial History of Indianapolis'', p. 30; Esarey, v. 3, pp. 42–43 and 201–2; and {{cite book|author=David J.
