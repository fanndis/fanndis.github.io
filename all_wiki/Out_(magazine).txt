'''''Out''''' is an American [[LGBTQ]]  news, fashion, entertainment, and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] magazine, with the highest circulation of any LGBTQ monthly publication in the United States. It presents itself in an editorial manner similar to ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[GQ]]''. ''Out'' was owned by Robert Hardman of Boston, its original investor, until 2000, when he sold it to [[LPI Media]], which was later acquired by [[PlanetOut Inc.]] In 2008, PlanetOut Inc. sold [[LPI Media]] to Regent Entertainment Media, Inc., a division of [[Here Media]], which also owns [[Here TV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Planetout Inc · 8-K · For 8/13/08|publisher=Fran Finnegan & Company|date=August 13, 2008|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dsvrp.tEX1.htm|access-date=February 3, 2009}}</ref><ref name="sass">{{Cite journal  |last=Sass  |first=Erik  |title=PlanetOut Is Out Of Publishing (And $26 Million)  |journal=MediaDailyNews  |date=2008-04-14  |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=80435  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609070729/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=80435  |archive-date=2009-06-09  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author= Matthew Bajko|title=PlanetOut to sell off magazines|newspaper=Bay Area Reporter|date=April 10, 2008|url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=2894}}</ref> In 2017, Here Media sold its magazine operations to a group led by Oreva Capital, who renamed the parent company Pride Media.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Staff|first=Reuters|date=2017-09-07|title=Publisher of High Times acquires LGBT publications|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oreva-lgbt-idUSKCN1BI1QW|access-date=2020-10-04}}</ref>

==History==
''Out'' was founded by [[Michael Goff]] in 1992<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sandra L. Caron|title=An investigation of content and media images in gay men's magazines|journal=Journal of Homosexuality |date=February 2008 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23555244 |access-date=August 13, 2015|doi=10.1080/00918360802345297|volume=55|issue=3|pages=504–523|pmid=19042283|s2cid=205468927}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Magazines in Alphabetical Order|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_womens_magazines|work=Radcliffe Institute|access-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref> as editor in chief and president. The executive editor was Sarah Pettit (since deceased). In 1996, owner Robert Hardman fired Goff and hired Henry E. (Hank) Scott, a former New York Times Co. executive, as president of Out Publishing Inc., with the charge to rescue the financially troubled magazine company. When Scott joined ''Out'', the company had annual revenues of less than $4 million and expenses of $7 million. Scott changed ''Out''{{'s}} LGBT focus, arguing that gay men and lesbians had little in common other than political and legal issues. He fired Pettit and hired James Collard, editor of ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', a gay magazine published in the U.K., to refocus ''Out'' on an affluent and style-conscious gay male audience. Audited circulation grew by 67 percent to over 130,000 and the household income of the average ''Out'' reader, as measured by MRI, grew from $70,000 a year to $90,000 a year. With the help of Lou Fabrizio, a senior advertising executive whom Scott hired from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Out'' began attracting major fashion advertisers and brands such as [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]], which previously had not advertised in gay publications. Three years after Scott took control of ''Out'', it had tripled its revenue and become the largest-circulation gay magazine in U.S. history.  Those changes positioned the publication for a sale by Hardman to LPI Media in 2000.

In 2001 the circulation was 100,000. By 2006, when the magazine was acquired by PlanetOut, ''Out''{{'s}} circulation had reached 130,000. ''Out'' attracted international attention when it published its debut Power Issue in May 2007, with a cover that featured two models wearing masks of journalist [[Anderson Cooper]] and the actor [[Jodie Foster]] above the cover line, "The Glass Closet". Some lesbians have criticized ''Out'' for primarily focusing on gay men. A writer for the website ''After Ellen'' noted that in 2008, no lesbians were featured on the magazine's cover, and that only 22% of the persons featured in the 'Out 100' were lesbians.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dorothy Snarker|title=An open letter to ''Out'' magazine|work=AfterEllen.com|publisher=Logo Online|date=November 13, 2008|url=http://www.afterellen.com/blog/dorothysnarker/an-open-letter-to-out-magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421170211/http://www.afterellen.com/blog/dorothysnarker/an-open-letter-to-out-magazine|archive-date=April 21, 2010|access-date=February 3, 2009}}</ref>

In 2008, ''Out'', along with its sister publication ''The Advocate'', was purchased by Here Media Inc. Since acquiring the brand, Here Media has expanded the magazine's web presence, OUT.com, and added a mobile application.

On April 18, 2012, it was announced that a newly formed company, Grand Editorial, would oversee the editorial content of ''Out'' as a contractor for Here Media. ''Out'' editor-in-chief Aaron Hicklin founded Grand. Although the in-house editorial department was eliminated, Hicklin said that he would hire most of the editorial staff back as contracted freelancers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2012/04/5727847/out-lays-its-entire-editorial-staff-editor-aaron-hicklin-wants-hire-mo|title='Out' lays off its entire editorial staff, but editor Aaron Hicklin wants to hire 'most' back into his new startup|access-date=April 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417070101/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2012/04/5727847/out-lays-its-entire-editorial-staff-editor-aaron-hicklin-wants-hire-mo|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2013, Here Media and ''Out'' hosted the 19th annual OUT100 event in New York City at Terminal 5. The annual event celebrates the compelling people who have had a hand in moving forward LGBT rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/backbeat/5793248/backbeat-byte-mariah-carey-debbie-harry-at-19th-annual-out-100-awards|title=Backbeat Byte: Mariah Carey, Debbie Harry at 19th Annual Out 100 Awards}}</ref> ''Out'' introduced a Reader's Choice Award in 2013 in addition to its editorially curated list of the top 100 honorees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://echelonmagazine.com/celebrates-19th-annual-out100-presented-buick/|title=Out Celebrates the 19th Annual Out100 Presented by Buick|access-date=January 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810125052/http://echelonmagazine.com/celebrates-19th-annual-out100-presented-buick|archive-date=August 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2017, Here Media sold its magazine operations to a group led by Oreva Capital, who renamed the parent company Pride Media.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Publisher of High Times acquires LGBT publications| work = Reuters| access-date = 2020-04-04| date = 2017-09-07| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oreva-lgbt-idUSKCN1BI1QW}}</ref>

On August 2, 2018, Hicklin announced that he would be stepping down after 12 years as editor-in-chief. R. Kurt Osenlund, the magazine's managing editor since March 2014, assumed the role of executive editor and acting editor-in-chief for one issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8476695/robyn-out-magazine-cover-photo|title=Robyn Shines Bright on the Cover of 'Out' Magazine: See the Pic}}</ref>

On August 23, 2018, [[Phillip Picardi]] was announced as the next editor-in-chief.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fashionista.com/2018/08/phillip-picardi-out-editor-in-chief|title=Phillip Picardi Leaves Condé Nast for 'Out'|work=Fashionista|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}</ref> Despite editorial changes, the parent company and magazine were still rife with financial issues and frequent complaints from freelancers and contract employees.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hays |first1=Kali |title=''Out'' Magazine, Pride Media Rife With Challenges for New Editor |url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/out-magazine-pride-media-challenges-new-editor-phillip-picardi-1202884718/ |access-date=October 18, 2018 |work=[[Women's Wear Daily]]}}</ref> Picardi left ''Out'' in December 2019, announcing his abrupt departure via Twitter.<ref name="lablade-11dec2019">{{cite news |last1=Levesque |first1=Brody |title=Advocate and Out Magazine Editors-In-Chief depart amid turmoil |url=https://www.losangelesblade.com/2019/12/11/advocate-and-out-magazine-editors-in-chief-depart-amid-turmoil/ |access-date=December 11, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Blade |date=December 11, 2019}}</ref>

===Non-payment controversy===

In February 2019, ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' (''WWD'') reported that more than forty contributors wrote an open letter to Pride Media and Oreva Capital, its operating entity, as well as its former editorial management partners Grand Editorial and McCarthy LLC, demanding payment for past work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/unpaid-out-magazine-contributors-letter-out-layoffs-1203006401/|title=Unpaid ''Out'' Magazine Contributors Demanding Payment Amid Fresh Layoffs|first1=Kali|last1=Hays|work=Women's Wear Daily

=== Other controversies ===
In 2018, it was reported that Adam Levin, the owner of Oreva Capital, the parent company of Pride Media, had a history of donating to Republican politicians who have publicly taken anti-LGTBQ stances, including [[Devin Nunes]], [[Dean Heller]], [[Josh Mandel]], and [[Dana Rohrabacher]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Villarreal|first=Daniel|date=2018-10-29|title=Pride Media owner with long history of funding antigay politicians promises he won't do it anymore|url=https://www.queerty.com/pride-media-owner-long-history-funding-antigay-politicians-promises-wont-anymore-20181029|access-date=2020-10-04|website=Queerty}}</ref> Dana Rohrabacher has said that gay people should be denied the right to buy a home and has consistently opposed legal advancements for the LGTBQ community.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-30|title=Owner of queer publications The Advocate and Out breaks pledge to stop donating to anti-LGBT+ Republicans|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/30/anti-lgbt-republicans-adam-levin-donation-advocate-out-thom-tillis-steve-daines/|access-date=2020-10-04|website=PinkNews - Gay news, reviews and comment from the world's most read lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans news service|language=en-GB}}</ref>
