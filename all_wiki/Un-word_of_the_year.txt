The '''Un-word of the year''' or '''Inappropriate word of the year''' ({{lang-de|Unwort des Jahres}}) refers to an annual action, in which a German linguists' panel chooses one new or recently popularized term that violates human rights or infringes upon Democratic principles. The term may be one that discriminates against societal groups or may be [[Euphemism|euphemistic]], disguising or misleading.<ref name=merk/> The term is usually, but not always a [[German language|German]] term. The term is chosen from suggestions sent in by the public. The choice of the word does not depend on how many times it was suggested/ sent in, but reflects the judgement of the panel. The core of the panel consists of 4 linguists and one journalist. The un-word of the previous year is announced annually in January.<ref name=merk>{{cite news|title=Wird Pegida das "Unwort des Jahres"?|url=http://www.merkur-online.de/politik/begriff-pegida-vorschlagsliste-unwort-jahres-zr-4595014.html|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=Muenchner Merkur|date=1 January 2015}}</ref>

The linguistic action was started in 1994 by the linguist [[Horst Dieter Schlosser]]. The yearly publication of the "un-words of the year" is today widely reported in German media and very popular among Germans. In 2007, the president of the [[PEN Centre Germany|German PEN association]], [[Johano Strasser]], criticized the votings as being "themselves a symptom of the language neglect that it pretends to be able to heal" and having the quality of [[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]].<ref name="Eltern">{{cite web|title=Unwort des Jahres beleidigt viele Eltern|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article1555921/Unwort-des-Jahres-beleidigt-viele-Eltern.html|publisher=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=15 January 2008}}</ref>

==History==
Between 1991 and 1993, the un-word was announced by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'', alongside the [[Word of the year (Germany)|Word of the Year]]. In 1994, following a row with the then German government led by [[Helmut Kohl]], the jury led by linguist [[Horst Dieter Schlosser]] decided to become independent of any state-funded institution.<ref>[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/ Official website of the linguistic jury responsible for the naming of the un-word of the year (in German)]</ref><ref>[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l0/l0/F.html#featuredEntry [[Spiegel Online]]: ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''

"prosperity waste" || Deprecatory term coined by [[Helmut Maucher]] (then [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of [[Nestlé]]) during an interview, referring to people who are either presumed unable or reluctant to find employment, who in his opinion would exist because of the highly developed [[welfare]] and [[social support]] systems in Germany.

"Me, Inc."|| One of the measures of the controversial [[Hartz concept]] (a reform of the German labor market), which allows for unemployed people to be registered as self-employed and thus eligible for public support for a start-up business.

"voluntary emigration" || A term used in the context of rejected [[Refugee#Asylum seekers|asylum seekers]] who opt for leaving Germany on their own terms rather than being formally deported.

"stove bonus" || Its origin being unknown, the term was ironically used by opponents of the conservative [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] government's proposal for the introduction of a special allowance for families in which the small children are educated at home instead of sending them to a [[kindergarten]] or similar pre-school institution, alluding to the presumed old-fashioned [[gender role]] of a mother fully dedicated to the raising of her children. Critics argued it defames ''any'' parents who keep their children at home, irrespective of their actual motives.<ref name="Eltern"/>

"contaminated by works councils" || This offensive [[neologism]] (reportedly used internally by the ''[[Bauhaus (company)|Bauhaus]]'' management) describes a business with a strong [[works council]], which takes care of the interests of the employees and thus presses for concessions on the employer's side.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiefpunkt in einem Baumarkt|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/sprachmuell-2009-betriebsratsverseucht-ist-unwort-des-jahres-a-672674.html|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=17 May 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, it was revealed that, in fact, all murders were racial [[hate crimes]] committed by members of a previously unknown terrorist group called ''[[National Socialist Underground]]'', which resulted in widespread criticism of the police for their initial determination.<ref>{{cite web|title='Kebab-Murders' called 'worst word of 2011'|url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20120117-40165.html|publisher=[[The Local]]|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>

| "anti-[[deportation]] industry"
| A term coined by [[Alexander Dobrindt]] in May 2018. 
According to the jury, this term insinuates that people who provide legal assistance to rejected asylum seekers want to make money on a large scale from defending even criminal applicants for asylum. 
Moreover, this expression suggests that this kind of help "produces" new asylum seekers.

| "[[climate change|climate (change)]] hysteria"
| The word "climate (change) hysteria" defames climate protection efforts and the climate protection movement, and discredits important discussions about [[climate protection]]. The expression was used by many in politics, economics, and the media in 2019 - by the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] as well as by entrepreneurs and especially by politicians of the [[Alternative for Germany]] party. It dismisses the increased commitment to climate protection as some kind of [[Mass hysteria|collective psychosis]]. Moreover, in light of scientific findings regarding climate change, this word is misleading and irresponsibly supports [[Antiscience|anti-scientific]] tendencies. The term was sent in (to the jury) 9 times.<ref>Translated from {{Cite web|title = Pressemitteilung: Wahl des 29. „Unworts des Jahres“ |url = http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/Pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung_unwort2019.pdf|publisher=[[Technische Universität Darmstadt]]|access-date = 2020-01-15|language = de}}</ref>
