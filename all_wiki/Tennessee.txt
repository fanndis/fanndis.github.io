The state of Tennessee is rooted in the [[Watauga Association]], a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians.<ref>John Finger, ''Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 46–47.</ref> What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later part of the [[Southwest Territory]]. Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. Tennessee was the last state to leave the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861. Occupied by Union forces from 1862, it was the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war.<ref name=guide>{{cite web |url=http://www.usm.edu/armyrotc/Shiloh%20Staff%20Ride/TN%20Civil%20War%20Heritage%20Trail.pdf |title=Tennessee's Civil War Heritage Trail |publisher=The University of Southern Mississippi |access-date=November 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326035703/http://www.usm.edu/armyrotc/Shiloh%20Staff%20Ride/TN%20Civil%20War%20Heritage%20Trail.pdf |archive-date=March 26, 2010}}</ref>

Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state besides Virginia, and more soldiers for the Union Army than the rest of the Confederacy combined.<ref name=guide /> Beginning during Reconstruction, it had competitive party politics, but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting. This reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century,<ref name="tnencycl-disfranchising" /> although unlike in the Deep South, Tennessee Republicans always expected at least a third of the vote in statewide elections via East Tennessee and Highland Rim [[Southern Unionist|Unionists]].<ref>[[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Phillips, Kevin P.]]; ''The Emerging Republican Majority'', pp. 210, 242 {{ISBN|978-0-691-16324-6}}</ref> In the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy, aided by massive federal investment in the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and, in the early 1940s, the city of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. This city was established just outside of Knoxville to house the [[Manhattan Project]]'s uranium enrichment facilities, helping to build the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|world's first atomic bombs]], two of which were dropped on [[Imperial Japan]] near the end of [[World War II]]. After the war, the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] became and remains a key center for scientific research. In 2016, the element [[tennessine]] was named for the state, largely in recognition of the roles played by Oak Ridge, [[Vanderbilt University]], and the [[University of Tennessee]] in the element’s discovery.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://iupac.org/iupac-announces-the-names-of-the-elements-113-115-117-and-118/ |title=IUPAC Announces the Names of the Elements 113, 115, 117, and 118 |publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry |date=November 30, 2016 |access-date=July 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923084225/http://iupac.org/iupac-announces-the-names-of-the-elements-113-115-117-and-118/ |archive-date=September 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:Tanasi-monument-cherokee-tennessee.jpg|thumb|right|Monument near the old site of Tanasi in Monroe County]]

The earliest variant of the name that became ''Tennessee'' was recorded by Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]], the Spanish explorer, when he and his men passed through an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] village named "Tanasqui" in 1567 while traveling inland from [[South Carolina]]. In the early 18th century, British traders encountered a Cherokee town named [[Tanasi]] (or "Tanase") in present-day [[Monroe County, Tennessee]]. The town was located on a river of the same name (now known as the [[Little Tennessee River]]), and appears on maps as early as 1725. It is not known whether this was the same town as the one encountered by Juan Pardo, although recent research suggests that Pardo's "Tanasqui" was located at the confluence of the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee–North Carolina)|Pigeon River]] and the [[French Broad River]], near modern [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]].<ref>Charles Hudson, ''The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566–1568'' (Tuscaloosa, Ala.: University of Alabama Press, 2005), 36–40.</ref>

The meaning and origin of the word are uncertain. Some accounts suggest it is a [[Cherokee]] modification of an earlier [[Yuchi]] word. It has been said to mean "meeting place", "winding river", or "river of the great bend".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.tn.us/sos/statelib/pubsvs/faq.htm#01 |title=Tennessee State Library and Archives FAQ |publisher=Web.archive.org |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023191026/http://www.state.tn.us/sos/statelib/pubsvs/faq.htm#01 |archive-date=October 23, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tngenweb.org/campbell/hist-bogan/tennessee.html |title=Tennessee's Name Dates Back To 1567 Spanish Explorer Captain Juan Pardo |publisher=Tngenweb.org |date=January 1, 2005 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103222507/http://www.tngenweb.org/campbell/hist-bogan/tennessee.html |archive-date=January 3, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to [[ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], the name "can not be analyzed" and its meaning is lost.<ref>Mooney, pg. 534</ref>

The modern spelling, ''Tennessee'', is attributed to [[James Glen]], the governor of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s. The spelling was popularized by the publication of [[Henry Timberlake]]'s "[[:File:Draught of the Cherokee Country.jpg|Draught of the Cherokee Country]]" in 1765. In 1788, North Carolina created "[[Tennessee County, Tennessee|Tennessee County]]", the third county to be established in what is now [[Middle Tennessee]]. (Tennessee County was the predecessor to present-day [[Montgomery County, Tennessee|Montgomery]] and [[Robertson County, Tennessee|Robertson]] counties.) When a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the [[Southwest Territory]], it adopted "Tennessee" as the name of the state.

===Nickname===
Tennessee is known as '''The Volunteer State''', a nickname some claimed was earned during the [[War of 1812]] because of the prominent role played by volunteer soldiers from Tennessee, especially during the [[Battle of New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.tn.us/TSLA/history/military/tn1812.htm |title=Brief History of Tennessee in the War of 1812 |publisher=Tennessee State Library and Archives |access-date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |quote=At the Battle of the Alamo in 1836, of the 236 defenders killed and whose birthplace was recorded, Tennessee Volunteers constituted the majority of men who traveled from outside of Texas to fight and die at the Alamo.<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alamo_defenders#cite_ref-todish88_206-1> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427081440/http://www.state.tn.us/TSLA/history/military/tn1812.htm |archive-date=April 27, 2006}}</ref> Other sources differ on the origin of the state nickname; according to ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/te/Tenn.html#17 |title=Tennessee, state, United States |work=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |year=2007 |orig-year=2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706170436/http://www.bartleby.com/65/te/Tenn.html#17 |archive-date=July 6, 2008}}</ref> the name refers to volunteers for the [[Mexican–American War]] from 1846 to 1848. This explanation is more likely, because [[James K. Polk|President Polk's]] call for 2,600 nationwide volunteers at the beginning of the [[Mexican–American War]] resulted in 30,000 volunteers from Tennessee alone, largely in response to the death of [[Davy Crockett]] and appeals by former Tennessee Governor and then Texas politician, [[Sam Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennesseehistory.com/archive/volpg.html |title=Why the Volunteer State |publisher=Tennessee Online History Magazine |access-date=April 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413134345/http://tennesseehistory.com/archive/volpg.html |archive-date=April 13, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{See also|List of counties in Tennessee|Geology of Tennessee}}

Tennessee borders eight other states: [[Kentucky]] and [[Virginia]] to the north; [[North Carolina]] to the east; [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]] on the south; [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]] on the [[Mississippi River]] to the west. Tennessee is tied with Missouri as the state bordering the most other states. The state is trisected by the [[Tennessee River]].

The highest point in the state is [[Clingmans Dome]] at {{convert|6643|ft|m}}.<ref name="usgs">{{cite web |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |date=April 29, 2005 |access-date=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116113632/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |archive-date=January 16, 2008}}</ref> Clingmans Dome, which lies on Tennessee's eastern border, is the highest point on the [[Appalachian Trail]], and is the third highest peak in the United States east of the Mississippi River. The state line between Tennessee and North Carolina crosses the summit. The state's lowest point is the Mississippi River at the Mississippi state line: {{convert|178|ft|m}}. The geographical center of the state is located in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]].

The state of Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically, and legally divided into three [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]: [[East Tennessee]], [[Middle Tennessee]], and [[West Tennessee]]. The state [[Tennessee Constitution|constitution]] allows no more than two justices of the five-member [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] to be from one Grand Division and a similar rule applies to certain commissions and boards.

Tennessee features six principal physiographic regions: the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]], the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Appalachian Ridge and Valley]] Region, the [[Cumberland Plateau]], the [[Highland Rim]], the [[Nashville Basin]], and the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]. Tennessee is home to the most caves in the United States, with more than ten thousand documented.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/tennessee/placesweprotect/tennessee-caves.xml|title=Tennessee Caves|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|access-date=March 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105021/http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/tennessee/placesweprotect/tennessee-caves.xml|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===East Tennessee===
{{Main|East Tennessee}}

The Blue Ridge area lies on the eastern edge of Tennessee, which borders North Carolina. This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the western Blue Ridge Mountains, which are subdivided into several subranges, namely the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], the [[Bald Mountains]], the [[Unicoi Mountains]], the [[Unaka Range|Unaka Mountains]] and [[Roan Highlands]], and the [[Iron Mountains]].

The average elevation of the Blue Ridge area is {{convert|5000|ft|m}} above sea level. [[Clingmans Dome]], the state's highest point, is located in this region. The Blue Ridge area was never more than sparsely populated, and today much of it is protected by the [[Cherokee National Forest]], the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], and several federal wilderness areas and state parks.
[[File:Greene-county-bald-mtns-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bald Mountains]]]]

Stretching west from the Blue Ridge for approximately {{convert|55|mi|km}} is the Ridge and Valley region, in which numerous tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the [[Tennessee Valley]]. This area of Tennessee is covered by fertile valleys separated by wooded ridges, such as [[Bays Mountain]] and [[Clinch Mountain]]. The western section of the Tennessee Valley, where the depressions become broader and the ridges become lower, is called the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Great Valley]]. In this valley are numerous towns and two of the region's three urban areas, [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], the third largest city in the state, and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], the fourth largest city in the state. The third urban area, the [[Tri-Cities (Tennessee)|Tri-Cities]], comprising [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], and [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]] and their environs, is located to the northeast of Knoxville.

The [[Cumberland Plateau]] rises to the west of the Tennessee Valley; this area is covered with flat-topped mountains separated by sharp valleys. The elevation of the Cumberland Plateau ranges from {{convert|1,500|to about|2,000|ft}} above sea level.

East Tennessee has several important transportation links with Middle and West Tennessee, as well as the rest of the nation and the world, including several major airports and interstates. Knoxville's [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] (TYS) and Chattanooga's [[Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport]] (CHA), as well as the Tri-Cities' [[Tri-Cities Regional Airport]] (TRI), provide air service to numerous destinations. [[Interstate 24 (Tennessee)|I-24]], [[Interstate 81 (Tennessee)|I-81]], [[Interstate 40 (Tennessee)|I-40]], [[Interstate 75 (Tennessee)|I-75]], and [[Interstate 26 (Tennessee)|I-26]] along with numerous state highways and other important roads, traverse the Grand Division and connect Chattanooga, Knoxville, and the Tri-Cities, along with other cities and towns such as [[Cleveland, Tennessee|Cleveland]], [[Athens, Tennessee|Athens]], and [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]].

===Middle Tennessee===
{{Main|Middle Tennessee}}

West of the Cumberland Plateau is the [[Highland Rim]], an elevated plain that surrounds the [[Nashville Basin]]. The northern section of the Highland Rim, known for its high [[tobacco]] production, is sometimes called the [[Pennyroyal Plateau]]; it is located primarily in Southwestern Kentucky. The Nashville Basin is characterized by rich, fertile farm country and great diversity of natural wildlife.

Middle Tennessee was a common destination of settlers crossing the Appalachians from Virginia in the late 18th century and early 19th century. An important trading route called the [[Natchez Trace]], created and used for many generations by American Indians, connected Middle Tennessee to the lower [[Mississippi River]] town of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]. The route of the Natchez Trace was used as the basis for a scenic highway called the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]].

Some of the last remaining large [[American chestnut]] trees grow in this region. They are being used to help breed [[blight]]-resistant trees.

Middle Tennessee is one of the primary state population and transportation centers along with the heart of state government. Nashville (the capital), [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]], and [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]] are its largest cities.<!--Half the U.S. population is within {{convert|600|mi|km}} of Nashville.--><!--hiding B.S., ref notwithstanding--><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sociology/VDOS_Nashville.shtml |title=What's Happening in Nashville |publisher=Vanderbilt.edu |access-date=August 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118201839/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/sociology/VDOS_Nashville.shtml |archive-date=January 18, 2008}}</ref> Interstates 24, 40, 65, and 840 service the Division, with the first three meeting in Nashville.

===West Tennessee===
{{Main|West Tennessee}}

West of the Highland Rim and Nashville Basin is the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]], which includes the [[Mississippi embayment]]. The Gulf Coastal Plain is, in terms of area, the predominant land region in Tennessee. It is part of the large geographic land area that begins at the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and extends north into southern [[Illinois]]. In Tennessee, the Gulf Coastal Plain is divided into three sections that extend from the [[Tennessee River]] in the east to the [[Mississippi River]] in the west.

The easternmost section, about {{convert|10|mi|km}} in width, consists of hilly land that runs along the western bank of the Tennessee River. To the west of this narrow strip of land is a wide area of rolling hills and streams that stretches all the way to the Mississippi River; this area is called the Tennessee Bottoms or bottom land. In Memphis, the Tennessee Bottoms end in steep bluffs overlooking the river. To the west of the Tennessee Bottoms is the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]], less than {{convert|300|ft|m}} above sea level. This area of lowlands, flood plains, and swamp land is sometimes referred to as [[Mississippi Delta|the Delta]] region. Memphis is the economic center of West Tennessee.

Most of West Tennessee remained Indian land until the [[Jackson Purchase (U.S. historical region)|Chickasaw Cession of 1818]], when the [[Chickasaw]] ceded their land between the Tennessee River and the Mississippi River. The portion of the Chickasaw Cession that lies in Kentucky is known today as the [[Jackson Purchase]].

Fifty-four state parks, covering some {{convert|132,000|acre|km2}} as well as parts of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and [[Cherokee National Forest]], and [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]] are in Tennessee. Sportsmen and visitors are attracted to [[Reelfoot Lake]], originally formed by the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes]]; stumps and other remains of a once dense forest, together with the lotus bed covering the shallow waters, give the lake an eerie beauty.

===Climate===
[[File:Tennessee Köppen.svg|thumb|A map of Köppen climate types in Tennessee]]

Most of the state has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as having a [[oceanic climate|mountain temperate]] or [[humid continental climate]] due to cooler temperatures.<ref name=Climate>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pdf/kottek_et_al_2006_A1.pdf |title=World Map of Köppen−Geiger Climate Classification |format=PDF |access-date=December 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114202025/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pdf/kottek_et_al_2006_A1.pdf |archive-date=January 14, 2009}}</ref> The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is the dominant factor in the climate of Tennessee, with winds from the south being responsible for most of the state's annual precipitation. Generally, the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year, with highest average monthly precipitation generally in the winter and spring months, between December and April. The driest months, on average, are August to October. On average the state receives {{convert|50|in|cm}} of precipitation annually. Snowfall ranges from {{convert|5|in|cm}} in West Tennessee to over {{convert|80|in|cm}} in the highest mountains in East Tennessee.<ref name="Tennessee Agriculture">{{cite web |url=http://www.agclassroom.org/kids/stats/tennessee.pdf |title=A look at Tennessee Agriculture |format=PDF |publisher=Agclassroom.org |access-date=November 1, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614025708/http://www.agclassroom.org/kids/stats/tennessee.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://weather.com/safety/winter/news/snowiest-places-most-snow |title=The Snowiest Places in Each State |publisher=The Weather Channel |first=Nick |last=Wiltgen |date=October 27, 2016 |access-date=July 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604025229/https://weather.com/safety/winter/news/snowiest-places-most-snow |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Summers in the state are generally hot and humid, with most of the state averaging a high of around {{convert|90|F|C|0}} during the summer months. Winters tend to be mild to cool, increasing in coolness at higher elevations. Generally, for areas outside the highest mountains, the average overnight lows are near freezing for most of the state. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|113|F|C}} at [[Perryville, Tennessee|Perryville]] on August 9, 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-32|F|C}} at [[Mountain City, Tennessee|Mountain City]] on December 30, 1917.

While the state is far enough from the coast to avoid any direct impact from a [[hurricane]], the location of the state makes it likely to be impacted from the remnants of tropical cyclones which weaken over land and can cause significant rainfall, such as [[Tropical Storm Chris (1982)|Tropical Storm Chris in 1982]] and [[Hurricane Opal]] in 1995.{{Tropical Cyclone Rainfall in the Southeastern United States}} The state averages about fifty days of thunderstorms per year, some of which can be severe with large [[hail]] and damaging winds. [[Tornado]]es are possible throughout the state, with West and Middle Tennessee the most vulnerable. Occasionally, strong or violent tornadoes occur, such as the devastating [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 2011 tornadoes]] that killed twenty people in North Georgia and Southeast Tennessee.<ref name="Thunderstorm Hazard">{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/tstmhazards.htm |title=US Thunderstorm distribution |publisher=src.noaa.gov |access-date=November 1, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015060809/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/tstmhazards.htm<!--Bot retrieved archive--> |archive-date=October 15, 2006}}</ref> On average, the state has 15 tornadoes per year.<ref name="Annual Average Number of Tornadoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=Mean Annual Average Number of Tornadoes 1953–2004 |publisher=ncdc.noaa.gov |access-date=November 1, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tornadoes in Tennessee can be severe, and Tennessee leads the nation in the percentage of total tornadoes which have fatalities.<ref name="Tornado Top 10 Lists">{{cite web |url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/toptens/topten1.htm |title=Top ten list |publisher=tornadoproject.com |access-date=November 1, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204033709/http://www.tornadoproject.com/toptens/topten1.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2012}}</ref> Winter storms are an occasional problem, such as the infamous [[Blizzard of 1993]], although [[ice storm]]s are a more likely occurrence.

[[File:Ftloudouninterior.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudon]], the first British settlement in Tennessee]]

The area now known as Tennessee was first inhabited by [[Paleo-Indians]] nearly 12,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/index.shtml |title=Archaeology & the Native Peoples of Tennessee |publisher=The University of Tennessee Knoxville |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702205050/http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/index.shtml |archive-date=July 2, 2012}}</ref> The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area between first settlement and the time of European contact are unknown, but several distinct cultural phases have been named by archaeologists, including [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] (8000–1000 BC), [[Woodland period|Woodland]] (1000 BC{{snd}}1000 AD), and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] (1000–1600 AD), whose chiefdoms were the cultural predecessors of the [[Creek people|Muscogee people]] who inhabited the Tennessee River Valley before Cherokee migration into the river's headwaters.

The first recorded European excursions into what is now called Tennessee were three expeditions led by [[Conquistador|Spanish explorers]], namely [[Hernando de Soto]] in 1540, [[Tristán de Luna y Arellano|Tristan de Luna]] in 1559, and [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] in 1567. Pardo recorded the name "Tanasqui" from a local Indian village, which evolved to the state's current name. At that time, Tennessee was inhabited by tribes of [[Creek people|Muscogee]] and [[Yuchi]] people. Possibly because of European diseases devastating the Indian tribes, which would have left a population vacuum, and also from expanding European settlement in the north, the [[Cherokee]] moved south from the area now called Virginia. As European colonists spread into the area, the Indian populations were forcibly displaced to the south and west, including all Muscogee and Yuchi peoples, the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]], and ultimately, the [[Cherokee]] in [[Cherokee removal|1838]].

The first British settlement in what is now Tennessee was built in 1756 by settlers from the [[colony of South Carolina]] at [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]], near present-day [[Vonore, Tennessee|Vonore]]. Fort Loudoun became the westernmost British outpost to that date. The fort was designed by [[John William Gerard de Brahm]] and constructed by forces under British Captain Raymond Demeré. After its completion, Captain Raymond Demeré relinquished command on August 14, 1757, to his brother, Captain Paul Demeré. Hostilities erupted between the British and the neighboring [[Overhill Cherokee]]s, and a siege of Fort Loudoun ended with its surrender on August 7, 1760. The following morning, Captain Paul Demeré and a number of his men were killed in an ambush nearby, and most of the rest of the garrison was taken prisoner.<ref>Stanley Folmsbee, Robert Corlew, and Enoch Mitchell, ''Tennessee: A Short History'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), p. 45.</ref>

In the 1760s, [[Longhunter|long hunters]] from Virginia explored much of East and Middle Tennessee, and the first permanent European settlers began arriving late in the decade. The majority of 18th century settlers were English or of primarily [[English-American|English descent]] but nearly 20% of them were also [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]].<ref>Robert E. Corlew, ''Tennessee: A Short History'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1981), page 106</ref> These settlers formed the [[Watauga Association]], a community built on lands leased from the [[Cherokee]] peoples.

During the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]], Fort Watauga at [[Sycamore Shoals]] (in present-day [[Elizabethton, Tennessee|Elizabethton]]) was attacked (1776) by [[Dragging Canoe]] and his warring faction of Cherokee who were aligned with the British Loyalists. These renegade Cherokee were referred to by settlers as the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]]. They opposed North Carolina's annexation of the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] and the concurrent settling of the [[Transylvania (colony)|Transylvania Colony]] further north and west. The lives of many settlers were spared from the initial warrior attacks through the warnings of Dragging Canoe's cousin, [[Nancy Ward]]. The frontier fort on the banks of the [[Watauga River]] later served as a 1780 staging area for the [[Overmountain Men]] in preparation to trek over the [[Appalachian Mountains]], to engage, and to later defeat the British Army at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] in [[South Carolina]].

Three counties of the Washington District (now part of Tennessee) broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the [[State of Franklin]]. Efforts to obtain admission to the [[Perpetual Union|Union]] failed, and the counties (now numbering eight) had re-joined North Carolina by 1789. North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized into the [[Southwest Territory]]. In an effort to encourage settlers to move west into the new territory, in 1787 the mother state of North Carolina ordered a road to be cut to take settlers into the Cumberland Settlements—from the south end of [[Clinch Mountain]] (in East Tennessee) to French Lick (Nashville). The Trace was called the "North Carolina Road" or "[[Avery's Trace]]", and sometimes "The Wilderness Road" (although it should not be confused with [[Daniel Boone]]'s "[[Wilderness Road State Park|Wilderness Road]]" through the [[Cumberland Gap]]).

===Statehood and increasing settlement===
{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}

Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796 as the 16th state. It was the first state created from territory under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government. Apart from the former [[Thirteen Colonies]] only [[Vermont]] and [[Kentucky]] predate Tennessee's statehood, and neither was ever a federal territory.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=Bill, Jr. |title=American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |url=https://archive.org/details/americanboundari00jrbi |url-access=limited |year=2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-35591-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanboundari00jrbi/page/n69 55]}}</ref> The Constitution of the State of Tennessee, Article I, Section 31, states that the beginning point for identifying the boundary is the extreme height of the Stone Mountain, at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it, and basically runs the extreme heights of mountain chains through the Appalachian Mountains separating North Carolina from Tennessee past the Native American towns of Cowee and Old Chota, thence along the main ridge of the said mountain (Unicoi Mountain) to the southern boundary of the state; all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line are included in the boundaries and limits of the newly formed state of Tennessee. Part of the provision also stated that the limits and jurisdiction of the state would include future land acquisition, referencing possible land trade with other states, or the acquisition of territory from west of the Mississippi River.

As more white settlers moved into Tennessee, they came into increasing conflict with Native American tribes. During the administration of [[Martin Van Buren|U.S. President Martin Van Buren]], nearly 17,000 Cherokees, along with approximately 2,000 black slaves owned by Cherokees, were uprooted from their homes between 1838 and 1839 and were forced by the U.S. military to march from "emigration depots" in Eastern Tennessee, such as [[Fort Cass]], toward the more distant [[Indian Territory]] west of Arkansas, now the state of Oklahoma.<ref>Carter (III), Samuel (1976). ''Cherokee sunset: A nation betrayed: a narrative of travail and triumph, persecution and exile''. New York: Doubleday, p. 232.</ref> During this relocation an estimated 4,000 Cherokees died along the way west.<ref name="Ronald Satz">{{cite book |last=Satz |first=Ronald |title=Tennessee's Indian Peoples |url=https://archive.org/details/tennesseesindian0000satz |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |location=[[Knoxville, Tennessee]] |isbn=978-0-87049-285-3 |year=1979}}</ref> In the [[Cherokee language]], the event is called ''Nunna daul Isunyi'',"the Trail Where We Cried". The Cherokees were not the only Native Americans forced to emigrate as a result of the [[Indian removal]] efforts of the United States, and so the phrase "[[Trail of Tears]]" is sometimes used to refer to similar events endured by other American Indian peoples, especially among the "[[Five Civilized Tribes]]". The phrase originated as a description of the earlier emigration of the [[Choctaw]] nation.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
{{Main|Ordinance of Secession|Confederate States of America|Tennessee in the American Civil War}}

In February 1861, secessionists in Tennessee's state government—led by Governor [[Isham Harris]]—sought voter approval for a convention to sever ties with the United States, but Tennessee voters rejected the referendum by a 54–46% margin. The strongest opposition to secession came from East Tennessee, which later tried to form a [[East Tennessee Convention|separate Union-aligned state]]. Following the Confederate [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack upon Fort Sumter]] in April and Lincoln's call for troops from Tennessee and other states in response, Governor Isham Harris began military mobilization, submitted an ordinance of secession to the General Assembly, and made direct overtures to the Confederate government. The Tennessee legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederate States on May 7, 1861. On June 8, 1861, with people in Middle Tennessee having significantly changed their position, voters approved a second referendum calling for secession, becoming the last state to do so. But the Union-backing [[State of Scott]] was also established at this time, and remained a ''[[de facto]]'' enclave of the United States throughout the war.

Many major battles of the [[American Civil War]] were fought in Tennessee—most of them Union victories. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and the [[U.S. Navy]] captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers in February 1862. They held off the Confederate counterattack at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] in April. Memphis fell to the Union in June, following a [[Battle of Memphis|naval battle]] on the Mississippi River in front of the city. The Capture of Memphis and Nashville gave the Union control of the western and middle sections. This control was confirmed at the [[Battle of Stones River|Battle of Murfreesboro]] in early January 1863 and by the subsequent [[Tullahoma Campaign]].
[[File:Kurz and Allison - Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Franklin]], November 30, 1864]]

Despite the strength of Unionist sentiment in East Tennessee (with the exception of [[Sullivan County, Tennessee|Sullivan County]], which was heavily pro-Confederate), Confederates held the area. The Confederates, led by General [[James Longstreet]], did attack [[Ambrose Burnside|General Burnside]]'s Fort Sanders at Knoxville and lost. It was a big blow to East Tennessee Confederate momentum, but Longstreet won the [[Battle of Bean's Station]] a few weeks later. The Confederates besieged Chattanooga during the [[Chattanooga Campaign]] in early fall 1863, but were driven off by Grant in November. Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor strategic vision of General [[Braxton Bragg]], who led the [[Army of Tennessee]] from [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville, Kentucky]], to another Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.

The last major battles came when the Confederates invaded Middle Tennessee in November 1864 and were checked at [[Battle of Franklin|Franklin]], then completely dispersed by [[George Henry Thomas|George Thomas]] at [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]] in December.  Meanwhile, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed displaced senator and native Tennessean [[Andrew Johnson]] military governor of the state.

When the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was announced, Tennessee was largely held by Union forces. Thus it was not among the states enumerated in the Proclamation, and the Proclamation did not free any [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] there. Nonetheless, enslaved African Americans escaped to Union lines to gain freedom without waiting for official action. Old and young, men, women, and children camped near Union troops. Thousands of former slaves ended up fighting on the Union side, nearly 200,000 in total across the South.

Tennessee's legislature approved an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting slavery on February 22, 1865.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm |title=Chronology of Emancipation during the Civil War |publisher=University of Maryland: Department of History |access-date=November 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011224131/http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Voters in the state approved the amendment in March.<ref name="blackhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.state.tn.us/tsla/exhibits/blackhistory/timelines/timeline_1861-1865.htm |title=This Honorable Body: African American Legislators in 19th Century Tennessee |publisher=Tennessee State Library and Archives |access-date=November 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119190405/http://www.state.tn.us/tsla/exhibits/blackhistory/timelines/timeline_1861-1865.htm |archive-date=November 19, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It also ratified the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (abolishing slavery in every state) on April 7, 1865.

In 1864, [[Andrew Johnson]], a War Democrat from Tennessee, was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln. He became President after Lincoln's assassination in 1865. Under Johnson's lenient re-admission policy, Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the U.S. Congress, on July 24, 1866. Because Tennessee had ratified the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] period.

After the formal end of Reconstruction, the struggle over power in Southern society continued. Through violence and intimidation against freedmen and their allies, White Democrats regained political power in Tennessee and other states across the South in the late 1870s and 1880s. Over the next decade, the state legislature passed increasingly restrictive laws to control African Americans. In 1889 the General Assembly passed four laws described as electoral reform, with the cumulative effect of essentially disfranchising most African Americans in rural areas and small towns, as well as many poor Whites. Legislation included implementation of a poll tax, timing of registration, and recording requirements. Tens of thousands of taxpaying citizens were without representation for decades into the 20th century.<ref name="tnencycl-disfranchising">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/disfranchising-laws/ |title=Disfranchising Laws |encyclopedia=Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture |first=Connie L. |last=Lester |date=July 3, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703163619/https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/disfranchising-laws/ |archive-date=July 3, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Disfranchising legislation accompanied [[Jim Crow laws]] passed in the late 19th century, which imposed segregation in the state.

In 1897, Tennessee celebrated its centennial of statehood (though one year late of the 1896 anniversary) with a great [[Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition (1897)|exposition]] in Nashville. A [[Parthenon (Nashville)|full-scale replica]] of the [[Parthenon]] was constructed for the celebration, located in what is now Nashville's [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]].

===20th century===
[[File:"A group of several hundred workers at Norris Dam construction camp site during noon hour." - NARA - 532734.jpg|thumb|Workers at [[Norris Dam]] construction camp site, 1933]]

On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the thirty-sixth and final state necessary to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which provided women the [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]]. Disenfranchising voter registration requirements continued to keep most African Americans and many poor whites, both men and women, off the voter rolls.

The need to create work for the unemployed during the [[Great Depression]], a desire for rural electrification, the need to control annual spring flooding and improve shipping capacity on the Tennessee River were all factors that drove the federal creation of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) in 1933. Through the power of the TVA projects, Tennessee quickly became the nation's largest public utility supplier.

During World War II, the availability of abundant TVA electrical power led the [[Manhattan Project]] to locate one of the principal sites for production and isolation of weapons-grade [[fissile]] material in East Tennessee. The [[planned community]] of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] was built from scratch to provide accommodations for the facilities and workers. These sites are now [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the [[Y-12 National Security Complex]], and the [[East Tennessee Technology Park]].

Despite recognized effects of limiting voting by poor whites, successive legislatures expanded the reach of the disfranchising laws until they covered the state. Political scientist [[V. O. Key, Jr.]] argued in 1949:
<blockquote>...{{nbsp}}the size of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] did not inhibit voting as much as the inconvenience of paying it. County officers regulated the vote by providing opportunities to pay the tax (as they did in Knoxville), or conversely by making payment as difficult as possible. Such manipulation of the tax, and therefore the vote, created an opportunity for the rise of urban bosses and [[political machine]]s. Urban politicians bought large blocks of poll tax receipts and distributed them to blacks and whites, who then voted as instructed.<ref name="tnencycl-disfranchising" /></blockquote>

In 1953 state legislators amended the state constitution, removing the poll tax. In many areas both blacks and poor whites still faced subjectively applied barriers to voter registration that did not end until after passage of national civil rights legislation, including the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref name="tnencycl-disfranchising" />

Tennessee celebrated its bicentennial in 1996. With a yearlong statewide celebration entitled "Tennessee 200", it opened a new state park ([[Bicentennial Mall State Park|Bicentennial Mall]]) at the foot of Capitol Hill in Nashville.

The state has had major disasters, such as the [[Great Train Wreck of 1918]], one of the worst train accidents in U.S. history,<ref name="Coggins2012">{{cite book |first=Allen R. |last=Coggins |title=Tennessee Tragedies: Natural, Technological, and Societal Disasters in the Volunteer State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfK6aBuqohQC&pg=PA158 |access-date=November 23, 2012 |date=January 15, 2012 |publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press |isbn=978-1-57233-829-6 |page=158 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101183229/http://books.google.com/books?id=SfK6aBuqohQC&pg=PA158 |archive-date=January 1, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the [[Sultana (steamboat)|''Sultana'']] explosion on the Mississippi River near Memphis, the deadliest maritime disaster in U.S. history.<ref name="StearnsLewis1998">{{cite book |first1=Peter N. |last1=Stearns |first2=Jan |last2=Lewis |title=An Emotional History of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ul5XPiFk4KIC&pg=PA157 |year=1998 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-8088-6 |page=157 |access-date=October 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501000232/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ul5XPiFk4KIC&pg=PA157 |archive-date=May 1, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===21st century===
In 2002, businessman [[Phil Bredesen]] was elected to become the 48th [[Governor of Tennessee|governor]] in January 2003. Also in 2002, Tennessee amended the [[Constitution of Tennessee|state constitution]] to allow for the establishment of a [[Lotteries in the United States|lottery]]. Tennessee's [[Bob Corker]] was the only freshman Republican elected to the [[United States Senate]] in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]]. The state constitution was amended to reject [[same-sex marriage]]. In January 2007, [[Ron Ramsey]] became the first Republican elected as Speaker of the [[Tennessee State Senate|State Senate]] since [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]],{{cn|date=July 2020}} as a result of the realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties in the South since the late 20th century, with Republicans now elected by conservative voters, who previously had supported Democrats.

In 2010, during the [[2010 United States elections|2010 midterm elections]], [[Bill Haslam]] was elected to succeed Bredesen, who was term-limited, to become the 49th Governor of Tennessee in January 2011. In April and May 2010, [[2010 Tennessee floods|flooding in Middle Tennessee]] devastated Nashville and other parts of [[Middle Tennessee]]. In 2011, parts of [[East Tennessee]], including [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton]] and [[Bradley County, Tennessee|Bradley]] counties, were devastated by the [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 2011 tornado outbreak]].

In [[2018 Tennessee gubernatorial election|2018]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] businessman [[Bill Lee (Tennessee politician)|Bill Lee]] was elected to succeed term-limited Haslam, and he became the 50th Governor of Tennessee.

In Nashville, the [[Vanderbilt Commodores]] are also charter members of the SEC. The [[Tennessee–Vanderbilt football rivalry]] began in 1892, having since played more than a hundred times. In June 2014, the [[Vanderbilt Commodores baseball]] team won its first men's national championship by winning the [[2014 College World Series]].

The state is home to 10 other [[NCAA Division I]] programs. Two of these participate in the top level of college football, the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]]. The [[Memphis Tigers]] are members of the [[American Athletic Conference]], and the [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders]] from Murfreesboro play in [[Conference USA]]. In addition to the Commodores, Nashville is also home to the [[Belmont Bruins]] and [[Tennessee State Tigers and Lady Tigers|Tennessee State Tigers]], both members of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] (OVC), and the [[Lipscomb Bisons]], members of the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]]. Tennessee State plays football in Division I's second level, the [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS), while Belmont and Lipscomb [[List of NCAA Division I non-football programs|do not have football teams]]. Belmont and Lipscomb have an intense rivalry in men's and women's basketball known as the [[Battle of the Boulevard]], with both schools' men's and women's teams playing two games each season against each other (a rare feature among non-conference rivalries). The OVC also includes the [[Austin Peay Governors and Lady Govs|Austin Peay Governors]] from Clarksville, the [[UT Martin Skyhawks]] from Martin, and the [[Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles]] from Cookeville. These three schools, along with fellow OVC member Tennessee State, play each season in football for the [[Sgt. York Trophy]]. The [[Chattanooga Mocs]] and Johnson City's [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers]] are full members, including football, of the [[Southern Conference]].

Tennessee is also home to [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] which features [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Cup Series]] racing two weekends a year, routinely selling out more than 160,000 seats on each date; it also was the home of the [[Nashville Superspeedway]], which held [[Xfinity Series|Nationwide]] and [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] races until it was shut down in 2012. Tennessee's only graded stakes horse race, the [[Iroquois Steeplechase]], is also held in Nashville each May.

The [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]] is a [[PGA Tour]] golf tournament held at Memphis since 1958. The [[U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships]] has been held at Memphis since 1976 (men's) and 2002 (women's).

==Transportation==
===Interstate highways===
[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]] spans the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].]]

[[Interstate 40 in Tennessee|Interstate 40]] crosses the state in an east–west orientation. Its branch interstate highways include [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]] in Memphis; [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]] in Nashville; [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|I-840]] in Nashville; [[Interstate 140 (Tennessee)|I-140]] from Knoxville to Alcoa; and [[I-640]] in Knoxville. [[Interstate 26 in Tennessee|I-26]], although technically an east–west interstate, runs from the North Carolina border below [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]] to its terminus at [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]]. [[Interstate 24 in Tennessee|I-24]] is an east–west interstate that runs from Chattanooga to Clarksville. In a north–south orientation are highways [[Interstate 55 in Tennessee|I-55]], [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], and [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]]. Interstate 65 crosses the state through Nashville, while Interstate 75 serves Chattanooga and Knoxville and Interstate 55 serves Memphis. Interstate 81 enters the state at Bristol and terminates at its junction with I-40 near [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. [[Interstate 155 (Missouri-Tennessee)|I-155]] is a branch highway from I-55. The only spur highway of I-75 in Tennessee is [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]], which is in Knoxville.<ref name=tdotmap>{{cite map|title = 2020 Official Transportation Map|year = 2020 |url = https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/state-maps/2020_Transportation_Map.pdf|publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation|access-date = June 4, 2020}}</ref> An extension of [[Interstate 69 in Tennessee|I-69]] is proposed to travel through the western part of the state, from [[South Fulton, Tennessee|South Fulton]] to Memphis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tn.gov/tdot/projects/region-4/interstate-69-corridor/interstate-69-corridor-timeline.html|title=Interstate 69 Corridor Timeline|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tn.gov/tdot|publisher=[[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]|access-date=May 8, 2020}}</ref> A branch interstate, [[Interstate 269|I-269]] also exists from [[Millington, Tennessee|Millington]] to [[Collierville, Tennessee|Collierville]].<ref name=tdotmap/>

===Airports===
Major airports within the state include [[Memphis International Airport]] (MEM), [[Nashville International Airport]] (BNA), [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] (TYS) outside of Knoxville in Blount County, [[Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport]] (CHA), [[Tri-Cities Regional Airport]] (TRI), and [[McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport]] (MKL), in Jackson. Because Memphis International Airport is the major hub for [[FedEx Corporation]], it is the [[World's busiest airport|world's largest air cargo operation]].

===Railroads===
For passenger rail service, Memphis and [[Newbern, Tennessee|Newbern]], are served by the [[Amtrak]] [[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]] line on its run between [[Chicago]], Illinois, and [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. Nashville is served by the [[Music City Star]] [[commuter rail]] service.

Cargo services in Tennessee are primarily served by [[CSX Transportation]], which has a [[hump yard]] in Nashville called Radnor Yard. [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] operates lines in East Tennessee, through cities including Knoxville and Chattanooga, and operates a [[classification yard]] near Knoxville, the John Sevier Yard. [[BNSF]] operates a major [[transport hub|intermodal facility]] in Memphis.

=={{anchor|Law_and_government}}Governance==
{{Main|Government of Tennessee}}
[[File:Tennessee State Capitol 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Tennessee State Capitol]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]]]

Similar to the United States Federal Government, Tennessee's government has three parts. The Executive Branch is led by Tennessee's governor, who holds office for a four-year term and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The governor is the only official who is elected statewide. Unlike most states, the state does not elect the [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]] directly; the Tennessee Senate elects its Speaker, who serves as lieutenant governor. The governor is supported by 22 cabinet-level departments, most headed by a commissioner who serves at the pleasure of the governor:

The Executive Branch also includes several agencies, boards and commissions, some of which are under the auspices of one of the cabinet-level departments.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.tennessee.gov/sos/bluebook/13-14/2_ExecutiveBranch.pdf |chapter=Section II: Executive Branch |title=Tennessee Blue Book, 2013–2014 |publisher=Tennessee Department of State |pages=162–393 |date=2013}}</ref>

The bicameral Legislative Branch, known as the [[Tennessee General Assembly]], consists of the 33-member [[Tennessee Senate|Senate]] and the 99-member [[Tennessee House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Senators serve four-year terms, and House members serve two-year terms. Each chamber chooses its own speaker. The speaker of the state Senate also holds the title of lieutenant governor. Constitutional officials in the legislative branch are elected by a joint session of the legislature.

The highest court in Tennessee is the [[Tennessee Supreme Court|state Supreme Court]]. It has a [[List of justices of the Tennessee Supreme Court|chief justice and four associate justices]]. No more than two justices can be from the same Grand Division. The Supreme Court of Tennessee also appoints the [[Tennessee Attorney General|Attorney General]], a practice not found in any of the other 49 states. Both the [[Tennessee Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] and the [[Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals|Court of Criminal Appeals]] have 12 judges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/geninfo/Bio/CrimAppeals/Biocca.htm |title=Court of Criminal Appeals |publisher=Tsc.state.tn.us |access-date=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731015238/http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/geninfo/Bio/CrimAppeals/Biocca.htm |archive-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> A number of [[Courts of Tennessee|local, circuit, and federal courts]] provide judicial services.

[[Constitution of Tennessee|Tennessee's current state constitution]] was adopted in 1870. The state had two earlier constitutions. The first was adopted in 1796, the year Tennessee joined the union, and the second was adopted in 1834. The 1870 Constitution outlaws [[Martial law#United States of America|martial law]] within its jurisdiction. This may be a result of the experience of Tennessee residents and other Southerners during the period of [[American Civil War#Reconstruction|military control]] by Union (Northern) forces of the U.S. government after the [[American Civil War]].

Tennessee politics, like that of most U.S. states, are dominated by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties. Historian Dewey W. Grantham traces divisions in the state to the period of the American Civil War; for decades afterward, the eastern third of the state was heavily Republican and the western two thirds mostly voted Democratic.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/dewey-w-grantham/ |title=Dewey W. Grantham |encyclopedia=Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture |first=Shaun A. |last=Martin |date=October 8, 2017 |access-date=July 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703164632/https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/dewey-w-grantham/ |archive-date=July 3, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> This division was related to the state's pattern of farming, plantations and slaveholding. The eastern section was made up of yeoman farmers, but Middle and West Tennessee farmers cultivated crops such as tobacco and cotton which were dependent on the use of slave labor. These areas became defined as Democratic after the war.

During Reconstruction, freedmen and former free people of color were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party. Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics, but in the 1880s, the white-dominated state government passed four laws, the last of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] most African Americans, and their power in state and local politics was markedly reduced. In 1900 African Americans comprised 23.8 percent of the state's population, concentrated in Middle and West Tennessee.<ref name="1900Federal" /> In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved a form of [[city commission government|commission government]] for cities based on [[at-large voting]] for a few positions on a Board of Commission; several cities adopted this as another means to limit African-American political participation. In 1913 the state legislature enacted a bill enabling cities to adopt this structure without legislative approval.<ref name="buch">{{cite court |litigants=Buchanan v. City of Jackson, Tenn. |vol=683 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1515 |pinpoint= |court=W.D. Tenn. |date=1988 |url=https://casetext.com/case/buchanan-v-city-of-jackson |accessdate=July 3, 2018}}</ref>

After disenfranchisement of blacks, the Republican Party in Tennessee became a primarily white [[sectionalism|sectional]] party supported only in the eastern part of the state. In the 20th century, except for two nationwide Republican landslides of the 1920s (in 1920, when Tennessee narrowly supported [[Warren G. Harding]] over Ohio Governor [[James M. Cox|James Cox]], and in 1928, when it more decisively voted for [[Herbert Hoover]] over New York Governor [[Al Smith]]), the state was part of the Democratic [[Solid South]] until the 1950s. In that postwar decade, it twice voted for Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during World War II. Since then, more of the state's voters have shifted to supporting Republicans, and Democratic presidential candidates have carried Tennessee only four times.

By 1960 African Americans comprised 16.45% of the state's population. It was not until after the mid-1960s and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] that they were able to vote in full again, but new devices, such as [[at-large]] commission city governments, had been adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation. Former Gov. [[Winfield Dunn]] and former U.S. Sen. [[Bill Brock]] wins in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among whites for the statewide victory. Tennessee has selected governors from different parties since 1970.

In the early 21st century, Republican voters control most of the state, especially in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores of the four major cities, and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis. The latter area includes a large [[African-American]] population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_PL/GCTPL1.ST05/0400000US47 |title=Race and Hispanic or Latino: 2010—State—County / County Equivalent, 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |date=2010 |access-date=July 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213115146/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_PL/GCTPL1.ST05/0400000US47 |archive-date=February 13, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s. Tennessee's [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district|1st]] and [[Tennessee's 2nd congressional district|2nd]] congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War; they identified with the GOP after the war and have stayed with that party ever since. The first has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans (or their antecedents) have held it for all but four years since 1859. The second has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1859.

In the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], Vice President [[Al Gore]], a Democratic [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from Tennessee, failed to carry his home state, an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support. Republican [[George W.

The ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962) decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] established the principle of "[[one man, one vote]]", requiring state legislatures to redistrict to bring Congressional apportionment in line with decennial censuses. It also required both houses of state legislatures to be based on population for representation and not geographic districts such as counties. This case arose out of a lawsuit challenging the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Justice for All: William J. Brennan, Jr., and the Decisions that Transformed America |url=https://archive.org/details/justiceforallwil00eisl |url-access=registration |last=Eisler |first=Kim Isaac |year=1993 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-76787-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter=Baker v.

The ruling also applied to numerous other states long controlled by rural minorities, such as Alabama, Vermont, and Montana.

===Law enforcement===
====State agencies====
The state of Tennessee maintains four dedicated law enforcement entities: the [[Tennessee Highway Patrol]], the [[Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency]] (TWRA), the [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]] (TBI), and the [[Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation]] (TDEC).

The Highway Patrol is the primary law enforcement entity that concentrates on highway safety regulations and general non-[[wildlife]] state law enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the [[Tennessee Department of Safety]]. The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife, boating, and fisheries regulations outside of state parks. The TBI maintains state-of-the-art investigative facilities and is the primary state-level criminal investigative department. Tennessee State [[Park Ranger]]s are responsible for all activities and law enforcement inside the Tennessee State Parks system.

====Local====
Local law enforcement is divided between County Sheriff's Offices and Municipal Police Departments. Tennessee's Constitution requires that each County have an elected Sheriff. In 94 of the 95 counties the Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the county and has jurisdiction over the county as a whole. Each Sheriff's Office is responsible for warrant service, court security, jail operations and primary law enforcement in the unincorporated areas of a county as well as providing support to the municipal police departments. Incorporated municipalities are required to maintain a police department to provide police services within their corporate limits.

The three counties in Tennessee to adopt metropolitan governments have taken different approaches to resolving the conflict that a Metro government presents to the requirement to have an elected Sheriff.
* [[Nashville-Davidson#Law and government|Nashville/Davidson County]] converted law enforcement duties entirely to the Metro Nashville Police Chief. In this instance the Sheriff is no longer the chief law enforcement officer for Davidson County. The Davidson County Sheriff's duties focus on warrant service and jail operations. The Metropolitan Police Chief is the chief law enforcement officer and the Metropolitan Police Department provides primary law enforcement for the entire county.
* [[Lynchburg, Tennessee#Government|Lynchburg]]/[[Moore County, Tennessee|Moore County]] took a much simpler approach and abolished the Lynchburg Police Department when it consolidated and placed all law enforcement responsibility under the sheriff's office.
* [[Hartsville, Tennessee|Hartsville]]/[[Trousdale County, Tennessee|Trousdale County]], although the smallest county in Tennessee, adopted a system similar to Nashville's, which retains the sheriff's office but also has a metropolitan police department.

====Firearms====
{{Main|Gun laws in Tennessee}}

[[Gun laws in Tennessee]] regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition. Concealed carry and open-carry of a handgun is permitted with a Tennessee handgun carry permit or an equivalent permit from a reciprocating state. As of July 1, 2014, a permit is no longer required to possess a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB1774 |title=Bill Information for SB1774 |publisher=Tennessee General Assembly |access-date=June 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602194635/http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB1774 |archive-date=June 2, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Capital punishment====
Capital punishment has existed in Tennessee at various times since statehood. Before 1913, the method of execution was hanging. From 1913 to 1915, there was a hiatus on executions but they were reinstated in 1916 when electrocution became the new method. From 1972 to 1978, after the Supreme Court ruled (''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'') capital punishment unconstitutional, there were no further executions. Capital punishment was restarted in 1978, although those prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 had their sentences mostly commuted to life in prison.<ref name="StateExecution">{{cite web |url=http://www.state.tn.us/correction/media/deathpenalty.html |title=Death Penalty in Tennessee |publisher=State of Tennessee Dept. of Correction |access-date=August 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815202759/http://www.state.tn.us/correction/media/deathpenalty.html |archive-date=August 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> From 1916 to 1960 the state executed 125 inmates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wbir.com/story/news/local/2014/05/23/electric-chair-tennessee-haslam/9510473/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525210220/http://www.wbir.com/news/local/electric-chair-brings-life-to-old-death-penalty-debates/312176066 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |title=Electric chair brings life to old death penalty debates |author=Jim Matheny |publisher=WBIR/NBC |date=May 23, 2014 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> For a variety of reasons there were no further executions until 2000.
