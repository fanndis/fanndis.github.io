== History ==
Under the name ''The Daily Bee'', the first issue of the newspaper was published on February 3, 1857, proudly boasting that "the object of this newspaper is not only independence, but permanence".<ref name="hist"/> At this time, ''The Bee'' was in competition with the ''[[Sacramento Union]]'', a newspaper founded in 1851.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Although ''The Bee'' soon surpassed the ''Union'' in popularity, the ''Union'' survived until its closure in 1994, leaving ''The Sacramento Bee'' to be the longest-running newspaper in the city's history.

The first editor of ''The Sacramento Bee'' was [[John Rollin Ridge]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v014/v014p295.html |title=Edward W. Bushyhead and John Rollin Ridge, Cherokee Editors in California |author=Carolyn Thomas Foreman |date=September 1936 |work=Chronicles of Oklahoma |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref> but [[James McClatchy]] took over the position by the end of the first week.

Also within a week of its creation, ''The Bee'' uncovered a state scandal which led to the impeachment of [[Know Nothing|Know-Nothing]] [[California State Treasurer]] [[Henry Bates (US politician)|Henry Bates]].<ref>Richardson, Darcy G.

=== 21st century ===
On March 13, 2006, The [[McClatchy Company]] announced its agreement to purchase [[Knight Ridder]], the United States' second-largest chain of daily newspapers. The purchase price of $4.5&nbsp;billion in cash and stock gave McClatchy 32&nbsp;daily newspapers in 29&nbsp;markets, with a total circulation of 3.3&nbsp;million.<ref>Katharine Q. Seelye and Andrew Ross Sorkin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/business/media/13knight.html "Newspaper Chain Agrees to a Sale for $4.5 Billion"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 13, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/business/media/newspaper-chain-agrees-to-a-sale-for-45-billion.html|title=Newspaper Chain Agrees to a Sale for $4.5 Billion|first1=Katharine Q. |first2=Andrew Ross|last1=Seelye|last2=Sorkin|date=13 March 2006|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=August 5, 2018}}</ref>

On February 3, 2007, the paper celebrated its 150th&nbsp;anniversary, and a copy of the original issue was included in every newspaper. On February 4, 2007, a 120-page section was included about the paper's history from its founding to today. In 2008, ''The Sacramento Bee'' redesigned and changed its layout.<ref name="hist" /><ref>''Sacramento Bee'', January 1, 2008</ref>

== Recognition ==
''The Sacramento Bee'' has won six [[Pulitzer Prize]]s in its history.<ref>{{cite news |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |date=2016 |title=The Sacramento Bee’s six Pulitzer Prizes |url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article72507372.html |work=Sacramento Bee |location=Sacramento, CA |access-date=2019-07-22 }}</ref> It has won numerous other awards, including many for its progressive public service campaigns promoting free speech (the ''Bee'' often criticized government policy, and uncovered many scandals hurting Californians), anti-racism (''The Bee'' supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]] and publicly denounced the [[Ku Klux Klan]]), worker's rights (''The Bee'' has a strong history of supporting [[Trade union|unionization]]), and [[environmental protection]] (leading numerous tree-planting campaigns and fighting against environmental destruction in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://guide.sacbee.com/105/story/19.html |title=Award-winning coverage that makes a difference

In 2003 the Council for Media Integrity from the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSICOP) gave the ''Candle in the Dark'' award to Edgar Sanchez for his column "Scam Alert" where he has written about [[Advance-fee scam|Nigerian scams]], car-mileage fraud and phony police detectives.
