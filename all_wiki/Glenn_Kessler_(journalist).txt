'''Glenn Kessler''' (born July 6, 1959) is an American diplomatic correspondent who writes columns and helms the "Fact Checker" feature for ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kessler |first=Glenn |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker |title=The Fact Checker website |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
Kessler is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and the author of  ''The Confidante: Condoleezza Rice and the Creation of the Bush Legacy''. The book, which revealed previously unknown details on the making of Bush administration's foreign policy, was described as  "brilliantly reported" by ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and generated news articles and reviews in two dozen countries around the world.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Anthony |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/books/review/Lewis.html?_r=1&ref=review |title=The New York Times 25 November 2007 – The Enabler By Anthony Lewis |work=The New York Times |date=November 25, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref>

Kessler's reporting played a role in two foreign policy controversies during the presidency of [[George W. Bush]]. He was called to testify in the trial of [[I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], in which he was questioned about a 2003 telephone conversation with Libby in which the name of [[Valerie Plame]], a [[CIA]] operative, might have been discussed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/12/AR2007021200588.html |title=The Washington Post 13 February 2007 – Journalists Testify That Libby Never Mentioned CIA Officer |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 3, 2012 |first1=Carol D. |last1=Leonnig |first2=Amy |last2=Goldstein |date=February 13, 2007}}</ref>  (Libby recalled they had discussed Plame; Kessler said they did not.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|2011|pp=245}}</ref>) Meanwhile, a 2004 telephone conversation between Kessler and [[Steve J. Rosen]], a senior official at [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC), was at the core of the AIPAC leaking case.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101649.html/ |title=The Washington Post 12 November 2005 – Media Tangled in Lobbyist Case |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 3, 2012 |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |date=November 12, 2005}}</ref>
The federal government recorded the call and made it the centerpiece of its 2005 indictment of Rosen and an alleged co-conspirator; the charges were dropped in 2009.

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called Kessler "one of the most aggressive journalists on the State Department beat."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB119828051872946001?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB119828051872946001.html |work=The Wall Street Journal|title= The Striver |date=December 22, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'', in a 2007 profile of [[Condoleezza Rice]], said that "week after week, Kessler asks the best questions, and the most questions, at the secretary’s press conferences." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/06/grand-illusions/305904/?single_page=true |title=The Atlantic Monthly June 2007 – Grand Illusions |work=The Atlantic Monthly |date=June 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> Kessler, a specialist on [[nuclear proliferation]] (especially in [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]) and the Middle East, wrote the first article on the North Korea nuclear facility being built in [[Syria]] that was destroyed by Israeli jets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/12/AR2007091202430.html |title=The Washington Post 13 September 2007 – N.

Kessler joined ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1998 as the national business editor and later served as economic policy reporter. Kessler also was a reporter with ''[[Newsday]]'' for eleven years, covering the [[White House]], politics, the [[United States Congress]], [[airline safety]] and [[Wall Street]]. His investigative articles on airline safety led to the indictments of airline executives and federal officials for fraud, prompted congressional hearings into safety issues and spurred the federal government to impose new safety rules for DC-9 jets and begin regular inspections of foreign airlines. He won the Premier Award from the Aviation Space Writers Association and the investigative reporting award from the Society of the Silurians.

At ''[[Newsday]]'', Kessler shared in two [[Pulitzer Prizes]] given for spot news reporting.<ref>1997 Pulitzer Prize in spot news reporting (TWA Flight 800); 1992 Pulitzer Prize in spot news reporting (Manhattan subway derailment)</ref>

Kessler once described what he called a "hare-brained scheme" to get hired by a major newspaper. "I had received my masters degree in international affairs at Columbia University, but nobody was going to hire me straight away to cover foreign policy," he said in a 2019 graduation speech to [[McLean High School]]. "However, I noticed that business journalism was then a growth area in the industry. I figured that I could get an expertise in a certain business subject, at a trade publication, and then a major newspaper would hire me to cover that subject. In retrospect, it sounds like a hare-brained scheme, but it actually worked. I started covering Wall Street for a business newsletter, and within three years I was hired to cover Wall Street by Newsday, then one of the ten biggest newspapers in the country."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@kesslerga/graduation-speech-to-mclean-high-school-june-3-2019-45e60ee90e2e |title=Graduation speech to McLean High School, June 3, 2019 |date=June 3, 2019 |accessdate=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

==''Washington Post'' Fact Checker==
In the ''Washington Post'' "Fact Checker," Kessler rates statements by politicians, usually on a range of one to four [[Pinocchio]]s&nbsp;– with one Pinocchio for minor shading of the facts and four Pinocchios for outright lies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2011/01/welcome_to_the_new_fact_checke.html |title=Guide to Washington Post Fact Checker Rating Scale |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=December 29, 2011 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> If the statement is truthful, the person will get a rare "[[Geppetto]]." Kessler has a new blog post at least five times a week; one column appears every week in the Sunday print edition of ''The Washington Post''. Kessler's team includes another reporter and a video producer, who also write fact checks edited by Kessler.

Kessler is considered one of the pioneers in political fact checking,<ref>{{Harvnb|Graves|2016|pp=34–36}}</ref> a movement that inspired nearly 300 fact-checking organizations in 83 countries, according to a tally by the Duke Reporters’ Lab.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://reporterslab.org/annual-census-finds-nearly-300-fact-checking-projects-around-the-world/ |title=Mark Stencel, "Annual census finds nearly 300 fact-checking projects around the world" |date=June 22, 2020 |accessdate=August 20, 2020}}</ref> In 1996, while at ''Newsday'', "Kessler wrote what may have been the first lengthy fact-check story in a major American newspaper, a preemptive guide to a debate between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole aimed at helping viewers evaluate the claims they were about to hear."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/4506/32/ |title= Stephanie Grace, "Just the Facts," Brown Alumni Monthly |date=January–February 2018 |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref> He documented the growth of fact checking around the world in an article for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, written after training journalists in Morocco.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2014-01-06/just-facts |title= Glenn Kessler, "Just the Facts: Politics and the New Journalism," Foreign Affairs |date=January 6, 2015 |accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>

In a 2012 study of fact checkers, the Center for Media and Public Affairs at [[George Mason University]] concluded that Kessler "splits almost evenly between the two parties."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/study-politifact-twice-as-critical-of-gop-compared-to-wapos-fact-check-column/article/2511401#.UI_6m2_A8TY |title="Study: PolitiFact twice as critical of GOP compared to WaPo's Fact Check column," The Washington Examiner, October 22, 2012 |work=The Washington Examiner |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

A columnist for ''The Wall Street Journal'' attacked the whole idea of awarding Pinocchios as akin to movie-reviewing, saying "the ‘fact check’ is opinion journalism or criticism, masquerading as straight news."<ref>{{cite news|last=Taranto |first=James |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122339946870411861 |title=The 'Fact Checking' Fad |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 7, 2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> The conservative ''[[Power Line]]'' political blog devoted three articles to critiquing one of Kessler’s articles, calling him a "liberal reporter",  and asserting that "these 'fact-checkers' nearly always turn out to be liberal apologists who don a false mantle of objectivity in order to advance the cause of the Democratic Party."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2011/09/who-checks-the-fact-checkers.php |title=John Hinderaker, "Who Checks the Fact Checkers?"

In 2015, Kessler exposed a series of false and misleading statistics about sex trafficking, which led politicians and advocacy groups to stop making those claims.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/14/the-biggest-pinocchios-of-2015/ |title=Glenn Kessler, "The Biggest Pinocchios of 2015" |publisher=washingtonpost.com|date=December 14, 2015 |accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>

"In terms of fact checking, [[Hillary Clinton]] is like playing chess with a real pro," he told [[Jordan Klepper]].

Because of the Trump database, Kessler and the Fact Checker Team were nominated in 2020 by the [[Arthur L.
