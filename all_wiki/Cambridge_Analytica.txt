==Methods==
CA's data analysis methods were to a large degree based on the academic work of Michal Kosinski. In 2008, Kosinski had joined the Psychometrics Centre of [[Cambridge University]] where he then developed with his colleagues a profiling system using general online data, [[Facebook]]-likes, and [[smartphone]] data.<ref name="Magazin">{{cite web |url=https://www.dasmagazin.ch/2016/12/03/ich-habe-nur-gezeigt-dass-es-die-bombe-gibt/ |author=Mikael Krogerus, Hannes Grassegger |title=Ich habe nur gezeigt, dass es die Bombe gibt |publisher=[[Das Magazin]] |language=de |date=3 December 2016 |access-date=7 December 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110 |pmid=23479631 |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=110 |issue=15 |pages=5802–5805 |year=2013 |last1=Kosinski |first1=M |last2=Stillwell |first2=D |last3=Graepel |first3=T|pmc=3625324 |bibcode=2013PNAS..110.5802K }}</ref> He showed that with a limited number of "likes", people can be analysed better than friends or relatives can do and that individual psychological targeting is a powerful tool to influence people.<ref name="Magazin"/>

CA would collect data on voters using sources such as [[demographics]], [[consumer behaviour]], [[Computer and network surveillance|internet activity]], and other public and private sources. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', CA used psychological data derived from millions of Facebook users, largely without users' permission or knowledge.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data |author=Davies, H |title=Ted Cruz using firm that harvested data on millions of unwitting Facebook users |work=The Guardian |date=11 December 2015 |access-date=7 February 2016 }}</ref> Another source of information was the "Cruz Crew" [[mobile app]] that tracked physical movements and contacts and according to the [[Associated Press]], invaded personal data more than previous presidential campaign apps.<ref name="ap0216">{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/2db0fc93cf664a63909e26e708e91c67|title=Cruz app data collection helps campaign read minds of voters|last1=Biesecker|first1=Michael|date=11 February 2016|work=AP News|access-date=13 February 2016|agency=[[Associated Press]]|last2=Bykowicz|first2=Julie}}</ref>

According to [[Sasha Issenberg]], CA indicates that it can tell things about an individual he might not even know about himself.<ref name=issenberg/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/the-persuasion-machine-of-silicon-valley |agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and British Broadcasting Corporation |title=The Persuasion Machine of Silicon Valley |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=17 February 2018 |access-date=17 February 2018 }}</ref>

CA derived much of its personality data on [[online survey]]s which it conducts on an ongoing basis. For each political client, the firm would narrow voter segments from 32 different [[personality style]]s it attributes to every adult in the United States. The personality data would inform the tone of the language used in ad messages or voter contact scripts, while additional data is used to determine voters' stances on particular issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/cruz-s-data-company-works-night-3m-payout/302515 |title=Cruz's Data Company Works into the Night After Big $3 Million Payout |website=[[Advertising Age]]| access-date = 26 February 2016 }}</ref>

The data would get updated with monthly surveys, asking about political preferences and how people get the information they use to make decisions. It also covered consumer topics about different [[brand engagement|brands and preferred products]], building up an image of how someone shops as much as how they vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2016/02/08/political-ad-targeting-cambridge-analytica-adtech |title=Inside the Tech That Puts Political Ads on Your Screen |website=DC Inno| access-date = 26 February 2016 }}</ref>

===''Channel 4 News'' investigation===
''[[Channel 4 News]]'', a news programme broadcast by the [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|British public service]] [[Channel 4]], conducted a four-month investigation into Cambridge Analytica starting in November 2017. An undercover reporter posed as a potential customer for Cambridge Analytica, hoping to help [[Sri Lanka]]n candidates get elected.

Cambridge Analytica said that the video footage was "edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent" the recorded conversations and company's business practices. Nix said that he had "entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios", but insisted his company does not engage in entrapment or bribery.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pham |first1=Sherisse |last2=Riley |first2=Charles |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/20/technology/cambridge-analytica-channel-4-report/index.html |title=Cambridge Analytica responds after CEO filmed discussing bribery and entrapment |publisher=CNN |date=20 March 2018 |access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref>

In the third part of the series, Nix also said that Cambridge Analytica "ran all the digital campaign" for Trump. Nix stated they used communications that would be self-destructive, leaving no incriminating evidence. After the news segment was broadcast, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix as chief executive officer, and [[Julian Wheatland]] became the new CEO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/04/14/who-is-the-man-set-to-be-cambridge-analyticas-new-boss/|title=Who is the man set to be Cambridge Analytica's new boss?|date=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name="wheatland">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/08/07/man-killed-cambridge-analytica-made-mistakes-arent-think/|title=The man that killed Cambridge Analytica: 'We made mistakes, but they aren't what you think'|first=Natasha|last=Bernal|date=August 7, 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> The company also released a statement that the allegations did not represent the ethics of the company, and an independent entity would investigate Nix's statements.<ref name="Lanxon">{{cite news |last=Lanxon |first=Nate |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/cambridge-analytica-used-disappearing-emails-in-campaign-report |title=Cambridge Analytica Boasted of Disappearing Emails in Campaigns |work=Bloomberg |date=20 March 2018 |access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref>

The investigation also raised questions regarding campaign finance law. During the 2016 election, the company was employed both by Trump's campaign and Robert Mercer's [[Make America Number 1]] Super [[Political Action Committee|PAC]] which supported Trump. While PACs are not limited in the amount of funds they can spend on behalf of a candidate, they are not allowed to coordinate strategy with the campaigns they are supporting. Nix's statements in the recorded video describe how the Trump campaign itself could "take the high road" and "stay clean", while the negative attacks were handled by the firm and the Super PAC, in a way which makes it "unattributable, untrackable". These statements potentially suggested unlawful coordination between Trump's campaign and the PAC, although Cambridge Analytica has denied this.<ref name="Bump">{{cite news |last=Bump |first=Philip |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/03/20/a-new-undercover-video-raises-significant-questions-about-cambridge-analyticas-elections-work/ |title=A new undercover video raises significant questions about Cambridge Analytica's elections work |work=The Washington Post |date=20 March 2018 |access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref>
