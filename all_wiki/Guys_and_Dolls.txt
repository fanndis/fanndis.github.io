It is based on "[[The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown]]" (1933) and "Blood Pressure", which are two short stories by [[Damon Runyon]],<ref name=nadel /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ebooks-library.com/author.cfm/AuthorID/900 |title=Damon Runyon |work=Authors |publisher=The eBooks-Library |accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> and also borrows characters and plot elements from other Runyon stories – such as "Pick the Winner".<ref>Stempel, 435</ref>
[[File:Viviane Blaine and Sam Levene in the Original Broadway Production of Guys and Dolls.jpg|thumb|[[Vivian Blaine]] as Miss Adelaide and [[Sam Levene]] as Nathan Detroit in the 1950 original Broadway production of ''Guys and Dolls'']]
The show premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1950, where it ran for 1,200 performances and won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical. The musical has had several Broadway and London revivals, as well as a [[Guys and Dolls (film)|1955 film adaptation]] starring [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Vivian Blaine]].

''Guys and Dolls'' was selected as the winner of the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. However, because of writer [[Abe Burrows]]' communist sympathies as exposed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), the Trustees of [[Columbia University]] vetoed the selection, and no Pulitzer for Drama was awarded that year.<ref>Suskin, 275</ref>

In 1998,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/hall-of-fame |title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame |date=2010-10-18 |website=GRAMMY.com |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Vivian Blaine]], [[Sam Levene]], [[Robert Alda]] and [[Isabel Bigley]], along with the original Broadway cast of the 1950 [[Decca Records|Decca]] cast album, were posthumously inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].

==Background==
''Guys and Dolls'' was conceived by producers [[Cy Feuer]] and Ernest Martin as an adaptation of [[Damon Runyon]]'s short stories.<ref name=Zolotow>Zolotow, Maurice. "Guys, Dolls and Runyon". ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nov. 12, 1950, Section 2, p. 1,3.</ref> These stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s, concerned gangsters, gamblers, and other characters of the New York underworld. Runyon was known for the unique dialect he employed in his stories, mixing highly formal language and slang.<ref name=Stempel434>Stempel, 434</ref> Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a [[lyricist]] for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. [[George S. Kaufman]] was hired as director. When the first version of the show's [[Musical theater#Book musicals|book]], or dialogue, written by [[Jo Swerling]] was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer [[Abe Burrows]] to rewrite it.<ref name=Zolotow/><ref>Suskin, 272-276</ref>

Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book.<ref name=Stempel434/> Burrows later recalled:

<blockquote>Frank Loesser's fourteen songs were all great, and the [new book] had to be written so that the story would lead into each of them. Later on, the critics spoke of the show as 'integrated'. The word ''integration'' usually means that the composer has written songs that follow the story line gracefully. Well, we accomplished that but we did it in reverse.<ref>Burrows, Abe (1980). ''Honest Abe''. Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, p. 149, cited in Stempel, 434-435</ref></blockquote>

Abe Burrows specifically crafted<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@jklfa/casting-guys-dolls-by-ron-fassler-includes-factual-errors-and-oversights-concerning-my-father-6d7606f3aba1 |title=Casting Guys and Dolls by Ron Fassler has factual errors and oversights concerning Sam Levene, the… |last=Levene |first=Joseph K. |date=2019-07-15 |website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> the role of Nathan Detroit around Sam Levene who signed for the project long before Burrows wrote a single word of dialogue, a similar break Burrows said he had when he later wrote ''[[Cactus Flower (play)|Cactus Flower]]'' for [[Lauren Bacall]]. In “Honest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?”, Burrows recalls "I had the sound of their voices in my head. I knew the rhythm of their speech and it helped make the dialogue sharper and more real". Although Broadway and movie veteran Sam Levene was not a singer, it was agreed he was otherwise perfect as Nathan Detroit; indeed, Levene was one of Runyon's favorite actors.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Frank Loesser agreed it was easier adjusting the music to Levene's limitations than substituting a better singer who couldn't act.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of Guys and Dolls |last=Gerabian |first=Keith |publisher=Mosaic Press |year=2002 |asin=B01M1E9JZR |location=Ontario |pages=93, 94}}</ref> Levene's lack of singing ability is the reason the lead role of Nathan Detroit only has one song, the duet "Sue Me".

Composer and lyricist Frank Loesser specifically wrote "Sue Me" for Sam Levene, and structured the song so he and Vivian Blaine never sang their showstopping duet together. The son of a cantor, Sam Levene was fluent in [[Yiddish]]: "Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick; alright, already, it’s true, so nu? So sue me." Frank Loesser felt<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ajnf0SdatsC&q=%22Nathan+Detroit+should+be+played+as+a+brassy+Broadway+tough+guy+who+sang+with+more+grits+than+gravy&pg=PA118 |title=A Most Remarkable Fella: Frank Loesser and the Guys and Dolls in His Life: a Portrait by His Daughter |last=Loesser |first=Susan |date=2000 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=9780634009273}}</ref> "Nathan Detroit should be played as a brassy Broadway tough guy who sang with more grits than gravy. Sam Levene sang “Sue Me” with such a wonderful Runyonesque flavor that his singing had been easy to forgive, in fact it had been quite charming in its ineptitude." "Musically, Sam Levene may have been tone-deaf, but he inhabited Frank Loesser's world as a character more than a caricature", says<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/iq/impertinent-questions-larry-stempel |title=Impertinent Questions with Larry Stempel |website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Larry Stempel, a music professor at [[Fordham University]] and the author of ''Showtime: A History of the Broadway Musical Theater''.

The character of Miss Adelaide was created specifically to fit Vivian Blaine into the musical, after Loesser decided she was ill-suited to play the conservative Sarah.<ref name="npr2000">Scott Simon (host). "Creation of the musical ''Guys and Dolls'', ''Weekend Edition Saturday'', National Public Radio, November 2=pk2000</ref> When Loesser suggested reprising some songs in the second act, Kaufman warned: "If you reprise the songs, we'll reprise the jokes."<ref>"On a lighter note, Sam Levene and Vivian Blane made guest-star appearances on a New Year's Eve production of [[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]], December 31, 1950, with [[Tallulah Bankhead]] and [[Jose Ferrer]]; Sam Levene and Vivian Blaine performed with Bankhead, satirizing the difficulty of getting theatre tickets to their standing-room-only Broadway musical, ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''."{{cite book |last=Herrmann |first=Dorothy |authorlink= |title=With Malice Toward All |publisher=G.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
A [[pantomime]] of never-ceasing activities depicts the hustle and bustle of New York City ("Runyonland"). Three small-time gamblers, Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet, and Rusty Charlie, argue over which horse will win a big race ("Fugue for Tinhorns"). The band members of the Save-a-Soul Mission, led by the pious and beautiful Sergeant Sarah Brown, call for sinners to "Follow the Fold" and repent. Nicely and Benny's employer, Nathan Detroit, runs an illegal floating [[craps|crap game]]. Due to local policeman Lt. Brannigan's strong-armed presence, he has found only one likely spot to hold the game: the "Biltmore garage". Its owner, Joey Biltmore, requires a $1,000 security deposit, and Nathan is broke ("The Oldest Established"). Nathan hopes to win a $1,000 bet against Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything. Nathan proposes a bet he believes he cannot lose: Sky must take a woman of Nathan's choice to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Sky agrees, and Nathan chooses Sarah Brown.

At the mission, Sky attempts to make a deal with Sarah; offering her "one dozen genuine sinners" in exchange for the date in Havana. Sarah refuses, and they argue over who they will fall in love with ("I'll Know"). Sky kisses Sarah, and she slaps him. Nathan goes to watch his fiancée of 14 years, Adelaide, perform her nightclub act ("[[A Bushel and a Peck]]"). After her show, she asks him to marry her once again, telling him that she has been sending her mother letters for twelve years claiming that they have been married with five children. She finds out that Nathan is still running the crap game. After kicking him out, she reads a medical book telling her that her long-running cold may be due to Nathan's refusal to marry her ("[[Adelaide's Lament]]").

The next day, Nicely and Benny watch as Sky pursues Sarah, and Nathan tries to win back Adelaide's favor. They declare that guys will do anything for the dolls they love ("Guys and Dolls"). General Cartwright, the leader of Save-a-Soul, visits the mission and explains that she will be forced to close the branch unless they succeed in bringing some sinners to the upcoming revival meeting. Sarah, desperate to save the mission, promises the General "one dozen genuine sinners", implicitly accepting Sky's deal. Brannigan discovers a group of gamblers waiting for Nathan's crap game, and to convince him of their innocence, they tell Brannigan their gathering is Nathan's "surprise bachelor party". This satisfies Brannigan, and Nathan resigns himself to eloping with Adelaide. Adelaide goes home to pack, promising to meet him after her show the next afternoon. The Save-A-Soul Mission band passes by, and Nathan sees that Sarah is not in it; he realizes that he lost the bet and faints.

In a Havana nightclub, Sky buys a drink for himself and a "Cuban milkshake" for Sarah. She doesn't realize that the drink contains [[Bacardi]] rum, and she gets drunk and kisses Sky ("[[If I Were a Bell]]"). Sky realizes that he genuinely cares for Sarah, and he takes her back to New York. They return at around 4:00&nbsp;a.m., and Sky tells Sarah how much he loves the early morning ("My Time of Day"). They both spontaneously admit that they're in love ("[[I've Never Been in Love Before]]"). A siren sounds and gamblers run out of the mission, where Nathan has been holding the crap game. Sarah assumes that Sky took her to Havana so Nathan could run the game in the mission, and she walks out on him.

===Act II===
The next evening, Adelaide performs her act ("Take Back Your Mink"). Nathan doesn't show up for the elopement because he's still running the crap game. She soon realizes that Nathan has stood her up again ("Adelaide's Second Lament").

Sarah admits to Arvide, her uncle and fellow mission worker, that she does love Sky, but she will not see him again. Arvide expresses his faith in Sky's inherent goodness and urges Sarah to follow her heart ("More I Cannot Wish You"). Sky tells Sarah he intends to deliver the dozen genuine sinners for the revival. She doesn't believe him and walks off, but Arvide subtly encourages him.

Nicely shows Sky to the crap game; now in the sewers ("Crapshooters Dance"). Big Jule, a gambler, has lost a large sum of money and refuses to end the game until he earns it back. Sky arrives and fails to convince the crapshooters to come to the mission. He gives Nathan $1,000 and claims that he lost the bet to protect Sarah. Sky makes a last-minute bet to get the sinners; if he loses, everyone gets $1,000, but if he wins, they go to the mission ("[[Luck Be a Lady]]"). He wins the bet. Nathan runs into Adelaide on his way there. She tries to get him to elope, but when he can't, she walks out on him. Nathan professes his love for her ("Sue Me"), then leaves.

Sarah is shocked to see that Sky carried through on his promise. The General asks the gamblers to confess their sins, and while some do, one of them admits the real reason they are even there. The General is thrilled that good can come from evil. Attempting to appear contrite, Nicely invents a dream that encouraged him to repent, and the gamblers join in with revivalist fervor ("[[Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat]]"). Brannigan arrives and threatens to arrest everyone for the crap game in the Mission, but Sarah clears them, saying that none of the gamblers were at the mission the previous night. After Brannigan leaves, Nathan confesses that they held the crap game in the mission. He also confesses to the bet he made with Sky about taking Sarah to Havana. He adds that he won the bet, to Sarah's shock, and she realizes that Sky wanted to protect her reputation and must genuinely care about her.

Sarah and Adelaide run into each other, and they commiserate and then resolve to marry their men anyway and reform them later ("Marry the Man Today"). A few weeks later, Nathan owns a newsstand and has officially closed the crap game. Sky, who is now married to Sarah, works at the mission band and has also stopped gambling. The characters celebrate as Nathan and Adelaide are married ("Guys and Dolls (Finale/Reprise)").

In this production, the musical was relocated to [[Harlem]], 1939, with the music referencing jazz, and gospel. Director [[Michael Buffong]] said, "Pre-war Harlem was all about the hustle. The creativity of that era was born from a unique collision of talent and circumstance as people escaped the agricultural and oppressive south via the 'underground railroad' into the highly urbanised and industrialised north. Much of our popular culture, from dance to music, has its roots in that period. Our ''Guys and Dolls'' brings all of this to the fore."<ref name=buffong/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/13/guys-and-dolls-manchester-royal-exchange-michael-buffong-interview |title=Harlem shake-up: How Guys and Dolls found its swing |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2017-11-13 |last1=Gilbey |first1=Ryan}}</ref>

This version of Frank Loesser's musical, which swirls around the lives of the petty gangsters and their 'dolls' who inhabit New York's underbelly, moves the action to Harlem at its prewar height in 1939.

==Reception==
The original Broadway production of ''Guys and Dolls'' opened to unanimously positive reviews, which was a relief to the cast, who had had a 41-performance pre-Broadway tryout in Philadelphia in which each of the 41 performances was different. Critics praised the musical's faithfulness to Damon Runyon's style and characterizations. [[Richard Watts, Jr.|Richard Watts]] of the ''New York Post'' wrote "''Guys and Dolls'' is just what it should be to celebrate the Runyon spirit...filled with the salty characters and richly original language sacred to the memory of the late Master".<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 272-276. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> William Hawkins of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York World-Telegram & Sun]]'' stated "It recaptures what [Runyon] knew about Broadway, that its wickedness is tinhorn, but its gallantry is as pure and young as [[Uncle Tom's Cabin#Eva|Little Eva]]".<ref name=Suskin/> Robert Coleman of the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' wrote "We think Damon would have relished it as much as we did".<ref name=Suskin/>

The book and score were greatly praised as well; [https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/20/archives/john-chapman-7t-drama-critic-dies-revewer-of-the-news-25-years.html John Chapman], then Chief Theatre Critic, of the ''New York Daily News'' wrote "The book is a work of easy and delightful humor. Its music and lyrics, by [[Frank Loesser]], are so right for the show and so completely lacking in banality, that they amount to an artistic triumph".<ref name=Suskin/> Coleman stated "Frank Loesser has written a score that will get a big play on the juke boxes, over the radio, and in bistros throughout the land. His lyrics are especially notable in that they help Burrows's topical gags to further the plot". In ''The New York Times'', [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote "Mr. Loesser's lyrics and songs have the same affectionate appreciation of the material as the book, which is funny without being self-conscious or mechanical".<ref name=Atkinson>[[Brooks Atkinson|Atkinson, Brooks]]. "At the Theatre". ''The New York Times'', November 25, 1950. p. 21</ref>

Multiple critics asserted that the work was of great significance to musical theatre. John McClain of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' proclaimed "it is the best and most exciting thing of its kind since ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]''. It is a triumph and a delight."<ref name=Suskin/> Atkinson stated, "we might as well admit that ''Guys and Dolls'' is a work of art. It is spontaneous and has form, style, and spirit."<ref name=Atkinson/> Chapman asserted, "In all departments, ''Guys and Dolls'' is a perfect musical comedy".<ref name=Suskin/>

[[Laurence Olivier]] said<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unz.com/isteve/business-strategy-101/ |title=Business Strategy 101 |last=Sailer |first=Steve |website=The Unz Review |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sam Levene]]'s performance as Nathan Detroit was the greatest stage performance he had ever seen.

Levene lost the film role of Nathan Detroit to Frank Sinatra: "You can’t have a Jew playing a Jew, it wouldn't work on screen", producer Samuel Goldwyn argued<ref>{{cite web |url=https://forward.com/culture/401977/hollywood-where-jews-dont-get-to-play-jews/ |title=Hollywood: Where Jews Don't Get To Play Jews |last1=RickeyJune 3 |first1=Carrie |last2=Images |first2=2018Getty |website=The Forward |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> when explaining he wanted Sinatra rather than Levene who had originated the role, even though ''Guys and Dolls'' film director Joseph L. Mankiewicz wanted Levene, the original Broadway star. Frank Loesser felt Sinatra<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7PUDAAAQBAJ&q=Frank+Loesser+felt+played+the+part+like+a+%22dapper+Italian+swinger%22&pg=PT186 |title=Showstoppers!: The Surprising Backstage Stories of Broadway's Most Remarkable Songs |last=Nachman |first=Gerald |date=2016-11-01 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=9781613731055}}</ref> played the part like a "dapper Italian swinger".

Sinatra did his best to give Nathan Detroit a few stereotyped Jewish gestures and inflections, but Frank Loesser hated<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7PUDAAAQBAJ&q=Frank+Loesser+hated+how+Sinatra+turned+the+rumpled+Nathan+Detroit+into+a+smoothie.&pg=PT186 |title=Showstoppers!: The Surprising Backstage Stories of Broadway's Most Remarkable Songs |last=Nachman |first=Gerald |date=2016-11-01 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=9781613731055}}</ref> "how Sinatra turned the rumpled Nathan Detroit into a smoothie. Sam Levene's husky untrained voice added to the song's charm, not to mention its believability". Frank Loesser died in 1969, still refusing<ref>{{cite web |url=https://chiseler.org/post/103202364301/frank-sinatra-vs-frank-loesser |title=FRANK SINATRA VS FRANK LOESSER |website=THE CHISELER |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> to watch the film version released in 1955.

Around the time of the film's release, American composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote film reviews for ''[[National Board of Review|Films in Review]]''. Sondheim (then aged 25) reviewed the film version of ''Guys and Dolls'', and observed: "Sinatra ambles through his role as Nathan Detroit as though he were about to laugh at the jokes in the script. He has none of the sob in the voice, and the incipient ulcer in the stomach, that the part requires and Sam Levene supplied so hilariously on the stage. Sinatra sings on pitch, but colorlessly; Levene sang off pitch, but acted while he sang. Sinatra's lackadaisical performance, his careless and left handed attempt at characterization not only harm the picture immeasurably but indicate an alarming lack of professionally."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/92146617/Stephen-Sondheim-film-critic |title=Stephen Sondheim, film critic {{!}} Musical Theatre {{!}} Theatre |website=Scribd |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>

Three new songs, written by Frank Loesser, were added to the film: "Pet Me Poppa"; "A Woman in Love"; and "Adelaide", which was written specifically for Sinatra. Five songs from the stage musical were omitted from the movie: "A Bushel and a Peck", "My Time of Day", "I've Never Been In Love Before", "More I Cannot Wish You", and "Marry the Man Today".

[[20th Century Fox]] acquired the film rights to the musical in early 2013 and was planning a remake.<ref>Fleming Jr., Mike [https://www.deadline.com/2013/04/fox-seals-guys-and-dolls-rights-wants-channing-tatum-joseph-gordon-levitt-to-fill-frank-sinatra-and-marlon-brando-shoes/ "Fox Seals ‘Guys And Dolls’ Rights; Wants Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt To Fill Frank Sinatra And Marlon Brando Shoes."] ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' (April 24, 2013).</ref> In March 2019, [[TriStar Pictures]] acquired the remake rights.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Brett Lang |author2=Justin Kroll |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/guys-and-dolls-movie-tristar-1203171850/ |title='Guys and Dolls' Getting Remade at TriStar (EXCLUSIVE) |website=Variety |accessdate=26 March 2019 |date=2019-03-26}}</ref>
