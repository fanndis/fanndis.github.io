The '''first Salmond government''', which was sworn in on 17 May 2007 at the start of the [[3rd Scottish Parliament]], was a [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] [[minority government]].

Having won the largest number of seats in the general election (47 of 129) the SNP sought to form a coalition with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]].  When those talks failed, the SNP chose to form a one-party minority government. The SNP and [[Scottish Greens]] signed an agreement where the Greens supported SNP ministerial appointments, but did not offer support for any confidence or budget votes ("confidence and supply").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6646227.stm |title=SNP and Greens sign working deal |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref> SNP leader, [[Alex Salmond]] was elected [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] on 16 May 2007; he was officially sworn in and his slate of ministerial appointments were ratified by the [[Scottish Parliament]] the following day.

==History==
Due to the agreement signed with the Greens, Salmond's investiture vote was successful despite only having 47 of 129 seats in the Parliament. The vote was 49-46, with the SNP and Greens voting in favour and the 46 Scottish Labour MSPs voting against, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats abstaining.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6659531.stm |title=Salmond elected as first minister |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=16 May 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2019}}</ref>

On 16 May 2007, a few hours after Salmond was sworn in by parliament, he announced his intention to form a government composed of five cabinet secretaries and ten junior ministers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6663031.stm |title=Salmond announces his new cabinet |publisher=BBC News |date=16 May 2007}}</ref> Furthermore, the Lord Advocate lost her seat in the cabinet.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6678697.stm |title=Legal official loses Cabinet seat |publisher=BBC News |date=22 May 2007}}</ref>

A cabinet reshuffle took place in February 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6665051.stm|title=Cabinet and ministers at-a-glance - A guide to who's who in the Scottish government|date=11 February 2009|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref>
