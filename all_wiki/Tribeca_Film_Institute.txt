The '''Tribeca Film Institute''' (TFI) is a year-round non-profit arts organization founded by [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jane Rosenthal]], and [[Craig Hatkoff]] in the wake of [[September 11, 2001]]. TFI's mission is to empower filmmakers through grants and professional development, and train the media-makers of the future by bringing film into the classroom, developing young audiences for independent film, and promoting career development.

As of September 2020, TFI suspended operations due to "uncertainties surrounding our new reality" affected by the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema|COVID-19 pandemic]]. “By no means is this the end of TFI... This pause in TFI’s activities will enable us to better position our focus and resources to support the greatest needs and where we can have the greatest impact, just like we did after 9/11.”<ref>{{Cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Marc Malkin,Matt|last2=Malkin|first2=Marc|last3=Donnelly|first3=Matt|date=2020-05-27|title=Tribeca Film Institute Suspends Operations, Enacts Small Round of Layoffs (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/tribeca-film-institute-suspends-operations-layoffs-1234616766/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref>
