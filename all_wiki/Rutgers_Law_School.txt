==History==
[[File:Prudential Home Office tower.tiff|thumb|200px|right|Original site of New Jersey Law School, a predecessor school of Rutgers Law]]
Rutgers Law School is the oldest law school in New Jersey.  Rutgers Law School has its roots in three law schools.  The first was founded October 5, 1908 as the New Jersey Law School, the second, the South Jersey Law School founded in 1926  by [[Collingswood, New Jersey]] mayor and businessmen Arthur E. Armitage, Sr. and the final was Mercer Beasley School of Law named for a former [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] Justice and founded in 1926 by several prominent Newark attorneys.

The New Jersey Law School was founded as a for-profit law school by Richard D. Currier, a New York lawyer and graduate of Yale and New York Law School. Currier was joined by Charles M. Mason, a New Jersey attorney, who served as dean until his death in 1928. The school originally had only three faculty members 30 students with classes on the 4th floor of the [[Prudential Headquarters|Prudential Insurance Home Office]] in Newark for their first classes. In December 1908, the school was moved to a large Victorian townhouse at 33 East Park Street also in Newark. From its founding, women were to be admitted on "equal basis to men."
[[File:RULawYard.JPG|thumb|right|Rear law school courtyard at the Camden campus]]
After World War I, the New Jersey Law School saw increase in enrollment and by 1927, enrollment had peaked to more than 2,300 students, making it the second largest law school in the United States. In 1927 the school moved to the former Ballantine & Sons Ale Brewery at 40 Rector Street.

In 1934, Mercer Beasley School of Law and Newark Institute of Arts and Sciences merged to form the University of Newark and two years later, the New Jersey Law School joined establishing the University of Newark Law School.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawwiki.rutgers.edu/yb/docs/his/1938history.pdf|title=History of the School of Law of the University of Newark|date=1938|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Combining the resources of the schools was designed created a stronger institution however the law school experienced a major decline in enrollment due to World War II and therefore was in a precarious financial condition.

In 1946, the University of Newark merged with [[Rutgers University]] and the law school was renamed the Rutgers University School of Law. In 1950, the South Jersey Law School in Camden, New Jersey,  merged with [[Rutgers University]]. The school was divided between the Newark Division and the South Jersey division based in Camden, with the dean and law school administration based in Newark. During the 1950s and 1960s the law school expanded in size creating the largest law library in New Jersey and its faculty tripled in size. In 1963, the now U.S. Supreme Court Justice, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], was hired as a law professor and served on the faculty until 1972. Ginsburg developed some of the concepts that led to the founding of the Women's Rights Litigation Clinic by Professor Nadine H. Taub, who was its director for many years, and the [[Women's Rights Law Reporter]] the first American legal journal dedicated women's rights.

In 1967, the South Jersey Division was split and created as a separate unit, creating two law schools: ''Rutgers School of Law – Camden'' and ''Rutgers School of Law – Newark''. In 1968, following the Newark riots of 1967, the faculty created the Minority Students Program (MSP) one of the first law school affirmative action programs in the country, with the goal of increasing African American student enrollment. In 1978, the law faculty voted to admit students regardless of race and revamped the Minority Students Program to focus on socio-economically disadvantaged students<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/10/archives/law-school-acts-on-bakke-rule-action-called-proper-response.html|title=Law School Acts on ‘Bakke Rule’|last=Times|first=Alfonso A.

Bakke|Bakke]]. In ''Doherty V. Rutgers School Of Law-Newark''  the [[3rd Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the MSP in a lawsuit from a white student alleging discrimination. Throughout the 1970s the Newark campus was a center of activism and law students nicknamed it "The People's Electric Law School."  Its graduates from this period include United States Senators [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Robert Menendez]].  After eliminating its evening program in 1955, in 1975, the law school restarted an evening program on Camden and Newark campus.<ref name=":0" /> From 1965 to 1978 the Newark division of the law school was located on Akerson Hall. In 1978, it moved to a skyscraper at 15 Washington Street which was renamed in honor of billionaire media baron [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.|Samuel I. Newhouse, Sr.]], a 1916 graduate of the law school. In January 2000, the school moved to the Center for Law and Justice, a newly constructed 225,000-square-foot, six-story building at 123 Washington Street in Newark. In 2015, Rutgers School of Law–Newark and Rutgers School of Law–Camden were unified into a single, jointly administered Rutgers Law School with two campuses.

==Admissions==
In 2018, Rutgers had a 48% acceptance rate, with 2,535 applications for admission and 1,237 offers. The for the 2018 admitted students, the [[LSAT]] 75% - 25% was 158-153 and the UGPA 75% - 25% was 3.61 - 3.08. Rutgers' admissions process offers applicants a choice between competing for admission based primarily on traditional measures such as LSAT scores and college GPAs, or, alternatively, on the basis of an applicant's life experience, with a lesser (though still significant) emphasis placed on traditional factors. Factors that may be considered in the Rutgers admissions process include, but are not limited to, work experience, personal accomplishments, and other aspects of the applicant's personal background.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.rutgers.edu/sites/law/files/attachments/ABA%20Standard%20509%20report%202018.pdf|title=Rutgers 2018 ABA|date=4 December 2019}}</ref>

Rutgers' unique admissions process is particularly significant when contrasted with the efforts of other law schools to maximize the undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores of their incoming classes in order to improve their standing in popular law school ranking publications.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB121971712700771731-lMyQjAxMDI4MTI5NjcyMTY3Wj.html

==Academics==
The J.D. program at Rutgers requires a total of 84 credits to graduate. The 1L curriculum requires traditional courses in Torts, Contracts, Property, Criminal Law, Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Legal Analysis, Writing and Research Skills.

All required courses are graded on a standard 2.95 - 3.1 GPA curve. 1Ls are grouped in small sections of roughly 30 people, who take all of the same required classes together. Though two or three sections are generally combined for required courses, each student has a 'small section' class where their section of 30 or fewer people is taught a required subject by a tenured faculty member. Students may choose to attend classes on either a full-time or part-time basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.rutgers.edu/degree-offerings|title=Degree Offerings|date=2016-07-19|website=Rutgers Law|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>
