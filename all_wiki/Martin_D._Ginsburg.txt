==Personal life and marriage==

Shortly after graduating from Cornell in 1954, Ginsburg married [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ruth Bader]] on June 23. Ruth said she and Martin decided whatever profession they pursued, they would pursue it together. The couple chose law, and both studied at Harvard Law School.

They are the parents of [[Jane C. Ginsburg|Jane Carol Ginsburg]] (born 1955), and [[James Steven Ginsburg]] (born 1965). Martin often told people how he did not make Law Review at Harvard, and Ruth did, sharing how he was proud of her successes, even when they were above his own. However, as he was also very successful in his career as a tax attorney, the couple enjoyed supporting one another and maintaining balance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carmon|first1=Irin|title=Notorious R.B.G.

Martin David Ginsburg died from cancer on June 27, 2010. A US Army Reserve ROTC officer, he was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Following her passing from pancreatic cancer in 2020, Justice Ginsburg was laid to rest in Arlington next to her husband.
