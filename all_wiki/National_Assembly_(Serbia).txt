{{Politics of Serbia}}

The '''National Assembly''' ({{lang-sr|Народна скупштина}} / ''Narodna skupština'', {{IPA-sr|nǎːrodnaː skûpʃtinaː|pron}}) is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[legislature]] of [[Serbia]]. The assembly is composed of 250 [[Deputy (legislator)|deputies]] who are [[Proportional representation|proportionally elected]] to four-year terms by [[secret ballot]]. The assembly elects a [[President of the National Assembly of Serbia|president]] ([[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) who presides over the sessions.<ref name=ustav>[[wikisource:Constitution of Serbia#1.

Performs other functions stipulated by the Constitution and Law.

==Elections==
{{Main|Elections in Serbia}}

Parliamentary elections are regulated by the Constitution.<ref name=ustav/> The elections are held after the four-year term of the previous assembly has expired, but can also be held before that if the Assembly dismisses the Government or the Government resigns and no majority can be reached to elect new Government. Elections are called by the [[President of Serbia]] 90 days before the end of the term of office of the National Assembly, so that elections are finished within the following 60 days. Elections are [[Closed list|closed party-list proportional]]. The whole country is one electoral district. 250 seats are then distributed between the lists using [[d'Hondt method]]. There is a minimum [[voting threshold]] of 3% so that only the party lists which get more than 3% of the votes are awarded the seats. There is no threshold for the [[Political parties of minorities|ethnic minority lists]].

After the elections, the first session of the new Assembly is convened by the Speaker from the previous convocation, so that the session is held not later than 30 days
from the day of declaring the final election results.<ref name=informer/>

==Deputies==
The assembly is composed of 250 [[deputies]]. At least 30% of the deputies are women. Deputies may not hold dual functions which represent a [[conflict of interest]].<ref name=informer/> Deputies enjoy [[parliamentary immunity]].

===President and vice-presidents===
By means of [[majority vote]]s of all deputies, the National Assembly elects the President of the Assembly ([[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) and one or more Vice-Presidents (deputy speakers), usually one vice-president from each parliamentary group. The President of the National Assembly represents the National Assembly, convokes its sessions, presides over them and performs other official activities. The vice-presidents assist the President in performing the duties within his/her purview.

In case the President is temporarily absent, one of the Vice-Presidents designated by him/her stands in for him/her. If the President does not designate any of the Vice-Presidents to stand in for him/her, the oldest Vice-President shall stand in for him/her.<ref name=informer/>

The Secretary of the National Assembly is appointed by the National Assembly. Secretary of the National Assembly assists the President and Vice-Presidents in preparing and chairing sittings. His/her term of office is terminated upon the constitution of a newly elected National Assembly, while he/she shall continue discharging his/her duties until the appointment of a new Secretary.<ref name=informer/> Secretary is not elected from the deputies, and is not a member of the Assembly.

===Parliamentary groups===
[[Parliamentary group]]s in the National Assembly must be formed no later than seven days following the election of the President.

Any grouping of five or more deputies can be officially recognized as a parliamentary group, with each deputy permitted to be members of only a single group at any one time. Although groups are mostly based on [[electoral list]]s from the previous election to the Assembly, groups are often a diverse collection of different parties as well as [[independent politician|independents]]. This is due to Serbia's complex [[multi-party system]], with many parties having a presence in the legislature; parties with similar ideology, but low representation, are therefore inclined to cooperate and form joint parliamentary groups together in order to secure more privileges they would otherwise not be entitled to, such as additional speaking time and committee assignments. An example of such a group includes the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Serbia)|LDP]]-[[League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina|LSV]]-[[Party of Democratic Action of Sandžak|SDA]] group.

The parliamentary groups are each led by a president, who are usually assisted by a number of vice presidents; it is common practice for heterogeneous groups (i.e. ones which comprise two or more parties) to have a vice president from the junior party in the group. The presidents of the groups regularly meet with the President of the Assembly to discuss and arrange the agenda for future meetings.

===Vacancies and replacements===
Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) initially indicated that, if an elected representative's mandate ended before the dissolution of the assembly, the right to fill the vacant position would "belong to the political party on whose electoral list the representative whose mandate [had] ceased was elected," and a new parliamentary mandate would be awarded to a candidate from the relevant party's electoral list who did not win a mandate in the general election.<ref>Law on the Election of Representatives (Article 92), Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 35/2000, made available via [http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/5/topic/6 LegislationOnline], accessed 28 February 2017.</ref> The law did not specify that the mandate would fall sequentially to the next candidate on the list who did not win a mandate. In addition, elected representatives whose party memberships were terminated or whose names were struck from the register of their party (or the political organization on whose list they were elected) were automatically deemed to have their assembly mandates terminated; this latter provision was rescinded by a constitutional court decision in 2003.<ref>Law on Elections of Representatives (2000, updated as of 2004) (Article 88), made available via [http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/5/topic/6 LegislationOnline], accessed 28 February 2017.</ref>

This system was sometimes criticized. [[Vesna Pešić]], for many years a prominent opposition figure in Serbia, noted in 2007 that it permitted party leaders to determine which candidates would enter parliament following elections, irrespective of where the candidates were placed on the lists. Pešić also stated that, after the 2003 constitutional court decision, members who entered the assembly were often required by their parties to sign blank resignation letters, by which means they could be expelled from parliament if they dissented from a party position. She argued that this led to corrupt practices, sometimes involving the misuse of assembly mandates to either keep governments in office or seek their overthrow.<ref>Vesna Pešić, ''State Capture and Widespread Corruption in Serbia'', [[Centre for European Policy Studies]] (CEPS Working Document 262/March 2007), p. 119.</ref> Daniel Bochsler, in a 2010 essay on Serbia's political system, also noted that the system gave party leaders significant control over individual mandates, although he added that the system of requiring blank resignation letters was "more understandable if we take into account that party switches are very common in post-communist legislatures, and not only in Serbia."<ref>Daniel Bochsler, "The party system of Serbia," in Vera Stojarová and Peter Emerson, ed., ''Party Politics in the Western Balkans'', (New York: Routledge, 2010), p. 105. Bochsler asserts that mandates were sometimes given to party figures who had not contested the general election.</ref>

The law was reformed in 2011, to clarify that vacant mandates would be "awarded to the first candidate from the same electoral list who was not awarded a mandate" and that, in the event of a resignation of a member elected on a coalition list, the vacant mandate would fall to the first candidate on the list from the same party who was not awarded a mandate. It also established a provision for the return to parliament of members who resigned during the same convocation to take a position in government, and it stipulated that members would be required to submit resignation letters in person.<ref>Law on the Election of Members of the Parliament (2000, as amended 2011) (Articles 88 & 92) made available via [http://www.legislationline.org/topics/country/5/topic/6 LegislationOnline], accessed 28 February 2017.</ref>

The first session of the new Assembly is convened by the Assembly Speaker from the previous convocation. The first sitting of the National Assembly is chaired by the oldest deputy. He/she is assisted in his/her work by the youngest deputy from each of the four party lists that polled the largest number of seats, and by the Secretary of the Assembly
from the previous convocation. At the first sitting of the National Assembly, the President of the Assembly, Vice-Presidents, and the members of the working bodies of the National Assembly are elected and the Secretary of the National Assembly is appointed.

The National Assembly is convoked for two regular sessions per year, starting on the first workdays of March and October. The Assembly is convoked for extraordinary session at the request of at least one-third of the deputies or the request of the Government, with previously determined agenda. The National Assembly can be convoked without an announcement upon the declaration of the state of war or emergency. The proposed agenda for a National Assembly sitting is prepared by the president. A [[quorum]] for the work of
the National Assembly exists if a minimum of one-third of deputies are present at the National Assembly sitting. The quorum for the work of the National Assembly on Voting Days exists if at least 126 deputies are present at the sitting.<ref name=informer/>

The right to propose laws, other regulations and general acts belongs to every deputy, the government, assemblies of autonomous provinces or at least 30,000 voters. The [[Ombudsman]] and [[National Bank of Serbia]] also have the right to propose laws falling within their competence. Upon the request of the majority of all deputies or at least 100,000 voters, the National Assembly may call a [[referendum]] on issues falling within its competence.<ref name=informer/>
[[File:Beograd 10038 parl old yugoslavia chamber.jpg|thumb|The Small Debating chamber]]

The National Assembly adopts decisions by [[majority vote]] of deputies at the session at which the majority of deputies are present. The deputies vote “For” a motion, “Against” a motion, or abstain from voting.<ref name=informer/>

If the Assembly is in crisis, The President of the Republic may dissolve the National Assembly, upon an elaborated proposal of the government. The government may not propose dissolution of the Assembly if a proposal has been submitted to dismiss the Government. The National Assembly is also dissolved if it fails to elect the Government within 90 days from the day of its constitution. The National Assembly may not be dissolved during the state of war and emergency. The National Assembly, which has been dissolved, only performs current or urgent tasks. In case of declaration of the state of war or emergency, its full competence is re-established and lasts until the end of the state of war, that is,
emergency.<ref name=informer/>
