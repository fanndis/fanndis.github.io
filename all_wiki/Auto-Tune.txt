'''Auto-Tune''' (or '''autotune''') is an audio processor introduced in 1997 by and registered trademark of Antares Audio Technologies,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=78170798|title=AUTO-TUNE|access-date=2020-02-17|publisher=USPTO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218074011/http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=78170798|archive-date=2020-02-18|url-status=live}}</ref> which uses a proprietary device to measure and alter [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in vocal and instrumental music recording and performances.<ref>{{Ref patent|country=US|number=5973252|status=patent|title=Pitch detection and intonation correction apparatus and method|pubdate=1999-10-26|gdate=1999-10-26|fdate=1998-10-14|pridate=1997-10-27|inventor=Harold A.

Since its inception, producers began to use Auto-Tune as an [[effects unit]] to deliberately distort vocals. By 2018, music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] observed that Auto-Tune had "revolutionized popular music", calling its use for effects "the fad that just wouldn't fade. Its use is now more entrenched than ever."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/|title=How Auto-Tune Revolutionized the Sound of Popular Music|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|date=2018-09-17|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726001852/https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/|archive-date=2019-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==

Auto-Tune was launched in September 1997<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarestech.com/files/news.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000819080205/http://www.antarestech.com/files/news.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2000-08-19|title=Antares News|work=AntaresTech.com|date=2000-08-19|accessdate=2019-05-19}}</ref> by Andy Hildebrand, a Ph.D. research engineer specialized in stochastic estimation theory and [[digital signal processing]]. His method for [[Pitch detection algorithm|detecting pitch]] involved the use of [[autocorrelation]] and proved to be superior to earlier attempts based on [[feature extraction]] that had problems processing certain aspects of the human voice such as [[Diphthong|diphthongs]], leading to sound artifacts.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://priceonomics.com/the-inventor-of-auto-tune/|title=The Mathematical Genius of Auto-Tune|last=Zachary|first=Crockett|date=2016-09-26|work=Priceonomics|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917034527/https://priceonomics.com/the-inventor-of-auto-tune/|archive-date=2018-09-17|url-status=live}}</ref> Music industry engineers had previously considered the use of autocorrelation impractical because of the extremely large computational effort required, but Hildebrand found a "simplification [that] changed a million [[Multiply–accumulate operation|multiply adds]] into just four. It was a trick — a mathematical trick."<ref name=":1" /> Over several months in early 1996, he implemented the algorithm on a custom Macintosh computer, and presented the result at the [[NAMM Show]] later that year, where "it was instantly a massive hit."<ref name=":1" />

Hildebrand had come up with the idea for a vocal pitch correction technology on the suggestion of a colleague's wife, who had joked that she could benefit from a device to help her sing in tune.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/|title=How Auto-Tune Revolutionized the Sound of Popular Music|author=Reynolds, Simon|date=September 17, 2018|work=Pitchfork|accessdate=September 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726001852/https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/|archive-date=July 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Originally, Auto-Tune was designed to discreetly correct imprecise intonations, in order to make music more expressive, with the original patent asserting that "When voices or instruments are out of tune, the emotional qualities of the performance are lost."<ref name=":0" />

According to Chris Lee of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Cher]]'s 1998 song "[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]" is "widely credited with injecting Auto-Tune's mechanical modulations into pop consciousness".<ref name="Lee"/> Cher's producers used the device to "exaggerate the artificiality of abrupt pitch correction", contrary to its original purpose.

{{Quote|While working with Cher on the song "Believe" in 1998, producers Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling discovered that if they set Auto-Tune on its most aggressive setting, so that it corrected the pitch at the exact moment it received the signal, the result was an unsettlingly robotic tone.|Greg Milner (2009)<ref name="Milner">Milner, Greg (2009).

[[Radiohead]] used Auto-Tune on their 2001 album [[Amnesiac (album)|''Amnesiac'']] to create a "nasal, depersonalised sound" and to process speech into melody.

Opponents of the plug-in have argued that Auto-Tune has a negative effect on society's perception and consumption of music. In 2004, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' music critic Neil McCormick called Auto-Tune a "particularly sinister invention that has been putting extra shine on pop vocals since the 1990s" by taking "a poorly sung note and transpos[ing] it, placing it dead centre of where it was meant to be".<ref name="TheAge">{{cite news|title=The truth about lip-synching|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/12/1097406567855.html|date=2004-10-13|accessdate=25 April 2010|last=McCormick|first=Neil|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115020027/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/12/1097406567855.html|archivedate=15 January 2010}}</ref>

In 2009, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted an unnamed Grammy-winning recording engineer as saying, "Let's just say I've had Auto-Tune save vocals on everything from [[Britney Spears]] to [[Bollywood]] cast albums. And every singer now presumes that you'll just run their voice through the box." The same article expressed "hope that pop's fetish for uniform perfect pitch will fade", speculating that pop-music songs have become harder to differentiate from one another, as "track after track has perfect pitch."<ref>Tyrangiel, Josh, "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1877372-2,00.html Singer's Little Helper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210130008/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1877372-2,00.html |date=2009-02-10 }}," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 5 February 2009.</ref> According to [[Tom Lord-Alge]], the device is used on nearly every record these days.<ref name="Milner"/>

===Positive===
Despite its negative reputation, some critics have argued that Auto-Tune opens up new possibilities in pop music, especially in [[hip-hop]] and [[R&B]]. Instead of using it as a crutch for poor vocals—its originally designed purpose—some musicians intentionally use the technology to mediate and augment their artistic expression. When [[French house]] duo [[Daft Punk]] was questioned about their use of Auto-Tune in their single "[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]", [[Thomas Bangalter]] replied by saying, "A lot of people complain about musicians using Auto-Tune. It reminds me of the late '70s when musicians in [[France]] tried to ban the [[synthesizer]]... What they didn't see was that you could use those tools in a new way instead of just for replacing the instruments that came before."<ref name="Robopop">{{cite web|url=http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_robopop/ |title=ROBOPOP |last=Gill |first=Chris |publisher=[[Remix (magazine)|Remix]] |date=2001-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103075925/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_robopop/ |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |accessdate=2014-10-06 }}</ref>

[[T-Pain]], the [[R&B]] singer and rapper who reintroduced the use of Auto-Tune as a vocal effect in pop music with his album ''[[Rappa Ternt Sanga]]'' in 2005, said "My dad always told me that anyone's voice is just another instrument added to the music.
