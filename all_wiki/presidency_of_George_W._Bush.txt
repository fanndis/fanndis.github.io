{{George W. Bush series}}
The '''presidency of George W. Bush''' began at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (18:00 UTC) on January 20, 2001, when [[George W. Bush]] was [[First inauguration of George W. Bush|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|43rd]] [[president of the United States]], and ended on January 20, 2009. Bush, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], took office following a very close victory over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] vice president [[Al Gore]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]]. Four years later, in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], he defeated Democrat [[John Kerry]] to win re-election. Bush, the 43rd president, is the eldest son of the 41st president, [[George H. W. Bush]]. He was succeeded by Democrat [[Barack Obama]], who won the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]].

Upon taking office, Bush pushed through a $1.3 trillion [[Bush tax cuts|tax cut program]] and the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], a major education bill. He also pushed for [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] efforts, such as the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] and [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|faith-based welfare initiatives]]. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]], Bush created the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and declared a [[War on Terror|global war on terrorism]]. In October 2001, Bush ordered an [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] to overthrow the [[Taliban]], destroy the terrorist group [[al-Qaeda]], and capture [[Osama bin Laden]]. That same month, he signed into law the controversial [[Patriot Act]] in order to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. In 2003, Bush ordered an [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], with administration officials arguing that the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime possessed [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (no WMD stockpiles were ever found) and had an [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|operational relationship with al-Qaeda]] (which conflicted with the consensus in the intelligence community). Later that year, he signed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], which created [[Medicare Part D]].

During his second term, Bush reached multiple [[free trade agreement]]s and successfully nominated [[John G. Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] to the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. He sought major changes to [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and immigration laws, but both efforts failed. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continued, and in 2007 he launched a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of troops in Iraq]]. The Bush administration's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the [[dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]] earned wide coverage, and his second term saw a drop in his approval ratings. A [[financial crisis of 2007-2008|global meltdown in financial markets]] dominated his last days in office as policymakers looked to avert a major economic disaster, and he established the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) to buy toxic assets from financial institutions.

The oldest son of [[George H. W. Bush]], the 41st president of the United States, [[George W. Bush]] emerged as a presidential contender in his own right with his victory in the [[1994 Texas gubernatorial election]]. After winning re-election by a decisive margin in the [[1998 Texas gubernatorial election]], Bush became the widely acknowledged front-runner in the race for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]]. In the years preceding the 2000 election, Bush established a stable of advisers, including [[supply-side economics]] advocate [[Lawrence B. Lindsey]] and foreign policy expert [[Condoleezza Rice]].<ref name="mann317"/> With a financial team led by [[Karl Rove]] and [[Ken Mehlman]], Bush built up a commanding financial advantage over other prospective Republican candidates.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 5–6</ref> Though several prominent Republicans declined to challenge Bush, Arizona senator [[John McCain]] launched a spirited challenge that was supported by many moderates and [[War hawk|foreign policy hawks]]. McCain's loss in the South Carolina primary effectively ended the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|2000 Republican primaries]], and Bush was officially nominated for president at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]]. Bush [[Republican Party vice presidential candidate selection, 2000|selected]] former secretary of defense [[Dick Cheney]] as his running mate; though Cheney offered little electoral appeal and had health problems, Bush believed that Cheney's extensive experience would make him a valuable governing partner.<ref name="mann317">Mann (2015), pp. 31-37</ref>

[[File:ElectoralCollege2000.svg|thumb|right|Bush defeated Democrat [[Al Gore]] in the 2000 presidential election.]]

With President [[Bill Clinton]] term-limited, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] nominated Vice President [[Al Gore]] for president. Bush's campaign emphasized their own candidate's character in contrast with that of Clinton, who had been embroiled in the [[Lewinsky scandal]]. Bush held a substantial lead in several polls taken after the final debate in October, but the unearthing of Bush's 1976 DUI arrest appeared to sap his campaign's momentum. By the end of election night, Florida emerged as the key state in the election, as whichever candidate won the state would win the presidency. Bush held an extremely narrow lead in the vote by the end of election night, triggering an automatic [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|recount]]. The Florida Supreme Court ordered a partial manual recount, but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] effectively ordered an end to this process, on equal protection grounds, in the case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', leaving Bush with a victory in both the state and the election. Though Gore narrowly won a plurality of the nationwide popular vote, Bush won the presidential election with 271 electoral votes compared to Gore's 266. In the concurrent [[2000 United States elections|congressional elections]], Republicans retained a narrow majority in the House, but lost five seats in the Senate, leaving the partisan balance in the Senate at fifty Republicans and fifty Democrats.<ref name="Mann, pp. 35-42">Mann (2015), pp. 35-42</ref>

Rejecting the idea of a powerful [[White House Chief of Staff|White House chief of staff]], Bush had high-level officials report directly to him rather than Chief of Staff [[Andrew Card]]. Vice President Cheney emerged as the most powerful individual in the White House aside from Bush himself. Bush brought to the White House several individuals who had worked under him in Texas, including Senior Counselor [[Karen Hughes]], Senior Adviser Karl Rove, legal counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]], and [[White House Office of the Staff Secretary|Staff Secretary]] [[Harriet Miers]].<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 152-156</ref> Other important White House staff appointees included [[Margaret Spellings]] as a domestic policy adviser, [[Michael Gerson]] as chief speechwriter, and [[Joshua Bolten]] and [[Joe Hagin]] as White House deputy chiefs of staff.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 94–95</ref> [[Paul H. O'Neill]], who had served as deputy director of the [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] under [[Gerald Ford]], was appointed secretary of the treasury, while former Missouri senator [[John Ashcroft]] was appointed attorney general.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 134-135</ref>

As Bush had little foreign policy experience, his appointments would serve an important role in dictating the foreign policy of the United States during his tenure. Several of his initial top foreign policy appointees had served in his [[presidency of George H. W. Bush|father's administration]]; Vice President Cheney had been secretary of defense, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice had served on the National Security Council, and deputy secretaries [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] had also served in important roles. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] had served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the first president Bush.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 53-54, 76-77</ref> Bush had long admired Powell, and the former general was Bush's first choice for the position. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who had served in the same position during the [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford administration]], rounded out the key figures in the national security team.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 129-134</ref> Rumsfeld and Cheney, who had served together in the Ford administration, emerged as the leading foreign policy figures during Bush's first term.<ref name="Herring, pp. 938–939">Herring (2008), pp. 938–939</ref>

Snow]] in February 2003.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 389-390</ref> Frustrated by the decisions of the Bush administration, particularly the launching of the Iraq War, Powell resigned following the 2004 elections.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 382-383</ref> He was replaced by Rice, while then-deputy national security adviser [[Stephen Hadley]] took Rice's former position.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 417-418</ref> Most of Bush's top staffers stayed on after the 2004 election, although Spellings joined the Cabinet as secretary of education and Gonzales replaced Ashcroft as attorney general.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 278–280, 283</ref> In early 2006, Card left the White House in the wake of the [[Dubai Ports World controversy]] and several botched White House initiatives, and he was replaced by Joshua Bolten.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 363–367</ref> Bolten stripped Rove of some of his responsibilities and convinced [[Henry Paulson]], the head of [[Goldman Sachs]], to replace Snow as secretary of the treasury.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 369–371</ref>

{{Further|George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates|List of federal judges appointed by George W. Bush|George W. Bush judicial appointment controversies}}

After the 2004 election, many expected that the aging Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] would step down from the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Cheney and White House Counsel Harriet Miers selected two widely respected conservatives, [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] judge [[John Roberts]] and Fourth Circuit judge [[Michael Luttig]], as the two finalists. In June 2005, Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] unexpectedly announced that she would retire from the court, and Bush [[John Roberts Supreme Court nomination|nominated Roberts]] for her position the following month. After Rehnquist died in September, Bush briefly considered elevating Associate Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] to the position of chief justice, but instead chose to nominate Roberts for the position. Roberts won confirmation from the Senate in a 78–22 vote, with all Republicans and a narrow majority of Democrats voting to confirm Roberts.<ref name="smithjudges"/>

To replace O'Connor, the Bush administration wanted to find a female nominee, but was unsatisfied with the conventional options available.<ref name="smithjudges"/> Bush settled on Miers, who had never served as a judge, but who had worked as a corporate lawyer and White House staffer.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 343–345</ref> [[Harriet Miers Supreme Court nomination|Her nomination]] immediately faced opposition from conservatives (and liberals) who were wary of her unproven ideology and lack of judicial experience. After Senate majority leader [[Bill Frist]] informed Bush that Miers did not have the votes necessary to win confirmation, Miers withdrew from consideration. Bush then [[Samuel Alito Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Samuel Alito]], who received strong support from conservatives but faced opposition from Democrats. Alito won confirmation in a 58–42 vote in January 2006.<ref name="smithjudges">Smith (2016), pp. 427-428, 445-452</ref><ref>James L. Gibson, and Gregory A.

[https://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/jlgibson/ajps2009.pdf online]</ref> In the years immediately after Roberts and Alito took office, the [[Roberts Court]] was generally more conservative than the preceding [[Rehnquist Court]], largely because Alito tended to be more conservative than O'Connor had been.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Liptak |first1=Adam |title=Court Under Roberts Is Most Conservative in Decades |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/us/25roberts.html |accessdate=February 21, 2019 |newspaper=New York Times |date=July 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223223927/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/us/25roberts.html |archive-date=February 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bush also [[List of federal judges appointed by George W.

Among them were two future Supreme Court associate justices: [[Neil Gorsuch]] to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] in 2006, and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit]] in 2006.

Bush's promise to cut taxes was the centerpiece of his 2000 presidential campaign, and upon taking office, he made tax cuts his first major legislative priority. A budget surplus had developed during the [[presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]], and with the Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]]'s support, Bush argued that the best use of the surplus was to lower taxes.<ref name="smith160161"/> By the time Bush took office, reduced economic growth had led to less robust federal budgetary projections, but Bush maintained that tax cuts were necessary to boost economic growth.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 119–120</ref> After Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill expressed concerns over the tax cut's size and the possibility of future deficits, Vice President Cheney took charge of writing the bill, which the administration proposed to Congress in March 2001.<ref name="smith160161">Smith (2016), pp. 160-161</ref>

Bush initially sought a $1.6 trillion tax cut over a ten-year period, but ultimately settled for a $1.35 trillion tax cut.<ref>Draper (2007), p. 120</ref> The administration rejected the idea of "triggers" that would phase out the tax reductions should the government again run deficits. The [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] won the support of congressional Republicans and a minority of congressional Democrats, and Bush signed it into law in June 2001. The act lowered the top income tax rate from 39 percent to 35 percent, and it also reduced the [[estate tax]]. The narrow Republican majority in the Senate necessitated the use of the [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]], which in turn necessitated that the tax cuts would phase out in 2011 barring further legislative action.<ref name = "taxcuts1"/>

After the tax bill was passed, Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] left the Republican Party and began caucusing with the Democrats, giving them control of the Senate. After Republicans re-took control of the Senate during the 2002 mid-term elections, Bush proposed further tax cuts. With little support among Democrats, Congress passed the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]], which cut taxes by another $350 billion over 10 years. That law also lowered the [[capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]] and [[dividend tax|taxes on dividends]]. Collectively, the [[Bush tax cuts]] reduced federal individual tax rates to their lowest level since [[World War II]], and government revenue as a share of [[gross domestic product]] declined from 20.9% in 2000 to 16.3% in 2004.<ref name = "taxcuts1">Mann (2015), pp. 43-48, Smith, pp. 161-162</ref> Most of the Bush tax cuts were later made permanent by the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], though that act rolled back the tax cuts on top earners.<ref name=steinhauer1>{{cite news|last1=Steinhauer|first1=Jennifer|title=Divided House Passes Tax Deal in End to Latest Fiscal Standoff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/house-takes-on-fiscal-cliff.html|accessdate=November 13, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=January 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017081519/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/house-takes-on-fiscal-cliff.html|archive-date=October 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Contrary to the rhetoric of the Bush administration and Republicans, the tax cuts increased the budget deficit. Statements by President Bush, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], and Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] that these tax cuts effectively "paid for themselves" were disputed by the CBPP,<ref name="CBPP2">{{cite web|last=Kogan|first=Richard|author2=Aron-Dine, Aviva|date=July 27, 2006|title=Claim that Tax Cuts "Pay for Themselves" is Too Good to Be True|url=http://www.cbpp.org/3-8-06tax.htm|accessdate=July 19, 2007|publisher=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities}}</ref> the U.S. Treasury Department and the CBO.<ref>{{cite web|title=Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6908/12-01-10PercentTaxCut.pdf|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dynamic Scoring: A Back-of-the-Envelope Guide|url=http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/dynamicscoring_05-1212.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516190105/http://economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/dynamicscoring_05-1212.pdf|archive-date=May 16, 2008|access-date=March 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=January 6, 2007|title=A Heckuva Claim|publisher=washingtonpost.com|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501801.html|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Sebastian Mallaby|date=May 15, 2006|title=The Return Of Voodoo Economics|publisher=washingtonpost.com|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/14/AR2006051400806.html|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Education===
[[File:Bush prepares for State of the Union 2003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|President [[George W. Bush]] prepares for the [[State of the Union Address]].]]

Aside from tax cuts, Bush's other major policy initiative upon taking office was education reform. Bush had a strong personal interest in reforming education, especially regarding the education of low-income and minority groups. He often derided the "soft bigotry of low expectations" for allowing low-income and minority groups to fall behind.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 113–114</ref> Although many conservatives were reluctant to increase federal involvement in education, Bush's success in campaigning on education reform in the 2000 election convinced many Republicans, including Congressman [[John Boehner]] of Ohio, to accept an education reform bill that increased federal funding.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 163-164</ref> Seeking to craft a bipartisan bill, Bush courted Democratic senator [[Ted Kennedy]], a leading [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] senator who served as the ranking member on the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Committee on Health, Education, and Pensions]].<ref name="smith166167"/>

Bush favored extensive testing to ensure that schools met uniform standards for skills such as reading and math. Bush hoped that testing would make schools more accountable for their performances and provide parents with more information in choosing which schools to send their children. Kennedy shared Bush's concern for the education of impoverished children, but he strongly opposed the president's proposed [[school voucher]]s, which would allow parents to use federal funding to pay for private schools. Both men cooperated to pass the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which dropped the concept of school vouchers but included Bush's idea of nationwide testing. Both houses of Congress registered overwhelming approval for the bill's final version, which Bush signed into law in January 2002.<ref name="smith166167">Smith (2016), pp. 166-167</ref> However, Kennedy would later criticize the implementation of the act, arguing that Bush had promised greater federal funding for education.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 50-52</ref>

===Surveillance and homeland security===

Shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], Bush announced the creation of the [[Office of Homeland Security]] and appointed former [[governor of Pennsylvania]] [[Tom Ridge]] its director.<ref>Draper (2007), p. 157</ref> After Congress passed the [[Homeland Security Act]] to create the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), Ridge became the first director of the newly-created department. The department was charged with overseeing immigration, border control, customs, and the newly-established [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA), which focused on [[airport security]].<ref name=mann6365/> Though the FBI and CIA remained independent agencies, the DHS was assigned jurisdiction over the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (which was divided into three agencies), the [[United States Customs Service]] (which was also divided into separate agencies), and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. The Homeland Security Act represented the most significant departmental reorganization since the [[National Security Act of 1947]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Glass |first1=Andrew |title=Bush creates Homeland Security Department, Nov. 26, 2002 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/this-day-in-politics-november-26-1012269 |accessdate=February 24, 2019 |publisher=Politico |date=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225102948/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/this-day-in-politics-november-26-1012269 |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On October 26, 2001, Bush signed into law the [[Patriot Act]]. Passed on the president's request, the act permitted increased sharing of intelligence among the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] and expanded the government's domestic authority to conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists.<ref name=mann6365/> The Patriot Act also authorized the use of [[roving wiretap]]s on suspected terrorists and expanded the government's authority to conduct surveillance of suspected "[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]]" terrorists.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=Everything you need to know about the Patriot Act debate |url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/politics/patriot-act-debate-explainer-nsa/index.html |accessdate=February 24, 2019 |publisher=CNN |date=May 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225102956/https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/politics/patriot-act-debate-explainer-nsa/index.html |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bush also secretly authorized the [[National Security Agency]] to [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|conduct warrantless surveillance]] of communications in and out of the United States.<ref name=mann6365>Mann (2015), pp. 63-65</ref>

===Healthcare===
After the passage of the Bush tax cuts and the No Child Left Behind Act, Bush turned his domestic focus to healthcare. He sought to expand [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] so it would also cover the cost of [[prescription drug]]s, a program that became known as [[Medicare Part D]]. Many congressional Democrats opposed the bill because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of drugs, while many conservative Republicans opposed the expansion of the government's involvement in healthcare. Assisted by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Senate majority leader [[Bill Frist]], Bush overcame strong opposition and won passage of his Medicare bill.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 390-391</ref> In December 2003, Bush signed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], the largest expansion of Medicare since the program's creation in 1965.<ref name="auto">Mann (2015), pp. 88-89</ref>

===Attempted Social Security reform===

After winning re-election in 2004, Bush made the partial privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] his top domestic priority.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 295–296</ref> He proposed restructuring the program so that citizens could invest some of the money they paid in [[payroll tax]]es, which fund the Social Security program.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 425-426</ref> The president argued that Social Security faced an imminent funding crisis and that reform was necessary to ensure its continuing solvency.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Prokop|first1=Andrew|title=In 2005, Republicans controlled Washington.

[[Hurricane Katrina]], one of the largest and most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the United States, ravaged several states along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in August 2005. On a working vacation at his ranch in Texas, Bush initially allowed state and local authorities to respond to the natural disaster. The hurricane made landfall on August 29, devastating the city of [[New Orleans]] after the [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans|failure of that city's levees]]. Over eighteen hundred people died in the hurricane, and Bush was widely criticized for his slow response to the disaster.<ref name="smith430443">Smith (2016), pp. 430-443</ref> Stung by the public response, Bush removed [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] director [[Michael D. Brown]] from office and stated publicly that "Katrina exposed serious problems in our response capability at all levels of government."<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 335–336</ref> After Hurricane Katrina, Bush's approval rating fell below 40 percent, where it would remain for the rest of his tenure in office.<ref name="smith430443"/>

===Proposed immigration reform===
[[File:Bush Addresses the Nation on Immigration Reform.jpg|thumb|right|President [[George W. Bush]] outlining his comprehensive immigration reform proposal in a television address.]]

Although he concentrated on other domestic policies during his first term, Bush supported [[immigration reform]] throughout his administration. In May 2006, he proposed a five-point plan that would increase [[border control|border security]], establish a [[guest worker program]], and create a [[path to citizenship]] for the twelve million [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States|illegal immigrants]] living in the United States. The Senate passed the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006]], which included many of the president's proposals, but the bill did not pass the House of Representatives. After Democrats took control of Congress in the 2006 mid-term elections, Bush worked with Ted Kennedy to re-introduce the bill as the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]]. The bill received intense criticism from many conservatives, who had become more skeptical of immigration reform, and it failed to pass the Senate.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 582-584</ref>

===Great Recession===
{{see also|Financial crisis of 2007–2008}}

After years of financial deregulation accelerating under the Bush administration, banks lent [[subprime mortgage]]s to more and more home buyers, causing a [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]]. Many of these banks also invested in [[credit default swap]]s and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] that were essentially bets on the soundness of these loans. In response to declining housing prices and fears of an impending recession, the Bush administration arranged passage of the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]]. Falling home prices started threatening the financial viability of many institutions, leaving [[Bear Stearns]], a prominent U.S.-based investment bank, on the brink of [[Bank failure|failure]] in March 2008. Recognizing the growing threat of a financial crisis, Bush allowed Treasury secretary Paulson to arrange for another bank, [[JPMorgan Chase]], to take over most Bear Stearn's assets. Out of concern that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] might also fail, the Bush administration put both institutions into [[conservatorship]]. Shortly afterwards, the administration learned that [[Lehman Brothers]] was on the verge of bankruptcy, but the administration ultimately declined to intervene on behalf of Lehman Brothers.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 126-132</ref>

Paulson hoped that the financial industry had shored itself up after the failure of Bear Stearns and that the failure of Lehman Brothers would not strongly impact the economy, but news of the failure caused stock prices to tumble and froze credit. Fearing a total financial collapse, Paulson and the Federal Reserve took control of [[American International Group]] (AIG), another major financial institution that teetered on the brink of failure. Hoping to shore up the other banks, Bush and Paulson proposed the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], which would create the $700 billion [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) to buy [[toxic asset]]s. The House rejected TARP in a 228–205 vote; although support and opposition crossed party lines, only about one-third of the Republican caucus supported the bill. After the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] dropped 778 points on the day of the House vote, the House and Senate both passed TARP. Bush later extended TARP loans to U.S. automobile companies, which faced [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008–10|their own crisis]] due to the weak economy. Though TARP helped end the financial crisis, it did not prevent the onset of the [[Great Recession]], which would continue long after Bush left office.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 132-137</ref><ref>Smith (2016), pp. 631-632, 659-660</ref>

===Social issues===
[[File:Richard Cheney 2005 official portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]]]

On his first day in office, President Bush reinstated the [[Mexico City policy]], thereby blocking federal aid to foreign groups that offered assistance to women in obtaining [[abortions in the United States|abortions]]. Days later, he announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations, despite the fears of critics that this would dissolve the traditional [[separation of church and state in the United States]].<ref>{{Cite news

After the Supreme Court struck down a state [[sodomy law]] in the 2003 case of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', conservatives began pushing for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.

===Environmental policies===

[[File:Us cabinet mtg.jpg|thumb|right|Cabinet meeting]]

In March 2001, the Bush administration announced that it would not implement the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international treaty signed in 1997 that required nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The administration argued that ratifying the treaty would unduly restrict U.S. growth while failing to adequately limit emissions from developing nations.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1247518.stm | work=BBC News | title=US blow to Kyoto hopes | date=March 28, 2001 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512181432/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1247518.stm | archive-date=May 12, 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref> Bush stated that he believed [[global warming]] is real<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with President Bush|work=White House Transcript|publisher=Politico|date=May 13, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2008|quote=Q.

===Taking office===

Upon taking office, Bush had little experience with foreign policy, and his decisions were guided by his advisers. Bush embraced the views of Cheney and other [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]], who de-emphasized the importance of [[multilateralism]]; neoconservatives believed that because the United States was the world's lone [[superpower]], it could act unilaterally if necessary.<ref name="smith181182"/> At the same time, Bush sought to enact the less [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy he had promised during the 2000 campaign.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 128–130</ref> Though the first several months of his presidency focused on domestic issues, the Bush administration pulled the U.S. out of several existing or proposed multilateral agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol, the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], and the [[International Criminal Court]].<ref name="smith181182">Smith (2016), pp. 181-182, 193</ref>

===September 11 attacks===

[[File:Remarks from Ground Zero September 14, 2001.webm|thumb|thumbtime=00:11|Bush making remarks from [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] on September 14, 2001]]

Terrorism had emerged as an important national security issue in the Clinton administration, and it became one of the dominant issues of the Bush administration.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 936, 941</ref> In the late 1980s, [[Osama bin Laden]] had established [[al-Qaeda]], a militant [[Sunni]] [[Islamist]] multi-national organization that sought to overthrow Western-backed governments in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], and [[Pakistan]]. In response to Saudi Arabia's decision to begin hosting U.S. soldiers in 1991, al-Qaeda had begun a terrorist campaign against U.S. targets, orchestrating attacks such as the 1998 [[USS Cole bombing]]. During Bush's first months in office, U.S. intelligence organizations [[September 11 intelligence before the attacks|intercepted communications indicating that al-Qaeda was planning another attack]] on the United States, but foreign policy officials were unprepared for a major attack on the United States.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 939–941</ref> Bush was briefed on al-Qaeda's activities, but focused on other foreign policy issues during his first months in office.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 145–146</ref>

On September 11, 2001, [[al-Qaeda]] [[terrorism|terrorists]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four airliners and flew two them into the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], destroying both 110-story skyscrapers. Another [[American Airlines Flight 77|plane]] crashed into [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], and a [[United Airlines Flight 93|fourth plane]] was brought down in Pennsylvania following a struggle between the terrorists and the aircraft's passengers.<ref name="mann5860"/> The attacks had a profound effect on many Americans, who felt vulnerable to international attacks for the first time since the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 941–942</ref> Appearing on national television on the night of the attacks, Bush promised to punish those who had aided the attacks, stating, "we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them." In the following days, Bush urged the public to renounce hate crimes and discrimination against [[Muslim-American]]s and [[Arab-American]]s.<ref name="mann5860">Mann (2015), pp. 58-60</ref> He also declared a "[[War on Terror]]", instituting new domestic and foreign policies in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 254-256</ref>

===War in Afghanistan===
{{Further|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}

[[File:Zalmay Khalilzad with George W. Bush in 2004.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Bush with U.S Ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Zalmay Khalilzad]].]]

As Bush's top foreign policy advisers were in agreement that merely launching strikes against al-Qaeda bases would not stop future attacks, the administration decided to overthrow [[Afghanistan]]'s conservative [[Taliban]] government, which harbored the leaders of al-Qaeda.<ref name=mann6166>Mann (2015), pp. 61-66</ref> Powell took the lead in assembling allied nations in a coalition that would launch attacks on multiple fronts.<ref>Herring (2008), p. 942</ref> The Bush administration focused especially on courting [[Pakistan]]i leader [[Pervez Musharraf]], who agreed to join the coalition.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 163–164</ref> On September 14, Congress passed a resolution called the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]], authorizing the president to use the military against those responsible for the attacks. On October 7, 2001 Bush ordered the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]].<ref name=mann6166/>

General [[Tommy Franks]], the commander of the [[United States Central Command]] (CENTCOM), drew up a four-phase invasion plan. In the first phase, the U.S. built up forces in the surrounding area and inserted CIA and special forces operatives who linked up with the [[Northern Alliance]], an Afghan resistance group opposed to the Taliban. The second phase consisted of a major air campaign against Taliban and al-Qaeda targets, while the third phase involved the defeat of the remaining Taliban and al-Qaeda forces. The fourth and final phase consisted of the stabilization of Afghanistan, which Franks projected would take three to five years. The war in Afghanistan began on October 7 with several air and missile strikes, and the Northern Alliance began its offensive on October 19. The capital of [[Kabul]] was captured on November 13, and [[Hamid Karzai]] was inaugurated as the new president of Afghanistan. However, the senior leadership of the Taliban and al-Qaeda, including bin Laden, avoided capture. Karzai would remain in power for the duration of Bush's presidency, but his effective control was limited to the area around Kabul, as various warlords took control of much of the rest of the country.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 942–943</ref> While the Karzai's government struggled to control the countryside, the Taliban regrouped in neighboring Pakistan. As Bush left office, he considered sending additional troops to bolster Afghanistan against the Taliban, but decided to leave the issue for the next administration.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 249-251, 602-605</ref>

===Bush Doctrine===

After the September 11 attacks, Bush's approval ratings increased tremendously. Inspired in part by the [[presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman administration]], Bush decided to use his newfound political capital to fundamentally change U.S. foreign policy. He became increasingly focused on the possibility of a hostile country providing [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) to terrorist organizations.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 166–169</ref> During his early 2002 [[State of the Union Address]], Bush set forth what has become known as the [[Bush Doctrine]], which held that the United States would implement a policy of [[Preemptive war|preemptive military strikes]] against nations known to be harboring or aiding a terrorist organization hostile to the United States.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 277-278</ref> Bush outlined what he called the "[[Axis of Evil]]," consisting of three nations that, he argued, posed the greatest threat to world peace due to their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and potential to aid terrorists. The axis consisted of [[Iraq]], [[North Korea]] and [[Iran]].<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 943–944</ref> Bush also began emphasizing the importance of spreading democracy worldwide, stating in 2005 that "the survival of liberty in our land depends on the success of liberty in other land." Pursuant to this newly-interventionist policy, the Bush administration boosted foreign aid and increased defense expenditures.<ref>Leffler (2011), pp. 34–35</ref> Defense spending rose from $304 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $616 billion in fiscal year 2008.<ref>Leffler (2011), pp. 37–38</ref>

During the [[presidency of George H. W. Bush]], the United States had launched the [[Gulf War]] against [[Iraq]] after the latter invaded [[Kuwait]]. Though the U.S. forced Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, it left [[Saddam Hussein]]'s administration in place, partly to serve as a counterweight to [[Iran]]. After the war, the [[Project for the New American Century]], consisting of influential neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz and Cheney, advocated for the overthrow of Hussein.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 179-180</ref> Iraq had [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|developed nuclear and chemical weapons]] prior to the Gulf War; after the war, it had submitted to WMD inspections conducted by the [[United Nations Special Commission]] until 1998, when Hussein demanded that all UN inspectors leave Iraq.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 174–175</ref> The administration believed that, by 2001, Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction, and could possibly provide those weapons to terrorists.<ref name="mann72"/> Some within the administration also believed that Iraq shared some responsibility for the September 11 attacks,<ref name="mann72">Mann (2015), pp. 72-75, 78-81</ref> and hoped that the fall of Hussein's regime would help spread democracy in the Middle East, deter the recruitment of terrorists, and increase the security of [[Israel]].<ref name="Herring, pp. 938–939"/>

In the days following the September 11 attacks, hawks in the Bush administration such as Wolfowitz argued for immediate military action against Iraq, but the issue was temporarily set aside in favor of planning the invasion of Afghanistan.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 61-63</ref> Beginning in September 2002, the Bush administration mounted a campaign designed to win popular and congressional support for the invasion of Iraq.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 947–949</ref> In October 2002, Congress approved the [[Iraq Resolution]], authorizing the use of force against Iraq. While congressional Republicans almost unanimously supported the measure, congressional Democrats were split in roughly equal numbers between support and opposition to the resolution.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 321-325</ref> Bowing to domestic and foreign pressure, Bush sought to win the approval of the [[United Nations]] before launching an attack on Iraq.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 312-314</ref> Led by Powell, the administration won the November 2002 passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]], which called on Iraq to dismantle its WMD program.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 330-331</ref> Meanwhile, senior administration officials became increasingly convinced that Iraq did indeed possess WMDs and was likely to furnish those WMDs to al-Qaeda; CIA Director [[George Tenet]] assured Bush that it was a "slam dunk" that Iraq possessed a stockpile of WMDs.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 185–186</ref>

After a [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|U.N. weapons inspections]] team led by [[Hans Blix]], as well as another team led by [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], failed to find evidence of an ongoing Iraqi WMD program, Bush's proposed regime change in Iraq faced mounting international opposition. Germany, China, France, and Russia all expressed skepticism about the need for regime change, and the latter three countries each possessed [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]] on the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 338-340</ref> At the behest of British prime minister [[Tony Blair]], who supported Bush but hoped for more international cooperation, Bush dispatched Powell to the U.N. to make the case to the Security Council that Iraq maintained an active WMD program.<ref name=smith343345/> Though Powell's presentation preceded a shift in U.S. public opinion towards support of the war, it failed to convince the French, Russians, or Germans.<ref name=smith343345>Smith (2016), pp. 343-345</ref> Contrary to the findings of Blix and ElBaradei, Bush asserted in a March 17 public address that there was "no doubt" that the Iraqi regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. Two days later, Bush authorized Operation [[Iraqi Freedom]], and the [[Iraq War]] began on March 20, 2003.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 353-355</ref>

====Invasion of Iraq====
{{Further|2003 invasion of Iraq}}

U.S.-led coalition forces, led by General Franks, launched a [[2003 invasion of Iraq|simultaneous air and land attack on Iraq]] on March 20, 2003, in what the American media called "[[shock and awe]]." With 145,000 soldiers, the ground force quickly overcomes most Iraqi resistance, and thousands of Iraqi soldiers deserted. The U.S. [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|captured]] the Iraqi capital of [[Baghdad]] on April 7, but Hussein escaped and went into hiding. While the U.S. and its allies quickly achieved military success, the invasion was [[Governmental positions on the Iraq War prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|strongly criticized by many countries]]; UN secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]] argued that the invasion was a [[Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq|violation of international law]] and the [[United Nations Charter|U.N. Charter]].<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 356-361</ref>

On May 1, 2003, Bush delivered the "[[Mission Accomplished speech]]," in which he declared the end of "major combat operations" in Iraq.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 192–196</ref> Despite the [[WMD conjecture in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq|failure to find evidence of an ongoing WMD program]]{{efn|No ongoing WMD program was ever found in Iraq,<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Beinart |first1=Peter |title=The Problem With Asking Republicans, 'Would You Have Invaded Iraq?' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/05/question-iraq-war-rubio-bush/393551/ |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |magazine=The Atlantic |date=May 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225161856/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/05/question-iraq-war-rubio-bush/393551/ |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Walcott |first1=John |title=What Donald Rumsfeld Knew We Didn’t Know About Iraq |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/iraq-war-wmds-donald-rumsfeld-new-report-213530 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |publisher=Politico |date=January 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225103027/https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/01/iraq-war-wmds-donald-rumsfeld-new-report-213530 |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> although the U.S. did discover some chemical weapons that had been produced prior to 1991.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kessler |first1=Glenn |title=Iraq WMD: Does the New York Times probe reflect what administration officials claimed? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/10/15/iraq-wmd-does-the-new-york-times-probe-reflect-what-administration-officials-claimed/ |accessdate=February 22, 2019 |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225044833/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/10/15/iraq-wmd-does-the-new-york-times-probe-reflect-what-administration-officials-claimed/ |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}} or an [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|operational relationship between Hussein and al-Qaeda]], Bush declared that the toppling of Hussein "removed an ally of al-Qaeda" and ended the threat that Iraq would supply weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations. Believing that only a minimal residual American force would be required after the success of the invasion, Bush and Franks planned for a drawdown to 30,000 U.S. troops in Iraq by August 2003. Meanwhile, Iraqis began looting their own capital, presenting one of the first of many challenges the U.S. would face in keeping the peace in Iraq.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 362-367</ref>

Bush appointed [[Paul Bremer]] to lead the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA), which was charged with overseeing the transition to self-government in Iraq. In his first major order, Bremer announced a policy of [[de-Ba'athification]], which denied government and military jobs to members of Hussein's [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath Party]]. This policy angered many of Iraq's [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], many of whom had joined the Ba'ath Party merely as a career move. Bremer's [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|second major order]] disbanded the Iraqi military and police services, leaving over 600,000 Iraqi soldiers and government employees without jobs. Bremer also insisted that the CPA remain in control of Iraq until the country held elections, reversing an earlier plan to set up a transition government led by Iraqis. These decisions contributed to the beginning of the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency]] opposed to the continuing U.S. presence. Fearing the further deterioration of Iraq's security situation, General [[John Abizaid]] ordered the end of the planned drawdown of soldiers, leaving over 130,000 U.S. soldiers in Iraq. The U.S. captured Hussein in December 2003, but the occupation force continued to suffer casualties. Between the start of the invasion and the end of 2003, 580 U.S. soldiers died, with two thirds of those casualties occurring after Bush's "Mission Accomplished" speech.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 368-380, 396</ref>

After 2003, more and more Iraqis began to see the U.S. as an occupying force. The fierce fighting of the [[First Battle of Fallujah]] alienated many in Iraq, while cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] encouraged [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Muslims to oppose the CPA.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 396-399</ref> Sunni and Shia insurgents engaged in a campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]] against the United States, blunting the technological and organizational advantages of the U.S. military.<ref name="auto1">Smith (2016), pp. 479-481</ref> While fighting in Iraq continued, Americans increasingly came to disapprove of Bush's handling of the Iraq War, contributing to a decline in Bush's approval ratings.<ref>Jacobson (2010), pp. 208–209</ref>

Bremer left Iraq in June 2004, transferring power to the [[Iraqi Interim Government]], which was led by [[Ayad Allawi]].<ref name="auto1"/> In January 2005, the Iraqi people [[January 2005 Iraqi legislative election|voted on]] representatives for the [[Iraqi National Assembly]], and the Shia [[United Iraqi Alliance]] formed a governing coalition led by [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]]. In October 2005, the Iraqis [[2005 Iraqi constitutional referendum|ratified a new constitution]] that created a decentralized governmental structure dividing Iraq into communities of Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurds]]. After a [[December 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election|December 2005 election]], Jafari was succeeded as prime minister by another Shia, [[Nouri al-Maliki]]. The elections failed to quell the insurgency, and hundreds of U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq died during 2005 and 2006. [[Sectarian violence in Iraq (2006–07)|Sectarian violence]] between Sunnis and Shias also intensified following the [[2006 al-Askari mosque bombing]].<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 482-487</ref> In a December 2006 report, the bipartisan [[Iraq Study Group]] described the situation in Iraq as "grave and deteriorating," and the report called for the U.S. to gradually withdraw soldiers from Iraq.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 533-534</ref>

As the violence mounted in 2006, Rumsfeld and military leaders such as Abizaid and [[George W. Casey Jr.|George Casey]], the commander of the [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|coalition forces in Iraq]], called for a drawdown of forces in Iraq, but many within in the administration argued that the U.S. should maintain its troop levels.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 494-496</ref> Still intent on establishing a democratic government in Iraq, the Bush administration rejected a drawdown and began planning for a change in strategy and leadership following the 2006 elections.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 512-515</ref> After the elections, Bush replaced Rumsfeld with Gates, while [[David Petraeus]] replaced Casey and [[William J.

In April 2007, Congress, now controlled by Democrats, passed a bill that called for a total withdrawal of all U.S. troops by April 2008, but Bush vetoed the bill.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 576-577</ref> Without the votes to override the veto, Congress passed a bill that continued to fund the war but also included the [[Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007]], which increased the federal [[minimum wage]].<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 578-579</ref> U.S. and Iraqi casualties continuously declined after May 2007, and Bush declared that the surge had been a success in September 2007.<ref name=smith596597>Smith (2016), pp. 596-597</ref> He subsequently ordered a drawdown of troops, and the number of U.S. soldiers in Iraq declined from 168,000 in September 2007 to 145,000 when Bush left office.<ref name=smith596597/> The decline in casualties following the surge coincided with several other favorable trends, including the [[Anbar Awakening]] and Muqtada al-Sadr's decision to order his followers to cooperate with the Iraqi government.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 598-600</ref> In 2008, at the insistence of Maliki, Bush signed the [[U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement]], which promised complete withdrawal of U.S. troops by the end of 2011.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 600-601</ref> The U.S. would [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007–2011)|withdraw]] its forces from Iraq in December 2011,<ref name=jlogan>{{cite news|last1=Logan|first1=Joseph|title=Last U.S. troops leave Iraq, ending war|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/18/us-iraq-withdrawal-idUSTRE7BH03320111218|accessdate=November 13, 2015|agency=Reuters|date=December 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011124811/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/18/us-iraq-withdrawal-idUSTRE7BH03320111218|archive-date=October 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> though it later re-deployed soldiers to Iraq to assist government forces in the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|Iraqi Civil War]].<ref name=bender>{{cite news|last1=Bender|first1=Bryan|title=Obama's Iraq Quagmire|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/iraq-barack-obama-us-military-combat-forces-islamic-state-118842|accessdate=November 13, 2015|work=Politico|date=June 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025203/http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/iraq-barack-obama-us-military-combat-forces-islamic-state-118842|archive-date=November 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Guantanamo Bay and enemy combatants===
{{Further|Guantanamo Bay detention camp}}

During and after the invasion of Afghanistan, the U.S. captured numerous members of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Rather than bringing the prisoners before domestic or international courts, Bush decided to set up a new system of [[military tribunal]]s to try the prisoners. In order to avoid the restrictions of the United States Constitution, Bush held the prisoners at secret [[Black site|CIA prisons]] in various countries as well as at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. Because the Guantanamo Bay camp is on territory that the U.S. technically leases from [[Cuba]], individuals within the camp are not accorded the same constitutional protections that they would have on U.S. territory. Bush also decided that these "[[enemy combatant]]s" were not entitled to all of the protections of the [[Geneva Conventions]] as they were not affiliated with sovereign states. In hopes of obtaining information from the prisoners, Bush allowed the use of "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]" such as [[waterboarding]].<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 66-71</ref> The [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib]], a U.S. prison in Iraq, elicited widespread outrage after photos of prisoner abuse were made public.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 384-387</ref>

In 2005, Congress passed the [[Detainee Treatment Act]], which purported to ban [[Torture and the United States|torture]], but in his [[signing statement]] Bush asserted that his executive power gave him the authority to waive the restrictions put in place by the bill.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 465-471</ref> Bush's policies suffered a major rebuke from the Supreme Court in the 2006 case of ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', in which the court rejected Bush's use of military commissions without congressional approval and held that all detainees were protected by the Geneva Conventions.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 499-501</ref> Following the ruling, Congress passed the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], which effectively overturned ''Hamdan''.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 505-507</ref> The Supreme Court overturned a portion of that act in the 2008 case of ''[[Boumediene v.

Believing that protectionism hampered economic growth, Bush concluded [[free trade agreement]]s with numerous countries. When Bush took office, the United States had free trade agreements with just three countries: Israel, Canada, and Mexico. Bush signed the [[Chile–United States Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement]] in 2003, and he concluded the [[Morocco-United States Free Trade Agreement]]
and the [[Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement]] the following year. He also concluded the [[Bahrain–United States Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Oman–United States Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Peru–United States Trade Promotion Agreement]], and the [[Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement]].

===North Korea===
{{see also|North Korea–United States relations}}

[[North Korea]] had [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|developed weapons of mass destruction]] for several years prior to Bush's inauguration, and the Clinton administration had sought to trade economic assistance for an end to the North Korean WMD program. Though Secretary of State Powell urged the continuation of the rapprochement, other administration officials, including Vice President Cheney, were more skeptical of the good faith of the North Koreans. Bush instead sought to isolate North Korea in the hope that the regime would eventually collapse.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 186-189</ref>

===AIDS relief===
Shortly after taking office, Bush pledged $200 million to [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].<ref name="auto2">Smith (2016), pp. 553-554</ref> Finding this effort insufficient, Bush assembled a team of experts to find the best way for the U.S. reduce the worldwide damage caused by the [[AIDS]] epidemic.<ref name="auto2"/> The experts, led by [[Anthony S. Fauci]], recommended that the U.S. focus on providing antiretroviral drugs to developing nations in Africa and the Caribbean.<ref name="auto2"/> In his State of the Union message in January 2003, President Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency [[AIDS]] relief, the [[President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief]]. With the approval of Congress, Bush committed $15 billion to this effort, which represented a huge increase compared to funding under previous administrations. Near the end of his presidency, Bush signed a re-authorization of the program that doubled its funding. By 2012, the PEPFAR program provided antiretroviral drugs for over 4.5 million people.<ref name="mann9192">Mann (2015), pp. 91-92</ref>

He visited six [[continent]]s: [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[South America]]. On one of his two trips to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], he visited three of the poorest countries in the world: [[Liberia]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Benin]]. He was the first sitting president to visit: [[Albania]], [[Bahrain]], Benin, [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iraq]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mongolia]], [[Qatar]], [[Slovakia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Bush also made a secret trip to Iraq on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 2003 to dine with the troops. His father had made a similar visit to the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia in 1990. On November 15–20, 2006, Bush made the third round the world presidential flight (after [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] and [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]]).

The number of visits per country where he travelled are:
* One visit to Albania, [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], Bahrain, Benin, [[Botswana]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Chile]], [[Croatia]], [[Denmark]], [[El Salvador]], Estonia, Georgia, [[Ghana]], [[Guatemala]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kuwait]], Liberia, Lithuania, Mongolia, [[Netherlands]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Panama]], [[Philippines]], [[Portugal]], Qatar, Rwanda, [[Senegal]], Slovakia, [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], Sweden, [[Tanzania]], [[Turkey]], [[Uganda]], [[Ukraine]], United Arab Emirates, [[Uruguay]], [[Vietnam]], and the West Bank

* Four visits to [[Canada]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Iraq]], and [[Japan]]
* Five visits to [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Vatican City]]
* Six visits to [[Italy]] and [[Mexico]]
* Seven visits to [[Russia]]

==Controversies==
{{see also|Political scandals during the George W. Bush Administration}}

===CIA leak scandal===

In July 2005, Bush and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s respective chief political advisers, Karl Rove and [[Scooter Libby|Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], came under fire for revealing the identity of covert [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[covert agent|agent]] [[Valerie Plame]] to reporters in the [[Plame affair|CIA leak scandal]].<ref name="smith452455"/> Plame's husband, [[Joseph C. Wilson]], had challenged Bush's assertion that Hussein had sought to obtain uranium from Africa, and a special prosecutor was tasked with determining whether administration officials had leaked Plame's identity in retribution against Wilson.<ref>Draper (2007), p. 309</ref> Libby resigned on October 28, hours after his [[indictment]] by a [[grand jury]] on multiple counts of [[perjury]], false statements, and [[obstruction of justice|obstruction]] in this case. In March 2007, Libby was convicted on four counts, and Cheney pressed Bush to pardon Libby. Rather than pardoning Libby or allowing him to go to jail, Bush commuted Libby's sentence, creating a split with Cheney, who accused Bush of leaving "a soldier on the battlefield."<ref name="smith452455">Smith (2016), pp. 452-455</ref>

===Dismissal of United States attorneys===
{{Main|Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy}}
[[File:George W Bush and Alberto Gonzales.jpg|thumb|President Bush announcing his nomination of Alberto Gonzales as the next U.S. Attorney General, November 10, 2004]]

In December 2006, Bush dismissed eight [[United States Attorney|United States attorney]]s. Though these attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president, the large-scale mid-term dismissal was without precedent, and Bush faced accusations that he had dismissed the attorneys for purely political reasons. During the 2006 elections, several Republican officials complained that the U.S. attorneys had not sufficiently investigated [[electoral fraud|voter fraud]]. With the encouragement of Harriet Miers and Karl Rove, Attorney General Gonzales dismissed eight U.S. attorneys who were considered insufficiently supportive of the administration's policies. Though Gonzales argued that the attorneys had been fired for performance reasons, publicly released documents showed that the attorneys were dismissed for political reasons. As a result of the dismissals and the subsequent congressional investigations, Rove and Gonzales both resigned. A 2008 report by the Justice Department inspector general found that the dismissals had been politically motivated, but no one was ever prosecuted in connection to the dismissals.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 564-575</ref>

By early 2006, his average rating was averaging below 40%, and in July 2008, a poll indicated a near all-time low of 22%.

In the 2002 mid-term elections, Bush became the first president since the 1930s to see his own party pick up seats in both houses of Congress. Republicans picked up two seats in the [[2002 United States Senate elections|Senate elections]], allowing them to re-take control of the chamber.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 78-79</ref> Bush delivered speeches in several venues in support of his party, campaigning on his desire to remove the administration of Saddam Hussein. Bush saw the election results as a vindication of his domestic and foreign policies.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 329-330</ref>

===2004 re-election campaign===
{{main|2004 United States presidential election}}
{{further|2004 United States elections|George W. Bush 2004 presidential campaign|2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004 Republican National Convention}}

Bush and his campaign team seized on the idea of Bush as a "strong wartime leader," though this was undermined by the increasingly-unpopular Iraq War.<ref name="auto"/> His conservative policies on tax cuts and several other issues appealed to many on the right, but Bush could also lay claim to some centrist achievements, including No Child Left Behind, Sarbanes-Oxley, and Medicare Part D.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 92-93</ref> Fearing that he might hurt Bush's re-election chances, Cheney offered to step down from the ticket, but Bush refused this offer, and the two were re-nominated without opposition at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]].<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 383-384</ref> On the advice of pollster [[Matthew Dowd]], who perceived a steady decline in the number of [[swing vote]]rs, the 2004 Bush campaign emphasized turning out conservative voters rather than the persuasion of moderates.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 392-393</ref>

[[File:ElectoralCollege2004.svg|thumb|right|Bush defeated Democrat [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 presidential election.]]

In the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic primaries]], Senator [[John Kerry]] of Massachusetts defeated several other candidates, effectively clinching the nomination on March 2. A [[Vietnam War]] veteran, Kerry had voted to authorize the Iraq War but had come to oppose it.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 401-403</ref> The Bush campaign sought to define Kerry as a "flip-flopper" due to his vote on a bill funding the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.<ref>Mann (2015), pp. 96-97</ref> Kerry sought to convince Republican senator John McCain to become [[Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 2004|his running mate]], but chose Senator [[John Edwards]] of North Carolina for the position after McCain rejected the offer.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 404-405</ref> The election saw a major jump in turnout; while 105 million people had voted in 2000, 123 million people voted in 2004. Bush won 50.7% percent of the popular vote, making him the first individual to win a majority of the popular vote since [[1988 United States presidential election]],
while Kerry took 48.3% of the popular vote. Bush won 286 electoral votes, winning Iowa, New Mexico, and every state he won in 2000 except for New Hampshire.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 412-415</ref>

===2006 mid-term elections===
{{main|2006 United States elections}}

Damaged by the unpopularity of the Iraq War and President Bush, the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 elections. Republicans were also damaged by various scandals, including the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] and the [[Mark Foley scandal]]. The elections confirmed Bush's declining popularity, as many of the candidates he had personally campaigned for were defeated. After the elections, Bush announced the resignation of Rumsfeld and promised to work with the new Democratic majority.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 519-526</ref>

===2008 elections and transition period===

[[File:ElectoralCollege2008.svg|thumb|right|Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in the 2008 presidential election.]]

Under the terms of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-second amendment]], Bush was ineligible to seek a third term in 2008. Senator John McCain won the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Republican primaries]], while Democratic senator [[Barack Obama]] of Illinois defeated Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] to win the Democratic presidential nomination.<ref name="smith634637"/> Obama's victory in the Democratic primaries was due in large part to his strong opposition to the Iraq War, as Clinton had voted to authorize the Iraq War in 2002.<ref>Jacobson (2010), pp. 212–213</ref> McCain sought to distance himself from the unpopular policies of Bush, and Bush appeared only by satellite at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], making him the first sitting president since [[Lyndon Johnson]] to not appear at his own party's convention.<ref name="smith634637">Smith (2016), pp. 634-637</ref>

McCain briefly took the lead in polls of the race taken after the Republican convention, but Obama quickly re-emerged as the leader in polls.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 637-638</ref> McCain's campaign was badly damaged by the unpopularity of the Bush administration and the Iraq War, and McCain's response to the outbreak of a full-blown financial crisis in September 2008 was widely viewed as erratic.<ref>Jacobson (2010), pp. 216–218</ref> Obama won 365 electoral votes and 52.9% of the popular vote. The election gave Democrats unified control of the legislative and executive branches for the first time since the [[1994 United States elections|1994 elections]]. After the election, Bush congratulated Obama and invited him to the White House. With the help of the Bush administration, the [[presidential transition of Barack Obama]] was widely regarded as successful, particularly for a transition between presidents of different parties.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 638-639</ref> During his [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]] on January 20, 2009, Obama thanked Bush for his service as president and his support of Obama's transition.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 652-654</ref>

In summing up evaluations of Bush's presidency, Gary L. Gregg II writes:

<blockquote>The Bush presidency transformed American politics, its economy, and its place in the world, but not in ways that could have been predicted when the governor of Texas declared his candidacy for America's highest office. As president, Bush became a lightning rod for controversy. His controversial election and policies, especially the war in Iraq, deeply divided the American people. Arguably his greatest moment as president was his initial, heartfelt response to the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks. Soon, however, his administration was overshadowed by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. President Bush's place in U.S. history will be debated and reconsidered for many years to come.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gregg II|first1=Gary L.|title=GEORGE W.
