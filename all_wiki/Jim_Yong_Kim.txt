==Career==

===Partners in Health (1987–2003)===
Jim Yong Kim, along with [[Paul Farmer]], Todd McCormack, Thomas J. White, and [[Ophelia Dahl]], co-founded [[Partners In Health]] (PIH) in 1987. The organization began with radical new, community-focused health care programs in [[Haiti]], which provided treatments based on local needs and trained community members to implement them. By the early 1990s, the program in Haiti was serving more than 100,000 people. It achieved success treating infectious diseases at low cost, spending $150 to $200 to cure [[tuberculosis]] patients in their homes, treatment that would have cost $15,000 to $20,000 in a U.S. hospital. Kim was instrumental in designing treatment protocols and making deals for cheaper, more effective drugs.

The PIH model was expanded to [[Peru]] in 1994. By 1998, successful results curing both common and serious ailments prompted the World Health Organization to embrace the model and support the adaptation of community-based care for impoverished communities around the world. Particular success in treating [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) prompted international organizations to rededicate efforts to the eradication of the disease, and in June 2002, the World Health Organization adopted prescriptions for dealing with the disease that were virtually the same as PIH had used in Peru. Kim's work with PIH to treat MDR-TB was the first large-scale attempt to treat the disease in a poor country, and the efforts have now been replicated in more than 40 countries around the world.<ref name=dbio1>[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~president/bio/ "Office of the President – Biography of Jim Yong Kim"], Dartmouth College website.</ref><ref>Hayoun, Massoud, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/how-jim-yong-kim-obamas-world-bank-pick-changed-global-health-aid/254972/ "How Jim Yong Kim, Obama's World Bank Pick, Changed Global Health Aid"], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', March 23, 2012.</ref>

PIH now employs more than 13,000 people in 12 countries. Kim left the organization as Executive Director in 2003.<ref name="forbes111611"/><ref>[http://www.pih.org/pages/partners-in-health-history/ "Partners in Health History"], pih.org.</ref><ref>Satchell, Michael, [https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31farmer.htm, “Wiping out TB and AIDS”], ''[[US News and World Report]]'', October 31, 2005.</ref><ref>Gustin, Sam, [http://business.time.com/2012/03/23/obamas-world-bank-pick-dr-jim-yong-kim-links-global-health-economic-development "Obama’s World Bank Pick, Dr. Jim Yong Kim, Links Global Health and Economic Development"], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', March 23, 2012</ref>

Kim's work with Partners in Health is documented in the 2017 film, ''[[Bending the Arc]]''.

===World Health Organization (2003–2006)===
Kim left PIH in 2003 to join the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as an adviser to the director-general. In March 2004, he was appointed as director of WHO's [[HIV/AIDS]] department, after having success creating programs to fight the disease at PIH. Kim oversaw all of WHO's work related to HIV/AIDS, focusing on initiatives to help developing countries scale up their treatment, prevention, and care programs. This included an ambitious "3x5 initiative" that was designed to put three million people in developing countries on AIDS treatment by the end of 2005. The goal was not met until 2007, but according to the WHO, served to push the treatment strategy for [[AIDS in Africa]] further and faster than could have otherwise been hoped.<ref name=mitbio>[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/corporate/pdf/kim.pdf "MIT Sloan Biography"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503035228/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/corporate/pdf/kim.pdf |date=May 3, 2012 }}, MIT Sloan Lecturer Biography.</ref><ref name=dnow62311>[http://now.dartmouth.edu/2011/06/leading-voices-lecturer-jim-yong-kim/ "Leading Voices Lecturer Jim Yong Kim"], ''Dartmouth Now'', June 23, 2011.</ref> As of 2012, the program has treated more than 7 million Africans with HIV.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/a-biographical-snapshot-of-jim-yong-kim-obamas-choice-to-head-the-world-bank/2012/03/23/gIQAwH3ZWS_story.html "A biographical snapshot of Jim Yong Kim, Obama’s choice to head the World Bank"], ''[[Associated Press]]'', March 23, 2012.</ref><ref>Boseley, Sarah, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/30/internationalaidanddevelopment.aids “WHO says Aids drug target unlikely to be hit”], ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 30, 2005.</ref>

===Harvard University (1993–2009)===
Beginning in 1993, Kim served as a lecturer at [[Harvard Medical School]], eventually holding professorships in medicine, social medicine and human rights. At the time of his departure in 2009, Kim held positions as Chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Chief of the Division of Global Health Equity at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], and Director of the [http://fxb.harvard.edu/ François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights] at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]],<ref name="mitbio"/><ref name="dnow62311"/><ref name=dbio>[http://www.dartmouth.edu/presidentelect/bio-kim.html “Introducing Dr. Jim Yong Kim, 17th President of Dartmouth”] Dartmouth College website.</ref> known internally as "The Four Pillars"{{citation needed|date=December 2015}},<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kim|first=Jim|date=23 March 2017|title=MEMORANDUM TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Strategy & Business Outlook FY18-20|url=https://www.miga.org/sites/default/files/2018/MIGAStrategy-Report2018-2020.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 October 2020|website=World Bank Group}}</ref> a term and concept taken from his earlier WHO work with HIV/AIDS (the 3x5 program).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/3by5/en/|title=WHO - The 3 by 5 Initiative|website=www.who.int}}</ref>

During his time at Harvard, Kim published numerous articles for leading academic and scientific journals, including the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', ''[[The Lancet]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', and others; and contributed to several books.

===Dartmouth College (2009–2012)===
In March 2009, Kim was named the 17th President of [[Dartmouth College]], becoming the first Asian-American to assume the post of president at an [[Ivy League]] institution. He oversaw the development of several innovative programs at Dartmouth, utilizing his past experience in health care and international affairs. In January 2010, Kim helped partner Dartmouth students and faculty with the organization he co-founded, Partners In Health, and other organizations, to respond to the devastating [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake in Haiti]], forming the Dartmouth Haiti Response. The initiative resulted in over $1 million in donations, the delivery of 18 tons of medical supplies and 25 volunteer medical professionals to Haiti, as well as hundreds of student volunteers contributing on campus.<ref>Fischer, Karin, [http://chronicle.com/article/Dartmouths-President-a-Gl/63557/ "Dartmouth's President, a Global Health Leader, Offers Perspectives on Helping Haiti"], ''The Chronicle on Higher Education'', January 14, 2010.</ref><ref>Barber, Bonnie, [http://now.dartmouth.edu/2010/03/dartmouth-rallies-to-help-haiti/ "Dartmouth Rallies to Help Haiti"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708023509/http://now.dartmouth.edu/2010/03/dartmouth-rallies-to-help-haiti/ |date=July 8, 2012 }}, ''Dartmouth Now'', March 1, 2010.</ref> In April 2010, Kim launched the National College Health Improvement Project (NCHIP), which convenes a number of expert institutions to develop quantitative methods to address student health issues.
