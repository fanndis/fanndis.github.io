[[File:The Manicure.jpg|thumb|''The Manicure'']]
A '''manicure''' is a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] [[beauty treatment]] for the [[fingernail]]s and hands performed at home or in a [[nail salon]]. A manicure consists of [[Nail file|filing]] and shaping the ''free edge'' of nails, pushing and clipping (with a cuticle pusher and cuticle nippers) any nonliving tissue (but limited to the [[cuticle]] and [[Hangnail|hangnails]]), treatments with various liquids, [[massage]] of the hand, and the application of [[fingernail polish]]. When the same is applied to the [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]] and feet, the treatment is referred to as a [[pedicure]]. Most nail polish can stay on nails for 2-3 weeks before another manicure, if there is no deliberate damage to it.

Some manicures include painting pictures or designs on the nails, or applying small [[decal]]s or imitation [[gemstone|jewel]]s (from 2 dimension to 3 dimension). Other nail treatments may include the application of [[Artificial nails|artificial]] [[gel nails]], tips, or [[Acrylic nails#Types|acrylic]]s, which may be referred to as ''French manicures''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-french-manicure.htm |title=What is a French Manicure? |website=Wisegeek.com}}</ref>

In many areas, manicurists are [[License|licensed]] and follow [[Regulation|regulations]]. Since skin is manipulated and is sometimes trimmed, there is a risk of spreading [[infection]] when tools are used across many people. Therefore, having improper [[sanitation]] can pose serious issues.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Etymology==
The English word ''manicure'' comes from the French word ''manucure'', meaning "care of the hands", which in turn originates from the [[Latin]] words ''manus'', for "hand", and ''cura'', for "care".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=manicure |title=Manicure definition |website= Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> Similarly, the English word ''pedicure'' comes from the [[Latin]] words ''pes (Genitive case - pedis)'', for "foot", and ''cura'', for "care".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=manicure |title=Pedicure definition |website= Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

Jeff Pink, founder of the professional nail brand ORLY, is credited with creating the natural nail look later called the French manicure in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/color-cosmetics/aha-moment-the-french-manicure-6883596/ |title=Aha! Moment: The French Manicure |website=Women's Wear Daily}}</ref>

In the mid-1970s, Pink was tasked by a film director to come up with a universal nail look that would save screen actresses from having to spend time getting their nails redone to go along with their costume changes. Inspired by the instant brightening effect of a white pencil applied to the underside, Pink suspected that the solution was to apply that same neutralizing principle to the top of the nail. "I got one gallon of white polish for the tips, and pink, beige, or rose for the nail," he recalled in a 2014 interview with ''The National''.

The Natural Nail Kit, as Pink called it then, was a hit among movie stars and the studios who found the time-saving strategy indispensable. "The director commented that I should get an Oscar for saving the industry so much money," he said. Eventually Pink took the trend to the catwalk crowd in Paris, and they liked it, too. The only thing it needed, he thought, was a kickier name. He came up with the whole "French" rebranding on the flight back home to Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/orly-s-jeff-pink-created-the-french-manicure-nearly-30-years-ago-1.645103|title=Orly's Jeff Pink created the French manicure nearly 30 years ago|website=The National|language=en|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref>

Nails that have undergone a French manicure are characterized by a lack of artificial base color and white tips at the free edge of the nail.  For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as "French tips".  The nail tips are painted white, while the rest of the nails are polished in a pink or a suitable nude shade.  French manicures can be achieved with [[artificial nails]].  However, it is also as common to perform a French manicure on natural nails.  Another technique is to whiten the underside of the nail with white pencil and paint a sheer color over the entire nail.{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}

===Hot oil manicures===
 
A hot oil manicure is a specific type of manicure that cleans the cuticles and softens them with oil. Types of oils that can be used are mineral oil, olive oil, some lotions or commercial preparations in an electric heater.

===Dip powder manicures===

Dip powder manicures are an alternative to traditional [[Artificial nails|acrylic nails]] and gel polish. Dip powders have become popular due to ease of application. They are similar to traditional silk or fiberglass enhancements, with the fiber being replaced by acrylic powder. Both methods rely on layering cyanoacrylate over the natural nail and encasing either the fiber or acrylic powder. While a single layer of fiber is typical, multiple alternating layers of powder and cyanoacrylate may be used in dip nails.

== Paraffin wax treatments ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Hands or feet can be covered in melted [[paraffin wax]] for softening and moisturizing. Paraffin wax is used because it can be heated to temperatures of over 95&nbsp;°F (35&nbsp;°C) without burning or injuring the body. The intense heat allows for deeper absorption of emollients and essential oils. The wax is usually infused with various botanical ingredients such as [[aloe vera]], [[azulene]], [[chamomile]], or [[tea tree oil]], and fruit waxes such as apple, peach, and strawberry, are often used in salons. Occasionally, lotion is rubbed on the hand or foot before being coated in paraffin. Paraffin wax treatments are often charged as an addition to the standard manicure or pedicure. They are often not covered in general training and are a rare treatment in most nail salons.

Professional services should not include dipping clients' hands or feet into a communal paraffin bath, as the wax can be a vector for disease. Paraffin should be applied in a way that avoids contamination, often by placing a portion of the wax into a bag or mitt, which is placed on the client's hand or foot and covered with a warm towel, cotton mitt, or booty to retain warmth. The paraffin is left for a few minutes until it has cooled.

===Sanitation options===
In Australia, the United States, and other countries,{{where|date=January 2016}} many nail salons offer personal nail tool kits for purchase to avoid some of the sanitation issues in the salon. The kits are often kept in the salon and given to the client to take home, or are thrown away after use. They are only used when that client comes in for a treatment.

Another option is to give the client the files and wooden cuticle sticks after the manicure. Since the 1970s, the overwhelming majority of professional salons use electric nail files that are faster and yield higher quality results, particularly with acrylic nail enhancements.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Shape==

==New York controversy==
