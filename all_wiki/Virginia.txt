'''Virginia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Virginia.ogg|v|ər|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i|ə}}), officially the '''Commonwealth of Virginia''', is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/united-states-regions/|title=United States Regions|first=National Geographic|last=Society|date=January 3, 2012|access-date=April 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327193614/https://www.nationalgeographic.org/maps/united-states-regions/|archive-date=March 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/|title=Mid-Atlantic Home : Mid–Atlantic Information Office : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=July 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408092405/https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/|archive-date=April 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> regions of the [[United States]] between the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The geography and climate of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] are shaped by the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] is the most-populous city, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] is the most-populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population {{as of|2019|lc=on}} is over 8.54{{nbsp}}million,<ref name=QuickFacts/> with 36% of them living in the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area]].

The area's history begins with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|several indigenous groups]], including the [[Powhatan]]. In 1607 the [[London Company]] established the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first permanent [[English overseas possessions|English colony]] in the [[New World]]. Virginia's state nickname, the Old Dominion, is a reference to this status. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 Colonies]] in the [[American Revolution]]. In the [[American Civil War]], Virginia's [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861|Secession Convention]] resolved to join the Confederacy while the [[Wheeling Convention#First Wheeling Convention|First Wheeling Convention]] resolved to remain in the Union, leading to a split that created [[West Virginia]]. Although the Commonwealth was under [[Solid South|one-party rule]] for nearly a century following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.<ref name=purple/>

Virginia's state legislature is the [[Virginia General Assembly]], which was established in 1619 and is the oldest continuous law-making body in North America. It is made up of a 40-member [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]] and a 100-member [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]].<ref name=hemisphere>{{cite news |url= https://www.dailypress.com/virginiagazette/news/va-vg-general-assembly-joint-session-0731-story.html |newspaper= The Virginia Gazette |title= General Assembly commemorates origins of democracy in America |first= Jack |last= Jacobs |date= July 30, 2019 |access-date= May 7, 2020}}</ref> The state government is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]; federal agencies in [[Northern Virginia]], including the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]]; and military facilities in [[Hampton Roads]], the site of the [[Virginia Port Authority|region's main seaport]].

The state's southern border is defined as [[Parallel 36°30′ north#In the United States|36°30' north latitude]], though surveyor error in the 1700s led to deviations of as much as three [[arcminute]]s.{{sfn|Hubbard, Jr.|2009|p=140}} From 1802 to 1803, a commission appointed by Virginia and [[Tennessee]] surveyed the area and set their border as a line from the summit of [[White Top Mountain]] to the top of the [[Cumberland Mountains]]. Errors discovered in 1856 led Virginia to propose a new surveying commission in 1871, but in 1893 the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decided in favor of the 1803 line in the case ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]''.{{sfn|Van Zandt|1976|pp=92–95}}{{sfn|Smith|2015|pp=71–72}} One result of this is the division of the city of [[Bristol, Virginia|Bristol]] between the two states.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.heraldcourier.com/news/pieces-of-the-past-supreme-court-looked-at-controversy-over/article_37075b77-6b6c-5a8b-a33d-4f74b5d3a0f1.html |title= Pieces of the Past: Supreme Court looked at controversy over Bristol border location |first1= Dalena |last1= Mathews |first2= Robert |last2= Sorrell |newspaper= Bristol Herald Courier |date= October 6, 2018 |access-date= September 16, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181006224334/https://www.heraldcourier.com/news/pieces-of-the-past-supreme-court-looked-at-controversy-over/article_37075b77-6b6c-5a8b-a33d-4f74b5d3a0f1.html |archive-date= October 6, 2018 |url-status= live }}</ref>

In the [[House of Burgesses]], opposition to [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] was led by [[Patrick Henry]] and [[Richard Henry Lee]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration/bio26.htm|title=Signers of the Declaration (Richard Henry Lee)|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=April 13, 2006|access-date=February 2, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611071114/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/declaration/bio26.htm|archive-date=June 11, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> Virginians began to [[committee of correspondence|coordinate their actions]] with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] the following year.{{sfn|Gutzman|2007|pp=24–29}} After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the [[Virginia Conventions]]. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted [[George Mason]]'s [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], which was then included in a new constitution.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=125–133}} Another Virginian, [[Thomas Jefferson]], drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].<ref name=mason>{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Stephan A.|title=George Mason: Forgotten Founder, He Conceived the Bill of Rights|journal=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|issue=2|page=142|date=May 2000|volume=31}}</ref>

When the [[American Revolutionary War]] began, [[George Washington]] was selected to head the [[Continental Army|colonial army]]. During the war, the capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack.{{sfn|Cooper|2007|p=58}} In 1781, the combined action of [[Continental Army|Continental]] and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the [[Virginia Peninsula]], where troops under George Washington and [[Comte de Rochambeau]] defeated British [[General Cornwallis]] in the [[Siege of Yorktown]]. His surrender on October 19, 1781 led to [[Peace of Paris (1783)|peace negotiations in Paris]] and secured the independence of the colonies.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=131–133}}

Virginians were instrumental in writing the [[United States Constitution]]. [[James Madison]] drafted the [[Virginia Plan]] in 1787 and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1789.<ref name=mason/> [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|Virginia ratified]] the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The [[three-fifths compromise]] ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Together with the [[Virginia dynasty]] of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], though the Virginian area was [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceded]] in 1846.{{sfn|Wallenstein|2007|p=104}} Virginia is called the "Mother of States" because of its role in being carved into states such as [[Kentucky]], which became the 15th state in 1792, and for the numbers of [[American pioneer]]s born in Virginia.<ref name=Robertson/>

===Civil War and aftermath===

[[File:Richmond Civil War ruins.jpg|thumb|left|Richmond was made the capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in 1861 and was partially burned by them prior to its [[Third Battle of Petersburg|recapture by Union forces]] in 1865.|alt=A single soldier stands among cannons and cannonballs across a river from the ruins of a city.]]

In addition to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries.{{sfn|Davis|2006|pp=125, 208–210}} The execution of [[Gabriel Prosser]] in 1800, [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion]] in 1831 and [[John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry]] in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the [[plantation economy]]. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31{{nbsp}}percent of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=490}} This division contributed to the start of the [[American Civil War]].

Virginia [[Ordinance of Secession|voted to secede]] from the United States on April 17, 1861, after the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call for volunteers. On April 24, Virginia joined the [[Confederate States of America]], which chose Richmond as its capital.<ref name=Robertson>{{harvnb|Robertson|1993|pp=8–12}}</ref> After the 1861 [[Wheeling Convention]], 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of [[West Virginia]], which chose to remain loyal to the [[Union (Civil War)|Union]]. Virginian general [[Robert E. Lee]] took command of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in 1862, and led invasions into Union territory, ultimately becoming commander of all Confederate forces. During the war, more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else, including [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], the [[Seven Days Battles]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], and the concluding [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|pp=4}} After the [[Siege of Petersburg|capture of Richmond]] in April 1865, the state capital was briefly moved to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Tripp|first=Steve|title=Lynchburg During the Civil War|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Lynchburg_During_the_Civil_War|website=Encyclopedia of Virginia|publisher=Library of Virginia|access-date=May 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517025843/http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Lynchburg_During_the_Civil_War|archive-date=May 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> while the Confederate leadership fled to [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]].{{sfn|Robertson|1993|p=170}} Virginia was formally restored to the United States in 1870, due to the work of the [[Committee of Nine]].{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=249–250}}

During the post-war [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], Virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]].{{sfn|Morgan|1992|pp=160–166}} The populist [[Readjuster Party]] ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white [[Democratic Party of Virginia|Democratic Party]] gained power after 1883.{{sfn|Dailey|Gilmore|Simon|2000|pp=90–96}} It passed segregationist [[Jim Crow laws]] and in 1902 rewrote the [[Constitution of Virginia]] to include a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and other voter registration measures that effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most African Americans and many poor European Americans.{{sfn|Wallenstein|2007|pp=253–254}} Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.{{sfn|Davis|2006|pp=328–329}}

===Post-Reconstruction===

[[File:USS Virginia in port, 1906-07.tiff|thumb|Many [[World War I]]-era warships were built in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], including the [[USS Virginia (BB-13)|USS ''Virginia'']].|alt=A white battleship with three smokestacks and two tall masts sitting in port.]]

New economic forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian [[James Albert Bonsack]] invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered around Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate [[Collis Potter Huntington]] founded [[Newport News Shipbuilding]], which was responsible for building six [[World War I]]-era [[dreadnought]]s, seven battleships, and 25 destroyers for the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1907 to 1923.{{sfn|Styron|2011|pp=42–43}} During the war, [[German Empire|German]] submarines like [[SM U-151|U-151]] attacked ships outside the port.{{sfn|Feuer|1999|pp=50–52}} In 1926, Dr. [[W.A.R.

[[File:Virginia Civil Rights Memorial wide.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Virginia Civil Rights Memorial]] was erected in 2008 to commemorate the protests which led to school desegregation.|alt=Bronze sculptures of seven figures marching stand around a large rectangular block of white engraved granite.]]

Protests started by [[Barbara Rose Johns]] in 1951 in [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville]] against segregated schools led to the lawsuit ''[[Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County]]''. This case, filed by Richmond natives [[Spottswood William Robinson III|Spottswood Robinson]] and [[Oliver Hill]], was decided in 1954 with ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', which rejected the segregationist doctrine of "[[separate but equal]]". But, in 1958, under the policy of "[[massive resistance]]" led by the influential segregationist Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]] and his [[Byrd Organization]], the Commonwealth prohibited [[desegregation|desegregated]] local schools from receiving state funding.{{sfn|Wallenstein|2007|pp=340–341}}

The [[civil rights movement]] gained many participants in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. In 1964 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ordered [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]] and others to [[racial integration|integrate]] schools.{{sfn|Wallenstein|2007|pp=357}} In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on [[Interracial marriage in the United States|interracial marriage]] with ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor [[Mills Godwin]] rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of [[Jim Crow laws]] had been achieved. In 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent, Jr.|Shade|2007|pp=359–366}}

The [[Cold War]] led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth.{{sfn|Accordino|2000|pp=76–78}} The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]] was involved in various [[Timeline of events in the Cold War|Cold War events]], including as the target of [[History of Soviet and Russian espionage in the United States|Soviet espionage activities]].

Virginia's culture was popularized and spread across America and the [[Southern United States|South]] by figures such as [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Robert E. Lee]]. Their homes in Virginia represent the birthplace of America and the South.{{sfn|McGraw|2005|p=14}} Modern Virginia culture has many sources, and is part of the [[culture of the Southern United States]].{{sfn|Fischer|Kelly|2000|pp=102–103}} The [[Smithsonian Institution]] divides Virginia into nine cultural regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/2007Festival/VA_Signs/SFF07_VA_Intro_Map.pdf |title=Roots of Virginia Culture |website=Smithsonian Folklife Festival 2007 |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=July 5, 2007 |access-date=September 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001175150/http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/2007Festival/VA_Signs/SFF07_VA_Intro_Map.pdf |archive-date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref>

Besides the general [[cuisine of the Southern United States]], Virginia maintains its own particular traditions.

The government today functions under the seventh [[Constitution of Virginia]], which was approved by voters in 1971 and is similar to the [[federal government of the United States|federal structure]] in that it provides for [[Separation of powers|three branches]]: a strong legislature, an executive, and a unified judicial system.<ref name=constitution/>

Virginia's legislature is bicameral with a 100-member [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and 40-member [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]], who together write the laws for the Commonwealth. Delegates serve two-year terms, while senators serve four-year terms, with [[2019 Virginia elections|the most recent elections]] for both taking place in November 2019. The executive department includes the [[Governor of Virginia|governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|lieutenant governor]], and [[Attorney General of Virginia|attorney general]], who are elected every four years in separate elections, with the next taking place in [[2021 Virginia gubernatorial election|November 2021]]. The governor must be at least 30 years old and [[List of Virginia Governors|incumbent governors]] cannot run for re-election, however the lieutenant governor and attorney general can, and governors can and have served non-consecutive terms.<ref name=constitution>{{cite journal|title=Commentaries on the Constitution of Virginia by A.

State elections in Virginia occur in odd-numbered years, with executive department elections occurring in years following U.S. presidential elections and [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]] elections occurring in the years prior to presidential elections, as both have four-year terms. [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] elections take place concurrent with each of those elections as members have two-year terms. National politics often play a role in state election outcomes, and Virginia has elected governors of the party opposite the U.S. president in ten of the last eleven contests, with only [[Terry McAuliffe]] beating the trend.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2017-elections/inside-data-what-virginia-election-results-mean-18-n820001 |title= Inside the Data: What the Virginia Election Results Mean for '18 |website= NBC News |date= November 12, 2017 |first= Dante |last= Chinni |access-date= November 7, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191119060422/https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2017-elections/inside-data-what-virginia-election-results-mean-18-n820001 |archive-date= November 19, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/polls-open-across-virginia-in-hotly-contested-governors-race/2013/11/04/06c6205c-45d2-11e3-bf0c-cebf37c6f484_story.html |title= McAuliffe narrowly wins Va. governor's race |newspaper= The Washington Post |first= Marc |last= Fisher |date= November 6, 2013 |access-date= November 7, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191107191400/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/polls-open-across-virginia-in-hotly-contested-governors-race/2013/11/04/06c6205c-45d2-11e3-bf0c-cebf37c6f484_story.html |archive-date= November 7, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>

==State symbols==

{{Main|List of Virginia state symbols}}
[[File:2017-06-12 15 45 41 'Welcome to Virginia' sign along eastbound U.S. Route 58 (Wilderness Road) entering Lee County, Virginia from Claiborne County, Tennessee crop.jpg|thumb|The state slogan, "[[Virginia is for Lovers]]", was developed in 1968 and is featured on the state's welcome signs.|alt=A large rectangular metal sign, mostly black, with the words "Welcome To Virginia" and "Virginia is for lovers" with a red heart symbol on the left.]]

The state nickname is its oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. Virginia was given the title "[[Dominion]]" by King [[Charles II of England]] at the time of [[The Restoration]], because it had remained loyal to the crown during the [[English Civil War]], and the present moniker, "Old Dominion" is a reference to that title. Charles' supporters were called [[Cavalier]]s, and "The Cavalier State" nickname was popularized after the [[American Civil War]] to romanticize the antebellum period. Sports teams from the [[University of Virginia]] are called the [[Virginia Cavaliers|Cavaliers]].{{sfn|Welch|2006|pp=1–3}} The other nickname, "Mother of Presidents", is also historic, as eight Virginians have served as [[Lists of United States Presidents by place of birth#By state of birth|President of the United States]], including four of the first five.<ref name=factpack>{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/class_media/4_5_pdfs/factpack-1.pdf |title=Factpack |publisher=[[Virginia General Assembly]] |date=January 11, 2007 |access-date=October 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028193205/http://legis.state.va.us/1_cap_class/class_media/4_5_pdfs/factpack-1.pdf |archive-date=October 28, 2008 }}</ref>

The state's motto, ''[[Sic semper tyrannis|Sic Semper Tyrannis]]'', translates from Latin as "Thus Always to Tyrants", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pilotonline.com/news/article_36f89ba4-ca4a-529a-be8f-31e8c1736068.html |title=Cuccinelli opts for more modest Virginia state seal |first= Julian |last= Walker |newspaper= The Virginian-Pilot |date= May 1, 2010 |access-date= June 7, 2020}}</ref> The majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.richmond.com/discover-richmond/the-state-of-the-state-emblems-checking-in-on-a-dozen-of-virginias-official-symbols/collection_7eafce86-1f1c-5d24-b9d0-dd2d83799482.html |title= The state of the state emblems: Checking in on a dozen of Virginia's official symbols |newspaper= The Richmond Times-Dispatch |date=February 18, 2017 |access-date= June 7, 2020}}</ref> The [[Virginia reel (dance)|Virginia reel]] is among the [[square dance]]s classified as the [[List of U.S. state dances|state dance]].<ref name=eov>{{harvnb|The Encyclopedia of Virginia|1999|pp=2–15}}</ref> In 1940, Virginia made "[[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]]" the [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]], but it was retired in 1997 due to its references to slavery.
