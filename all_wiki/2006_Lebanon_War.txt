The principal parties were [[Hezbollah]] paramilitary forces and the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). The conflict started on 12 July 2006, and continued until a United Nations-brokered [[ceasefire]] went into effect in the morning on 14 August 2006, though it formally ended on 8 September 2006 when Israel lifted its naval [[blockade]] of Lebanon.

On 11 August 2006, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701]] (UNSCR 1701) in an effort to end the hostilities. The resolution, which was approved by both the Lebanese and Israeli governments the following days, called for disarmament of Hezbollah, for withdrawal of the IDF from Lebanon, and for the deployment of the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] and an enlarged [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) in the south.

== Background ==
{{Main|Israeli–Lebanese conflict}}
Cross-border attacks from [[southern Lebanon]] into Israel by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) dated as far back as 1968, and followed the [[Six-Day War]]; the area became a significant base for attacks following the arrival of the PLO leadership and its [[Fatah]] brigade following their 1971 [[Black September in Jordan|expulsion from Jordan]]. Starting about this time, increasing [[Demographics of Lebanon|demographic tensions]] related to the Lebanese [[National Pact]], which had divided governmental powers among religious groups throughout the country 30 years previously, began running high and led in part to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–1990).

Concurrently, Syria began a [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|29-year military occupation]] in 1976. Israel's [[Operation Litani|1978 invasion of Lebanon]] failed to stem the Palestinian attacks in the long run, but [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] again in 1982 and forcibly expelled the PLO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,CHRON,,LBN,469f38b21e,0.html |title=Chronology for Druze in Lebanon |publisher=UN High Commissioner for Refugees |access-date=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018152915/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type%2CCHRON%2C%2CLBN%2C469f38b21e%2C0.html |archive-date=18 October 2012 }}</ref> Israel withdrew to a [[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|borderland buffer zone]] in southern Lebanon, held with the aid of proxy militants in the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA).<ref name="Encarta: Arab–Israeli Conflict">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588322_2/Arab-Israeli_Conflict.html#s6 |title=Arab–Israeli Conflict |access-date=13 July 2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta Encyclopedia |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWKLyKq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588322_2/Arab-Israeli_Conflict.html |archive-date=31 October 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The invasion also led to the conception of a new [[Shi'a]] [[Paramilitary|militant group]], which in 1985, established itself politically under the name [[Hezbollah]], and declared an armed struggle to end the [[South Lebanon conflict (1985–2000)|Israeli occupation]] of Lebanese territory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4314423.stm|title=Who are Hezbollah?|work=BBC News|access-date=20 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="Encarta: Hassan Nasrallah">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_701835564/Nasrallah_Hassan.html |title=Hassan Nasrallah |access-date=19 March 2007 |encyclopedia=Encarta Encyclopedia |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWFl3Rk?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_701835564/Hassan_Nasrallah.html |archive-date=31 October 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> When the Lebanese Civil War ended and other warring factions agreed to disarm, both Hezbollah and the SLA refused.

The withdrawal also led to the immediate collapse of the SLA, and Hezbollah quickly took control of the area. Later, citing continued Israeli control of the [[Shebaa farms]] region and the [[internment]] of [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel]], Hezbollah intensified its cross-border attacks, and used the tactic of seizing soldiers from Israel as leverage for a [[Israeli MIA prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange]] in 2004.<ref name="Institute for Palestinian Studies">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009123926/http://71.18.226.238/final/en/bn/viewbndetails.php?bnid=13|archive-date=9 October 2007|url-status=dead|url=http://71.18.226.238/final/en/bn/viewbndetails.php?bnid=13|title=What the Struggle Over a Cease-Fire Could Mean for US-Israeli Unilateralism|access-date=13 July 2008|publisher=Institute for Palestinian Studies}}</ref><ref name=Boston>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/08/08/death_and_destruction_are_hezbollahs_goals/ |title=Death and destruction are Hezbollah's goals |date=8 August 2006 |access-date=13 July 2008 |work=The Boston Globe |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gpG2V4Os?url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/08/08/death_and_destruction_are_hezbollahs_goals/ |archive-date=17 May 2009 |url-status=live |first1=Andrea |last1=Levin  }}</ref> All told, from summer 2000, after the Israeli withdrawal, until summer 2006, Hezbollah conducted approximately 200 attacks on Israel – most of them artillery fire, some raids and some via proxies inside Israel.

In August 2006, in an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Seymour Hersh]] claimed that the [[White House]] gave the green light for the [[Israeli government]] to execute an attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon.

According to Conal Urquhart in ''[[The Guardian]]'', the Winograd Committee leaked a testimony from Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] suggesting that Olmert "had been preparing for such a war at least four months before the official ''casus belli'': the capture by Hezbollah of two Israeli soldiers from a border post on 12 July 2006."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/09/syria.israelandthepalestinians|title=Israel planned for Lebanon war months in advance, PM says|author=Conal Urquhart|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 September 2014}}</ref>

=== Abduction efforts in the year prior to conflict ===
In June 2005, an [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) paratroop unit operating near the [[Shebaa Farms]] engaged three Lebanese it identified as Hezbollah special force members, killing one. Videotapes recovered by the paratroopers contained footage of the three recording detailed accounts of the area.<ref name="Harel">{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/chronicle-of-disaster-1.249950 |title=Chronicle of Disaster |work=Haaretz |author=Amos Harel |date=18 July 2008 |access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>

Over the following 12 months, Hezbollah made three unsuccessful attempts to abduct Israeli soldiers. On 21 November 2005, a number of Hezbollah special forces attempted to attack an Israeli outpost in [[Ghajar]], a village straddling the border between Lebanon and the [[Golan Heights]]. The outpost had been deserted following an intelligence warning, and three of the Hezbollah militants were killed when Israeli sniper David Markovich shot a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] they were carrying, causing it to explode. From his sniper position, Markovich shot and killed a fourth gunman shortly thereafter.<ref name="Harel"/><ref>Dudkevitch, "Paratrooper Sniper Becomes Hero", ''Jerusalem Post'' Online Edition, 22 November 2005.</ref>

At the same time, a Hezbollah ground contingent infiltrated the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|border]] into Israel through a "dead zone" in the border fence, hiding in an overgrown [[wadi]]. They attacked a patrol of two Israeli [[Humvee]]s patrolling the border near Zar'it, using pre-positioned explosives and anti-tank missiles, killing three soldiers, injuring two, and capturing two soldiers (First Sergeant [[Ehud Goldwasser]] and Sergeant First Class [[Eldad Regev]]).<ref name=unreport/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Israel/Lebanon Under fire: Hizbullah's attacks on northern Israel|date=14 September 2006|access-date=27 September 2006|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde02/025/2006/en/}}</ref>

In response to the Hezbollah feint attacks, the IDF conducted a routine check of its positions and patrols, and found that contact with two jeeps was lost. A rescue force was immediately dispatched to the area, and confirmed that two soldiers were missing after 20 minutes. A [[Merkava|Merkava Mk III]] tank, an [[Armored personnel carrier]], and a [[helicopter]] were immediately dispatched into Lebanon. The tank hit a large land mine, killing its crew of four. Another soldier was killed and two lightly injured by mortar fire as they attempted to recover the bodies.<ref name=unreport /><ref name="Exit Strategy" />

Hezbollah named the attack "[[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|Operation Truthful Promise]]" after leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]]'s public pledges over the prior year and a half to seize Israeli soldiers and swap them for [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel|four Lebanese held by Israel]]:

Nasrallah claimed that Israel had broken a previous deal to release these prisoners, and since diplomacy had failed, violence was the only remaining option.<!-- Quote: "Second, the reason for today's operation was one-upmanship within the enemy government during the previous prisoner exchange.

On 16 July, the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli Cabinet]] released a communiqué explaining that, although Israel had engaged in military operations ''within'' Lebanon, its war was not against the Lebanese government.

During the first day of the war the Israeli Air Force, artillery and navy conducted more than 100 attacks mainly against Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon, among them the regional headquarters in Ya'tar. Five bridges across the Litani and Zahrani rivers were also destroyed, reportedly to prevent Hezbollah from transferring the abducted soldiers to the north.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Hizbullah/Pages/Hizbullah%20attack%20on%20northern%20border%20and%20IDF%20response%2012-Jul-2006.aspx |title=IDF Spokesman: Hizbullah attack on northern border and IDF response |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=12 July 2006|access-date=3 July 2013}}</ref>

Attacks from land, sea and air continued in the following days. Among the targets hit were the Hezbollah headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut as well as the offices and homes of the leadership, the compounds of [[al-Manar]] TV station and [[al-Nour]] radio station, and the runways and fuel depots of the [[Rafic Hariri International Airport]] in Beirut.

It was later reported that the Israel Air Force after midnight, 13 July, attacked and destroyed 59 stationary medium range [[Fajr]] rocket launchers positioned throughout southern Lebanon. '''[[Operation Density]]''' allegedly only took 34 minutes to carry out but was the result of six years of intelligence gathering and planning. Between half and two-thirds of Hezbollah medium range rocket capability was estimated by the IDF to have been wiped out. According to Israeli journalists Amos Harel and Avi Issacharoff the operation was "Israel's most impressive military action" and a "devastating blow for Hezbollah". In the coming days IAF allegedly also attacked and destroyed a large proportion of Hezbollah's long range [[Zelzal-2]] missiles.<ref>Harel and Issacharof, p. 91–92</ref>

According to military analyst [[William Arkin]] there is "little evidence" that the Israeli Air Force even attempted, much less succeeded in, wiping out the medium and long range rocket capability in the first days of the war. He dismissed the whole claim as an "absurdity" and a "tale".<ref>Arkin p.128–129</ref> Benjamin Lambeth, however, insisted that it was far-fetched to suggest that the "authoritative Israeli leadership pronouncements" were not based on facts. He admitted however that there was "persistent uncertainty" surrounding the "few known facts and figures" concerning the alleged attacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG835.html |title=Air operations in Israel's war against Hezbollah: learning from Lebanon and getting it right in Gaza |publisher=RAND Corporation |author=Lambeth, Benjamin S. |year=2011|access-date=20 November 2012}}</ref> [[Anthony Cordesman]] believed that IAF probably destroyed most long and medium range missiles in the first two days of the war but acknowledged that these claims "have never been validated or described in detail."<ref>Cordesman, 2007, p. 10 and 30</ref>

Hezbollah long remained silent on this episode of the war. On the sixth anniversary of the Lebanon war Hezbollah chairman Hassan Nasrallah claimed that Hezbollah had known that the Israelis were collecting information on the rocket platforms and launchers and managed to move them without being detected. Most of the locations attacked by the Israeli air force were therefore empty.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.alahednews.com.lb/essaydetails.php?eid=20509&cid=444&st=Sayyed%20Nasrallah%20Speech%20on%206th%20Anniversary%20of%20Divine%20Victory#.UmqS4xBQhSI |title=Sayyed Nasrallah Speech on 6th Anniversary of Divine Victory: "Israel's" Operation Was Qualitative Illusion |publisher=Moqawama |author=Nour Rida |date=18 July 2012|access-date=20 November 2012}}</ref>

The combined effect of the massive air and artillery bombardment on Hezbollah capacity to fire short-range Katyusha rockets on northern Israel was very meager. According to the findings of the post-war military investigations the IDF shelling succeeded only in destroying about 100 out of 12,000 Katyusha launchers. The massive fire led to a severe shortage of ammunition towards the end of the war.<ref>Rapaport (2010), p.19</ref>

Northern command had prepared a list before the war on potential Hezbollah targets, identified by the Israeli intelligence, to be struck in case of renewed hostilities. By the fourth day of the war the IDF ran out of targets, as all the 83 targets on the list had already been hit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/idf-preparing-for-next-lebanon-war-based-on-bank-of-possible-targets.premium-1.469660 |title=IDF preparing for next Lebanon war based on 'bank' of possible targets |work=Haaretz|author=Amos Harel |date=13 October 2012 |access-date=8 November 2012}}</ref> A high-ranking IDF officer told reporters off the record that the Israeli Chief of Staff Dan Halutz had ordered the air force to destroy ten 12-story buildings in the Southern suburbs of Beirut for every rocket that fell on Haifa.

=== Hezbollah rocket attacks ===
[[File:2006crisis lebanon israel.png|thumb|Map showing some of the localities in Israel and the Golan Heights hit by rockets fired from Lebanese soil as of Monday 7 August.]]
[[File:KiryatShmona Rocket Damage.JPG|thumb|upright|Structural damage of a residential building in [[Kiryat Shmona]] after being hit by a rocket]]
On 16 July, eight employees of the Israel Railways were killed by direct rocket hits on the Haifa train depot.<ref name="mfa_casualties" /> Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah defended the attacks, saying that Hezbollah initially had aimed its rockets on "military sites only". But since Israel, he said, had systematically bombed civilian targets he felt that Hezbollah had no choice but to answer in kind and target Israeli cities.<ref>HRW (August 2007), pp. 99–100</ref>

The attack on the Haifa depot was not the first civilian target to be hit by Hezbollah. Civilians in the border communities were hurt in the initial cover fire on IDF positions for the cross-border raid. Two Israeli civilians were killed in an attack near the air force base at [[Mount Meron]] on July, 14. Since Hezbollah rockets were not very accurate it is unclear whether civilians were intentionally targeted in these attacks. After the attack on Haifa, however, Hezbollah made no attempt to cover this fact. According to a Human Rights Watch study civilian Israeli targets were mentioned four times as often in official Hezbollah war time communiques as was military targets.<ref>HRW (August 2007), p. 11</ref>

Hezbollah TV station al-Manar warned both in Arabic and Hebrew specific Israeli communities for future rocket attacks.<ref>Ehrlich, p. 238</ref> Similarly Hezbollah sent text messages to warn Israeli residents to evacuate their homes to avoid being targeted by rocket attacks.<ref>Cordesman (2007), p. 143</ref>

Israel published an alleged range card for upgraded Grad rocket launcher placed outside the village of Shihin in the Western sector of South Lebanon, issued by the Artillery Department of the elite Nasr Unit of Hezbollah. This list included 91 targets, 56 of whom were civilian and 27 were IDF posts or bases. The military targets had three-digit reference numbers while civilian targets had double-digit numbers.<ref>Ehrlich p. 166</ref>

During the war, the [[Hezbollah rocket force]] fired between 3,970 and 4,228 rockets at a rate of more than 100 per day, unprecedented since the [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref name="Mideast War, by the numbers" /><ref name="RCANI" /> About 95% of these were 122&nbsp;mm (4.8&nbsp;in) [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] [[rocket artillery|artillery rockets]], which carried warheads up to 30&nbsp;kg (66&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]) and had a range of up to 30&nbsp;km (19&nbsp;mi).<ref name="RCANI" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5187974.stm|title=Hezbollah's rocket force|work=BBC News|date=18 July 2006|access-date=13 July 2008}}</ref> An estimated 23% of these rockets hit cities and built-up areas across northern Israel, while the remainder hit open areas.<ref name="jdw230806" /><ref name="Mideast War, by the numbers">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081700909_pf.html|title=Mideast War, by the numbers|work=The Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|date=18 August 2006|access-date=21 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="RCANI" />

After the high number of Lebanese civilian casualties in the [[Qana airstrike]], Israel announced a unilateral freeze in its air attacks on Lebanon. Hezbollah then halted its own rocket attacks on Israel. When Israel resumed its air attacks on Lebanon, Hezbollah followed suit and recommenced rocket attacks on Israeli targets.<ref>Harel and Issacharoff, p. 170</ref>

Hezbollah rocket attacks also targeted and succeeded in hitting military targets in Israel. The Israeli military censorship was, however, very strict and explicitly forbade Israel-based media from reporting such incidents.

Hezbollah engaged in [[guerrilla warfare]] with IDF ground forces, fighting from well-fortified positions, often in urban areas, and attacking with small, well-armed units. Hezbollah fighters were highly trained, and were equipped with flak jackets, [[night vision device|night-vision goggles]], communications equipment, and sometimes with Israeli uniforms and equipment. An Israeli soldier who participated in the war said that Hezbollah fighters were "nothing like [[Hamas]] or the Palestinians. They are trained and highly qualified. All of us were kind of surprised."<ref name="disciplined" />

During engagements with the IDF, Hezbollah concentrated on inflicting losses on the IDF, believing an unwillingness to absorb steady losses to be Israel's strategic weakness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%DD=860|title=The Jamestown Foundation: single|publisher=Jamestown.org|access-date=29 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418050331/http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1|archive-date=18 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Hezbollah countered IDF armor through the use of sophisticated Iranian-made [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGMs). According to Merkava tank program administration, 52 [[Merkava]] [[main battle tank]]s were damaged (45 of them by different kinds of ATGM), missiles penetrated 22 tanks, but only 5 tanks were destroyed, one of them by an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED). The Merkava tanks that were penetrated were predominantly [[Merkava II|Mark II]] and Mark III models, but five [[Merkava Mk. IV|Mark IV]]s were also penetrated. All but two of these tanks were rebuilt and returned to service.<ref name="jdw230806" />

The IDF declared itself satisfied with the Merkava Mark IV's performance during the war. Hezbollah caused additional casualties using ATGMs to collapse buildings onto Israeli troops sheltering inside.<ref name="jdw230806" /> As a result, IDF units did not linger in any one area for an extended period of time.<ref name="disciplined" /> Hezbollah fighters often used [[Tunnel warfare|tunnels]] to emerge quickly, fire an anti-tank missile, and then disappear again.<ref name="disciplined">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/world/middleeast/07hezbollah.html|work=The New York Times|first1=Steven|last1=Erlanger|first2=Richard A.|last2=Oppel Jr|title=A Disciplined Hezbollah Surprises Israel With Its Training, Tactics and Weapons|date=7 August 2006|access-date=25 November 2011}}</ref>

On 11 August 2006 the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved [[UN Security Council Resolution 1701]], in an effort to end the hostilities. It was accepted by the Lebanese government and Hezbollah on 12 August 2006, and by the Israeli government on 13 August 2006.

== Techniques ==
=== Cluster and phosphorus munitions ===
{{See also|Convention on Cluster Munitions}}
Both sides used [[cluster bombs#Lebanon, 1978, 1982 and 2006|cluster bombs]] during the conflict. Israel fired 4.6&nbsp;million submunitions into dozens of towns and villages in southern Lebanon in 962 separate strikes, circa 90% within the final 72 hours of the war, when the conflict already had been largely resolved by UN Security Council Resolution 1701.<ref name=HRW_Flooding>Human Rights Watch, February 2008 [https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/lebanon0208/lebanon0208web.pdf ''Flooding South Lebanon − Israel's Use of Cluster Munitions in Lebanon in July and August 2006''], Volume 20, No. 2(E).

Hezbollah fired 4,407 submunitions into civilian-populated areas of northern Israel in 113 separate strikes, using Chinese made [[Type 81 (rocket launcher)|Type-81]] 122mm rockets, and Type-90 submunitions. These attacks killed one civilian and wounded twelve.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/10/18/lebanonisrael-hezbollah-hit-israel-cluster-munitions-during-conflict|title=Lebanon/Israel: Hezbollah Hit Israel with Cluster Munitions During Conflict|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=18 October 2006|access-date=16 January 2011}}</ref>

[[Human Rights Watch]] "found that the IDF's use of cluster munitions was both indiscriminate and disproportionate, in violation of IHL, and in some locations possibly a war crime" because "the vast majority [were dropped] over the final three days when Israel knew a settlement was imminent."<ref name=HRW_Flooding /> After the ceasefire, parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexploded cluster bomblets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5382192.stm|title='Million bomblets' in S Lebanon|work=BBC News|date=26 September 2006|access-date=13 July 2008}}</ref>

=== Psychological warfare ===
{{See also|Psychological warfare|Information warfare|Disinformation}}
During the war, the IAF dropped 17,000 leaflets over Lebanon in 47 missions, and sent more than 700,000 computerized voice messages. Many of them contained caricatures of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah leading Lebanon to ruin and making civilians suffer, showing them as puppets of Iran and Syria, and calling on civilians to help remove Hezbollah. Another leaflet addressing Hezbollah fighters told them that they were lied to by their leaders, that they were "sent like sheep to be butchered, lacking military training and without proper combat gear", that they could not hope to face "highly trained soldiers that fight to protect their homeland, their people, and their home", referring to them as "mercenaries" without the support of the Lebanese public, and urging them to run and save their lives. On 26 July, Israel dropped leaflets containing illustrations of nine tombstones with the name of a dead Hezbollah fighter on each one, in response to Nasrallah "deceiving" people on the amount of Hezbollah casualties. Another leaflet urged Hezbollah fighters to stop bleeding and fighting for Nasrallah, who sat safe in a bunker, to stop fighting against Lebanese national interests, and to return to their homes and families. On 11 August, Israel dropped leaflets accusing Hezbollah of hiding its "great losses", and containing the names of 90–100 Hezbollah fighters killed. Israeli technicians also hacked into [[Al-Manar]] and broadcast clips, criticizing Nasrallah, showing the bodies of Hezbollah fighters, footage from Israeli raids and airstrikes, and captured Hezbollah equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psywar.org/israellebanon.php|title=Psychological Operations during the Israel–Lebanon War 2006|publisher=Psywar.org|access-date=16 January 2011}}</ref>

=== Hezbollah and other militias ===
During the war Hezbollah kept a firm lid on its casualties. Although it did announce casualty numbers in some of the clashes, the party did not publish a comprehensive estimate for the duration of the war. A tally made by [[Associated Press]] counted to 70 dead Hezbollah fighters officially acknowledged by party during the war.<ref name=Ghattas>{{cite news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206055402/http://news.usti.net/home/news/cn/?%2Fworld.mideast.misc%2F1%2Fwed%2Fbq%2FAlebanon-war-deaths.RYBR_GDS.html |archive-date=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead |url=http://news.usti.net/home/news/cn/?/world.mideast.misc/1/wed/bq/Alebanon-war-deaths.RYBR_GDS.html |title=Lebanon Sees More Than 1,000 War Deaths |agency=Associated Press |author=Sam Ghattas |date=28 December 2006 }}</ref>

On 6 August ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported the IDF placing the number of Hezbollah fighters killed at 400, but added that "armies fighting guerrilla forces tend to exaggerate the fatalities of the enemy".<ref name=NoComp>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/lebanon-and-the-territories-no-resemblance-1.194494 |title=Lebanon and the territories / No resemblance |work=Haaretz |author1=Avi Issacharoff |author2=Amos Harel |date=6 August 2006|access-date=10 November 2011}}</ref> Matt M. Matthews military historian at [[United States Army Combined Arms Center]], also described these figures as "highly exaggerated" because he asserts that Hezbollah suffered only 187 casualties.<ref>Matthews, p.51</ref>

A 4 August 2006 ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' article by [[Con Coughlin]], referring to estimates by Lebanese officials, said that up to 500 Hezbollah fighters had been killed and 1,500 wounded. According to the article, many of Hezbollah's wounded were secretly evacuated to hospitals in [[Syria]] through the Al-Arissa Border Crossing. A later article by the ''Daily Telegraph'' said that funerals of fallen Hezbollah fighters were "staggered" and were interred without ceremony for re-burial later. Coughlin quoted a senior Lebanese security official as saying that "Hizbollah is desperate to conceal its casualties because it wants to give the impression that it is winning its war. People might reach a very different conclusion if they knew the true extent of Hizbollah's casualties." According to the article, Hezbollah's operational council had drawn up casualty lists to be sent to [[Iran]], as the Iranian government compensated the families of Hezbollah's dead, and that Hezbollah had pressured Lebanese newspapers that had obtained copies not to publish them.<ref>Bishop, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 22 August 2006</ref><ref>Coughlin, ''Daily Telegraph'', 4 August 2006</ref> Historian [[John Keegan]] wrote in an op-ed that "perhaps as many as 1,000" Hezbollah fighters were killed.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">Keegan, John, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3633843/Why-Israel-will-go-to-war-again---soon.html "Why Israel will go to war again – soon"], ''Telegraph''</ref> A [[Stratfor]] report cited "sources in Lebanon" as estimating the Hezbollah death toll at "more than 700 fighters with many more to go",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0608MLN/06082914STR.asp|title=Lebanon: Hezbollah's Political Regrouping Efforts|date=29 August 2006|publisher=Stratfor|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813035905/http://www.lebanonwire.com/0608MLN/06082914STR.asp|archive-date=13 August 2014}}</ref> Intelligence analysts [[Alastair Crooke]] and [[Mark Perry (author)|Mark Perry]] reported a few months after the war a total of 184 "Shiite martyr funerals" having been held in Lebanon since the war.

IDF Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yaakov Amidror said that IDF had identified the names of 440 members of Hezbollah who were killed in the war.

Four months after the end of the war the deputy chairman of the Hezbollah Political Council [[Mahmoud Qomati]] substantially raised the official estimate of the number of Hezbollah fatalities.

Instead of the 800 Hezbollah fatalities said during the war, Israeli government spokesperson [[Miri Eisin]] in December revised that estimate, saying, "We think that it's closer to 600."<ref name=JP250/> Three years after the outbreak of war the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a summary of the war which concluded that over 600 Hezbollah fighters were killed in the war.<ref name=MFA09>{{cite news |url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Issues/Pages/The-Second-Lebanon-War-Three-years-later-12-Jul-2009.aspx |title=Behind the Headlines: The Second Lebanon War-Three years later |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=12 July 2009|access-date=16 October 2013}}</ref>

Hezbollah claimed that many of Hezbollah's dead were local village fighters rather than regulars. However, according to one analyst, who noted that general estimates place Hezbollah's losses at around 500–600 fighters out of a regular fighting force of 2,000, "this was mainly party propaganda attempting to put a brave face on what was by any measure a major blow to the resistance," and claimed that Hezbollah subsequently went on a recruitment drive to replace its losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/hezbollah-slips-in-qusayr/|title=Hezbollah Slips in Qusayr – Foundation for Defense of Democracies |website=www.defenddemocracy.org|date=28 May 2013 }}</ref>

According to the ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' "Encyclopedia" of the Second Lebanon War, the main reason for the discrepancy between Lebanese and Israeli estimates of the number of Hezbollah fatalities during the war (700 and 300 respectively) was that the former included only Hezbollah '''combatants''' while the latter also included '''civilian''' members of Hezbollah.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/yaan/0,7340,L-799018-Nzk5MDE4XzE3NTE2NzU0Nl8xNDg2ODcyMDAeq-FreeYaan,00.html |title=מלחמת לבנון השנייה (The second Lebanon war)|publisher=Yedioth Achronoth/Encyclopedia|access-date=20 October 2011}}</ref> The NGO [[Human Rights Watch]] argued that in 94 IDF air, artillery, and ground attacks during the war that claimed the lives of 561 persons, that only 51 of these were combatants and about half of them were women or children.<ref>HRW (September 2007), p. 5-6</ref> HRW said it documented the identities of another 548 fatalities, bringing the total of identified Lebanese deaths in the war to 1109.

The [[Amal movement]], a [[Shiite]] militia that fought alongside Hezbollah, suffered 17 dead. Armed elements of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] suffered 12 dead.

==== Hezbollah commanders ====
Hezbollah General-Secretary Hassan Nasrallah said in an interview with New TV August shortly after the war that between 10 and 12 Hezbollah commanders were killed in the war. None of the first or second levels of the leadership were harmed. Three commanders of the third level however were killed; an operations officer in the Bint Jbeil axis, a logistics officer and a third commander involved in the military side of the party. In addition three or four town commanders and four or five village commanders were killed in the war.<ref>Noe, Nicholas, ''Voice of Hezbollah, the statements of Sayed Hassan Nasrallah'', Verso, London and New York, 2007, p. 398–99</ref>

IDF bombing has damaged irrigation canals, open water channels, and underground water diversion pipes which run [[Litani River]] water to more than {{convert|10000|acres|km2}} of farmland, villages in southern Lebanon and the [[Bekaa Valley]].

Images obtained by the ''[[Sunday Herald Sun]]'' show that "Hezbollah is waging war amid suburbia.

Amnesty International stated, however, that the volume of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure suggested that Israel was not just trying to target Hezbollah fighters. An AI spokesperson, Kate Gilmore, said that "[t]he pattern, scope and scale of the attacks makes Israel's claim that this was 'collateral damage', simply not credible".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=35357|title=AI: Israel committed war crimes|date=27 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816190956/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=35357|archive-date=16 August 2007}}</ref> "The evidence strongly suggests that the extensive destruction of power and water plants, as well as the transport infrastructure vital for food and other humanitarian relief, was deliberate and an integral part of a military strategy," Gilmore said.

On 24 July 2007, ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported that the official Israeli inquiry into the war "is to include the examination of claims that the IDF committed war crimes during last summer's fighting."<ref>{{cite news|last=Azoulay|first=Yuval|title=Panel to probe alleged IDF war crimes in Lebanon|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=24 July 2007|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/885676.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20071001110707/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/885676.html|archive-date=1 October 2007|access-date=13 July 2008}}</ref>

A 6 September 2007 Human Rights Watch report found that most of the civilian deaths in Lebanon resulted from "indiscriminate Israeli airstrikes", and found that Israeli aircraft targeted vehicles carrying fleeing civilians.<ref>{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212049/http://www.wset.com/news/stories/0907/453157.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead |url=http://www.wset.com/news/stories/0907/453157.html |title=Israel Blamed for Lebanese Civilian Deaths |work=WSET (ABC News) |agency=Associated Press |date=6 September 2007}}</ref> In a statement issued before the report's release, the human rights organization said there was no basis to the Israeli government's claim that civilian casualties resulted from Hezbollah guerrillas using civilians as shields. [[Kenneth Roth]], Human Rights Watch executive director, said there were only "rare" cases of Hezbollah operating in civilian villages. "To the contrary, once the war started, most Hizbollah(sic) military officials and even many political officials left the villages," he said. "Most Hizbollah(sic) military activity was conducted from prepared positions outside Lebanese villages in the hills and valleys around." Roth also noted that "Hezbollah fighters often didn't carry their weapons in the open or regularly wear military uniforms, which made them a hard target to identify. But this doesn't justify the IDF's failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants, and if in doubt to treat a person as a civilian, as the [[laws of war]] require."<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112050528/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2938967.ece |archive-date=12 January 2008 |url-status=dead |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2938967.ece |title=Hizbollah 'did not use civilians as cover' |work=The Independent |author=Mark Lavie |date=7 September 2007}}</ref>

On its final report, issued on 30 January 2008, the Israeli government's [[Winograd Commission]] concluded that the [[Israel Defense Forces]] did not commit violations or war crimes, as alleged by the [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], and other NGOs. The Commission claimed that the evidence shows that the [[Israel Defense Forces]] did not target civilians, in contrast to [[Hezbollah]] and to denunciations by NGOs, and explained that terms like "war crimes" are without basis.<ref>NGO Monitor (31 January 2008), [http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/winograd_report_ngos_use_human_rights_in_propaganda_war "Winograd Report: NGOs Use Human Rights in Propaganda War"].

=== Media coverage ===
{{further|2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies|Adnan Hajj photographs controversy}}

The 2007 report "'War to the Last Moment': The Israeli Media in the Second Lebanon War" by the Israeli media monitoring NGO [http://www.keshev.org.il/ Keshev] (trans. "Awareness")<ref name =Keshev1>{{cite news |url=http://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/danield/files/2010/07/KESHEV-ENGLISH-REPORT-LEBANON-WAR1.pdf |title="War to the Last Moment" – The Israeli Media in the Second Lebanon War. |publisher=Keshev |date=July 2007|access-date=20 November 2012}}</ref> stated that the Israeli media "except for a few exceptional instances ... covered the war in an almost entirely mobilized manner" serving more to support the goals of the Israeli government and IDF than to objectively report the news. "The media created a general atmosphere of complete and absolute support and justification of the war, and systematically suppressed questions that arose as early as the first day of fighting. ... The criticism gradually increased toward the end of the war-as it became clearer that the IDF was not managing to win. But the general spirit of the war coverage, in the broad strategic sense, as utterly uncritical." Keshev's report documents a post-war memo from the Deputy CEO of Marketing for the Hebrew newspaper [[Maariv]] to Maariv employees which states, in part, that {{cquote|Even when we had problematic material related to the management of the war ... we restrained ourselves. In a certain sense, we betrayed our role as journalists, but we did so because we took national, patriotic considerations into account and decided that in the event of war, and certainly a war which was not progressing as it should and was going awry, we were part of the Country; that it was permissible, and even required of us, to postpone disputes and criticism; and that we did not have to apologize, or to feel abashed, for our support and backing of the Army and the Government.<ref name = Keshev1/>}}

According to the report, "significant coverage of the decision-making process was almost entirely absent in Israel's media" at the beginning of the war and reports on the status of Israelis living in the North who did not receive proper governmental support were marginalized. Further, the report states that the media unreasonably centered on the question of the loyalties of Arab-Israelis in the North instead of focusing on inadequate provision of services by the state. The report acknowledges that the Israeli media reported on Lebanese suffering, But states that it divorced the suffering from the IDF operations causing it. Finally, with regard to diplomacy, Israeli media buried the stories on negotiations to reflect the derision held by decision-makers toward a diplomatic solution.<ref name = Keshev1/>

On 18 July 2006 Hezbollah Press Officer Hussein Nabulsi took CNN's [[Nic Robertson]] on an exclusive tour of southern Beirut. Robertson noted that despite his minder's anxiety about explosions in the area, it was clear that Hezbollah had sophisticated media relations and were in control of the situation. Hezbollah designated the places that they went to, and the journalists "certainly didn't have time to go into the houses or lift up the rubble to see what was underneath." According to his reports, there was no doubt that the bombs were hitting Hezbollah facilities, and while there appeared to be "a lot of civilian damage, a lot of civilian properties," he reiterated that he could not verify the civilian nature of the destroyed buildings.<ref name="reliable">{{cite news|title=CNN Reliable Sources, Coverage of Mideast Conflict|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/23/rs.01.html|publisher=CNN|date=23 July 2006|access-date=25 November 2011}}</ref>

Social and online media were important for providing alternate means of creating and disseminating accounts and political commentary.

At the outbreak of hostilities, Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] promised to rein in Hezbollah in an effort to stop Israel's offensive. Saniora said that there could be no sovereign state of Lebanon without the group's disarming. The former President of Lebanon [[Amin Gemayel]], a longtime critic of Hezbollah said, "Hezbollah took a unilateral action, but its repercussions will affect the entire country."<ref name="foxnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,203825,00.html|title=Fighting with Israel deepens Lebanese divisions over Hezbollah|publisher=Fox News|access-date=20 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521063504/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,203825,00.html|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
The war deepened the longtime divide in Lebanon over Hezbollah's role. Many admired the organization for being the sole group to fight against Israel. Others considered it to be a dangerous militia that executes Iran and Syria policies in Lebanon. The divide over Hezbollah followed mostly sectarian lines, with [[Shias]] largely supporting the group and [[Sunnis]], Christians and [[Druze|Druse]] mostly opposing it.<ref name="foxnews.com"/>

On 27 August 2006, Nasrallah said in an interview with [[Al Jadeed|New TV]] that the abduction of the two soldiers did not cause the war. It only advanced a long planned war for a few months. But he added: "If there was even a 1 percent chance that the July 11 capturing operation would have led to a war like the one that happened, would you have done it? I would say no, absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons. [...] What happened is not an issue of a reaction to a capturing operation... what happened was already planned for. The fact that it happened in July has averted a situation that would have been a lot worse, had the war been launched in October."<ref>Nicholas Noe, ''Voice of Hezbollah, The Statements of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah'', Verso, 2007, pp. 394–95</ref>

On 22 September 2006, some eight hundred thousand Hezbollah supporters gathered in Beirut for a rally at which Nasrallah stated that Hezbollah had achieved a "divine and strategic victory."<ref name=CNN_800>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/22/lebanon.rally|title=Hezbollah leader: Militants 'won't surrender arms'|publisher=CNN|date=22 September 2006|access-date=30 April 2007}}</ref>

On 21 August, a group of demobilized Israel reserve soldiers and parents of soldiers killed in the fighting started [[2006 Israeli reserve soldiers' protest|a movement]] calling for the resignation of Olmert and the establishment of a state commission of [[Public inquiry|inquiry]].

Due to these pressures, on 11 October, Admoni was replaced by retired justice [[Eliyahu Winograd]] as chair of the political probe, and the probe itself was elevated to the status of governmental commission with near-state commission mandate: the [[Winograd Commission]]. On 12 September, former defense minister [[Moshe Arens]] spoke of "the defeat of Israel" in calling for a state committee of inquiry. He said that Israel had lost "to a very small group of people, 5,000 Hezbollah fighters, which should have been no match at all for the IDF", and stated that the conflict could have "some very fateful consequences for the future."<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111110105/http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/commentary/newsblogs/jerusalemdateline/060908.aspx |archive-date=11 January 2007 |url-status=dead |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/commentary/newsblogs/jerusalemdateline/060908.aspx |title=Did Israel Lose the War? – Part Two |work=CBNnews.com |author=Chris Mitchell |date=8 September 2006 |access-date=8 December 2015}}</ref> Disclosing his intent to shortly resign, [[Ilan Harari]], the IDF's chief education officer, stated at a conference of senior IDF officers that Israel lost the war, becoming the first senior active duty officer to publicly state such an opinion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Halutz disputes officer's remarks that Israel lost war|date=22 September 2006|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070802091348/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/766154.html |archive-date=2 August 2007 |url-status=dead|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/766154.html|work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref> IDF Major General [[Yiftah Ron-Tal|Yiftah Ron Tal]], on 4 October 2006 became the second and highest ranking serving officer to express his opinion that the IDF failed "to win the day in the battle against Hezbollah" as well as calling for Lt.

However, Eyal Zisser, director of the [[Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies]] at Tel Aviv University, took a contrary position and expressed the view that the war was in fact a strategic success for Israel and a Hezbollah defeat. He noted that Hezbollah had "lost about a third of its elite fighting force" and that "despite mistakes made by the IDF in conducting the military campaign, Israeli soldiers triumphed in every face-to-face battle with Hezbollah." He concluded that "as time passes, the severity of the blow suffered by Lebanon and its people from the 2006 war becomes clear."<ref>Zisser, [http://www.meforum.org/2054/nasrallahs-defeat-in-the-2006-war "Nasrallah's Defeat in the 2006 War: Assessing Hezbollah's Influence"], ''Middle East Forum'', 23 January 2009</ref>

Israeli military historian [[Martin van Creveld]] stated that Israel's war against Hezbollah was indeed "marked by a long series of failures" but he criticized the [[Winograd Commission]] for its failure to take into account the substantial achievements of the war. He noted that hundreds of Hezbollah fighters were killed in the war, and that the organization had "the fight knocked out of it", since following the war, Israel experienced a level of calm on its Lebanon border not seen since the mid-1960s. He also noted that Hezbollah was "thrown out of South Lebanon", and was replaced by "a fairly robust United Nations peacekeeping force" to prevent its return.<ref>{{cite news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129042632/http://forward.com/articles/12579/israel-s-war-with-hezbollah-was-not-a-failure-/ |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=dead|url=http://forward.com/articles/12579/israel-s-war-with-hezbollah-was-not-a-failure-/|title=Israel's War With Hezbollah Was Not a Failure|work=Forward|author=Martin van Creveld|date=30 January 2008}}</ref>

IDF Maj.-Gen. (res.) [[Yaakov Amidror]] highlighted the number of Hezbollah militants killed, the quick military response to Hezbollah's long-range rocket attacks, the post-war replacement of Hezbollah by the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, and Iran's loss of Hezbollah as a deterrent against an Israeli first strike following the war.<ref>Yaakov Amridor, "Misreading the Second Lebanon War", 16 January 2007, www.JCPA.org</ref> [[Thomas Friedman]] concurred, stating that the war was a "huge strategic loss for Hezbollah", and contrasted the billions in damage suffered by Hezbollah and Lebanon with the "relatively minor damage" suffered by Israel, which enjoyed an economic "growth spurt" immediately following the war.<ref>Friedman, "The Arab Commission," ''The New York Times'', 5 September 2007</ref>

==== Winograd Commission report ====
{{Main|Winograd Commission}}
According to the Winograd Commission report, the Second Lebanon War was regarded as a "missed opportunity" and that "Israel initiated a long war, which ended without a defined military victory". The report continued to state that "a semi-military organization of a few thousand men resisted, for a few weeks, the strongest army in the Middle East, which enjoyed full [[air superiority]] and size and technology advantages." Furthermore, [[Hezbollah]]'s rocket attacks continued throughout the war and the IDF did not provide an effective response to it. Following a long period of using standoff firepower and limited ground activities, the IDF launched a large-scale ground offensive close to the UN Security Council's resolution which imposed a cease-fire. "This offensive did not result in military gains and was not completed."

Later in the Report, the Commission stated that "[a] decision [was] made in the night of 12 July to react (to the capturing) with immediate and substantive military action and to set ... ambitious goals." This decision had immediate repercussions in that subsequent decisions were limited mainly to a choice between a) "a short, painful and unexpected blow on Hezbollah" and b) "to bring about a significant change of the reality in the South of Lebanon with a large ground operation,[occupying] ... the South of Lebanon and 'cleaning' it of Hezbollah." "The fact Israel went to war before it decided which option to select and without an exit strategy, all these constituted serious failures of the decision making process." As for achievements, the Commission reported that "SC resolution 1701, and the fact that it was adopted unanimously, were an achievement for Israel."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/world/middleeast/31winograd-web.html|title=English Summary of the Winograd Commission Report|date=30 January 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=25 November 2011}}</ref>

Matt M. Matthews, a military historian at the Combat Studies Institute of the U.S. Army [[Command and General Staff College]] praised Hezbollah [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and reflected on what he described as "the lackluster performance of the IDF."

The US [[Congressional Research Service]] found that although Hezbollah's military capabilities may have been substantially reduced, its long-term potential as a guerrilla movement appeared to remain intact: "Observers note that Hezbollah's leaders have been able to claim a level of 'victory' simply by virtue of not having decisively 'lost'."<ref>Congressional Research Service, 2006 [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33566.pdf "Lebanon: The Israel–Hamas–Hezbollah Conflict"]</ref>

Military analyst and former IDF general Giora Eiland concluded that, though outgunned and outnumbered, Hezbollah managed to hold off Israel's advanced armed forces and proved its ability to damage Israel by launching rockets at its territory until the end of the war. He estimates that Hezbollah's destructive capabilities have increased in the years after the war and that the group is capable to inflict "far worse damage on the Israeli homefront" than in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/16/us-israel-lebanon-idUSTRE6BF20L20101216|title=Israel can't defeat Hezbollah: Israeli expert|date=16 December 2010|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> An Israeli official warned that combat with Hezbollah will be very bloody and Lebanon would sustain heavy damage in any future war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Hezbollah-planning-large-raids-into-Galilee-senior-army-source-says-375303|title=Hezbollah planning 'large raids' into Galilee, senior army source says|date=14 September 2014|work=Jerusalem Post}}</ref>

In the 2007 [[BBC]] documentary, ''Hunting for Hezbollah'', BBC ''[[This World (television programme)|This World]]'' reporter Emeka Onono referred to Israel's inability to eliminate Hezbollah as a "humiliation for Israel's supposedly all-powerful army," and he went on to claim that Hezbollah's survival propelled it to hero status throughout many Muslim nations.<ref>"Hunting for Hezbollah." Norman, Louise. ''This World''. British Broadcasting Corp. 4 July 2007. Television.</ref>

British military historian [[John Keegan]] stated that the outcome of the war was "misreported as an Israeli defeat" due to anti-Israel bias in the international media. He concluded that Hezbollah had suffered heavy losses, and that a cease-fire came into effect before Israel could completely dislodge Hezbollah from its positions. He also stated that the casualties sustained by Israel during the war had alarmed the Israeli Government and High Command because Israel's small population is acutely vulnerable to losses in battle.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/>

[[Charles Krauthammer]], a syndicated columnist and political commentator, citing an interview by which Nasrallah admitted that he would not have captured the soldiers had he known that it would lead to war, wrote, "Nasrallah's admission, vastly underplayed in the West, makes clear what Lebanese already knew. Hezbollah may have won the propaganda war, but on the ground it lost. Badly." He noted that Hezbollah's entrenched infrastructure along Israel's border was shattered and would not be easily rebuilt due to the presence of the Lebanese Army and a robust UNIFIL force, hundreds of Hezbollah's best fighters were killed in the war, and that many Lebanese were angry with Hezbollah for provoking a war which largely devastated the country.<ref>Krauthammer, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083101444.html "Hezbollah's 'Victory'"], ''the Washington Post'' 9 January 2006</ref>

''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that the war had been "widely seen as a disaster for the Israeli military". It further reported that the US Defense Department had sent as many as a dozen teams to interview Israeli officers who had fought in the war, to learn the lessons of the Israeli army's failures during the conflict.<ref>{{cite news|title=2006 Israel–Lebanon War Looms Large in Pentagon Debate on Future|date=6 April 2009|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/05/AR2009040502235.html|access-date=6 March 2012|work=The Washington Post|first=Greg|last=Jaffe}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pentagon learning from 'IDF's disaster'|work=Ynet News|date=4 June 2009|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3697924,00.html|access-date=6 March 2012}}</ref>

Michael Young, opinion page editor at the Lebanese ''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]'' newspaper, stated that Hezbollah turned "the stench of defeat into the smell of victory", through clever use of its propaganda machine. He suggested that Hezbollah had "hoodwinked" pundits who believed that Hezbollah was victorious, and opined that "one dreads to imagine what Hezbollah would recognize as a military loss."<ref>Young, [http://reason.com/archives/2006/08/24/hoodwinked-by-hezbollah "Hoodwinked by Hezbollah"], reason.com; 24 August 2006.</ref>

American military strategist and historian [[Edward Luttwak]] drew comparisons with the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where what initially looked like an Israeli setback later turned out to be an IDF victory and an Arab defeat. He stated that although some IDF tanks were penetrated by missiles, they also largely limited IDF casualties, and that Hezbollah had failed to inflict massive losses on the IDF and to kill large numbers of Israelis in rocket attacks.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922222218/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5573%2Cnews-comment%2Cnews-politics%2Cagain-israeli-gloom-is-misplaced |archive-date=22 September 2011 |url-status=dead |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5573,news-comment,news-politics,again-israeli-gloom-is-misplaced |title=Again, Israeli gloom is misplaced |work=[[The First Post]] |author=Edward Luttwak }}</ref> [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] professor and Peterhouse Fellow [[Brendan Simms]] summed up the war this way; "Hezbollah have suffered a setback (but are too clever to admit it) and the Israelis have scored a long-term success (but are too narrow-minded to realize it)."<ref>Brendan Simms, "Hezbollah have suffered a setback", [[Social Affairs Unit]], 24 August 2006.</ref>

Journalist [[Michael Totten]] wrote that "Hezbollah lost and Hezbollah knows it." He questioned why Hezbollah did not attack Israel when the IDF attacked Hamas in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in 2008, and noted that most of Nasrallah's supporters "want Hezbollah to deter Israeli invasions, not to invite Israeli invasions". Totten concluded that Nasrallah's boasts "play well in much of the Arab world", but that the 2006 "victory" seemed "empty at home."<ref>Totten, Michael, [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2009/01/30/who-really-won-the-second-lebanon-war "Who Really Won the Second Lebanon War"], ''Commentary'', 30 January 2009.</ref>

Armin Rosen, Defense and military advisor wrote at Business Insider that the 2006 Lebanon War was "widely remembered as one of the worst debacles in the history of the Israeli military", but remarked that it established Israeli deterrence against Hezbollah.<ref>Armin Rosen, [http://www.businessinsider.com/the-israeli-army-is-suffering-severe-losses-2014-7 "The Israeli Army Is Suffering Some Of Its Most Severe Losses In Years"], ''Commentary'', 21 July 2014.</ref>

On 24 October, six [[Israeli Air Force|Israeli]] [[F-16]]s flew over a [[German Navy]] vessel patrolling off Israel's coast just south of the Lebanese border. The German Defence Ministry said that the planes had given off infrared decoys and one of the aircraft had fired two shots into the air, which had not been specifically aimed. The Israeli military said that a German helicopter took off from the vessel without having coordinated this with Israel, and denied vehemently having fired any shots at the vessel and said "as of now" it also had no knowledge of the jets launching flares over it. Israeli Defence Minister [[Amir Peretz]] telephoned his German counterpart [[Franz Josef Jung]] to clarify that 'Israel has no intention to carry out any aggressive actions' against the German peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, who are there as part of [[UNIFIL]] to enforce an arms embargo against Hezbollah.

On 1 December 2006, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted a report to the Security Council president maintaining "there were no serious incidents or confrontations" since the cease-fire in August 2006. He did, however, note that peacekeepers reported air violations by Israel "almost on a daily basis," which Israel maintained were a security measure related to continuing Syrian and Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, and evidence of the presence of unauthorized armed personnel, assets, and weapons in Lebanon.<ref name="iht_vio_challenge">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919142041/http://www.israeliwatch.com/2006/12/03/annan-israels-actions-compromise-efforts-to-stabilize-the-israeli-lebanon-border/ |archive-date=19 September 2015 |url-status=dead |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/02/news/UN_GEN_UN_Lebanon_Peacekeepers.php |title=Annan: Israel's actions compromise efforts to stabilize the Israeli–Lebanon border|work=International Herald Tribune|date=29 March 2009}}</ref> In one case, a UNIFIL demining team was challenged by two Hezbollah members in combat uniforms armed with [[AK-47|AK-47 rifles]]; UNIFIL notified the Lebanese army, who arrested three suspects the next day.<ref name="iht_vio_challenge"/> There were also "13 instances where UNIFIL came across unauthorized arms or related material in its area of operation", including the discovery of 17 katyusha rockets and several improvised explosive devices in [[Rachaiya El-Foukhar]], and the discovery of a weapons cache containing seven missiles, three rocket launchers, and a substantial amount of ammunition in the area of [[Bourhoz]].<ref name="iht_vio_challenge"/><ref name="ynet_annan_report">Ynet News (2 December 2006).

After the war, the Lebanese Army deployed 15,000 soldiers, backed by a UNIFIL force of 12,000, deployed South of the [[Litani River]] to replace Hezbollah, although the Lebanese government said that it cannot and will not disarm Hezbollah by force. On 7 February 2010, the Lebanese Army fired at an Israeli bulldozer on the border, and Israeli forces returned fire. There were no reported casualties. Lebanon claimed that the bulldozer had crossed the border and entered Lebanese territory. On 21 February 2007, [[Lebanese Army]] troops fired at an Israeli UAV over [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] with small arms, causing no damage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Porat|first=Elisha|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=52232|title=Lebanese army fires at Israeli UAV|work=Jerusalem Post|location=Israel|date=21 February 2007|access-date=16 January 2011}}</ref>

On 30 June 2007, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]]'s fourth report on the implementation of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Security Council Resolution 1701]] fingered Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah for violating the ceasefire, but called the firing of rockets into Israel by unknown elements "the most serious breach of the cessation of hostilities since the end of the war." The report commended Israel on its restraint following this attack, and commended Lebanon for its continued efforts to disarm armed groups.
