'''Cornetto''' ({{IPA-it|korˈnetto}}), meaning "little horn" in Italian,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/One-Day-One-Place-Eat-up-Rome-during-tourist-8319277.php|title=One Day, One Place: Eat up Rome during tourist season|last=Wach|first=Bonnie|date=22 June 2016|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> is an Italian brand of frozen dessert [[ice cream cone|cone]], the manufacturer owned by the British-Dutch company [[Unilever]]. Cornetti are sold as part of the [[Heartbrand]] product line, known internationally by different names, including Algida in Italy, [[Wall's (ice cream)|Wall's]] in the UK, [[HB Ice Cream|HB]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbicecream.ie/Brand/Cornetto.aspx|title=Share Happy|publisher=HB Ice Cream|accessdate=30 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928205214/http://www.hbicecream.ie/Brand/Cornetto.aspx|archive-date=28 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Frigo in Spain,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frigo.es/Brand/Brandslist.aspx|title=Comparte Felicidad|publisher=Frigo|accessdate=30 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928235738/http://www.frigo.es/Brand/Brandslist.aspx|archive-date=28 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Kwality Wall's]] in India. Several variations of the product exist, ranging from milk-based [[ice cream]] to [[vegetable fat]]-based dessert.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindustan Unilever told to erase 'Ice Cream' word from Kwality Walls advertisements|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-08-02/news/33001289_1_ice-cream-ice-cream-kwality-walls|accessdate=3 May 2013 | work=The Times Of India|date=2 August 2012}}</ref>

== Manufacturing==
For a long time, the idea of selling frozen ice-cream cones had been impractical, as the ice cream would soak into the moist cone during the manufacturing process and make it soggy and unpalatable when served.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} In 1959, Spica,<ref name="unileverAboutCornetto">{{cite web|url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands-in-action/detail/Cornetto/297639/|title=Cornetto|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> an Italian ice-cream manufacturer based in [[Naples]], overcame this problem by insulating the inside of the waffle cone from the ice cream with a coating of oil, sugar, and chocolate. They are sold in many different sizes throughout Europe in sizes ranging from 28-ml Miniatures to 260-ml King Cones, though the 90-ml and 125-ml sizes tend to be the most popular.

==Varieties==
The product is available in a variety of flavours, including Strawberry, Mint Chocolate, Nut, Lemon, Whippy (yogurt flavour with a chewy chocolate), Valentine's Day flavours, and Cornetto Soft (soft ice cream that comes in chocolate chip, cookie dough, vanilla, chocolate, and double chocolate). Cornetto Soft is sold on the street by vendors and is made on the spot with an ice cream dispenser, but the other flavours are premade and factory packaged. Also, Cornetto Enigma is made, which consists of cookies and cream, raspberry and double chocolate flavours.

Unilever introduced a Cornetto chocolate confectionery into the UK market in 2013, following a licensing deal with Kinnerton Confectionery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confectionerynews.com/Manufacturers/Unilever-enters-UK-confectionery-market-with-Kinnerton-licensing-deal|title=Unilever enters UK confectionery market with Kinnerton licensing deal|first=|last=ConfectioneryNews.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>

==Advertising campaigns==
===’O sole mio campaign===
The brand was marketed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Brazil by successful advertising campaigns which placed the Neapolitan song "[[O Sole Mio]]" into a variety of stereotypical Italian locations and situations, with its lyrics changed to:

:''Just one Cornetto,''
:''give it to me,''
:''delicious ice-cream, of Italy,''
:''creamy vanilla and choco dream,''
:''Give me Cornetto,''
:''from [[Wall's ice cream]].''
(in the UK)<ref name="unileverAboutCornetto"/>

:''give it to me,''
:''a big ol'nut and chocolate dream,''
:''HB Cornetto''
:''spells the best ice cream.''
(in Ireland)

:''Dame un Cornetto''
:''Molto crocante'' 
:''E piu cremoso'' 
:''É da Gelatto.'' 
:''Cornetto é da própria Itália.'' 
:''Ti voglio tanto,''
:''Corneeeeeto mio!''
(in Brazil)

In Britain and Ireland, the advertisements ran for 10 years during the 1980s and 1990s, with the song supposedly sung by former Italian waiter [[Renato Pagliari]] of [[one-hit wonder]]s [[Renée and Renato]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8186652.stm|title=Save Your Love singer Renato dies |work=BBC News|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> (However, this is claimed not to be the case by Pagliari's son, Remo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisissuttoncoldfield.co.uk/news/Tributes-Renato-8211-singing-sensation/article-1237758-detail/article.html |author=J Newton |work=This Is Sutton Coldfield |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |title=Tributes to Renato &#8211; a singing sensation<!-- Bot generated title --> |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913013327/http://www.thisissuttoncoldfield.co.uk/news/Tributes-Renato-8211-singing-sensation/article-1237758-detail/article.html |archive-date=13 September 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>) In 2000, the commercial was ranked 23rd in [[Channel 4]]’s UK poll of the "[[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Adverts]]".<ref name="poll">{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/greatest_ads/|title=The 100 Greatest TV Ads|year=2000|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010618095141/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/greatest_ads/|archive-date=18 June 2001|url-status=dead|access-date=5 August 2019}}</ref>

The theme resurfaced in 2006, this time sung by pedestrians, drivers, office workers, and marathon runners in Central London.

In the Philippines, the "{{lang|tl|sarap ng 20 Pesos|italic=no}}" ({{literal translation|delicious 20 pesos}}) campaign was launched in 2008, relying on humour and focused on the product's affordability, with skits that centre on things one cannot afford with 20 [[Philippine peso|pesos]] and suggests that the audience should buy a Cornetto instead. "{{lang|tl|Mag-Cornetto ka na lang|italic=no}}" ({{literal translation|Just have a Cornetto instead}}) and "{{lang|tl|Hanggang saan aabot ang 20 pesos mo?|italic=no}}" ({{literal translation|How far will your 20 pesos take you?}}) were used as slogans for the campaign. 
By May 2011, 30-story lines had been produced.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pe|first1=Roger|title=A very likable ice cream TV commercial|url=http://business.inquirer.net/2590/a-very-likable-ice-cream-tv-commercial|accessdate=29 June 2016|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=26 May 2016}}</ref>

The television advertisement entitled "Tugs", which is part of the campaign, was selected as the Adobo Ad of the Year for 2010 through online voting at the ad agency band night "Lakihan Mo Logo 14".<ref>{{cite news|title=Lowe Philippines' popular "Tugs" TVC for Selecta Cornetto hailed as adobo Ad of the Year 2010|url=http://www.adobomagazine.com/lowe-philippines-popular-tugs-tvc-selecta-cornetto-hailed-adobo-ad-year-2010|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=Adobo Magazine|publisher=Sanserif, Inc.|date=3 June 2010}}</ref>
