==Career==
Prior to the launch of his own company, Holland gained attention with his Fashion Groupies T-shirt designs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/life_and_style/shopping/s/1418185_ramsbottom-designer-henry-holland-sets-the-pace|title=Ramsbottom designer Henry Holland sets the pace|author=Deborah Linton|date=18 April 2011|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> Holland's range of 1980s-inspired T-shirts displayed catchphrases such as, "I'll tell you who's boss, Kate Moss".

In September 2006 Holland designed a range of T-shirts that were worn by both [[Gareth Pugh]] and [[Giles Deacon]] as they took their bow at the end of their runway shows during [[London Fashion Week]]. Gareth Pugh appeared to take a bow at the end of his show wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "Get Yer Freak on Giles Deacon" while later in the week Giles Deacon wore a T-shirt that had "Uhu Gareth Pugh" printed on it.

Holland subsequently designed a full collection and founded his own fashion house the "House of Holland" in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/careers/fashion-careers/2008-04/HenryHolland|title=Designer Bio: Henry Holland|last=Keltner|first=Jane|work=[[Teen Vogue]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> He is well known for his work with model [[Agyness Deyn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2008/02/16/sm_henryholland116.xml&page=2|title=Henry Holland's house of fun|date=16 February 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511201030/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=%2Ffashion%2F2008%2F02%2F16%2Fsm_henryholland116.xml&page=2|archivedate=11 May 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>

In May 2012, Holland's collaboration with sunglasses company, Le Specs, was released. The collection, entitled "Henry Holland for Le Specs", featured sunglass models with names such as "Muffin Top" and "Blinders".<ref>{{cite web|title=MADE IN THE SHADE: Henry Holland For Le Specs|url=http://www.revolveclothing.com/blognew/DisplayBlogPosts.jsp?id=1775|work=RevolverClothing.com|publisher=Eminent, Inc|accessdate=7 October 2012|author=Janel Molton|date=9 May 2012}}</ref> The collection campaign featured Australian hip-hop recording artist and model [[Iggy Azalea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/style/2012/10/15/iggy-azalea-house-of-holland-campaign/|title=News - Entertainment, Music, Movies, Celebrity|website=MTV News}}</ref> Following the success of his first two eyewear campaigns starring Iggy Azalea and Ioanna Gika, Holland released his third eyewear campaign, this time featuring model and actress [[Adwoa Aboah]].

The dress took over three months to complete and is now worth around £5,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Article/2014/03/31/Henry-Holland-creates-chocolate-dresses-for-Magnum-s-25th-anniversary|title=Magnum creates chocolate dresses for 25th anniversary|work=foodmanufacture.co.uk|access-date=3 September 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>
