'''John M. "Jack" Keane''' (born February 1, 1943) is a retired American [[four-star general]], former [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] and [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] recipient. He is a national security analyst, primarily on [[Fox News]], and serves as chairman of the [[Institute for the Study of War]] and as chairman of [[AM General]].

==Early life and education==
Keane was born in 1943 in Manhattan, New York,<ref>Matthew Kaminski, ''Wall Street Journal'', [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB122186492076758643 "Why the Surge Worked"], September 20, 2008</ref><ref>http://www.defense.gov/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=731</ref> the son of Elizabeth (Davis) and John Keane. He has a brother, Ronald.

Keane attended [[Fordham University]], where he participated in the [[Pershing Rifles]], graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[accounting]] in 1966. He then attended [[Western Kentucky University]], graduating with a [[master's degree]] in [[philosophy]]. He later attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Command and General Staff College]] and the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]].<ref name="jh-apl">{{cite web|url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/POW/bios/keane.htm |title=General Jack Keane (bio) |work=Principles of War Seminar Series |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] |accessdate=January 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304104138/http://www.jhuapl.edu/POW/bios/keane.htm |archivedate=March  4, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Military career==
[[File:President George W. Bush signs a defense appropriations bill at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|right|Keane watches as [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signs a defense appropriations bill in 2002]]
Keane served in the [[Vietnam War]] as a [[paratrooper]], leading in combat as a platoon leader and company commander.  He is eligible for the [[Combat Infantry Badge]] and the [[Master Parachutist Badge]].<ref>[[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]], ''The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 2013, p. 225.</ref> He later served in U.S. engagements in [[Somalia]], [[Haiti]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]]. His commands include the [[1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division]], [[101st Airborne Division]] and the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]].<ref name="jh-apl"/>

In 1991 Keane saved the life of [[David Petraeus]] during a live-fire exercise. According to Keane, Petraeus was shot "accidentally, standing right next to me, and I had to fight to save his life. He had a hole about the size of a quarter in his back and is gushing with blood, and we stopped the bleeding and got him on a helicopter and got him to a surgeon and so we were sort of bonded ever since that time."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keane|first1=Jack|title=Jack Keane |website=Conversations with Bill Kristol|accessdate=October 1, 2014|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/jack-keane/}}</ref> 

Keane retired from military service in 2003.

==Post military service==

Following his retirement, he has served as an informal advisor to presidents and other senior officials. He served an advisory role in the management of the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|U.S. occupation of Iraq]], as a member of the [[Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee]]. In January 2007, Keane and scholar [[Frederick W. Kagan]] released a policy paper titled "Choosing Victory: A Plan for Success in Iraq,"<ref name=kagan>{{cite web|last=Kagan |first=Frederick W. |authorlink=Frederick W. Kagan |date=January 5, 2007 |url=https://www.aei.org/publication/choosing-victory-a-plan-for-success-in-iraq/ |title=Choosing Victory: A Plan for Success in Iraq: Phase I Report |publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]] for Public Policy Research |accessdate=2017-04-17 |archivedate=January 17, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117151850/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25396/pub_detail.asp }}</ref> through the [[American Enterprise Institute]] that called for bringing security by putting 30,000 additional American troops there for a period of at least 18 months. In part convinced by this paper, President [[George W. Bush]] ordered on January 10, 2007, the deployment of 21,500 additional troops to Iraq, most of whom would be deployed to Baghdad. This deployment has been nicknamed the 2007 "[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]]".<ref name="abc">{{cite news|first=David |last=Kerley |authorlink=David Kerley |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2782936&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |title=The Architect of Bush's New Iraq Strategy |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=January 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825043919/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2782936&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |archivedate=August 25, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=msnbc>{{cite news|last=Hastings, Hirsh, and Wolffe |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16411558/site/newsweek/page/2/ |title='Surge' Strategy |work=Newsweek National News |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |page=2 |date=January 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114221629/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16411558/site/newsweek/page/2/ |archivedate=January 14, 2007 |accessdate=January 16, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Of his initial meeting with President Bush regarding the surge, Keane said he made a phone call to [[Newt Gingrich]] to ask his advice prior to the meeting. As Keane said in 2014, <blockquote>Gingrich gave me some good advice. He said, "Look, Jack. Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table." He said, "Don't leave anything on the table." He said, "You're going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there. And when you walk out of that room, feel good that you got it all out there." So that was sound advice, and I did put it all out there.<ref>http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/jack-keane/</ref></blockquote>

Keane was asked by then-Vice President Cheney to go back on active duty and lead the surge in the field. When Keane declined, Cheney pressed him to come work in the White House and oversee both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; Keane again declined. Keane ended up briefly working at the White House and then later traveled to Iraq several times to advise General Petraeus.<ref name="KeaneCon">{{cite web |url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/transcript/gen-jack-keane-transcript/ |title=GEN.

According to a staff report to the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|House Oversight Committee]], during the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]] of [[Donald Trump]], and subsequently, Trump aides such as [[Jared Kushner]] and others have been engaged in promoting IP3's plan to transfer nuclear technology from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia. According to the report, IP3 founders and others have been seeking to broker a deal with Riyadh without the "gold standard," a provision -- tied to section 123 of the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954|1954 Atomic Energy Act]] which establishes conditions for nuclear cooperation between the U.S. and its allies -- that seeks to limit weaponizing of nuclear energy.<ref name="report2"></ref><ref>[https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/AEASection123 Arms Control Association fact sheet, retrieved August 27, 2019]</ref>
