In the opening session on September 4, the keynote speech was delivered by then-37-year-old [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Julian Castro]]. In his speech, Castro stated that "the Romney-Ryan budget … doesn't just pummel the middle class, it dismantles it...it dismantles what generations before have built to ensure that everybody can enter and stay in the middle class" and that "Now we need to make a choice...a choice between a country where the middle class pays more so that millionaires can pay less, or a country where everybody pays their fair share, so we can reduce the deficit and create the jobs of the future. It's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts [[Pell Grant]]s, or a nation that invests more in education. It's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas, or a leader who brings jobs back home...this is the choice before us … Our choice is a man who has always chosen us. A man who already is our president, Barack Obama", with the ''[[Global Post]]'' describing the audience as "adoring and appreciative" and the speech as "powerful words, and the audience responded with gratitude."<ref>{{cite web|title=Julian Castro seeks to deliver the Hispanic vote, Analysis: The Democrats' rising star rocks the convention with an appeal to immigrants|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/highway-2012/julian-castro-seeks-deliver-the-hispanic-vote-dnc-2012}}</ref>

First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] gave the final speech of the evening, stating that "Barack knows what it means when a family struggles...he knows what it means to want something more for your kids and grandkids. Barack knows the American dream because he's lived it, and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." Her speech lasted 25 minutes and focused on the Barack Obama she fell in love with as well as the strength of the American Spirit and those in the military. "I've seen it in our  men and women in uniform and our proud military families…in a young man blinded by a bomb in Afghanistan who said simply, 'I'd give my eyes 100 times again to have the chance to do what I have done, and what I can still do."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTPdKUA9Ipg|title=Michelle Obama's full DNC speech|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> Jim Rutenberg, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', described the crowd as "electrified" by her remarks, "her impassioned delivery drawing the crowd to its feet."<ref>{{cite news|title=Michelle Obama Tops Opening Night For Democrats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/michelle-obama-speaks-as-democratic-convention-begins.html?hp | work=The New York Times | first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=September 4, 2012}}</ref>

The original 2012 party platform caused controversy after it was written, because the typical invocations and references to God and God-given rights were omitted, and language affirming the role of [[Jerusalem]] as the capital of [[Israel]] was removed. On Wednesday, September 5, former Ohio Governor [[Ted Strickland]] introduced an amendment on the floor of the convention to reinsert language invoking God and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Convention chairman [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] put the amendment to a voice vote requiring a two-thirds majority for passage. After the first vote was indecisive, Villaraigosa called for a second vote, which was again met with an equal volume of "ayes" and "nos". A woman standing to his left said, "You've got to rule, and then you've got to let them do what they're gonna do." Villaraigosa called a third vote with the same result. Villaraigosa then declared the amendment passed, causing an eruption of boos on the floor.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-dnc-platform-god-jerusalem-20120905,0,558903.story Democrats put God, Jerusalem back in platform over objections]</ref>

====Nomination of Obama====
Bill Clinton officially nominated Obama for re-election and Obama was nominated unanimously by the 5,556 delegates of the convention. During the roll call, Mississippi delayed its vote so Ohio could give Obama the nomination, putting the tally over the top of 2,778 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-election/obama-nominated-for-reelection-as-president-20120906 |title=Obama nominated |work=National Journal |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |author=Naureen Khan |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906141626/http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-election/obama-nominated-for-reelection-as-president-20120906 |archivedate=September 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The roll call continued while delegates started to leave and ended with Wyoming casting its votes in an almost empty hall.

Charlotte received a $50 million grant from the [[federal government]] for convention security.

In anticipation of protest activity, the city of Charlotte passed a variety of new ordinances. These include:
* Rules prohibiting camping on public property.
* Restricting the possession and use of a list of different items during and within the boundaries of a declared "extraordinary event":<ref name="City of Charlotte">{{cite web|last=City of Charlotte|title=Extraordinary Event Ordinance|url=http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/CMPD/resources/Ordinances/Documents/Amdmt%20to%20Chap%2015%20Sec%2015-310%20(Events).pdf|publisher=City of Charlotte|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref>  permanent markers; backpacks carried with the intent to conceal weapons; cables; bars; projectiles; spray guns; breakable containers capable of being filled with a flammable substance carried with the intent to inflict serious injury; aerosol containers; fireworks; smoke bombs; pepper spray or mace carried with the intent to delay, obstruct or resist the lawful orders of a law enforcement officer; masks or scarves worn with the intent to hide one's identity while committing a crime; body-armor or helmets carried or worn with the intent to delay, obstruct or resist the lawful orders of a law enforcement officer; and police scanners.<ref name="City of Charlotte"/>

These ordinances were permanent and remained effective after the end of the convention.

The DNC was designated a [[National Special Security Event]], and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] did some of the policing. The [[Charlotte Police Department]] was also responsible for the areas outside the convention venues.
