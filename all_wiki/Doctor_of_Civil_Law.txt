'''Doctor of Civil Law''' ('''DCL'''; {{lang-la|Legis Civilis Doctor or Juris Civilis Doctor}}) is a degree offered by some universities, such as the [[University of Oxford]], instead of the more common [[Legum Doctor|Doctor of Laws]] (LLD) degrees.

At Oxford, the degree is a higher doctorate usually awarded on the basis of exceptionally insightful and distinctive publications that contain significant and original contributions to the study of law or politics in general. As of June 2016, the DCL has been suspended, pending a reform of the higher doctorates.<ref>[https://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2015-2016/16june2016-no5137/notices/#234506 ''Education Committee: Suspension of higher degrees,'' Oxford University Gazette vol. 146 no. 5137 (16 June 2016)]</ref> The DCL is senior to all degrees save the [[Doctor of Divinity]] which was traditionally the highest degree bestowed by the Universities. The degree of [[Doctor of Canon Law]] was replaced by the DCL after [[the Reformation]].
The degree of Doctor of Civil Law by Diploma is customarily conferred on foreign [[Heads of State]], as well as on the [[Chancellor of Oxford University|Chancellor of the University]]. (The [[British Sovereign]] is unable to receive university degrees, since these would, theoretically, place her under the jurisdiction of the Chancellor of the university. Prior to her accession, the present [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] did accept several honorary degrees, including an Oxford DCL in 1948).<ref>See 'Honorary Degrees', in Ronald Allison and Sarah Riddell, eds., ''The Royal Encyclopedia'' (London; Basingstoke: [[Macmillan Publishing|Macmillan]], 1991), p. 264.</ref>

The following other higher institutions also provide for awarding a DCL:

* [[University of Durham]], United Kingdom
* [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], United Kingdom
* [[University of Kent]], [[Kent]], United Kingdom
* [[McGill University]] [[McGill University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]], [[Montreal, Quebec]] Canada
* [[Louisiana State University]] [[Paul M. Hebert Law Center]], [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]], United States
* [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Rome]]
* [[University of Santo Tomas|Royal and Pontifical University of Santo Tomas]], [[Philippines]]
