'''''How Do You Know''''' is a 2010 American [[romantic comedy]]<ref name="afi" /> film directed, written, and produced by [[James L. Brooks]] and starring [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Paul Rudd]], and [[Jack Nicholson]] (in his last feature film role to date). It was the third film to feature Witherspoon and Rudd following 1998’s ''[[Overnight Delivery]]'' and 2009’s ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]''. The film was shot in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. ''How Do You Know'' was released theatrically on December 17, 2010, and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $49 million against a $120 million budget. It received generally negative reviews.

==Plot==
Softball player Lisa Jorgenson begins dating Matty Reynolds, a pitcher for the [[Washington Nationals]]. She also receives an intriguing phone call from a young executive, George Madison, who was advised by a friend of Lisa's to give her a call. George calls out of politeness because he wants to explain that his relationship with his girlfriend has just become more serious. But life takes an abrupt turn for the worse for George when he suddenly finds himself the target of a federal criminal investigation for corporate [[malfeasance]] at a company run by his father, Charles Madison. George is fired from his job and abandoned by the company, with the exception of his father and his pregnant secretary, Annie.

Still reeling from this blow, George goes to his girlfriend for sympathy and is stunned when she immediately breaks up with him. Lisa is devastated when she is left off the [[United States women's national softball team|Team USA]] roster. On a whim, George calls again to invite Lisa to lunch and she accepts. It turns out to be a disaster; George is so overwhelmed with his troubles that Lisa eventually asks that they just eat in silence, and they part ways not expecting to see one another again. Unsure what to do next, Lisa moves in with Matty, who has a penthouse in the same upscale building where George's father lives. Matty is rich, well-meaning and fun, but is also immature and insensitive, and continues to have casual affairs with other women.

George is indicted and could face prison time. Annie is so loyal that she tries to give him inside information in advance, but he urges her not to lose her own job. George and Lisa bump into each other in Matty’s building and George offers to help Lisa carry her groceries home. Matty returns home and is upset to find Lisa at “his place” with an uninvited guest. He inadvertently offends her, so Lisa moves out and spends a pleasant, tipsy evening at George's modest new apartment. George's father then drops one last bombshell on his son: It was he who committed the illegal act for which George is being charged. Due to a previous conviction, Charles would spend at least 25 years &mdash; basically, the rest of his life &mdash; in prison, whereas George would only do three years at most.

On the night Annie's baby is born and her boyfriend proposes, Lisa begins to reconsider her previous reluctance to settle down. George is clearly smitten with her, but Matty pleads for another chance and she accepts. George makes a proposition to his father: he will take one more shot at persuading Lisa to be with him. If she does, Charles must go to jail, and if she doesn't, George will take the rap for his dad. At a birthday party that Matty throws for her, George confesses his feelings for Lisa and tells her to meet him downstairs if she decides she reciprocates them too. George then leaves the party and goes downstairs to give her time to think it over. Finally, Lisa says goodbye to Matty and joins George outside. Charles looking on from above smiles at the sight, but the smile soon fades as he realises that he has to go to jail. 

Lisa is confused about her feelings and tells George, "I thought you were this silly guy. Now it's like... everything but you seems silly." George suggests she had never felt the kind of overwhelming love where the guy is the whole deal, which helps her realise that she's in love with him. Lisa then reaches out and holds George's hand and they are seen boarding a bus together.

[[Bill Murray]] was Brooks' original choice for the role of Charles Madison.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|access-date=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=May 20, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Production==
Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film, he also became interested in "the dilemmas of contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they may not even be aware." He created [[Paul Rudd]]'s and [[Jack Nicholson]]'s characters for this concept.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/movies/23brooks.html |title=Star-Heavy Big-Budget Love Story Bucks Trend |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2010-03-22 |author=Cieply, Michael}}</ref> Filming finished in November 2009,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/11/03/reese-witherspoon-sheds-some-light-on-her-untitled-project-with-james-l-brooks/#more-24059 |title=Reese Witherspoon Sheds Some Light On Her Untitled Project With James L.

The combined [[salary|salaries]] for the director Brooks (about $10 million) and the four major stars Witherspoon ($15 million), Nicholson ($12 million), Wilson ($10 million) and Rudd ($3 million) totaled about $50 million. Brooks' "slow and meticulous" production and post-production also explained the size of the budget.<ref name="HollywoodReporter">{{cite news | date=2010-12-10 | first=Kim | last=Masters | title=EXCLUSIVE: 'How Do You Know' Price Tag: $120 Million, $50 Million Just for Talent | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/price-tag-120-million-50-58410 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | access-date=2010-12-19}}</ref>

Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave it a mixed review, and called it "A low-impact romantic comedy-drama from James L.
