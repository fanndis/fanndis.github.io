'''Joseph Broussard '''(1702–1765), also known as '''Beausoleil''' ({{lang-en|Beautiful Sun}}), was a leader of the [[Acadians|Acadian people]] in [[Acadia]]; later [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[New Brunswick]]. Broussard organized a [[Military history of the Mi’kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] and [[Military history of the Acadians|Acadian militia]]s against the British through [[King George's War]], [[Father Le Loutre's War]] and during the [[French and Indian War]].  After the loss of Acadia to the British, he eventually led the first group of Acadians to southern Louisiana in present-day [[United States]]. His name is sometimes presented as Joseph Gaurhept Broussard; this is likely the result of a transcription error.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://bayoutechedispatches.blogspot.com/2012/04/middle-name-or-clerical-error-joseph.html| title = Middle Name or Clerical Error?: Joseph Broussard dit Beausoleil and 'Gaurhept', Shane K. Bernard| accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref> Broussard is widely regarded as a hero and an important historical figure by both Acadians and Cajuns.

==Life==
Broussard was born in [[Port-Royal_(Acadia)|Port-Royal, Nova Scotia]] in 1702 to Jean-François Broussard and Catherine Richard. His father came from [[Poitiers]] and his mother was born in Port Royal. He lived much of his life at Le Cran (present-day [[Stoney Creek, New Brunswick|Stoney Creek]], [[Albert County, New Brunswick]]), along the [[Petitcodiac River]] with his wife Agnes and their eleven children.

During [[Father Rale's War]], Broussard participated in a raid on [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia]] (1724).<ref>James Laxer, ''The Acadians: In Search of a Homeland,'' Anchor Canada Press, p. 103</ref>

===King George's War===
During [[King George's War]], under the leadership of French priest [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]], Broussard began actively resisting the British occupation of Acadia. Broussard's forces often included [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] allies in their resistance against the British. In 1747 he participated in and was later charged for his involvement with the [[Battle of Grand Pré]].

===Father Le Loutre's War===
During [[Father Le Loutre's War]], after the construction of [[Fort Beausejour]] in 1751, Broussard joined [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]] at Beausejour. In an effort to stop the British movement into Acadia, in 1749 Broussard was involved in one of the first raids on [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)|Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]] which resulted in the deaths of five British settlers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grenier|first=John|title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG5h6G5fWMC&pg=PP1|year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3876-3|page=150|ref=harv}}</ref> The following year, Broussard was in the [[Battle at Chignecto]] and then shortly afterward he led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)|"Dartmouth Massacre"]] (1751). Broussard and the others killed twenty British civilians and took more prisoners.{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|p=160}} Cornwallis temporarily abandoned plans to settle Dartmouth.{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|p=161}}

In late April 1754, Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown.  They arrived in mid-May and in the night opened fired on the village.  Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers. By August, as the raids continued, the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Dianne|title=Heroes of the Acadian Resistance: The Story of Joseph Beausoleil Broussard and Pierre II Surette 1702-1765|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4ZiQ2udL94C&pg=PA110|year=2011|publisher=Formac|location=Halifax|isbn=978-0-88780-978-1|pages=110–111}}</ref>

[[File:CaptureOfAlcideAndLys.jpg|thumb|right| [[Action of 8 June 1755|Capture of French ships Alcide and Lys]] off Newfoundland. The ships were carrying war supplies for Acadians and Mi'kmaq]]
In the [[Action of 8 June 1755]], a naval battle off [[Cape Race]], Newfoundland, on board the French ships Alcide and Lys were found 10,000 scalping knives for Acadians and Indians serving under Chief [[Jean-Baptiste Cope]] and Acadian Beausoleil as they continue to fight Father Le Loutre's War.<ref>{{cite book|last=Raddall|first=Thomas Head|authorlink=Thomas Head Raddall|title=Halifax, warden of the north|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07tPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PP1|year=1948|publisher=McClelland & Stewart|page=45}}</ref>

Broussard was also active in the fight against Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Monckton]] in the [[Battle of Beausejour]].{{sfnp|Grenier|2008|p=171}}

===French and Indian War===
With Le Loutre imprisoned after the [[Battle of Beausejour]], Broussard became the leader of an armed resistance during the [[expulsion of the Acadians]] (1755&ndash;1764), leading assaults against the British on several occasions between 1755 and 1758 as part of the forces of [[Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot]].<ref name="www2.umoncton.ca"/>
After arming a ship in 1758, Broussard traveled through the upper [[Bay of Fundy]] region, where he attacked the British. His ship was seized in November 1758. He was then forced to flee, travelling first to the [[Miramichi Valley|Miramichi]] and later imprisoned at [[Fort Edward (Nova Scotia)|Fort Edward]] in 1762. Finally, he was transferred and imprisoned with other Acadians in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

===Arrival at Louisiana===
Released in 1764, the year after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Broussard left Nova Scotia, along with his family and hundreds of other Acadians, to [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day Haiti).<ref>Shane K. Bernard. "Cajuns and their Acadian ancestors: a young reader's history", 2008, University Press of Mississippi, p. 31, {{ISBN|978-1-934110-78-2}}</ref> Unable to adapt to the climate and diseases that were killing Acadians, he led the group to settle in [[Louisiana]].<ref>C.

He was among the first 200 [[Acadians]] to arrive in Louisiana on February 27, 1765, aboard the ''Santo Domingo''.<ref>[http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm "Broussard named for early settler Valsin Broussard"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521212233/http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm |date=2009-05-21 }}</ref> On April 8, 1765, he was appointed militia captain and commander of the "Acadians of the [[Atakapa]]s" the area around present-day St. Martinville, La.<ref name="www2.umoncton.ca"/> Not long after his arrival, Joseph Broussard died near what is now [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]] at the presumed age of 63. The exact date of his death is unknown, but it is assumed to have been on or about October 20, 1765. Many of his descendants live in southern Louisiana and Nova Scotia.

==Modern cultural references==
The [[Cajun music]] group [[BeauSoleil]] is named after him.

A New Brunswick group "Beausoleil Broussard" was very popular in the 1970s.

He is a character in the novel ''Banished from Our Home: The Acadian Diary of Angelique Richard, Grand-Pre, Acadia, 1755'' (2004) by Sharon Stewart. 

A dramatized, historically inaccurate version of Beausoleil is featured in the Acadian novel ''Pélagie-la-Charette,'' by Antonine Maillet.

Part of his militant Acadian hero story is told in the documentary feature "Zachary Richard, Cajun Heart" by Acadian director Phil Comeau.
