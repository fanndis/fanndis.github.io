A '''blind trust''' is a [[Trust law|trust]] in which the [[beneficiary (trust)|trust beneficiaries]] have no knowledge of the holdings of the trust, and no right to intervene in their handling. In a blind trust, the [[trustee]]s ([[fiduciary|fiduciaries]], or those who have been given [[power of attorney]]) have full discretion over the assets. Blind trusts are generally used when a trust creator (sometimes called a [[settlor]], [[Settlor|trustor]], grantor, or donor) wishes for the beneficiary to be unaware of the specific assets in the trust, such as to avoid [[conflict of interest]] between the beneficiary and the investments.

[[Politician]]s, or others in sensitive positions (such as [[journalists]] and religious leaders) often place their personal assets (including investment income) into blind trusts, to avoid public scrutiny and accusations of [[conflicts of interest]] when they direct government funds to the private sector.

==Use by US government officials to avoid conflicts of interest==
The US federal government recognizes the "qualified blind trust" (QBT), as defined by the [[Ethics in Government Act]] and related regulations.<ref>{{CodeFedReg |5|2634}}, Subpart D</ref> In order for a blind trust to be a QBT, the trustee must not be affiliated with, associated with, related to, or subject to the control or influence of the government official.<ref name="QBT1">{{cite web|title=Title 5 United States Code 102(f)(3)(A)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05a/usc_sec_05a_00000102----000-.html|website=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=4 February 2017}}</ref>

Because the assets initially placed in the QBT are known to the government official (who is both creator and beneficiary of the trust), these assets continue to pose a potential conflict of interest until they have been sold (or reduced to a value less than $1,000). New assets purchased by the trustee will not be disclosed to the government official, so they will not pose a conflict.<ref name="QBT1" />

==British party funding==
In the [[United Kingdom]], while the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was in [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] in 1992–97, its [[Official opposition frontbench (UK)|front bench]] received funding from blind trusts. One set up to fund its campaign in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] received donations from wealthy supporters, some of whose names leaked out, and some of whom received [[life peerage]]s into the [[House of Lords]] after Labour won the election.<ref>

</ref> The Neill Committee's report in 1998 found the use of blind trusts to be "inconsistent with the principles of [[openness]] and [[accountability]]" and recommended that such trusts be "prohibited as a mechanism for funding political parties, party leaders or their offices, [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] or parliamentary candidates"
