'''Orpah''' ({{lang-he|עָרְפָּה}} ''ʿorpā'', meaning "neck" or "fawn") is a woman mentioned in the [[Book of Ruth]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. She was from [[Moab]] and was the daughter-in-law of [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]] and wife of [[Chilion]].<ref>Ruth 1:4</ref> After the death of her husband, Orpah and her sister-in-law [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] wished to go to [[Judea]] with Naomi. However, Naomi tried to persuade both Ruth and Orpah to return to their people and to their gods. Ruth chose to remain with Naomi, however, Orpah chose to return to her people and her gods. (Ruth i. 4 et seq.).

In [[rabbinic literature]], Orpah is identified with Herse, the mother of the four Philistine giants, one of whom was [[Goliath]]. These four sons were said to have been given her for the four tears which she shed at parting with her mother-in-law (Babylonian Talmud, [[Nashim|Sotah]] 42b). Her other name Harafa is cognate of the word for [[threshing]]; that she allowed herself to be "threshed" by many men as one would thresh wheat (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 42b).

According to a legend in a [[midrash]], Orpah was a sister of Ruth, and both were daughters of the [[Eglon (king)|Moabite King Eglon]] ([[Ruth Rabbah|Ruth R. ii. 9]]). Her name was changed to "Orpah" because she turned her back (from {{lang-he| עורף}}, literally [[nape]]) on her mother-in-law (ib.; comp. [[Nashim|Talmud Sotah]] l.c.).

The [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]] tractate in the Talmud that she was killed by [[King David]]'s general [[Abishai (Bible)|Abishai]], the son of [[Zeruiah]], with her own [[Spindle_(textiles)|spindle]].<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_95.html Talmud Sanhedrin 95a]</ref>
