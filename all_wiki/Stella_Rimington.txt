'''Dame Stella Rimington''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DCB}} (born 13 May 1935) is a British author and former [[Director General of MI5]], a position she held from 1992 to 1996. She was the first female DG of [[MI5]], and the first DG whose name was publicised on appointment. In 1993, Rimington became the first DG of MI5 to pose openly for cameras at the launch of a brochure outlining the organisation's activities.<ref>{{cite journal |title=First lady of espionage |journal=[[BBC News Online]] |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1532221.stm |issue=8 September |accessdate=26 October 2008 | date=8 September 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=1993: Secret Service goes public |format=[[BBC News Online]]: On This Day (16 July) |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/16/newsid_2504000/2504329.stm |accessdate=26 October 2008 | date=16 July 1993}}</ref>

==Early life==
Rimington was born Stella Whitehouse in [[South London]], England; her family moved from [[South Norwood]] to [[Essex]] in 1939, due to the danger of living in London during [[World War II]]. Her father got a job as chief draughtsman at a steel works in [[Barrow-in-Furness]] in Cumbria, and the family moved there and she was educated at Croslands Convent School<ref>{{cite web|title=Stella attended Croslands|url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/dalton/Stella-attended-Croslands-28cda19e-27c6-49be-92c3-975f6d7d633b-ds|publisher=North West Evening Mail|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref> after spending some time in [[Wallasey]]. When her father got a job in [[Ilkeston]], Derbyshire, the family moved to the [[English midlands|Midlands]], where Stella attended [[Nottingham High School for Girls]]. She spent her last summer of secondary school working as an ''[[au pair]]'' in Paris, before enrolling at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1954 to study English. By chance, she met her future husband, John Rimington, whom she had known from [[Nottingham]].

Completing her degree in 1958, she studied archive administration at the [[University of Liverpool]], before beginning work as an [[archivist]] at the [[Worcestershire Record Office|County Record Office]] in [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] in 1959. In 1963, she married John Rimington and moved to London, where she successfully applied for a position at the [[India Office Records|India Office Library]].

In 1965, her husband was offered an overseas posting as First Secretary (Economic) for the British [[High Commission]] in New Delhi, India, and the couple sailed to India in September.

==India and MI5==
In 1967, after two years in India, Rimington was asked to assist one of the First Secretaries at the High Commission with his office work. She agreed, and when she began, discovered that he was the representative in India of the British Security Service ([[MI5]]). Gaining her security clearance, Rimington worked in the MI5 office for nearly two years, until she and her husband returned to London in 1969, where she decided to apply for a permanent position at MI5.

Between 1969 and 1990, Rimington worked in all three branches of the Security Service: [[counter espionage]], counter subversion, and [[counter terrorism]].
Following the 1979 [[Department of Health and Social Security]] computer operators strike, Rimington became an assistant director of the revived Inter-departmental Group on Subversion in Public Life to identify and limit the actions of subversives in the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil service]].<ref name=guardian-20180724>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/24/subversive-civil-servants-secretly-blacklisted-under-thatcher |title='Subversive' civil servants secretly blacklisted under Thatcher |last=Cobain |first=Ian |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 July 2018 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref>

In 1989, she gave evidence in court against the Czechoslovak spy [[Václav Jelínek]] (prosecuted under his alias of "Erwin van Haarlem"), using the alias "Miss J".<ref name="Maysh">{{Cite book|title=The Spy With No Name |first=Jeff |last=Maysh |authorlink=Jeff Maysh |publisher=Amazon |series=Kindle Singles |year=2017}}</ref> In 1990, she was promoted to one of the Service's two Deputy Director General positions, where she oversaw MI5's move to [[Thames House]]. In December 1991, she made a visit to Moscow to make the first friendly contact between the British intelligence services and their old enemies the [[KGB]]. On her return from Russia, she was told she had been promoted to Director General.

==Director General==
In her first months as Director General, Rimington was subject to a determined campaign by the British press to identify her. The ''[[New Statesman]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'' had obtained and published covert photographs of her, despite which Rimington oversaw a public relations campaign to improve the [[openness]] of the Service and increase public transparency. On 16 July 1993, MI5 (with the reluctant approval of the [[British Government]]) published a 36-page booklet titled ''The Security Service'', which revealed publicly, for the first time, details of MI5's activities, operations and duties, as well as the identity and even photographs of Rimington as Director General.

Rimington retired from MI5 in 1996. She was made a [[Order of the Bath|Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (DCB) in the [[British honours system|New Year Honours List]] in 1996.

==Post-MI5==
Rimington's work after leaving MI5 has been as a non-executive director for companies such as [[Marks & Spencer]] and [[BG Group]].

Rimington published her memoirs, entitled ''Open Secret'', in 2001. In July 2004, her first novel, ''At Risk'', about a female intelligence officer, Liz Carlyle, was published. Her other novels are ''Secret Asset'' (August 2006), ''Illegal Action'' (August 2007), ''Dead Line'' (October 2008), ''Present Danger'' (September 2009), ''Rip Tide'' (July 2011), ''The Geneva Trap'' (July 2012) and ''Close Call'' (2014).<ref>[http://spywise.net/rimington.html Spies in history and literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129210526/http://spywise.net/rimington.html |date=29 November 2010 }}</ref> Her novels are part of a tradition of "insider" [[spy fiction]] written by former spies in the UK, especially in MI5, going back to [[John Bingham, 7th Baron Clanmorris]], [[John Le Carré]], and [[Ted Allbeury]], among others.

In 2004, she continued her interest in [[archives]], fostered by her early career, through involvement with the Archives Task Force, where she visited a number of archives through the country and contributed to the report for the future strategy of archives in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |title=Listening to the Past, Speaking to the Future |format=[[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] |url=http://www.mlasouthwest.org.uk/index.php?SID=988&YEAR=2004&ID=28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928134737/http://www.mlasouthwest.org.uk/index.php?SID=988&YEAR=2004&ID=28 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 September 2007 |access-date=8 February 2009 }}</ref>

In November 2005 she spoke out against [[British national identity card|national ID cards]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex MI5 chief sparks ID card row |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4444512.stm |accessdate=26 October 2008 | work=BBC News | date=17 November 2005}}</ref> She has also described the US response to the [[9/11 attacks]] as a "huge overreaction."<ref name=guardian-20081018>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/18/stella-rimington-9-11-mi5 |title=Response to 9/11 was 'huge overreaction' - ex-MI5 chief |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |newspaper=The Guardian |date=18 October 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref> In remarks reported in 2009, Rimington expressed concerns that the Brown administration was not "recognizing that there are risks, rather than frightening people in order to be able to pass laws which restrict civil liberties, precisely one of the objects of terrorism: that we live in fear and under a police state."<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4643415/Spy-chief-We-risk-a-police-state.html Spy chief: We risk a police state]</ref>

On 5 October 2009 the [[BBC]] broadcast a statement from Rimington who claimed that certain MI5 files collected by her predecessors had been destroyed, but without clarifying whether this took place during her appointment as Director General, or as part of her later involvement with the Archives Task Force.

In 2009, Rimington received an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Social Science from [[Nottingham Trent University]] in recognition of her support for openness about the work of the secret service.

She was chair of the judges for the 2011 [[Man Booker Prize]]. She and her fellow judges were widely criticised for focusing on "readability" rather than literary quality. Rimington responded during her speech at the Booker ceremony with a "diatribe" in which she compared British literary critics to the KGB.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/oct/19/stella-rimington-booker-diatribe-kgb Booker prize 2011: Stella Rimington's broadside against critics was entertaining, for all the wrong reasons]</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1963 she married John Rimington, whom she knew from school. In 1984 they separated, with Stella retaining custody of their two daughters. They have never divorced.<ref name=telegraph-20110710>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/ways-with-words/8617927/The-perfect-spy-Stella-Rimington.html |title=The perfect spy: Stella Rimington |last=Durrant |first=Sabine |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=10 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref>

==Bibliography==

===''At Risk''===
Rimington's first novel, ''At Risk'', brings her knowledge of spy operations to the thriller genre. Her heroine, 34-year-old Liz Carlyle, an MI5 intelligence officer, receives information that a terrorist threat is imminent, and that it will be assisted by an "invisible" young British woman who can easily blend into the background and cross borders easily. Liz must not only deal with the impending crisis, but she must put up with the patronising sexist attitude from her MI6 partner. Danger lurks constantly for both Liz and the "invisible" woman as their paths come closer to each other. ''At Risk'' has received positive reviews with ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' saying, "''At Risk'' is breezily told, seldom pompous, and the plot, though every bit as hokey as you'd expect, winds its threads together very entertainingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3619659/An-insider-job.html|title=An insider job|last=Leith|first=Sam|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref>"
