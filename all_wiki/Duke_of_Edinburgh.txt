[[File:Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales by Philip Mercier.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Frederick Louis]] (1707–1751) was the first Duke of Edinburgh, from 1726 to his death.]]

'''Duke of Edinburgh''', named after the city of [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], is a [[substantive title]] that has been created three times for members of the [[British royal family]] since 1726. The current holder is [[Prince Philip]], husband of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

==1726 creation==
[[File:George III As Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[George III of the United Kingdom|Prince George]] was the second Duke of Edinburgh, before he became George III.]]
The title was first created in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]] on 26 July 1726 by King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who bestowed it on his grandson [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Frederick]], who also became [[Prince of Wales]] the following year. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom were '''Baron of Snowdon''', in the County of Caernarvon, '''Viscount of Launceston''', in the County of Cornwall, '''Earl of Eltham''', in the County of Kent,<ref name="gazette12july1726">{{London Gazette |issue=6494 |date=12 July 1726 |page=1 }}</ref> and '''Marquess of the Isle of Ely'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/peers/peersE1.htm |title=Peerages: Eames to Emly |publisher=Leighrayment.com |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref> These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. The marquessate was apparently erroneously [[London Gazette|gazetted]] as Marquess of the [[Isle of Wight]]<ref name="gazette12july1726"/> although Marquess of the [[Isle of Ely]] was the intended title. In later editions of the ''[[London Gazette]]'' the Duke is referred to as the Marquess of the Isle of Ely.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=6741 |date=4 January 1728 |page=2 }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=9050 |date=16 April 1751 |page=1 }}</ref> Upon Frederick's death, the titles were inherited by his son Prince George. When Prince George became [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in 1760, the titles "[[merged into the Crown]]", and ceased to exist.

==1866 creation==
[[Queen Victoria]] re-created the title, this time in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], on 24 May 1866 for her second son [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]], instead of [[Duke of York]], the traditional title of the second son of the Monarch. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom were '''Earl of Kent''' and '''Earl of Ulster''', also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=23119 |date=25 May 1866 |page=3127 }}</ref> When Alfred became the [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha#Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1826–1918)|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in 1893, he retained his British titles. His only son [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] committed suicide in 1899, so the Dukedom of Edinburgh and subsidiary titles became extinct upon the elder Alfred's death in 1900.

==1947 creation==
The title was created for a third time on 19 November 1947 by King [[George VI]], who bestowed it on his son-in-law [[Philip Mountbatten]], when he married [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]. Subsequently, Elizabeth was styled "HRH The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh" until her accession in 1952. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom are '''[[Earl of Merioneth]]''' and '''[[Baron Greenwich]]''', of Greenwich in the County of London. Like the dukedom, these titles are also in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38128 |date=21 November 1947 |page=5496 }}</ref> Earlier that year, Philip had renounced his Greek and Danish royal titles (he was born a Prince of Greece and Denmark, being a male-line grandson of King [[George I of Greece]] and male-line great-grandson of King [[Christian IX of Denmark]]) along with his rights to the Greek throne. In 1957, Philip became a [[Prince of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=41009 |date=22 February 1957 |page=1209 }}</ref>

==Possible future creations==
It was announced in 1999, at the time of the wedding of [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]], that he would follow [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|his father]] as Duke of Edinburgh.  This is unlikely to happen by direct inheritance, as Prince Edward is the youngest of Prince Philip's three sons.  Rather, the title is expected to be newly created for Prince Edward after it "eventually reverts to the Crown"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/The%20Earl%20of%20Wessex.aspx |title=The Earl of Wessex |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=2010-10-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203012826/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/The%20Earl%20of%20Wessex.aspx |archive-date=3 December 2010 }}</ref> after "both the death of the current Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales' succession as King".<ref>''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'' 2010, page 46 'Peers of the Blood Royal'</ref>

==Line of succession==
Although the following individuals are in the line of succession to the Dukedom, they are also in line of succession to the throne. As a consequence, should one of the following individuals become king while Duke, the Dukedom of Edinburgh would cease to exist, as it would merge with the Crown.
