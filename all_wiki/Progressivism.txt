'''Progressivism''' is a [[political philosophy]] in support of [[social reform]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/progressivism|title=Progressivism in English|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=2 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321174257/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/progressivism|archive-date=21 March 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Based on the [[idea of progress]] in which advancements in [[science]], [[technology]], [[economic development]] and [[social organization]] are vital to the improvement of the [[human condition]], progressivism became highly significant during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe, out of the belief that Europe was demonstrating that societies could progress in [[civility]] from uncivilized conditions to civilization through strengthening the basis of [[empirical knowledge]] as the foundation of society.<ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157">Harold Mah. [https://books.google.com/?id=WVlGIelNNNcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Enlightenment Phantasies: Cultural Identity in France and Germany, 1750–1914]. Cornell University. (2003). p. 157.</ref> Figures of the Enlightenment believed that progress had [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application to all societies and that these ideas would spread across the world from Europe.<ref name="Harold Mah 1914. p157"/>

The contemporary common political conception of progressivism emerged from the vast [[social change]]s brought about by [[industrialization]] in the Western world in the late-19th century. Progressives take the view that progress is being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] with [[monopolistic]] [[corporation]]s; and the intense and often violent conflict between capitalists and workers, arguing that measures were needed to address these problems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068| pages=2}}</ref>

The meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives. Early-20th century progressivism was tied to [[eugenics]] and the [[temperance movement]], both of which were promoted in the name of public health and as initiatives toward that goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/progress/prohib/ |title=Prohibition: A Case Study of Progressive Reform |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=2017-10-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |year=2005 |last=Leonard |first=Thomas |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=207–224 |doi=10.1257/089533005775196642 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |accessdate=2017-10-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820132528/https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |archivedate=20 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|jstor=4026900|title=Geneticists and the Eugenics Movement in Scandinavia|last=Roll-Hansen|first=Nils|journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]]|volume=22|issue=3|pages=335–346|date=1989|doi=10.1017/S0007087400026194|pmid=11621984}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=2005|last=Freeden|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Freeden|title=Liberal Languages: Ideological Imaginations and Twentieth-Century Progressive Thought|pages=144–165|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Lpu8wwvA1AC&pg=144|isbn=978-0691116778}}</ref><ref>James H.

=== From the Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution ===
[[File:Kant gemaelde 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] identified progress as being a movement away from [[Barbarian|barbarism]] towards [[civilization]]. 18th-century philosopher and political scientist [[Marquis de Condorcet]] predicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of [[slavery]], the rise of [[literacy]], the lessening of [[sex inequality]], [[prison reform]]s which at the time were harsh and the decline of poverty.<ref>Nisbet, Robert (1980). History of the Idea of Progress. New York: Basic Books. ch 5</ref>

[[Modernity]] or modernization was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to [[free market]]s and [[Freedom of movement|free movements]] of people.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Joyce Appleby |author2=Lynn Hunt |author3=Margaret Jacob  |name-list-style=amp |title=Telling the Truth about History |year=1995 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0aCcnVcbZcC&pg=78|isbn=9780393078916 }}</ref>

[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]]]
In the late 19th century, a political view rose in popularity in the Western world that progress was being stifled by vast [[economic inequality]] between the rich and the poor, minimally regulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] with out-of-control [[monopolistic]] [[corporation]]s, intense and often violent conflict between capitalists and workers, with a need for measures to address these problems.<ref>{{cite book |title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068|page=2}}</ref> Progressivism has influenced various political movements. [[Social liberalism]] was influenced by British [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]]'s conception of people being "progressive beings".<ref>Alan Ryan. ''The Making of Modern Liberalism''. p. 25.</ref> British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] developed [[progressive conservatism]] under [[One-nation conservatism|one-nation]] [[Toryism]].<ref>Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran. ''British Political Science: Fifty Years of Political Studies''. Oxford, England, UK; Malden, Massachusetts: Wiley-Blackwell, 2000. pp. 107–08.</ref><ref>Robert Blake. Disraeli. Second Edition. London, England, UK: Eyre & Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd, 1967. p. 524.</ref>

In France, the space between [[social revolution]] and the [[socially-conservative]] ''laissez-faire'' [[centre-right]] was filled  with the emergence of [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] which thought that [[social progress]] required [[anti-clericalism]], [[humanism]] and [[republicanism]]. Especially anti-clericalism was the dominant influence on the [[centre-left]] in many French- and Romance-speaking countries until the mid 20th-century. In [[Imperial Germany]], Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] enacted various progressive [[social welfare]] measures out of [[paternalistic conservative]] motivations to distance workers from the [[socialist movement]] of the time and as humane ways to assist in maintaining the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Union Contributions to Labor Welfare Policy and Practice: Past, Present, and Future. Routledge, 16, 2013. p. 172.</ref>

In 1891, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] condemned the [[exploitation of labour]] and urged support for [[labour unions]] and [[government regulation]] of businesses in the interests of [[social justice]] while upholding the [[right to property]] and criticizing socialism.<ref>Faith Jaycox. [http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=A45775BE9CF853C263D1597D2B161F30 The Progressive Era]. New York, New York: Infobase Publishing, 2005. p. 85.</ref> A [[Protestant]] progressive outlook called the [[Social Gospel]] emerged in North America that focused on challenging economic exploitation and poverty and by the mid-1890s was common in many Protestant theological seminaries in the United States.<ref>Charles Howard Hopkins, ''The Rise of the Social Gospel in American Protestantism, 1865–1915'' (1940).</ref>

=== Contemporary mainstream political conception ===
[[File:President Roosevelt - Pach Bros.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Theodore Roosevelt]]]]
In the United States, progressivism began as a [[social movement]] in the 1890s and grew into a [[political movement]] in what was known as the [[Progressive Era]]. While the term ''American progressives'' represent a range of diverse [[political pressure group]]s (not always united), some American progressives rejected [[social Darwinism]], believing that the problems society faced such as [[class warfare]], [[greed]], [[poverty]], [[racism]] and [[violence]] could best be addressed by providing good education, a safe environment and an efficient workplace. Progressives lived mainly in the cities, were college educated and believed that government could be a tool for change.<ref>[http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/progressive-era.cfm he Progressive Era (1890–1920)], The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project (retrieved 31 September 2014).</ref> President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and later the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] declared that he "always believed that wise progressivism and wise conservatism go hand in hand".<ref>Jonathan Lurie. William Howard Taft: The Travails of a Progressive Conservative. New York, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. 196.</ref>

[[File:Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Harris & Ewing bw photo portrait, 1919.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Woodrow Wilson]]]]
President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was also a member of the American progressive movement within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Progressive stances have evolved over time. [[Imperialism]] was a controversial issue within progressivism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the United States, where some progressives supported [[American imperialism]] while others opposed it.<ref name="nugent">{{cite book|title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Nugent, Walter|year=2010|isbn=9780195311068|pages=33}}</ref> In response to [[World War I]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] established the concept of national [[self-determination]] and criticized imperialist competition and colonial injustices. These views were supported by [[anti-imperialists]] in areas of the world that were resisting imperial rule.<ref>Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace. p. 309.</ref>

During the period of acceptance of economic [[Keynesianism]] (1930s–1970s), there was widespread acceptance in many nations of a large role for [[state intervention]] in the economy. With the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and challenges to state [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] policies in the 1970s and 1980s, [[centre-left]] progressive movements responded by adopting the [[Third Way]] that emphasized a major role for the [[market economy]].<ref>Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. pp. 3–4, 16.</ref> There have been [[social democrats]] who have called for the social-democratic movement to move past Third Way.<ref>After the Third Way: The Future of Social Democracy in Europe. I. B. Taurus, 2012. p. 47.</ref> Prominent [[Progressive conservatism|progressive conservative]] elements in the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] have criticized neoliberalism.<ref>Hugh Bochel. The Conservative Party and Social Policy. The Policy Press, 2011. p. 108.</ref>

In the 21st century, progressives continue to favour [[public policy]] that reduces or ameliorates the harmful effects of [[economic inequality]] as well as systemic [[discrimination]] such as [[institutional racism]]; to advocate for [[Environmentalism|environmentally]] conscious policies as well as for [[social safety net]]s and [[workers' rights]]; and to oppose the [[negative externalities]] inflicted on the environment and society by [[monopolies]] or [[corporate]] influence on the democratic process. The unifying theme is to call attention to the negative impacts of current institutions or ways of doing things and to advocate for [[social progress]], i.e. for positive change as defined by any of several standards such as expansion of [[democracy]], increased [[egalitarianism]] in the form of [[Economic egalitarianism|economic]] and [[social equality]] as well as improved well being of a population. Proponents of social democracy have identified themselves as promoting the progressive cause.<ref>Henning Meyer, Jonathan Rutherford. The Future of European Social Democracy: Building the Good Society. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. p. 108.</ref>
