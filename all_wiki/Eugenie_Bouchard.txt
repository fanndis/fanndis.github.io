==Early life and junior career==
Eugenie Bouchard was born as one of twins to Michel Bouchard, an investment banker, and Julie Leclair in [[Montreal]].<ref name="LeclairG">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/30/eugenie-bouchard-beats-alize-cornet-wimbledon-2014|title=Majestic performance from Bouchard as rain hits play again at Wimbledon|work=The Guardian|date=June 30, 2014 |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}</ref>

Bouchard started playing tennis at the age of five and was a member of [[Tennis Canada]]'s National Training Centre in [[Montreal]]. She grew up in [[Westmount]], where she attended elementary school at [[The Study]], a private girls’ school, and lived on the same street as former prime minister [[Brian Mulroney]].<ref>[https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/eugenie-bouchard-used-to-living-with-great-expectations Eugenie Bouchard used to living with great expectations]</ref> At age 12, she moved to [[Florida]] with her mother to be coached by [[Nick Saviano]],<ref name="The Globe and Mail">{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/more-sports/bouchard-on-fast-track-to-stardom/article13592795/ |title=Bouchard on fast-track to tennis stardom|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref> where she met one of her best childhood friends, tennis player [[Laura Robson]].

He and two investors contributed money to the partnership in exchange for 10 percent of Bouchard's future earnings when she would become a professional tennis player. In August 2013, a court ruled that the partnership has no legal claims as Eugenie, then a 9-year-old, could not have reasonably agreed to giving away parts of her future earnings. Her father had argued that the money he had put into the partnership before Eugenie turned pro was a business loss which would have meant a tax benefit for himself.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/behind-the-bouchard-familys-double-fault-in-tax-court/article19500417/ |title=Behind The Bouchard Family's Double Fault On Tax Courts |work=The Globe and Mail| date=July 14, 2014| accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref>

At the [[2018 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Bouchard defeated [[Océane Dodin]] in the opening round before losing to world No. 1, [[Simona Halep]], in the second round. Following several poor results at the front-end of the season, including failure to qualify at the French Open, Bouchard's world ranking plummeted to 194 in early June, her lowest ranking in six years. Bouchard slowly improved her ranking over the coming months, starting with qualifying into main draw of [[2018 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], where she lost in the second round to [[Ashleigh Barty]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Barty serves up brilliance in Bouchard Wimbledon win | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/barty-serves-brilliance-bouchard-wimbledon-win | date = 5 July 2018 | accessdate = 5 July 2018}}</ref> Bouchard followed this up with a semi-final appearance at the [[2018 Ladies Championship Gstaad – Singles|Ladies Championship Gstaad]] to bring her ranking back to no.123 in the world.

At the [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], Bouchard showed glimpses of the player she once was, dropping just seven games in three qualifying matches in front of packed crowds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/eugenie-bouchard-us-open-qualifying-match-a-standing-room-only-affair/news-story/219d4030ae3853b2de1c3f85974195b7|title=Bouchard causes New York pandemonium|date=2018-08-24|website=NewsComAu|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> In the main draw, she continued her dominance from qualifying, dispatching French wildcard Harmony Tan, 6–3, 6–1.

Bouchard again struggled following the US Open, failing to win a main draw match at her next four tournaments. Her luck turned drastically at the [[2018 BGL Luxembourg Open – Singles|Luxembourg Open]], where she almost reached her first WTA final since the [[2016 Malaysian Open – Singles|2016 Malaysian Open]]. Bouchard won through three qualifying matches and then defeated [[Tímea Babos]], [[Carla Suárez Navarro]] and [[Andrea Petkovic]] to set up a semifinal clash with top seed [[Julia Görges]]. Despite serving for the match at 5–3 in the second set, Bouchard ultimately lost 7–6, 5–7, 1–6.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/tennis/bouchard-luxembourg-wta-semifinal-1.4870920|title=Eugenie Bouchard falls just short of reaching 1st WTA final in 2 years {{!}} CBC Sports|work=CBC|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/goerges-mounts-epic-comeback-against-bouchard-luxembourg|title=Goerges mounts epic comeback against Bouchard in Luxembourg|last=Livaudais|first=Stephanie|date=2018-10-19|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}</ref> The result, however, moved Bouchard inside the top 100 and saw her end 2018 as world No. 87.

===2019: Maiden doubles title, losing streak and rankings decline===
Bouchard began the season at the [[2019 ASB Classic – Women's Singles|ASB Classic]] in New Zealand, where she made the quarterfinals before losing to top seed Julia Görges. Bouchard also played doubles at the event, partnering American [[Sofia Kenin]]. The pair would go on to win the tournament, earning Bouchard her first doubles title on the WTA Tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Stories/64904/eugenie-bouchardsofia-kenin-turns-losses-into-an-auckland-doubles-title/|title=Eugenie Bouchard/Sofia Kenin turns losses into an Auckland Doubles title|website=Tennis World USA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref>

At the [[Australian Open]], Bouchard made short work of [[Peng Shuai]] in the opening round before falling to [[Serena Williams]] in the second round. With an early exit at the Australian Open, Bouchard opted to compete at the [[2019 Oracle Challenger Series – Newport Beach – Women's Singles|Oracle Challenger Series]] on the [[WTA 125K series]] tour (WTA's secondary level professional tour circuit). Seeded third, Bouchard progressed to the quarter-finals at the event, where she was defeated by compatriot [[Bianca Andreescu]].

In February, Bouchard was awarded a wildcard into the Premier 5 tournament in [[2019 Dubai Tennis Championships – Women's Singles|Dubai]]. Bouchard defeated [[Vera Lapko]] in the first round before losing to third-seed [[Simona Halep]] in the second round. The loss to Halep would begin a huge losing streak for Bouchard and some of the worst form since her initial slump in 2015. Bouchard failed to win a match at [[2019 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|Indian Wells]], [[2019 Miami Open – Women's Singles|Miami]], [[2019 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], [[2019 Eastbourne International – Women's Singles|Eastbourne]], [[2019 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], [[2019 Ladies Open Lausanne – Singles|Lausanne]], [[2019 Citi Open – Women's Singles|Washington]], [[2019 Rogers Cup – Women's Singles|Rogers Cup]], [[2019 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open – Women's Singles|Vancouver]] and [[2019 Bronx Open – Singles|New York]] to extend her losing streak to 11 matches across WTA main tour, qualifying and [[ITF Women's Circuit|ITF Circuit]] matches. At the [[2019 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], Bouchard's losing streak extended to 12 matches with a straight sets defeat to 12th seed [[Anastasija Sevastova]]. Bouchard's ranking fell outside the world's top 150 following her loss at the US Open.

She returned in late September at the [[2019 Central Coast Pro Tennis Open – Singles|Central Coast Open]] on the ITF Circuit. Seeded third, Bouchard crashed out of the tournament in the opening round to world No. 272, Gabriela Talaba, a little known Romanian player with zero top-200 wins prior to the tournament. The loss extended her losing streak to 13 matches. Following her continued poor results, Bouchard's ranking slumped to 224 in the world. Bouchard returned to the singles circuit at the [[2019 Oracle Challenger Series – Houston – Women's Singles|Oracle Challenger Series]] of the 125K series in Houston. At the event, Bouchard ended her 13-match losing streak and won her first match at any level in nine months, defeating [[Valentini Grammatikopoulou]] in straight sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/tennis-briefs-eugenie-bouchard-bounces-back-greek-freak-gets-his-revenge/news-story/a0747eabd8faad7390d323cb71210c56|title=Bouchard breaks painful dry spell|date=2019-11-11|website=NewsComAu|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> Bouchard also won through her second-round match against eighth-seed [[Francesca Di Lorenzo]] after Di Lorenzo retired a break down in the second set, but exited the tournament after retiring three-games into her third-round match against Mandy Minella following a foot injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/1495967/returning-falconi-vandeweghe-reach-semifinals-in-houston|title=Returning Falconi, Vandeweghe reach semifinals in Houston|website=Women's Tennis Association|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>

===2020: Resurgence; first WTA final in four years; best Grand Slam showing in three years===
At the [[2020 ASB Classic – Women's Singles|ASB Classic]] in Auckland, for which she was granted a wildcard, Bouchard showed some signs of a return to form, she defeated [[Kirsten Flipkens]] and eighth seed [[Caroline Garcia]] in straight sets before losing a hard-fought match to [[Amanda Anisimova]] in the quarterfinals. Bouchard entered the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles Qualifying|Australian Open qualifying]] unseeded where she won her first two matches against [[You Xiaodi]] and [[Maddison Inglis]] before slumping to a disappointing straight sets loss in the final qualifying round against [[Martina Trevisan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://au.eurosport.com/tennis/australian-open/2020/tennis-video-genie-bouchard-falls-to-world-no-154-martina-trevisan-in-australian-open-qualifying_sto7613541/story.shtml|title=Bouchard falls to world No 154 Trevisan in Australian Open qualifying|website=eurosport|language=en|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref> After the hiatus from tennis due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], she returned to tennis at the [[2020 Prague Open|Prague Open]] where she showed more signs of a return to form by upsetting eighth seed [[Veronika Kudermetova]] in the first round. She then defeated [[Tamara Zidanšek]] in three sets to make her second WTA quarterfinal of 2020.

==World TeamTennis==
Bouchard has played four seasons with [[World TeamTennis]] starting in 2009 when she debuted in the league with the [[Kansas City Explorers]], followed by a season with the [[Texas Wild]] in 2013, the [[New York Empire (tennis)|New York Empire]] in 2017, and the [[Orange County Breakers]] in 2019. It was announced that she will be joining the [[Chicago Smash]] for their debut season, during the 2020 WTT season set to begin July 12 at [[The Greenbrier]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wtt.com/2020/06/16/world-teamtennis-adds-stars-tiafoe-puig-raonic-bouchard-sock-as-rosters-set-for-2020/ |title=World TeamTennis Adds Stars Tiafoe, Puig, Roanic, Bouchard, & Sock As Rosters Set For 2020 |website=WTT.com |date=June 16, 2020 }}</ref>

Bouchard was dominant for the Smash in women's doubles with [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]] during the 2020 season, finishing the season with an 11–5 record, helping the Smash to earn a No. 2 seed in WTT Play-offs. The Smash defeated the [[Orlando Storm]] in the semifinals before falling to the [[New York Empire (tennis)]] in a super-tiebreaker for the championship.

==Playing style==
Bouchard employs a high-risk, aggressive playing style, focused on her powerful groundstrokes, that is played from the baseline. During her 2014 breakout season, Bouchard was noted for her ability to hit the ball hard, flat, and early on the rise, allowing her to defeat multiple top 10 players and run deep into Grand Slams.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/07/bouchard-takes-step-forward-win-over-taylor-wimbledon/74997/|title=Wimbledon finalist turned qualifier Eugenie Bouchard takes step ahead|work=Tennis|date=3 July 2018|accessdate=19 July 2020}}</ref> Her two-handed backhand is her strongest groundstoke, and consistently penetrates deep into the court, and allows her to push her opponents behind the baseline. Her forehand is notable for its condensed swing, allowing her to generate considerable power, and is especially effective when utilised to redirect power down the line. However, the condensed forehand swing also reduces the level of control Bouchard has over her forehand, which can result in the accumulation of unforced errors when employing this shot. Her first serve is powerful, averaging 103&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h), and having been recorded as high as 111&nbsp;mph (178&nbsp;km/h), allowing her to serve aces. Her second serve typically averages 84&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h), but is not particularly reliable. When nervous, double faults begin to seep into Bouchard's game, resulting in a relatively high double fault count. Due to her aggressive playing style, she rarely incorporates drop shots, lobs, or sliced backhands into points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/tennis/eugenie-bouchard-tennis-pros-weigh-in-on-her-struggles-1.3133478|title=Eugenie Bouchard: Tennis pros weigh in on her struggles|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Company]]|date=30 June 2015|accessdate=19 July 2020}}</ref> Bouchard is a strong lateral mover, but is not the fastest player on the WTA Tour, and her footwork sometimes lacks precision when she is nervous. Due to her doubles experience, Bouchard is a strong volleyer, although she rarely approaches the net when she plays singles matches. She has been noted for her competitive spirit and determination. Bouchard's major weakness is a lack of confidence in herself and her game, leading to accusations of "choking".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lastwordontennis.com/2018/04/18/glory-misery-went-wrong-eugenie-bouchard\|title=From Glory to Misery: Why it All Went Wrong for Eugenie Bouchard|work=Last Word on Tennis|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=19 July 2020}}</ref>
