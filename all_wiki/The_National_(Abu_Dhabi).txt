With its pledge to emulate [[Western world|Western]] newspaper standards and to "help society evolve", ''The National'' claims to be an anomaly in the [[Middle East]], where most media are tightly controlled by the government. Before ''The National'' moved to private ownership there were several high-level resignations across the editorial team regarding spiked stories and the newspaper's impotency when covering stories on Abu Dhabi.<ref name=":1" /> However, a major goal in establishing the paper was to have respect from the international community on the part of the government.<ref name="lisarei">{{cite journal|url=https://www.arabmediasociety.com/environmental-journalism-in-the-uae/|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|last=Reinisch|first=Lisa|title=Environmental Journalism in the UAE|journal=Arab Media & Society|access-date=16 April 2013}}</ref>

During the initial launch ''The National'' built its staff levels up to 200, recruiting from newspapers around the world, including the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' of Britain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.alittihad.ae/details.php?id=17448&y=2008|title=ذا ناشيونال نافذة إلى الإمارات وجسر إلى الآخر|work=alittihad.ae|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Martin Newland was editor of the ''Daily Telegraph'' from 2003 to 2005, and he took with him many former ''Telegraph'' employees, most notably Colin Randall (former ''Telegraph'' executive news editor), Sue Ryan (former managing editor) and senior photographer Stephen Lock (who covered domestic and foreign news and the international fashion circuit during 20 years on ''The Daily Telegraph'').<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/06/dailymail.pressandpublishing|title=Mail showbiz reporter off to Abu Dhabi|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 February 2008|access-date=5 September 2010|location=London|first=Stephen|last=Brook}}</ref>

The 2008 circulation of the paper was 60.000 copies.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Report: Abu Dhabi 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ1OUwDYpgAC&pg=PA209|access-date=10 September 2014|year=2009|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=978-1-907065-04-0|page=209}}</ref>

==Content==
The paper is a single selection organised into five daily sections (News, Business, Opinion, Arts & Lifestyle and Sport) and a Weekend edition which comes out every Friday.  It covers local and international news, business, sports, arts and life, travel and [[Driving|motoring]].  In addition, ''The National'' publishes two magazines: Ultratravel (quarterly) and Luxury (monthly.) The target group of the paper can be described as 25+, educated, affluent, out and about, business leaders, decision makers and key influencers.<ref name=publ/>

==Criticism and controversies==
===Prior to International Media Investments acquisition===
In a 2012 article in the ''[[American Journalism Review]]'', former foreign desk editor Tom O'Hara contended that coverage was skewed to favor the agenda of the government of the United Arab Emirates. He said that the newspaper had a "meticulous censorship process" that directly influenced coverage and word usage in the newspaper, such as prohibiting use of the term "[[Persian Gulf naming dispute|Persian Gulf]]". He said that the newspaper engaged in self-censorship, suppressing coverage of subjects deemed as casting an unfavorable light on the UAE royal family. He said that, among other things, coverage of the [[Libyan uprising]] was suppressed, as were articles about [[WikiLeaks]] and [[gay rights]].<ref>OHara, Tom (December 2012/January 2013)  
[https://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=5460 "Just Make Sure You Don’t Call It the Persian Gulf!"], ''[[American Journalism Review]]''.</ref>

''[[The New Republic]]'' reported in February 2013 that ''The National'' had failed to live up to high expectations that had been raised when it was established. The magazine said that the newsroom has had a series of crises during the preceding five years, and that "tensions over the management and direction of the paper have been simmering behind the scenes, with leadership changes, budget cuts, infighting and allegations of rampant self-censorship conspiring to trigger a series of defections that have depleted the paper of much of its marquee talent". The article described examples of rampant self-censorship, and said the newspaper's story was "a cautionary tale about pursuing journalism in a censored society".<ref name=Pompeo />
