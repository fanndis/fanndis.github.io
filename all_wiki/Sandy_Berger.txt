'''Samuel Richard "Sandy" Berger''' (October 28, 1945&nbsp;– December 2, 2015) was a [[Political consulting|political consultant]] who served as the 19th [[National Security Advisor (United States)|United States National Security Advisor]] for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] from 1997 to 2001. Before that he served as the [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]] for the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] from 1993 to 1997.

In 2005, he was fined and sentenced to two years of probation plus community service for unauthorized removal of classified material from the National Archives.  He gave up his license to practice law.

==Early life==
Berger was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Millerton, New York]], where his parents ran an [[Surplus store|Army-Navy store]].<ref>edited by Louis Sandy Maisel, Ira N.

Berger, Cornell University alumnus, is appointed national security adviser by President Bill Clinton|date=December 6, 1996}}</ref>

At Cornell, Berger was a member of the [[Quill and Dagger]] society with [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and [[Stephen Hadley]]. Opposed to the [[Vietnam War]], Berger began working for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign in 1972. While there, he met [[Bill Clinton]], forming a friendship that lasted for decades. Berger later urged Clinton to run for President of the United States.<ref name=bio>Ahrens, Frank, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/iraq/keyplayers/berger022498.htm "The Reluctant Warrior"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', February 24, 1998.</ref>

After the McGovern campaign, Berger gained experience working in a variety of government posts, including serving as Special Assistant to [[Mayor of New York City]] [[John Lindsay]] and Legislative Assistant to U.S. Senator [[Harold Hughes]] of [[Iowa]] and Congressman [[Joseph Resnick]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was also Deputy [[Director of Policy Planning]] for the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] from 1977 to 1980 under [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cyrus Vance]] during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]].<ref name=stonebridgebio>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonebridge-international.com/bios/bio01.html |title=Web Page Under Construction |website=Stonebridge-international.com |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}</ref>

After leaving the State Department, Berger went on to join the law firm [[Hogan & Hartson]] where he helped expand the firm's [[international law]] practice. As a partner, he opened the firm's first two international offices, in [[London]] and [[Brussels]].<ref name=bio /> "Sandy Berger", [[Nancy Pelosi]] said in 1997, "was the point-man at&nbsp;... Hogan & Hartson&nbsp;... for the trade office of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]].

Berger served as Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] Clinton during the campaign, and as Assistant Transition Director for National Security of the 1992 Clinton-Gore Transition. Berger served eight years on the National Security Council staff, first from 1993 - 1997 as [[Deputy National Security Advisor|deputy national security advisor]], under [[Anthony Lake]], whom Berger had recommended for the role, and then succeeding Lake as [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]] from 1997 to 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Berger was a central figure in formulating the [[foreign policy of the Clinton Administration]], and played an integral role advancing the administration's self-described objectives of advancing "democracy, shared prosperity, and peace."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-10.html |title=The Clinton Presidency: A Foreign Policy for the Global Age |website=Clinton5.nara.gov |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}</ref> In President Clinton's words, "Nobody was more knowledgeable about policy or smarter about how to formulate it.  He was both great in analyzing a situation and figuring out what to do about it. His gifts proved invaluable time and time again, in Latin America, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/statement-president-clinton-and-secretary-clinton-passing-sandy-berger |title=Statement from President Clinton and Secretary Clinton on the Passing of Sandy Berger |publisher=Clinton Foundation |date=2015-12-02 |access-date=2015-12-12}}</ref>

Key achievements during Berger's NSC tenure included the 1995 peso recovery package in Mexico, [[NATO enlargement]], [[Operation Desert Fox]], the [[Dayton Accords]] that ended the killing in Bosnia, the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia]] that stopped the ethnic cleansing in [[Kosovo]], the [[Good Friday Agreement]] that helped bring about peace in Northern Ireland, and the administration's policy of engagement  with the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref name="timesbio">Apple Jr., R.

On July 4, 1999, in what South Asia expert Bruce Reidel called Berger's "finest hour,"<ref>{{cite web|author=Bruce Riedel |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/02/farewell-sandy-berger-the-clinton-man-who-stopped-armageddon.html |title=Farewell, Sandy Berger, the Clinton Man Who Stopped Armageddon |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=1999-07-04 |access-date=2015-12-12}}</ref> Berger advised President Clinton through a pivotal negotiation with Pakistan's prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] to pull that country's troops back from [[Kashmir]], averting a potentially cataclysmic nuclear war with India.<ref>{{cite web|author=Raymond E Vickery Jr.|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-man-who-helped-end-the-kargil-war/20151215.htm|title=The Man Who Helped End The Kargil War|publisher=rediff.com}}</ref>

Berger also advised the President regarding the Khobar Towers bombing and responses to the terrorist [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania]]. In the final years of the Clinton administration, combating terrorism was the paramount foreign policy priority; Berger said in his March 2005 oral history interview at UVA's Miller Center, "I said to [[Condoleezza Rice]] during the transition ... that the number-one issue that she would deal with as national security advisor was terrorism in general and [[al-Qaeda]] specifically."<ref name="Samuel R. Berger—Miller Center" />

==Controversies==

===Stock ownership===
In November 1997, Berger paid a $23,000 [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] penalty to settle [[conflict of interest]] allegations stemming from his failure to sell his [[stock]] of [[Amoco]] Corporation as ordered by the [[White House]]. Berger was advised by the White House to sell the stock in early 1994. He said he had planned to sell the stock, but then forgot. He denied knowingly participating in decisions in which he had a financial interest. With no evidence that Berger intended to break the law, the [[United States Department of Justice]] determined a civil penalty was adequate for a "non-willful violation" of the conflict of interest law.<ref name=conflict>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/11/10/email/berger |title=AllPolitics - Berger Agrees To Pay Penalty - Nov. 10, 1997 |website=Cnn.com |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}</ref>

===Chinese nuclear espionage===
[[Image:Clinton berger albright.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Sandy Berger with President Clinton and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]].]]
In 1999, Berger was criticized for failing to promptly inform President Clinton of his knowledge that the [[People's Republic of China]] had managed to acquire the designs of a number of U.S. [[nuclear warhead]]s. Berger was originally briefed of the [[espionage]] by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) in April 1996, but did not inform the president until July 1997.<ref name=nukeespionage>Gerth, Jeff and Risen, James, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B17F73E5C0C7A8CDDAD0894D1494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBerger%2c%20Samuel%20R%2e "China Stole Nuclear Secrets From Los Alamos, U.S. Officials Say"], ''New York Times'', March 6, 1999.</ref><ref name=Timeseditorial>[http://taiwansecurity.org/News/NYT-990306.htm "The White House and China"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004858/http://taiwansecurity.org/News/NYT-990306.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}, ''The New York Times'', April 9, 1999.</ref>

A number of [[Republican party (United States)|Republicans]], including then presidential hopeful [[Lamar Alexander]], called for Berger's resignation. They accused him of ignoring the allegations of Chinese espionage. "For his unwillingness to act on this serious matter, Mr. Berger should resign", Alexander said. "If he does not, he should be relieved of his duties by President Clinton."<ref name="resign">[http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/10/nuclear.secrets.02/ "Clinton's security adviser takes heat for China nuclear scandal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218002357/http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/10/nuclear.secrets.02/ |date=December 18, 2007 }}, ''CNN''.com, March 11, 1999</ref> President Clinton rejected the calls: "The record is that we acted aggressively," Clinton said.

{{quote|I asked DOE to widen and deepen its investigation, to intensify as they were planning their [[counterintelligence]] efforts to brief the [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Within several weeks the [[FBI]] had opened up a full investigation on the prime suspect. So I took the actions that I believe were appropriate. I get an awful lot of threat information every day. I have to make a judgment as to what I brief the president on and what I don't. In 1997, when this was clearly a pattern and a systemic problem, I thought it was essential for the president to know — Sandy Berger, May 29, 1999.<ref name=bergertranscript>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/jan-june99/berger_5-27.html Transcript], [[PBS NewsHour|NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]], ''PBS'', May 27, 1999; retrieved May 27, 2006</ref>}}

===Unauthorized removal and destruction of classified material===
[[Image:National Archives.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The National Archives building in [[Washington, D.C.]].]]
On July 19, 2004, it was revealed that the [[United States Department of Justice]] was investigating Berger for unauthorized removal of [[classified information|classified documents]] in October 2003 from a [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] reading room prior to testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]].  The documents were five classified copies of a single report commissioned from [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] covering internal assessments of the Clinton Administration's handling of the unsuccessful [[2000 millennium attack plots]]. An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003, allegedly by stuffing the documents into his socks and pants.<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith|first=Jeffrey|date=21 February 2007|title=Berger Case Still Roils Archives, Justice Dept.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/20/AR2007022001344.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=6 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/01/berger.plea|work=CNN|title=Sandy Berger to plead guilty on documents charge|date=April 1, 2005|access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Berger subsequently lied to investigators when questioned about the removal of the documents.<ref name=Turley>[[Jonathan Turley|Turley, Jonathan]] (June 25, 2013) [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/06/24/snowdens-russia-chase-reveals-double-standard-column-/2453817/ Snowden's Russia chase reveals double standard], ''[[USA Today]]''</ref>

During the House Government Reform Committee hearings, Nancy Kegan Smith — who was the director of the presidential documents staff at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] — acknowledged that she had granted Berger access to original materials in her office.<ref>R.

On December 20, 2006, Inspector General Paul Brachfeld reported that Berger took a break to go outside without an escort. "In total, during this visit, he removed four documents ... Mr. Berger said he placed the documents under a trailer in an accessible construction area outside Archives 1 (the main Archives building)". Berger acknowledged having later retrieved the documents from the construction area and returned with them to his office.<ref name=theft1>Lichtblau, Eric, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/washington/21berger.html "Report Details Archives Theft by Ex-Adviser"], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2006</ref><ref name=theft2>Margasak, Larry, [http://apnews.myway.com/article/20061220/D8M4R7DO0.html "Report Says Berger Hid Archive Documents"], Apnews.myway.com, December 20, 2006.</ref>

On May 17, 2007, Berger relinquished his license to practice law as a result of the Justice Department investigation. Saying, "I have decided to voluntarily relinquish my license. ... While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am very sorry for what I did, and I deeply apologize." By giving up his license, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070516-113137-9942r.htm |title=Clinton aide forfeits law license in Justice probe |publisher=Washington Times |date= |access-date=2015-12-12}}</ref>

In late 2003, Berger was called to testify before the [[9/11 Commission]] regarding steps taken against [[terrorism]] during his tenure and the information he provided to his successor, Condoleezza Rice.

{{quote|Sandy Berger was one of our nation's foremost national security leaders. From his service in President Carter's State Department to President Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy devoted himself to strengthening American leadership in an uncertain world. Today, his legacy can be seen in a peaceful Balkans, our strong alliance with Japan, our deeper relationships with India and China. Around the globe, families and children are living healthier, more secure lives because, as a private citizen, Sandy was a humanitarian who helped the world respond to crises and feed the hungry. With his trademark passion, wisdom and good humor, he is remembered fondly within the ranks of the National Security Council, where those he mentored carry on his work.  I'm grateful to Sandy because, as President, I've benefited personally from his advice and counsel.}}
