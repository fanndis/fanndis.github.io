==Career==
===Junior career===
[[File:Camila Giorgi.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Giorgi at the 2008 Italian Open]]
Following an initial interest in artistic gymnastics, Giorgi decided to devote herself to tennis after assisting in her brother's training, when she was five years old. She was subjected to hard training by her father, Sergio. Two years later, [[1976 French Open]] champion [[Adriano Panatta]] said of her: "It's the first time I play a girl who plays like [[Andre Agassi]]."<ref name="usopen1"/> In 2000, she was spotted by tennis coach [[Nick Bollettieri]], who subsequently offered her seven months of training (previously offered only to [[Maria Sharapova]]).<ref name="usopen1"/>

In November 2005, she reached the final of the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Junior Tour, but was defeated by Slovakia's Zuzana Luknarová. Giorgi reached the final at the Sey Development Cup in the [[Czech Republic]], and the round of 16 at the Astrid Bowl in Belgium.

===2006–10: Early professional years===
Giorgi started with $10k tournaments, and obtained her first significant results reaching two semifinals in Baku and Jakarta. At the end of the season, she took part in her first $25k tournament. She closed 2006 with ten wins and seven losses, and as the 944th in the WTA rankings.

She obtained her best results in 2007 in September at Limoges in France, reaching the quarterfinals in a $10k tournament; then in $25k tournaments that she played at the end of the season, in December, in Lagos, Nigeria, where she reached the quarterfinals.

Giorgi started 2008 playing several tournaments in France, where she lived with her family. In May, she played for the first time qualifying for a major tournament circuit, thanks to a wildcard obtained at the [[Internazionali d'Italia|Italian Open]]. She lost to [[Jill Craybas]], No. 66 in the world, in a third set tie-breaker. She also played in the first round of the main draw in Rome-Tevere Remo (25k), Contrexéville (50k), and [[Rimini]] (75k). In [[Martina Franca]] (25k), she qualified and reached the second round. In November, in Saint Denis (La Réunion, 25k), she reached the quarterfinals. Giorgi finished the year 480th in the WTA rankings.

At the beginning of the 2009 season, Giorgi played few tournaments, failing to qualify for the main draw. She achieved her first important results in April, when she qualified for and reached the quarterfinals of two $25k tournaments. After some successes in tournaments in France, Giorgi won her first ITF tournament in August, in Katowice (25k), starting again from qualifying and defeating players such as [[Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová]] (ranked No. 105) and, in the final, [[Ksenia Pervak]] (No. 135). After another quarterfinal in Nantes (50k), Giorgi ended with the victory in a $50k tournament in Toronto. With these two successes, she ended the year with 33 wins and 12 defeats, and reached No. 285 in the rankings.

The 2010 season began poorly for Giorgi, as she suffered three first-round losses in the first three months of the year. In June, she reached the final of a $25k tournament, in [[Bratislava]]. In the summer, she played several tournaments in America, where she went to live (in Miami, with her family), without remarkable results. In August, trying for the first time to qualify for a Grand Slam tournament – the US Open – she was defeated in the first round. However, in October, Camila won (losing only one set, in the first round) a $25k tournament in Rock Hill, South Carolina.

===2011===
[[File:Camila Giorgi - 2011 Wimbledon.jpg|thumb|At Wimbledon, Giorgi reached her first main draw in a major event through qualifiers, but lost in the first round to eventual quarterfinalist [[Tsvetana Pironkova]].]]
In February, Giorgi reached the semifinals in two ITF events, but her best result came in May, when she reached the final of a $50k tournament in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and a week later triumphed in Carson (50k) yielding a single set and dominating the semifinal with an unprecedented double 6–0. In June, at Wimbledon, Giorgi passed the qualifiers and reached her first appearance in a major tournament, but she lost in the first round to eventual quarterfinalist [[Tsvetana Pironkova]]. Giorgi reached semifinals in two other tournaments before closing the year with 36 wins and 21 defeats, and 149th in the WTA rankings, reaching her best ranking in October when she was No. 141 in the world.

In an article for ''LiveTennis.com'', Nicholas Walz commented on Giorgi's game, saying, "Her play is often too erratic – she followed her result at the [[2014 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|2014 Indian Wells Masters tournament]] (defeating No. 4 seed, Maria Sharapova) by losing in the qualification round of the [[2014 Sony Open Tennis – Women's Singles|2014 Sony Open]] (two weeks later) to [[Zarina Diyas]]."<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas J. |last=Walz |title=US Open Player to Watch: Camila Giorgi |work=livetennis.com |date=11 March 2014 |access-date=2 April 2014 |url=http://www.usta.com/news/us_open_player_to_watch_camila_giorgi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308110449/https://www.usta.com/news/us_open_player_to_watch_camila_giorgi/ |archive-date=8 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Giorgi uses a two-handed backhand and flat groundstrokes. Her tendency is to play near and inside the baseline. She is known to be one of the hardest hitters on the tour. Her service is powerful but can be inconsistent. Her preferred surfaces are the fast hard and grass courts.<ref name=ny/><ref>{{cite news |first=Hannah |last=Wilks |title=Maria Sharapova falls to qualifier Camila Giorgi in error-strewn Indian Wells third round|work=livetennis.com |date=11 March 2014 |access-date=12 April 2014 |url=http://www.livetennis.com/category/livetennis-news/defending-champion-maria-sharapova-upset-by-qualifier-camila-giorgi-in-indian-wells-201403110005/}}</ref>

'''Notes'''
* <sup>1</sup> <small>The first [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier 5]] event of the year has switched back and forth between the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] and the [[Qatar Ladies Open|Qatar Open]] since 2009. The Dubai Championships were classified as a Premier 5 event from 2009–2011 before being succeeded by the Qatar Open for the 2012–2014 period. In 2015, the Dubai Championships regained its Premier 5 status while the Qatar Open was demoted to Premier status. The two tournaments have since alternated status every year.</small>
*<sup>2</sup> <small>In 2014, the [[Toray Pan Pacific Open]] was downgraded to a Premier event and replaced by the [[Wuhan Open]].</small>
* <sup>3</sup> <small>2006: WTA Ranking–944,<br />2007: WTA Ranking–833.</small>
