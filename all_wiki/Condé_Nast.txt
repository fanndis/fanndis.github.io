==History==

[[File:One World Trade Center May 2015.jpg|thumb|One World Trade Center, the New York headquarters of the company]]
[[Condé Montrose Nast]], a New York City-born publisher, launched his magazine empire in 1909 with the purchase of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', which was first created in 1892 as a New York weekly journal of society and fashion news.<ref>''A Brief History of the Condé Nast Publications'', New York: CNP, 1993.</ref>

At first, Nast published the magazine under Vogue Company and did not incorporate Condé Nast until 1923. He had a flair for nurturing elite readers as well as advertisers and upgraded ''Vogue'', sending the magazine on its path of becoming a top fashion authority. Eventually, Nast's portfolio expanded to include ''[[House & Garden (magazine)|House & Garden]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (briefly known as ''[[Vanity Fair (US magazine 1913–36)|Dress and Vanity Fair]]''), ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', and ''American Golfer''. The company also introduced ''[[British Vogue]]'' in 1916, and Condé Nast became the first publisher of an overseas edition of an existing magazine.

Condé Nast is largely considered to be the originator of the "[[lifestyle magazine|class publication]]," a type of magazine focused on a particular social group or interest instead of targeting the largest possible readership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar26.html|title=Today in History: March 26|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=November 9, 2010|accessdate=November 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210042448/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar26.html|archive-date=February 10, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its magazines focus on a wide range of subjects, including travel, food, home, and culture, with fashion the larger portion of the company's focus.

Nast opened a printing press in 1924, which closed in 1964 to make way for more centrally located sites capable of producing higher volumes. During the [[Great Depression]], Condé Nast introduced innovative typography, design, and color. ''Vogue's'' first full color photograph was featured on the cover in 1932, marking the year when Condé Nast began replacing fashion drawings on covers with photo illustrations―an innovative move at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/Weber2.t.html |title=IN VOGUE: The Illustrated History of the World's Most Famous Fashion Magazine |work=[[The New York Times|NYTimes.com]] |date=December 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225090405/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/Weber2.t.html |archive-date=February 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Glamour'', launched in 1939, was the last magazine personally introduced to the company by Nast, who died in 1942.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7g9PgL_No0C&q=Nast%20died%20in%201942&pg=PA47|title=The Magazine Century: American Magazines Since 1900|last=Sumner|first=David E.|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433104930|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303105658/https://books.google.com/books?id=J7g9PgL_No0C&pg=PA47&q=Nast%20died%20in%201942|archive-date=2018-03-03|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1959, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.|Samuel I.

The company folded the women's magazine ''[[Jane (magazine)|Jane]]'' with its August issue in 2007, and later shut down its website.  One of Condé Nast's oldest titles, the American edition of ''House and Garden'', ceased publication after the December 2007 issue. ''[[Condé Nast Portfolio|Portfolio]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' and ''[[Domino (magazine)|Domino]]'' were folded as well. On May 20, 2008, the company announced its acquisition of a popular technology-oriented website, ''[[Ars Technica]]''.

On October 5, 2009, Condé Nast announced the closure of three of its publications: ''[[Cookie (magazine)|Cookie]]'', ''Modern Bride'', and ''Elegant Bride''. ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' ceased monthly publication with its November 2009 issue; the Gourmet brand was later resurrected as "Gourmet Live," an [[iPad]] app that delivers new editorial content in the form of recipes, interviews, stories, and videos.  In print, ''Gourmet'' continues in the form of special editions on newsstands and cookbooks.

===2010–2020===
In July 2010, Robert Sauerberg became Condé Nast's president.
