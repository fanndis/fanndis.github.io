'''Carbon neutrality''' refers to achieving net zero [[Greenhouse gas#Direct greenhouse gas emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] by balancing carbon dioxide emissions with removal (often through [[carbon offset]]ting) or simply eliminating carbon dioxide emissions altogether (the transition to the "post-carbon economy").<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-03-10|title=What is carbon neutrality and how can it be achieved by 2050? {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20190926STO62270/what-is-carbon-neutrality-and-how-can-it-be-achieved-by-2050|access-date=2020-05-14|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en}}</ref> It is used in the context of [[carbon dioxide]]-releasing processes associated with transportation, energy production, agriculture, and industrial processes. Carbon-neutral status can be achieved in two ways:

* Balancing carbon dioxide emissions with carbon offsets, often through [[carbon offset]]ting - the process of reducing or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions or sequestering (removing) carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make up for emissions elsewhere.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/weekinreview/29revkin.html?ex=1335499200&en=d9e2407e4f1a20f0&ei=5124 Carbon-Neutral Is Hip, but Is It Green?], ''[[The New York Times]]'', published 2007-04-29, accessed 2007-08-03</ref> If the total greenhouse gasses emitted is equal to the total amount avoided or removed then the two effectively cancel each other out and the net emissions are 'neutral'.
* Reducing carbon emissions ([[low-carbon economy]]) to zero through changing energy sources and industry processes. Shifting towards the use of [[renewable energy]] (e.g. [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[Geothermal power|geothermal]], and [[Solar power|solar]] power)<ref name=":1">{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Samuel|date=2019|title=Reducing carbon dioxide emissions; Does renewable energy matter?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719332073}}</ref> as well as [[nuclear power]]<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=2018-01-26|title=What is the role of nuclear power in the energy mix and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions?|url=https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/role-nuclear-power-energy-mix-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment|language=en-GB}}</ref> reduces GHG emissions. Although both renewable and [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable energy]] both produce carbon emissions in some form, renewable energy has a lesser to almost zero carbon emissions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc240/node/506}}</ref> which produces much less carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels. Making changes to current industrial and agricultural processes to reduce carbon emissions (for example, diet changes to [[livestock]] such as [[cattle]] can potentially reduce methane production by 40%.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Joshua|date=2019|title=The race is on to cultivate a seaweed that slashes greenhouse emission from cows, other livestock|url=https://phys.org/news/2019-05-cultivate-seaweed-slashes-greenhouse-emission.html}}</ref> [[Carbon project]]s and [[emissions trading]] are often used to reduce carbon emissions, and carbon dioxide can even sometimes be prevented from entering the atmosphere entirely (such as by [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon scrubbing]]).

Although the term "carbon neutral" is used, a [[carbon footprint]] also includes other [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs), usually [[carbon-based]], measured in terms of their [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon dioxide equivalence]]. The phrase was the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'''s Word of the Year for 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carbon Neutral: Oxford Word of the Year|url=http://blog.oup.com/2006/11/carbon_neutral_/|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=Blog.oup.com}}</ref> The term '''climate neutral''' reflects the broader inclusiveness of other greenhouse gases in [[climate change]], even if CO<sub>2</sub> is the most abundant. The terms are used interchangeably throughout this article. The term "net zero" is increasingly used to describe a broader more comprehensive commitment to decarbonization and climate action, moving beyond carbon neutrality by including more activities under the scope of indirect emissions, and often including a science-based target on emissions reduction, as opposed to relying solely on offsetting.

==Process==
{{See also|100% renewable energy}}Carbon neutrality is usually achieved by combining the following steps (although these may vary depending whether the strategy is implemented by individuals, companies, organizations, cities, regions, or countries):

===Commitment===
In the case of individuals, decision-making is likely to be straightforward, but for more complex set-ups, it usually requires political leadership at the highest level and wide popular agreement that the effort is worth making.

===Counting and analyzing===
Counting and analyzing the emissions that need to be eliminated, and the options for doing so, is the most crucial{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} step in the cycle as it enables setting the priorities for action&nbsp;– from the products purchased to energy use and transport&nbsp;– and to start monitoring progress. This can be achieved through a GHG inventory that aims at answering questions such as:

* Which operations, activities, units should be included?
* Which sources should be included (see section Direct and indirect emissions)?
* Who is responsible for which emissions?
* Which gases should be included?

For individuals, carbon calculators simplify compiling an inventory. Typically they measure electricity consumption in kWh, the amount and type of fuel used to heat water and warm the house, and how many kilometres an individual drives, flies and rides in different vehicles. Individuals may also set various limits of the system they are concerned with, e.g. personal GHG emissions, household emissions, or the company they work for.

There are plenty of carbon calculators available online, which vary significantly in their usefulness and the parameters they measure. Some, for example, factor in only cars, aircraft and household energy use. Others cover household waste or leisure interests as well. In some circumstances, actually going beyond carbon neutral (usually after a certain length of time taken to reach carbon breakeven) is an objective.

===Action===
In starting to work towards climate neutrality, businesses and local administrations can make use of an environmental (or sustainability) management system or EMS established by the international standard ISO 14001 (developed by the International Organization for Standardization). Another EMS framework is EMAS, the European Eco Management and Audit Scheme, used by numerous companies throughout the EU. Many local authorities apply the management system to certain sectors of their administration or certify their whole operations.

===Reduction===
One of the strongest arguments for reducing GHG emissions is that it will often save money. Energy prices across the world are rising, making it harder to afford to travel, heat and light homes and factories, and keep a modern economy ticking over. So it is both common sense and sensible for the climate to use energy as sparingly as possible. Examples of possible actions to reduce GHG emissions are:

* Limiting energy usage and emissions from transportation (walking, using bicycles or public transport, avoiding flying, using low-energy vehicles), as well as from buildings, equipment, animals and processes.
* Obtaining electricity and other forms of energy from a [[Low-carbon power|low carbon energy sources]].
* [[Electrification]] : using [[electrical energy]], ideally from non-emitting sources, rather than [[combustion]]. For example, in transportation (e.g. [[Electric vehicle|electric vehicles]] and [[Electric locomotive|electric trains]]) and [[Electric heating|heating]] (e.g. [[Heat pump|heat pumps]] and [[electric heating]]).<ref>{{Cite web|title=How electrification can supercharge the energy transition|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/electrification-energy-transition-decarbonization-climate-change/|access-date=2020-09-14|website=World Economic Forum|language=en}}</ref>

[[Wind power]], [[nuclear power]], [[hydropower]], [[solar power]], and [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] are the energy sources with the lowest life-cycle emissions, which includes deployment and operations.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" />{{Main|Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources}}

===Offsetting===
The use of [[Carbon offset]]s aims to neutralize a certain volume of GHG emissions by funding projects which should cause an equivalent reduction of GHG emissions somewhere else, such as tree planting. Under the premise “First reduce what you can, then offset the remainder”, offsetting can be done by supporting a responsible carbon project, or by buying [[carbon offset]]s or [[carbon credit]]s.

Carbon offsetting is also a tool for severals local authorities in the world.<ref>Kebe A., V. Bellassen & A. Leseur (2011) "Voluntary carbon offsetting by local authorities: practices and lessons" Climate report n.29, CDC Climate</ref>

In 2015, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]], following the mandate of the CDM Executive board, launched a dedicated website where organizations, companies, but also private person are able to offset their footprint (https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/) with the aim of facilitating everyone's participation in the process of promoting sustainability.

Offsetting is sometimes seen as a charged and contentious issue. For example, [[James Hansen]] describes offsets as "modern day indulgences, sold to an increasingly carbon-conscious public to absolve their climate sins."

Some even consider telling others to consider going climate neutral to be greenwashing.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/11/greenwash-noel-kempff-forests</ref>

===Evaluation and repeating===
This phase includes evaluation of the results and compilation of a list of suggested improvements, with results documented and reported, so that experience gained of what does (and does not) work is shared with those who can put it to good use. Finally, with all that completed, the cycle starts all over again, only this time incorporating the lessons learned. Science and technology move on, regulations become tighter, the standards people demand go up. So the second cycle will go further than the first, and the process will continue, each successive phase building on and improving on what went before.

Being carbon neutral is increasingly seen as good [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate]] or state social responsibility and a growing list of corporations and states are announcing dates for when they intend to become fully neutral. Events such as the [[G8 Summit]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|date=2005-06-07|title=The G8 summit promises to be a "carbon-neutral" event|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4614713.stm|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> and organizations like the [[World Bank]]<ref>{{cite web|author=GreenBiz Admin|date=2006-06-04|title=GreenBiz News &#124;World Bank Group Goes Carbon-Neutral|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=31240|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329142043/http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=31240|archive-date=2008-03-29|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=Greenbiz.com}}</ref> are also using offset schemes to become carbon neutral. Artists like [[The Rolling Stones]]<ref>{{cite web|author=ClimateBiz Staff|date=2003-09-04|title=GreenBiz News &#124;Rolling Stones Pledge Carbon-Neutral U.K. Tour|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=25589|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508230810/http://www.greenbiz.com/news/news_third.cfm?NewsID=25589|archive-date=2006-05-08|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=Greenbiz.com}}</ref> and [[Pink Floyd]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Pink Floyd breathe life into new forests|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=76033|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=prnewswire.co.uk}}</ref> have made albums or tours carbon neutral.

==Direct and indirect emissions==
To be considered carbon neutral, an organization must reduce its [[carbon footprint]] to zero. Determining what to include in the carbon footprint depends upon the organization and the standards they are following.

Generally, direct emissions sources must be reduced and offset completely, while indirect emissions from purchased electricity can be reduced with renewable energy purchases.

Direct emissions include all pollution from manufacturing, company owned vehicles and reimbursed travel, livestock and any other source that is directly controlled by the owner. Indirect emissions include all emissions that result from the use or purchase of a product. For instance, the direct emissions of an airline are all the jet fuel that is burned, while the indirect emissions include manufacture and disposal of airplanes, all the electricity used to operate the airline's office, and the daily emissions from employee travel to and from work. In another example, the power company has a direct emission of greenhouse gas, while the office that purchases it considers it an indirect emission.

==Simplification of standards and definitions==
Carbon neutral fuels are those that neither contribute to nor reduce the amount of carbon into the atmosphere. Before an agency can certify an organization or individual as carbon neutral, it is important to specify whether indirect emissions are included in the Carbon Footprint calculation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carbon footprints will decrease in the Future » Standard Carbon|url=http://standardcarbon.com/resources/?p=25%5D|access-date=2 April 2018|website=standardcarbon.com}}</ref> Most Voluntary Carbon neutral certifiers such as [http://www.standardcarbon.com/ Standard Carbon] in the US, require both direct and indirect sources to be reduced and offset. As an example, for an organization to be certified carbon neutral by [http://www.standardcarbon.com/ Standard Carbon], it must offset all direct and indirect emissions from travel by 1&nbsp;lb CO<sub>2</sub>e per passenger mile, and all non-electricity direct emissions 100%.<ref>[http://www.standardcarbon.com/ecatalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1 Carbon Neutral Certification Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112034949/http://www.standardcarbon.com/ecatalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1|date=November 12, 2007}}</ref> Indirect electrical purchases must be equalized either with offsets, or renewable energy purchase. This standard differs slightly from the widely used World Resource Institute and may be easier to calculate and apply.

Much of the confusion in carbon neutral standards can be attributed to the number of voluntary carbon standards which are available. For organizations looking at which carbon offsets to purchase, knowing which standards are robust, credible and permanent is vital in choosing the right carbon offsets and projects to get involved in. Some of the main standards in the voluntary market include; [http://www.v-c-s.org/ The Verified Carbon Standard], [http://www.goldstandard.org/ The Gold Standard], [http://americancarbonregistry.org/ The American Carbon Registry], [http://www.climateactionreserve.org/ The Climate Action Reserve], and [http://www.planvivo.org/ Plan Vivo]. In addition companies can purchase Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) which result from mitigated carbon emissions from [https://web.archive.org/web/20200528113835/https://unfccc.int/ UNFCCC] approved projects for voluntary purposes. The concept of shared resources also reduces the volume of carbon a particular organization has to offset, with all upstream and downstream emissions the responsibility of other organizations or individuals. If all organizations and individuals were involved then this would not result in any double accounting.

Regarding terminology in UK and Ireland{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}, in December 2011 the Advertising Standards Authority (in an ASA decision which was upheld by its Independent Reviewer, Sir Hayden Phillips) controversially ruled that no manufactured product can be marketed as "zero carbon", because carbon was inevitably emitted during its manufacture. This decision was made in relation to a solar panel system whose embodied carbon was repaid during 1.2 years of use and it appears to mean that no buildings or manufactured products can legitimately be described as zero carbon in its jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Article with references to ASA documentation banning marketing of "Zero Carbon"|url=http://www.solartwin.com/zero-carbon-homes-face-imminent-asa-ban|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=Solartwin.com}}</ref>

==Pledges==
Being carbon neutral is increasingly seen as good corporate or state social responsibility and a growing list of corporations, cities and states are announcing dates for when they intend to become fully neutral. Many countries have also announced dates by which they want to be carbon neutral, with many of them targeting at the year 2050. The setting of an earlier date (i.e. 2025,<ref>[https://www.cat.org.uk/can-we-reach-zero-carbon-by-2025/ Can we reach zero carbon by 2025?]</ref> 2030,<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47947775 Extinction Rebellion: What do they want and is it realistic?]</ref> 2045<ref>[https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/policy-positions/reducing-greenhouse-gases-our-position-0 Reducing greenhouse gases: our position]</ref>) may be considered to send out a stronger signal internationally though.<ref>[https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/net-zero-the-uks-contribution-to-stopping-global-warming/ Net Zero report]</ref><ref>[http://theconversation.com/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-or-2025-depends-how-you-think-politics-works-116335 Net zero emissions by 2050 or 2025?

===Companies and organizations===
{{update section|date=May 2019}}The original Climate Neutral Network was an Oregon-based non-profit organization founded by Sue Hall and incorporated in 1999 to persuade companies that being climate neutral was potentially cost saving as well as environmentally sustainable. It developed both the Climate Neutral Certification and Climate Cool brand name with key stakeholders such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], Conservation International, and the World Resources Institute and succeeded in enrolling the 2002 Winter Olympics to compensate for its associated greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ellison|first=Katherine|date=2002-07-08|title=Burn Oil, Then Help A School Out; It All Evens Out|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/07/08/325856/index.htm|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=Money.cnn.com}}</ref> The non-profit's web site as of March 2011, lists the organization as closing its doors and plans to continue the Climate Cool upon transfer to a new non-profit organization, unknown at this time.<ref>{{cite web|title=climateneutralnetwork.org|url=http://climateneutralnetwork.org|access-date=2012-02-09|publisher=climateneutralnetwork.org}}</ref> The for-profit consulting firm Climate Neutral Business Network listed the same Sue Hall as CEO and many of the same companies who were participants in the original Climate Neutral Network as consulting clients.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate Neutral Business Network|url=http://climateneutral.com|access-date=2012-02-09|publisher=Climateneutral.com}}</ref> Today, there are many companies and organizations that have developed other independent Carbon and Climate Neutral certifications and designations.

Few companies have actually attained Climate Neutral Certification, applying to a rigorous review process and establishing that they have achieved absolute net zero or better impact on the world's climate. Another reason that companies have difficulty in attaining the Climate Neutral Certification is due the lack clear guidelines on what it means to make a carbon neutral development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zuo|first=Jian|last2=Read|first2=Ben|last3=Pullen|first3=Stephen|last4=Shi|first4=Qian|date=2012-04-01|title=Achieving carbon neutrality in commercial building developments – Perceptions of the construction industry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397511000841|journal=Habitat International|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=278–286|doi=10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.10.010|issn=0197-3975}}</ref> Shaklee Corporation became the first Climate Neutral certified company in April 2000.

Under the leadership of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[United Nations]] pledged to work towards climate neutrality in December 2007. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) announced it was becoming climate neutral in 2008 and established a Climate Neutral Network to promote the idea in February 2008.

Events such as the G8 Summit and organizations like the World Bank are also using offset schemes to become carbon neutral. Artists like [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Pink Floyd]] have made albums or tours carbon neutral, while [[Live Earth]] says that its seven concerts held on 7 July 2007 were the largest carbon neutral public event in history.

The Vancouver 2010 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and Paralympic Winter Games were the first carbon neutral Games in history<ref>{{cite web|title=Offsetting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games|url=http://www.offsetters.ca/about-us/olympic-games/|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=Offsetters.ca}}</ref> through a large partnership with the carbon offset provider, [[Offsetters]].

Buildings are the largest single contributor to the production of greenhouse gases. The [[American Institute of Architects]] 2030 Commitment is a voluntary program for AIA member firms and other entities in the built environment that asks these organizations to pledge to design all their buildings to be carbon neutral by 2030.<ref>{{cite web|date=2009-05-05|title=AIA Introduces 2030 Commitment Program to Reach Goal of Carbon Neutrality by 2030|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/17758|access-date=2013-11-02|publisher=Dexigner.com}}</ref>

In 2010, architectural firm [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum|HOK]] worked with energy and daylighting consultant The Weidt Group to design a {{convert|170735|sqft|m2|adj=on}} net zero carbon emissions Class A office building prototype in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], U.S.<ref>[http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20101119/a-net-zero-office-today A Net Zero Office Today] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205002811/http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20101119/a-net-zero-office-today|date=December 5, 2010}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
As recommended by the [[Committee on Climate Change]] (CCC) the government has legally committed to net zero [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom]] by 2050<ref name="Guardian20192">{{cite news|date=2 May 2019|title='This report will change your life': what zero emissions means for UK|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/02/this-report-will-change-your-life-what-zero-emissions-means-for-uk}}</ref> and the [[Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit]] (ECIU) has said it would be affordable. A range of techniques will be required including carbon sinks ([[greenhouse gas removal]]) in order to counterbalance emissions from agriculture and aviation. These carbon sinks might include reforestation, habitat restoration, soil carbon sequestration, [[bioenergy with carbon capture and storage]] and even direct air capture.<ref>{{cite web|date=12 September 2018|title=Net Zero: CO2 removal technology could make UK carbon neutral by 2050|url=https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/3062556/net-zero-co2-removal-technology-could-make-uk-carbon-neutral-by-2050|access-date=17 April 2019}}</ref> The UK government has recently linked attainment of net zero targets as a potential mechanism for improved air quality as a co-benefit.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Department for Environment|first=Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) webmaster@defra gsi gov uk|title=Air Quality Library- Defra, UK|url=https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/reports.php?report_id=1002|access-date=2020-07-10|website=uk-air.defra.gov.uk}}</ref> In 2020 the UK government estimated that eliminating fossil fuels for home heating and transportation could lead to a tripling of demand for electricity.<ref name=BBC_RR_new_nuclear > {{ cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54703204 | title=Rolls-Royce plans 16 mini-nuclear plants for UK | last=Rowlatt | first=Justin | newspaper=[[BBC]] | date=2020-11-11 | quote=In addition to the six nuclear plants going offline by 2030, there's another challenge.

==Carbon neutral initiatives==
Many initiatives seek to assist individuals, businesses and states in reducing their carbon footprint or achieving climate neutrality. These include

* Website neutralisation project CO<sub>2</sub> Stats
* [[Website neutralisation project]]
* Climate Neutral Network
* [[Caring for Climate]]
* Together campaign
* [[Carbon Neutrality Coalition]]

* [https://www.greenlife.cloud/ GreenLife - Daily tips on sustainability for individuals to become carbon neutral.]

==Certification==
Although there is currently no international certification scheme for carbon or climate neutrality, some countries have established national certification schemes. Examples include Norwegian Eco-Lighthouse Program and the Australian government's [[National Carbon Offset Standard]] (NCOS). In the private sector, organisations such as ClimatePartner can, for a fee, allow companies from many sectors to offset their carbon emissions using techniques like reforestation. These companies can then claim climate neutral status and even use the title online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sanvt.com/journal/sanvt-and-eden-projects-working-together-for-reforestation/}}</ref> However, there is no international clarity around these certifications and their validity.

Certifications are also available from the [[Commodity Exchange Bratislava|CEB]],<ref>{{cite web|title=CEB VER Registry|url=http://www.en.ver.kbb.sk/}}</ref> [[British Standards Institute|BSI]] ([[BSI PAS 2060|PAS 2060]]) and [[The Carbon Neutral Company|The CarbonNeutral Company]] (CarbonNeutral).<ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Standards: Carbon Neutral|url=http://us.carbonneutral.com/environmental-standards/carbonneutral/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718031527/http://us.carbonneutral.com/environmental-standards/carbonneutral/|archive-date=2012-07-18|access-date=2012-05-16|publisher=carbonneutral.com}}</ref>
