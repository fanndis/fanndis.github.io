The [[Des Plaines River]] forms much of the eastern boundary of the village. Other bodies of water include Butler Lake, Liberty Lake, and Lake Minear.

Libertyville's main street is [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]] ([[Illinois Route 21]]).  The main automobile route to Chicago is via [[Interstate 94]] (the [[Tri-State Tollway]] and the [[Edens Expressway]]); Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] is approximately 45 minutes away.  The main [[Metra]] rail station sits at the northern edge of downtown off Milwaukee Avenue, and serves the [[Milwaukee District/North Line]] running from [[Chicago Union Station|Union Station]] in Chicago to [[Fox Lake, Illinois|Fox Lake]].  The same line is served by another Metra station at [[Prairie Crossing (Metra Milwaukee District/North)|Prairie Crossing]], near the boundary of Libertyville and Grayslake.

==History==
[[File:St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery Church.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[St. Sava's Serbian Orthodox Seminary|Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery Church]] is the former [[Burial sites of European monarchs|burial site]] of [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]], who until 2013 was the only [[European monarch]] buried on U.S. soil.]]
The land that is now Libertyville was the property of the Illinois River [[Potawatomi]] Indians until August 1829, when economic and resource pressures forced the tribe to sell much of their land in northern Illinois to the U.S. government for $12,000 cash, an additional $12,000 in goods, plus an annual delivery of 50 barrels of salt.<ref>[http://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-107.html Potawatomi Treaties and Treaty Rights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831093416/http://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-107.html |date=2006-08-31 }}, mpm.edu. Accessed 2008-01-04.</ref>

Pursuant to the treaty, the Potawatomi left their lands by the mid-1830s,<ref>[http://www.19thcircuitcourt.state.il.us/bkshelf/resource/history.htm The Illinois Constitution of 1818] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207221508/http://www.19thcircuitcourt.state.il.us/bkshelf/resource/history.htm |date=2006-02-07 }}, 19thcircuitcourt.state.il.us. Accessed 2008-01-04.</ref> and by 1835 the future Libertyville had its first recorded non-indigenous resident, George Vardin. Said to be {{citation needed|date=January 2013}} a "well-educated" [[English people|English]] immigrant with a wife and a young daughter, Vardin lived in a cabin located where the Cook Park branch of the Cook Memorial Public Library District stands today. Though he apparently moved on to the west that same year, the settlement that grew up around his cabin was initially known as Vardin's Grove.<ref name="cook">[http://library.thinkquest.org/12934/nfaboutland.html History of the Cook Property] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306030211/http://library.thinkquest.org/12934/nfaboutland.html |date=2008-03-06 }}. Accessed 2008-01-04.</ref>

In 1836, during the celebrations that marked the 60th anniversary of the U.S. [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the community voted to name itself Independence Grove. 1837 brought the town's first practicing physician, Jesse Foster, followed quickly by its first lawyer, Horace Butler, for whom Butler Lake is named.<ref name=cook/> The professionals needed services, so a post office opened, necessitating a third name change, because another Independence Grove existed elsewhere in the state. On April 16, 1837, the new post office was registered under the name Libertyville.

The town's name changed again two years later to Burlington when it became the county seat of Lake County. When the county seat moved to Little Fort (now [[Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan]]) in 1841, the name reverted to Libertyville, without further changes.<ref name="lbhistory">[http://www.libertyville.com/index.asp?nid=136 Libertyville History], libertyville.com. Accessed 2008-01-04.</ref>

Libertyville's most prominent building, the Cook Mansion, was built in 1879 by Ansel Brainerd Cook, very close to the spot where Vardin's cabin was built in the 1830s. Cook, a teacher and stonemason, became a prominent Chicago builder and politician, providing [[flagstone]]s for the city's sidewalks and taking part in rebuilding after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871. The two-story [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansion served as Cook's summer home as well as the center of his horse farm, which provided animals for Chicago's [[horsecar]] lines. The building was remodeled in 1921, when it became the town library, gaining a [[American colonial architecture|Colonial]]-style facade with a pillared [[portico]].  The building is now a museum with furnishings of the period and other relevant displays. It is operated by the Libertyville-Mundelein Historical Society.

The community expanded rapidly with a spur of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]] train line (now a [[Metra]] commuter line) reaching Libertyville in 1881, resulting in the incorporation of the Village of Libertyville in 1882, with John Locke its first village president.<ref name=lbhistory/>

Libertyville's downtown area was largely destroyed by fire in 1895,<ref name=ec/> and the village board mandated brick to be used for reconstruction, resulting in a village center whose architecture is substantially unified by both period and building material.<ref name=ec/> The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], which gave Libertyville a Great American Main Street Award, called the downtown "a place with its own sense of self, where people still stroll the streets on a Saturday night, and where the tailor, the hometown bakery, and the vacuum cleaner repair shop are shoulder to shoulder with gourmet coffee vendors and a microbrewery. If it's Thursday between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., it's Farmer's Market time (June–October) on Church Street across from Cook Park -- a tradition for more than three decades."<ref>[http://awards.mainstreet.org/content.aspx?page=7262 section=22 National Main Street Awards]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, mainstreet.org.

[[Samuel Insull]], founder of [[Commonwealth Edison]], began purchasing land south of Libertyville in 1906. He eventually acquired {{convert|4445|acre|km2}}, a holding that he named Hawthorn-Mellody Farms. He also bought the Chicago & Milwaukee Electric line (later the Chicago, North Shore & Milwaukee), which built a spur from [[Lake Bluff, Illinois|Lake Bluff]] to Libertyville in 1903. When Insull was ruined by the [[Great Depression]], parts of his estate were bought by prominent Chicagoans [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[Vernon Hills, Illinois#Additional facts|John F. Cuneo]].<ref name=ec/> The home Cuneo built is now the [[Cuneo Museum]].

From 1970 until 2013, Libertyville was the resting place of the only European monarch buried on American soil, [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]], who died in exile in Denver.
