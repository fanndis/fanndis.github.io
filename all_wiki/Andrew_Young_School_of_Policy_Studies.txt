== History and Culture ==

The beginnings of the Andrew Young School were in the establishment of a Master of Governmental Administration degree in 1972. This would later evolve into a Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) which was offered originally though the Institute of Governmental Administration. After shuffling around throughout the decades, the Georgia State Policy School was established in 1996.<ref name=":0" />

Three years later in 1999, The Policy School was renamed the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. The name pays respects to  [[Andrew Young]], a civil rights leader from [[Atlanta]] who served as [[United Nations]] Ambassador from 1977–79, as mayor of Atlanta  from 1982–90, and was instrumental in bringing the [[Olympics]] to the city in 1996.

His leadership and Georgia State University's status as one of the most diverse student bodies in the nation allow Andrew Young School's programs to be inclusive and make a global impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsu.edu/mission-statement/|title=Mission Statement|website=Georgia State University|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> Roughly one-fifth of graduate students come from developing countries, 59 percent of students are women and nearly one-half are African Americans.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://aysps.gsu.edu/welcome-from-andrew-young/|title=Welcome from Andrew Young|website=Andrew Young School of Policy Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>

The current home of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies has a varied past, as the building dates to 1905. The Fourth National Bank opened the building on the southwest corner of Marietta and Peachtree streets in 1905 - the site of the [[Norcross Building]] which had burned in a 1902 fire – and was for one year the tallest building in the city until the [[Candler Building (Atlanta, Georgia)|Candler Building]] was built. [[Morgan & Dillon]] designed the building.

In 1928 firm Pringle & Smith directed addition of several floors to the building, an extension northward along Marietta street resulting in an L-shaped building, and a renovation of the interior to an even more opulent style.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-3GahRYq9UC |title=The Architecture of Francis Palmer Smith, Atlanta's Scholar-Architect, Robert M. Craig, p.136 |isbn=9780820328980 |accessdate=2013-12-08|last1=Craig |first1=Robert Michael |year=2012 }}</ref>

In 1966, First National Bank built a 41-story tower on the lot adjacent to the south, site of the [[Peachtree Arcade]] (1917-1964); today the [[State of Georgia Building]]; the architect was [[Cecil Alexander (architect)|Cecil Alexander]]. It removed the top half of the original building and resurfaced it in the white marble that covers it today.
