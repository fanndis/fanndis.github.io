{{Party politics}}
A '''grand coalition''' is an arrangement in a [[multi-party]] [[parliamentary system]] in which the two largest [[political party|political parties]] of opposing [[political spectrum|political ideologies]] unite in a [[coalition government]].<ref>Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction, Eighth Edition, Hague and Harrop, page 330; quoted on [https://thepoliticalloop.wordpress.com/2011/09/06/how-stuff-works-the-different-types-of-coalition/ The Political Loop]</ref> The term is most commonly used in countries where there are two dominant parties with different ideological orientations, and a number of smaller parties that have passed the [[electoral threshold]] to secure representation in the [[parliament]]. The two large parties will each try to secure enough seats in any [[election]] to have a [[majority government]] alone, and if this fails each will attempt to form a coalition with smaller parties that have a similar ideological orientation. Because the two large parties will tend to differ on major ideological issues, and portray themselves as rivals, or even sometimes enemies, they will usually find it more difficult to agree on a common direction for a combined [[government]] with each other than with smaller parties.

==Causes of a grand coalition==
Occasionally circumstances arise where normally opposing parties may find it desirable to form a government. One is a national crisis such as a war or [[depression (economics)|depression]], where people feel a need for national unity and stability that overcomes ordinary ideological differences. This is especially true where there is broad agreement about the best policy to deal with the crisis. In this case, a grand coalition may occur even when one party has enough seats to govern alone. An example would be the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|British national governments]] during [[World War I]] and before and during [[World War II]].

Another possibility is that the major parties may find they have more in common ideologically with each other than with the smaller parties, or that the fragmentation of the smaller parties is so great that no other coalition is stable. Examples include [[Austria]], where the mainstream parties of the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]] have often formed grand coalitions to keep parties of the [[far left]] or [[far right]] out of government (an example of a ''[[Cordon sanitaire (politics)|cordon sanitaire]]''), or [[Israel]], where no single party has ever won enough seats to govern alone, and, in some parliaments, the fragmentation and intransigence of some of the smaller parties has made it easier to maintain a coherent platform with a grand coalition than with a narrow one. This is often done out of political necessity, to prevent an early election.

==Grand coalitions by country==
===Austria===
In post-war Austria, a "grand coalition" ({{lang-de|Große Koalition}}) between the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) and the conservative [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) has been standard since [[World War II]]. Of the 31 governments which have taken office since 1945, 20 have been grand coalitions, including eleven consecutively from 1945 to 1966. Grand coalitions again governed from 1987 to 2000 and 2007 to 2017. Grand coalitions have also been common on the [[States of Austria|state]] level – as of July 2020, grand coalitions govern [[Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Lower Austria]], and [[Upper Austria]]; in the case of the latter two, grand coalitions (more specifically, all-party government) are compulsory in accordance with the constitution.

===Czech Republic===
After the [[Velvet Revolution]], there has been a government of socialists ([[ČSSD]]) with Prime Minister [[Miloš Zeman]] supported by the right-wing [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]], known as the [[opposition agreement]].

===European Union===
In the [[European Parliament]], the two main [[Political groups of the European Parliament|pan-European party groups]] are the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D). Until 2019, they held a majority in the European Parliament and worked together in a grand coalition. However, advances by green, liberal and right-wing populist parties across Europe in the [[2019 European Parliament election]] led to the EPP-S&D coalition losing their majority.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48417744 European elections 2019: Power blocs lose grip on Parliament] from [[BBC Online|BBC.com]]</ref>

===Germany===
{{main|Grand coalition (Germany)}}
In post-war Germany, "grand coalition" ({{lang-de|Große Koalition}}) refers to a governing coalition of the two largest parties, usually the Christian Democrats ([[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD). While Germany has historically tended to favor narrow coalitions of one of the two largest parties with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] or with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], four grand coalitions have been formed on a federal level: the [[Kiesinger cabinet]] (1966–1969), the [[First Merkel cabinet]] (2005–2009), the [[Third Merkel cabinet]] (2013-2018), and the [[Fourth Merkel cabinet]] (since 2018). Under the [[Weimar Republic]], a grand coalition was one including all of the major parties of the left, center, and center-right who formed the basis of most governments - the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], the [[Catholic Centre Party]], the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), and the [[German People's Party]] (DVP). The two examples were the [[first Stresemann cabinet|first]] and [[second Stresemann cabinet]]s (August-November 1923) and, less ephemerally, the [[Hermann Müller (politician)|second Müller cabinet]] (1928-1930).

===Iceland===
{{main|Icelandic parliamentary election, 2017#Government formation}}
Iceland has a grand coalition since 30 November 2017 between the largest parties of the centre-right to right-wing [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] (16), the left-wing [[Left-Green Movement]] (9), and the centre-right [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] (8).

===Italy===
{{main|Grand coalition (Italy)|Historic Compromise}}
In Italy, "grand coalition" ({{lang-it|Grande coalizione}}) refers to the only supermajority government formed in April 2013 between center-left [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (PD), center-right [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) party, and the centrist [[Civic Choice]] (SC) and [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of the Centre]] (UdC) parties. In November 2013, The People of Freedom (later renamed as [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]]) however dropped out and broke apart, leaving the [[Letta Cabinet]] and further [[Renzi Cabinet]] (Coalition between PD, NCD, SC and UdC) with a small majority.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|National Government (United Kingdom)}}
The UK has had grand coalitions in central government during periods of wartime.  They are referred to as the "National Government".

====Northern Ireland====
{{main|Northern Ireland Executive}}
The [[Northern Ireland Executive]], the devolved administration of Northern Ireland, combines the largest Republican (also predominantly left of centre) and Unionist (also predominantly right of centre) parties.  The chief post, of [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]], is a [[diarchy]]. Most recently, this coalition was led by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Sinn Féin]].  

All parties, major and minor, are offered posts in the executive, although may [[Leader of the Opposition (Northern Ireland)#Northern Ireland Assembly|now opt to form an opposition]].

====Cayman Islands====
{{main|Caymanian general election, 2017#Government formation}}
The Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory, has an incumbent coalition between the largest parties; the centre-left [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|Progressives]] and centre-right [[Cayman Democratic Party|Democrats]].

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there have been several [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinets]] which can be described as grand coalitions. The [[Roman/Red]] coalitions of the 1940s and 1950s under Prime Minister [[Willem Drees]] were composed of  the [[Catholicism|catholic]] [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP) and the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) at its core and several smaller parties as backup ([[Drees–Van Schaik cabinet|Drees–Van Schaik]]). The [[Purple (government)|Purple]] coalitions in the 1990s under Prime Minister [[Wim Kok]] were between the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), the [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]] [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and the [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] [[Democrats 66]] (D66) party ([[First Kok cabinet]]). The [[Second Rutte cabinet]] a grand coalition cabinet which also can be described as a purple coalition was composed of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) and the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA). A more traditional grand coalition cabinet was the [[Third Lubbers cabinet]], comprising the [[Christian democracy|christian-democratic]] [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA).

===Spain===
In Spain, the term "grand coalition" is typically used to refer to any hypothetical government formed between the centre-right to right-wing [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) and the centre-left [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). No such a coalition government as ever been formed at the national level, though it was proposed by then-[[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] during the [[2015–16 Spanish government formation|2015–2016 government formation process]].<ref>{{cite news |date=29 December 2015 |title=Mariano Rajoy pide una gran coalición y no descarta ofrecer ministerios a PSOE y Ciudadanos |url=https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Mariano-Rajoy-PSOE-Ciudadanos-Gobierno_0_467903488.html |language=Spanish |work=eldiario.es |access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=18 February 2016 |title=Rajoy insiste en la gran coalición y ofrece la vicepresidencia al PSOE |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2016/02/18/56c5be2fe2704e653a8b4580.html |language=Spanish |work=El Mundo |access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=21 June 2016 |title=Rajoy afirma que la gran coalición con el PSOE ayudaría a "resolver" la cuestión catalana |url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20160621/rajoy-gran-coalicion-ayudaria-resolver-debate-independentista-catalan-5218696 |language=Spanish |work=El Periódico de Catalunya |access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> Rajoy's own investiture on 29 October 2016 was allowed through the abstention of PSOE's MPs in what was dubbed as a "covert grand coalition", in reference to PSOE's tolerance of Rajoy's minority government through punctual agreements until the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party leadership election, 2017|re-election]] of [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]] as party leader in June 2017.<ref>{{cite news |date=31 January 2017 |title=PP y PSOE escenifican ya la gran coalición en el primer pleno del año |url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170131/413877085394/pp-psoe-gran-coalicion.html |language=Spanish |work=La Vanguardia |access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=13 May 2017 |title=Rajoy da por perdido al PSOE gane quien gane y apuesta todo a los nacionalistas |url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2017-05-13/gobierno-pp-psoe-crisis-primarias-legislatura-nacionalistas-rajoy_1382004/ |language=Spanish |work=El Confidencial |access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref>

At the regional level, grand coalitions between the two largest parliamentary forces have been rare, but examples exist:
*[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]: [[Basque Nationalist Party|PNV]]–[[Socialist Party of the Basque Country–Basque Country Left|PSE]], 1986–1990 and 1991–1998.
*[[Navarre]]: [[Navarrese People's Union|UPN]]–[[Socialist Party of Navarre|PSN]], 2011–2012.

Additionally, both PSOE and PP formed a joint coalition government—which also included other parties—following a successful vote of no confidence on the Cantabrian regional government of [[Juan Hormaechea]] in 1990, enduring until the [[Cantabrian regional election, 1991|1991 regional election]]. At the time, however, the PP was not among the two largest political parties in the regional assembly.
