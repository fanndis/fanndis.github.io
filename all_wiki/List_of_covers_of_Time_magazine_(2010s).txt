{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of covers of ''Time'' magazine (2010s)}}
[[File:Time Magazine logo.svg|200px|right]]
This is a '''list of covers of ''Time'' magazine''' between 2010 and 2019. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] was first published in 1923. As ''Time'' became established as one of the United States' leading [[newsmagazines]], an appearance on the cover of ''Time'' became an indicator of a person's notability, fame or notoriety.  Such features were accompanied by articles about the person.

A European, Middle East and African version, an Asian version, and a South Pacific version are also published in addition to the United States edition each week. This article distinguishes when the intercontinental covers are different.

For other decades, see [[Lists of covers of Time magazine|Lists of covers of ''Time'' magazine]].
