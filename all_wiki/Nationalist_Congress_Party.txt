==Party formation and performance==
The NCP was formed on 25 May 1999, by [[Sharad Pawar]], [[P. A. Sangma]], and [[Tariq Anwar (politician)|Tariq Anwar]] after they were expelled from the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) on 20 May 1999, for disputing the right of [[Italians|Italian]]-born [[Sonia Gandhi]] to lead the party.<ref>[http://m.rediff.com/%0D%0Anews/1999/may/24jhar.htm Senior Congress leaders quit in Jharkhand]</ref><ref>[http://m.rediff.com/%0D%0Anews/1999/may/20pawar2.htm CWC expels threesome for six years]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-02/india/28205192_1_foreign-origin-sangma-janpath-residence |title=Sangma meets Sonia Gandhi, first time in a decade |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=2 June 2009}}</ref>  At the time of formation of the NCP, the [[Indian Congress (Socialist)]] party merged with the new party.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99jun11/spotlite.htm | title = Spotlight: Merger with NCP | newspaper = Tribune India | date = 1999-06-11 | accessdate = 2009-05-19}}</ref>

Despite the NCP being founded on opposition to the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, the party joined the Congress led [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]] to form [[government of Maharashtra]] in October 1999. In 2004, the party joined the UPA to form the Indian Government led by [[Manmohan Singh]]. NCP leader, Sharad pawar served as the minister of agriculture for both five-year terms of Singh led government. The party remained part of the Congress led Maharashtra state government until 2014.<ref name="KohliSingh2013">{{cite book|author1=Suhas Palshikar|author2=Prerna Singh|author3=Atul Kohli|title=Routledge Handbook of Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbLcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PR1|date=4 January 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-12275-1|pages=92, 97}}</ref> On 20 June 2012, [[P. A. Sangma]] quit the NCP to contest in [[2012 Indian presidential election|presidential polls]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/I-have-quit-NCP-will-contest-presidential-polls-PA-Sangma/articleshow/14300738.cms | title=I have quit NCP, will contest presidential polls: PA Sangma
| date=29 June 2012 |newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> In May 2014 Lok Sabha, the UPA lost to the rival NDA alliance led by [[Narendra Modi]] and the NCP was out of government for the first time in ten years. NCP broke its alliance with the Congress party just before Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections in 2014 to contest on its own.<ref>https://hwnews.in/news/politics/congress-ncp-seat-sharing-maharashtra/112929</ref> In the assembly election the BJP emerged as the largest party and formed a minority government initially with support from NCP.

In April 2019, voting took place for the 48 [[2019 Indian general election|Lok Sabha]] seats from Maharashtra. 
The Congress and NCP had a seat-sharing arrangement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Raj Thackeray, Dhananjay Munde in demand to campaign for Cong |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/maharashtra/raj-thackeray-dhananjay-munde-in-demand-to-campaign-for-cong/articleshow/68833350.cms |work=April 11 |agency=PTI |date=2019}}</ref> Similarly, despite their differences, the BJP and Shiv Sena once again contested the elections together under the [[National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) banner.<ref>{{cite news |title=Opinion Poll: BJP-Shiv Sena may lose 8 seats in Maharashtra, Congress-NCP to improve figures |url=https://www.newsnation.in/election/lok-sabha-election-2019/opinion-poll-lok-sabha-elections-2019-bjp-shiv-sena-seats-maharashtra-congress-ncp-sharad-pawar-devendra-fadnavis--article-216712.html |issue=March 23 |publisher=New Nation |date=2019}}</ref> The election was another landslide victory for the NDA, with the BJP and Shiv Sena winning 23 and 18 seats, respectively, out of the total of the state's 48 Lok Sabha seats. The Congress party won only one seat in the state whereas the NCP won five seats from its stronghold of western Maharashtra.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.esakal.com/loksabha-2019/result |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608010227/https://www.esakal.com/loksabha-2019/result |archive-date=8 June 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In November 2019 after a month of political drama, the NCP came back into power at the state level  as part of a coalition formed between Shiv Sena, the Congress and NCP. This followed the [[2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election|Vidhan sabha elections]] in October 2019 where the BJP–Shiv-Sena and NCP–Congress alliances remained intact for seat sharing. The BJP and Shiv Sena together gained the majority of seats in the assembly but could not form government due to squabbles between the two parties. The BJP, with 105 seats, was far short of the 145 seats required to form majority and declined to form a minority government. At the same time, Shiv Sena started talks with the NCP and Congress to form government. However, in a dramatic and controversial move, on 23 November 2019, the BJP formed a government with support from NCP, with [[Ajit Pawar]] as Deputy Chief Minister. This government collapsed three days later with Chief Minister [[Devendra Fadnavis]] and Ajit Pawar resigning their respective positions. On 28 November 2019, the governor of Maharashtra swore in [[Uddhav Thackeray]], the Shiv Sena chief, as the new chief minister of Maharashtra. Thackeray's governing coalition includes Shiv Sena, NCP, INC, and a number of independent members of legislative assembly. The cabinet includes ministers from NCP in key portfolios.<ref>{{cite news |title=Political drama has gripped the home state of Bollywood |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/11/29/political-drama-has-gripped-the-home-state-of-bollywood |accessdate=30 November 2019 |issue=30 November 2019 |publisher=The Economist}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Maharashtra: With 169 votes, Uddhav-led govt sails through Assembly floor test, BJP stages walkout |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra-assembly-floor-test-uddhav-thackeray-fadnavis-bjp-shiv-sena-ncp-congressmaharashtra-uddhav-led-mahavikasaghadi-govt-wins-trust-vote-bjp-stages-walkout-6144236/ |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=Indian Express |issue=30 November 2019 |publisher=Indian Express newspapers}}</ref>

The Mumbai President of the Nationalist Congress Party [[Nawab Malik]] said that the NCP advocates for [[Indian reunification]], that "India, Pakistan and Bangladesh should be merged".<ref>{{cite web |title=India, Pakistan & Bangladesh should be MERGED, Indian minister suggests |url=https://www.rt.com/news/507570-india-pakistan-bangladesh-merge/?fbclid=IwAR1WpQvmi0bAYmiMthLY-sel9VJqUY7uAu3TF-DKbZC2HQxB36W_JwhNCUY |website=[[RT International]] |date=23 November 2020}}</ref>

It is situated on a tri-coloured Indian flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.in/political-parties-in-india/nationalist-congress-party.html|title=Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – Party History, Symbol, Founders, Election Results and News|website=www.elections.in}}</ref>

==Party leadership==
The party's primary base is the state of Maharashtra and leadership reflects that. Also since the 1980s, Indian politics has become dynastic, possibly due to the absence of a party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for the party, and centralized financing of elections.<ref name="ppq.sagepub.com">{{cite journal|last1=Chhibber⇑|first1=Pradeep|title=Dynastic parties Organization, finance and impact|journal=Party Politics by Sage Journals|date=March 2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=277–295|doi=10.1177/1354068811406995}}</ref> This phenomenon is seen from national level down to district level. In that regard NCP is considered the party with the highest level of dynasticism in Indian politics. <ref name="Chandra2016">{{cite book|author=Kanchan Chandra|title=Democratic Dynasties: State, Party, and Family in Contemporary Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwbFDAAAQBAJ&pg=PR10|date=28 April 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-316-59212-0|page=131,136}}</ref> The party founder, Sharad Pawar has many members of his family such as daughter Supriya Sule and nephew Ajit Pawar holding prominent positions in the party.
