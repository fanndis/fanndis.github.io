'''John Locke''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|l|ɒ|k}}; 29 August 1632&nbsp;– 28 October 1704) was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers and commonly known as the "Father of [[Liberalism]]".<ref>Hirschmann, Nancy J. 2009. ''Gender, Class, and Freedom in Modern Political Theory''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]. p. 79.</ref><ref>Sharma, Urmila, and S. K. Sharma. 2006. ''Western Political Thought''. Washington: [[Atlantic Books|Atlantic Publishers]]. p. 440.</ref><ref>Korab-Karpowicz, W. Julian. 2010. ''A History of Political Philosophy: From Thucydides to Locke''. New York: Global Scholarly Publications. p. 291.</ref> Considered one of the first of the British [[Empiricism|empiricists]], following the tradition of Sir [[Francis Bacon]], Locke is equally important to [[social contract]] theory. His work greatly affected the development of [[epistemology]] and [[political philosophy]]. His writings influenced [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and many [[Scottish Enlightenment]] thinkers, as well as the [[American Revolution]]aries. His contributions to [[classical republicanism]] and [[liberal theory]] are reflected in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Carl Lotus|authorlink=Carl L. Becker|title=The Declaration of Independence: a Study in the History of Political Ideas|location=New York|publisher=[[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt, Brace]]|year=1922|page=27}}</ref>

Locke's [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]] is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of [[Personal identity|''identity'']] and the [[self (psychology)|''self'']], figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Locke was the first to define the ''self'' through a continuity of [[consciousness]]. He postulated that, at birth, the [[mind]] was a blank slate, or ''[[tabula rasa]]''. Contrary to [[Descartes|Cartesian]] philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without [[Innatism|innate ideas]], and that [[knowledge]] is instead [[empiricism|determined only by experience]] derived from [[sense]] [[perception]], a concept now known as ''empiricism''.<ref>Baird, Forrest E., and [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]. 2008. ''From Plato to Derrida''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]. {{ISBN|978-0-13-158591-1}}. pp. 527–29.</ref> Demonstrating the ideology of science in his observations, whereby something must be capable of being tested repeatedly and that nothing is exempt from being disproved, Locke stated that "whatever I write, as soon as I discover it not to be true, my hand shall be the forwardest to throw it into the fire". Such is one example of Locke's belief in empiricism. Challenging the work of others, Locke is said to have established the method of [[introspection]], i.e. observing the emotions and behaviours of one's self.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Baldwin |first=B.T. |year=1913 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education. |jstor=27532614 |journal=The Sewanee Review |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177–87 [179]|quote=[He was a] pioneer in psychology,... and established on a substantial basis the introspective method of to-day; ... }}</ref>

==Life and work==
Locke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched [[cottage]] by the church in [[Wrington]], Somerset, about 12 miles from [[Bristol]]. He was [[baptism|baptised]] the same day, as both of his parents were [[Puritans]]. Locke's father, also called John, was an attorney who served as clerk to the [[Justice of the peace|Justices of the Peace]] in [[Chew Magna]]<ref>Broad, C. D. 2000. ''Ethics And the History of Philosophy''. UK: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-22530-4}}.</ref> and as a captain of [[cavalry]] for the [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces during the early part of the [[English Civil War]]. His mother was Agnes Keene. Soon after Locke's birth, the family moved to the [[market town]] of [[Pensford]], about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] house in [[Belluton]].

In 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious [[Westminster School]] in London under the sponsorship of [[Alexander Popham]], a member of Parliament and John Sr.'s former commander. After completing studies there, he was admitted to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], in the autumn of 1652 at the age of 20. The dean of the college at the time was [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]], vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found the works of modern philosophers, such as [[René Descartes]], more interesting than the [[classics|classical]] material taught at the university. Through his friend [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]], whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the [[experimental philosophy]] being pursued at other universities and in the [[Royal Society]], of which he eventually became a member.

Locke was awarded a [[bachelor's degree]] in February 1656 and a master's degree in June 1658.<ref>Uzgalis, William. [2001] 2018. "[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/ John Locke]." ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by [[Edward N. Zalta|E. N. Zalta]].</ref> He obtained a [[bachelor of medicine]] in February 1675,<ref>Roger Woolhouse, ''Locke: A Biography'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 116.</ref> having studied the subject extensively during his time at Oxford and, in addition to Lower, worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Thomas Willis]] and [[Robert Hooke]]. In 1666, he met [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper, Lord Ashley]], who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a [[liver]] infection. Ashley was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue.

Locke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Ashley's home at Exeter House in London, to serve as his personal physician. In London, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of [[Thomas Sydenham]]. Sydenham had a major effect on Locke's natural philosophical thinking{{spaced ndash}}an effect that would become evident in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]].''

Locke's medical knowledge was put to the test when Ashley's liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Ashley to undergo surgery (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst. Ashley survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life.

During this time, Locke served as Secretary of the [[Board of Trade]] and Plantations and Secretary to the [[Lords Proprietor]]s of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]], which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics.

Ashley, as a founder of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] movement, exerted great influence on Locke's political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Ashley became [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1672 (Ashley being created [[Earl of Shaftesbury|1st Earl of Shaftesbury]] in 1673). Following Shaftesbury's fall from favour in 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across France as a tutor and medical attendant to [[Caleb Banks]].<ref name=Henning>{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HW1_upECKUwC&q=%22Caleb+Banks%22+Aylesford&pg=PA590 |first=Basil Duke |last=Henning |title=The House of Commons, 1660–1690 |volume=1 |accessdate=28 August 2012 |isbn=978-0-436-19274-6 |year=1983}}</ref> He returned to England in 1679 when Shaftesbury's political fortunes took a brief positive turn. Around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury's prompting, Locke composed the bulk of the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. While it was once thought that Locke wrote the ''Treatises'' to defend the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date.{{Sfn | Laslett | 1988 | loc = III. ''Two Treatises of Government'' and the Revolution of 1688}} The work is now viewed as a more general argument against [[absolute monarchy]] (particularly as espoused by [[Robert Filmer]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]]) and for individual consent as the basis of [[political legitimacy]]. Although Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]] and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history.

Locke fled to the [[Netherlands]] in 1683, under strong suspicion of involvement in the [[Rye House Plot]], although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme. The philosopher and novelist [[Rebecca Newberger Goldstein]] argues that during his five years in Holland, Locke chose his friends "from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]] small group of loyal confidants. [Baruch Spinoza had died in 1677.] Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who... insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone." While she says that "Locke's strong empiricist tendencies" would have "disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinoza's ideas, most particularly to the rationalist's well thought out argument for political and [[religious tolerance]] and the necessity of the separation of church and state."<ref>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, ''Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity'', New York: Schocken Books (2006), pp. 260–61</ref>

In the Netherlands, Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time re-working the ''Essay'' and composing the ''Letter on Toleration.'' Locke did not return home until after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Locke accompanied [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] back to England in 1688. The bulk of Locke's publishing took place upon his return from exile{{spaced ndash}}his aforementioned ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' all appearing in quick succession.

Locke's close friend [[Lady Masham]] invited him to join her at Otes, the Mashams' country house in Essex. Although his time there was marked by variable health from [[asthma]] attacks, he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs. During this period he discussed matters with such figures as [[John Dryden]] and [[Isaac Newton]].

He died on 28 October 1704, and is buried in the churchyard of the village of [[High Laver]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Locke |title=John Locke |last=Rogers |first=Graham A. J. |website=Britannica Online |access-date=3 September 2019 }}</ref> east of [[Harlow]] in Essex, where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691. Locke never married nor had children.

Events that happened during Locke's lifetime include the [[English Restoration]], the [[Great Plague of London]] and the [[Great Fire of London]]. He did not quite see the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in [[personal union]] throughout his lifetime. [[Constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] were in their infancy during Locke's time.

==Ideas==
In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' were rarely cited. Historian Julian Hoppit said of the book, "except among some Whigs, even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made 'a great noise')."<ref>Hoppit, Julian. 2000. ''A Land of Liberty? England. 1689–1727''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. p. 195.</ref> [[John Philipps Kenyon|John Kenyon]], in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke's theories were "mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the [Glorious] Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them" and that "no one, including most Whigs, [were] ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke."<ref name=":0">Kenyon, John. 1977. ''Revolution Principles: The Politics of Party. 1689–1720''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].</ref>{{Rp|200}} In contrast, Kenyon adds that [[Algernon Sidney]]'s ''Discourses Concerning Government'' were "certainly much more influential than Locke's ''Two Treatises.''"<ref group="lower-roman">Kenyon (1977) adds: "Any unbiassed study of the position shows in fact that it was Filmer, not Hobbes, Locke or Sidney, who was the most influential thinker of the age" (p. 63).</ref><ref name=":0" />{{Rp|51}}

[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|John Locke]]

In the 50 years after Queen Anne's death in 1714, the ''Two Treatises'' were reprinted only once (except in the collected works of Locke). However, with the rise of American resistance to British taxation, the ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'' gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain. The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston.<ref>{{cite ODNB |id=16885 |title=Locke, John (1632–1704) |origyear=2004 |year=2008 |last=Milton |first=John R.}}</ref>

Locke exercised a profound influence on political philosophy, in particular on modern liberalism. [[Michael Zuckert]] has argued that Locke launched liberalism by tempering Hobbesian absolutism and clearly [[separation of church and state|separating the realms of Church and State]]. He had a strong influence on [[Voltaire]] who called him "''le sage'' Locke." His arguments concerning [[liberty]] and the [[social contract]] later influenced the written works of [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and other [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. In fact, one passage from the ''Second Treatise'' is reproduced verbatim in the Declaration of Independence, the reference to a "long train of abuses." Such was Locke's influence that Thomas Jefferson wrote:<ref>{{cite web|date=August 2007|title=The Three Greatest Men|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tr11a.html#obj11|url-status=live|accessdate=27 June 2018|website=American Treasures of the Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|quote=Jefferson identified [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], Locke, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] as "the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception". Their works in the physical and moral sciences were instrumental in Jefferson's education and world view.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=The Letters: 1743–1826 Bacon, Locke, and Newton|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231231043/http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm|archive-date=31 December 2009|accessdate=13 June 2009|quote=Bacon, Locke and Newton, whose pictures I will trouble you to have copied for me: and as I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical & Moral sciences.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jefferson called Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who had so indelibly shaped his ideas, "my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced"|url=http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&type=4|accessdate=28 August 2012|work=Explorer|publisher=Monticello}}</ref><blockquote>[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], Locke and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]… I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences.</blockquote>However, Locke's influence may have been even more profound in the realm of [[epistemology]]. Locke redefined [[subjectivity]], or ''self'', leading [[Intellectual history|intellectual historians]] such as [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[Jerrold Seigel]] to argue that Locke's ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689/90) marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the ''self''.<ref>[[Jerrold Seigel|Seigel, Jerrold]]. 2005.

Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].</ref><ref>[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Charles]]. 1989. ''Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity''. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]].</ref>

Locke's [[Associationism|theory of association]] heavily influenced the subject matter of [[modern psychology]]. At the time, Locke's recognition of two types of ideas, ''simple'' and ''complex''—and, more importantly, their interaction through associationism—inspired other philosophers, such as [[David Hume]] and [[George Berkeley]], to revise and expand this theory and apply it to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of Modern Psychology |last=Schultz |first=Duane P. |publisher=Thomas Higher Education |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-495-09799-0 |location=Belmont, CA |pages=47–48 |edition=ninth }}</ref>

===Theories of religious tolerance===
{{See also|Toleration#Locke}}
[[File:John Locke by Richard Westmacott.jpg|thumb|John Locke by [[Richard Westmacott]], University College, London]]

Locke, writing his ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letters Concerning Toleration]]'' (1689–1692) in the aftermath of the [[European wars of religion]], formulated a classic reasoning for [[Toleration|religious tolerance]], in which three arguments are central:<ref>[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–15.</ref>

# Earthly judges, [[State (polity)|the state]] in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the [[Truth claim|truth-claims]] of competing religious standpoints;
# Even if they could, enforcing a single 'true religion' would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence;
# Coercing [[religious uniformity]] would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.

With regard to his position on religious tolerance, Locke was influenced by [[Baptist]] theologians like [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] and [[Thomas Helwys]], who had published [[Tract (literature)|tracts]] demanding [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]] in the early 17th century.{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 18}}<ref>[[Henri H.

Retrieved 2 June 2020. {{ISBN|9789004146662}}.</ref> Baptist theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony of [[Rhode Island]] in 1636, where he combined a [[Democracy|democratic constitution]] with unlimited religious freedom. His tract, ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience]]'' (1644), which was widely read in the mother country, was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total [[separation of church and state]].{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | pp = 102–05}} Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agenda, as [[Martin Luther]] refused to recant his beliefs before the [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)|Diet]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at [[Diet of Worms|Worms]] in 1521, unless he would be proved false by the Bible.{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 5}}

===Constitution of Carolina===
Appraisals of Locke have often been tied to appraisals of liberalism in general, and to appraisals of the United States. Detractors note that (in 1671) he was a major investor and beneficiary of the English [[History of slavery|slave-trade]] through the [[Royal African Company]]. In addition, while secretary to [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], Locke participated in drafting the ''[[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]'', which established a [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[aristocracy]] and gave masters absolute power over their slaves. For example, [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] notes that Locke, as a secretary to the [[Council of Trade and Plantations]] (1673–1674) and a member of the [[Board of Trade]] (1696–1700), was in fact, "one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude."<ref>{{Citation |first=Martin |last=Cohen |title=Philosophical Tales |publisher=Blackwell |year=2008 |page=101}}.</ref> Some see his statements on [[enclosure|unenclosed]] [[property]] as having been intended to justify the displacement of the Native Americans.<ref>{{Citation |first=James |last=Tully |title=An Approach to Political Philosophy: Locke in Contexts |place=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=128 |isbn=978-0-521-43638-0}}</ref><ref>Farr, J. 1986.

Collectively, these documents are known as the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]].

===Theory of value and property===
Locke uses the concept of ''[[Property (philosophy)|property]]'' in both broad and narrow terms: broadly, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more particularly, it refers to [[Tangible property|material goods]]. He argues that property is a [[Natural rights and legal rights|natural right]] that is derived from [[manual labour|labour]]. In Chapter V of his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise]]'', Locke argues that the individual ownership of goods and property is justified by the labour exerted to produce such goods—"at least where there is enough [land], and as good, left in common for others" (para. 27)—or use property to produce goods beneficial to human society.<ref name="labortheory">Vaughn, Karen. 1978. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20111019073702/http://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_3.pdf John Locke and the Labor Theory of Value]." ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'' 2(4):311–26. Archived from the [https://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_3.pdf original] on 19 October 2011. Retrieved 2 June 2020.</ref>

Locke stated his belief, in his ''Second Treatise'', that nature on its own provides little of value to society, implying that the labour expended in the creation of goods gives them their value. From this premise, understood as a [[Labor theory of value|''labour theory of value'']],<ref name="labortheory" /> Locke developed a [[Labor theory of property|''labour theory of property'']], whereby ownership of [[property]] is created by the application of labour. In addition, he believed that property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his own social theory.

Locke's political theory was founded upon that of [[social contract]]. Unlike [[Thomas Hobbes]], Locke believed that [[human nature]] is characterised by [[reason]] and [[Toleration|tolerance]]. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allowed people to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a [[State of nature#Locke's view on the state of nature|natural state]], all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend his "life, health, liberty, or possessions."<ref name="locke">Locke, John. [1690] 2017. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm Second Treatise of Government]'' (10th ed.), digitized by D. Gowan. [[Project Gutenberg]]. Retrieved 2 June 2020.</ref>{{rp|198}} Most scholars trace the phrase "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]," in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American Declaration of Independence]], to Locke's theory of rights,<ref>{{Citation |last=Zuckert |first=Michael |title=The Natural Rights Republic |year=1996 |publisher=Notre Dame University Press |pages=73–85}}</ref> though other origins have been suggested.<ref>{{Citation |last=Wills |first=Garry |title=Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co |year=2002}}</ref>

Like Hobbes, Locke assumed that the sole right to defend in the state of nature was not enough, so people established a [[civil society]] to resolve conflicts in a civil way with help from government in a state of society. However, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day.<ref>{{Citation |last=Skinner |first=Quentin |title=Visions of Politics |place=Cambridge}}.</ref> Locke also advocated governmental [[separation of powers]] and believed that revolution is not only a [[Right of revolution|right]] but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the Declaration of Independence and the [[Constitution of the United States]].

====Limits to accumulation====
{{See also|Lockean proviso}}
According to Locke, unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature,<ref>{{Citation |last=Locke |first=John |title=Two Treatises on Government: A Translation into Modern English |year=2009 |publisher=Industrial Systems Research |isbn=978-0-906321-47-8 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3eB0IgzJjoC&q=John+Locke+unused+property+waste+offence+against+nature&pg=PA81}}</ref> but, with the introduction of [[Durable good|"durable" goods]], men could exchange their excessive perishable goods for those which would last longer and thus not offend the [[natural law]]. In his view, the introduction of money marked the culmination of this process, making possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage.<ref>{{cite web |title=John Locke: Inequality is inevitable and necessary |url=http://www0.hku.hk/philodep/courses/ac/Phil1003-2008/Locke2.ppt |publisher=Department of Philosophy The University of Hong Kong |accessdate=1 September 2011 |format=MS PowerPoint |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509074104/http://www.hku.hk/philodep/courses/ac/Phil1003-2008/Locke2.ppt |archivedate=9 May 2009}}</ref> He also includes gold or silver as money because they may be "hoarded up without injury to anyone,"<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Locke |title=Second Treatise |at=§§&nbsp;25–51, 123–26 |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s3.html |publisher=The Founders Constitution |accessdate=1 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911101831/http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s3.html |archivedate=11 September 2011}}</ref> as they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor. In his view, the introduction of money eliminates the limits of accumulation. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing [[civil society]] or the [[Land law|law of land]] regulating property. Locke is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem. However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example, the [[labour theory of value]] in the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory of value developed in a letter he wrote titled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money''. Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but in the end, upholds the unlimited accumulation of wealth.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Cobb |last1=Cliff |first2=Fred |last2=Foldvary |title=John Locke on Property |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/cobb-cliff-and-fred-foldvary_john-locke-on-property-1999.html |publisher=The School of Cooperative Individualism |accessdate=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315171711/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/cobb-cliff-and-fred-foldvary_john-locke-on-property-1999.html |archivedate=15 March 2012}}</ref>

===On price theory===
Locke's general theory of value and price is a [[supply and demand|supply-and-demand]] theory, set out in a letter to a member of parliament in 1691, titled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money''.<ref>{{Citation |first=John |last=Locke |year=1691 |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/locke/contents.htm |title=Some Considerations on the consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money |publisher=Marxists}}.</ref> In it, he refers to supply as ''quantity'' and demand as [[Economic rent|''rent'']]: "The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers," and "that which regulates the price…[of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent."

The [[quantity theory of money]] forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on "money answers all things" ([[Ecclesiastes]]) or "rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough," and "varies very little…" Locke concludes that, as far as money is concerned, the demand is exclusively regulated by its quantity, regardless of whether the [[demand for money]] is unlimited or constant. He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For [[Supply (economics)|supply]], he explains the value of goods as based on their [[scarcity]] and ability to be [[Exchange value|exchanged]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]]. He explains [[demand]] for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income. Locke develops an early theory of [[Capital (economics)|capitalisation]], such as land, which has value because "by its constant production of saleable [[Commodity|commodities]] it brings in a certain yearly income." He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land: it depends on whether money is wanted as [[medium of exchange]]. As a medium of exchange, he states that "money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life," and for [[loanable funds]], "it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income…or interest."

====Monetary thoughts====
Locke distinguishes two functions of money: as a ''counter'' to [[Valuation (finance)|measure value]], and as a ''pledge'' to lay claim to [[good (economics)|goods]]. He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to [[Banknote|paper money]], are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it.

Locke argues that a country should seek a favourable [[balance of trade]], lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world [[Money supply|money stock]] grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock. Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine [[exchange rate]]s. He considers the latter less significant and less [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] than commodity movements. As for a country's money stock, if it is large relative to that of other countries, he says it will cause the country's exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do.

He also prepares estimates of the [[cash]] requirements for different economic groups ([[Land tenure|landholders]], labourers, and brokers). In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokers—the [[Intermediary|middlemen]]—whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders, have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute.

===The self===
Locke defines ''the self'' as "that conscious thinking thing, (whatever substance, made up of whether spiritual, or material, simple, or compounded, it matters not) which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends."{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 307}} He does not, however, ignore "substance", writing that "the body too goes to the making the man".{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 306}}

In his ''Essay'', Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind. Arguing against both the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] view of man as [[original sin|originally sinful]] and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions, Locke posits an 'empty mind', a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', which is shaped by experience; [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] and [[human self-reflection|reflections]] being the two sources of ''all'' of our [[idea]]s.<ref>{{Citation |title=The American International Encyclopedia |publisher=JJ Little Co |place=New York |year=1954 |volume=9}}.</ref> He states in ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'':

<blockquote>This source of ideas every man has wholly within himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called 'internal sense.'<ref>{{Cite book|last=Angus|first=Joseph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDYCAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA324|title=The Handbook of Specimens of English Literature|date=1880|publisher=[[William Clowes Ltd.|William Clowes and Sons]]|year=1880|location=London|pages=324|language=en|author-link=Joseph Angus}}</ref></blockquote>

Locke's ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' is an outline on how to educate this mind. Drawing on thoughts expressed in letters written to [[Mary Clarke (letter writer)|Mary Clarke]] and her husband about their son,<ref name="MaryC">{{Cite ODNB|id=66720|title=Clarke [née Jepp], Mary}}</ref> he expresses the belief that education makes the man{{mdash}}or, more fundamentally, that the mind is an "empty cabinet":{{Sfn|Locke|1996|p=10}}<blockquote>I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education.</blockquote>Locke also wrote that "the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences".{{Sfn | Locke | 1996 | p = 10}} He argued that the "[[Association of Ideas|associations of ideas]]" that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the ''self''; they are, put differently, what first mark the ''tabula rasa''. In his ''Essay'', in which both these concepts are introduced, Locke warns against, for example, letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the night for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other".{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 357}}

This theory came to be called ''[[associationism]]'', going on to strongly influence 18th-century thought, particularly [[education theory|educational theory]], as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of [[psychology]] and other new disciplines with [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]]'s attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749).

===Dream argument===
Locke was critical of Descartes' version of the [[dream argument]], with Locke making the counter-argument that people cannot have physical pain in dreams as they do in waking life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dreaming/#SH1b |title=Dreaming, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |work=utm.edu}}</ref>

==Religious beliefs==
Some scholars have seen Locke's political convictions as being based from his religious beliefs.<ref>{{Citation |first=Greg |last=Forster |title=John Locke's politics of moral consensus |year=2005}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=Kim Ian |last=Parker |title=The Biblical Politics of John Locke |year=2004 |publisher=Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion|title-link=The Biblical Politics of John Locke }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=John |last=Locke |title=Writings on religion |editor-first=Victor |editor-last=Nuovo |place=Oxford |year=2002}}.</ref> Locke's religious trajectory began in [[Calvinist]] [[trinitarianism]], but by the time of the ''Reflections'' (1695) Locke was advocating not just [[Socinianism|Socinian views]] on tolerance but also Socinian [[Christology]].<ref name="Marshall 1994 426">{{Citation |first=John |last=Marshall |title=John Locke: resistance, religion and responsibility |place=Cambridge |year=1994 |page=426}}.</ref> However Wainwright (1987) notes that in the posthumously published ''Paraphrase'' (1707) Locke's interpretation of one verse, [[Ephesians 1]]:10, is markedly different from that of Socinians like [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|Biddle]], and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an [[Arianism|Arian]] position, thereby accepting Christ's pre-existence.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clarendon Edition of the Works of John Locke: A Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-19-824806-4|editor-last=Wainwright|editor-first=Arthur, W.|location=Oxford|page=806}}</ref><ref name="Marshall 1994 426" />
Locke was at times not sure about the subject of [[original sin]], so he was accused of Socinianism, Arianism, or [[Deism]].{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 27, 223}} Locke argued that the idea that "all ''[[Adam]]'''s Posterity [are] doomed to Eternal Infinite Punishment, for the Transgression of ''Adam''" was "little consistent with the Justice or Goodness of the Great and Infinite God", leading [[Eric Nelson (historian)|Eric Nelson]] to associate him with [[Pelagian]] ideas.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=7–8}} However, he did not deny the reality of evil. Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes. Criminals had to be punished, even with the death penalty.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 145}}

With regard to the Bible, Locke was very conservative. He retained the doctrine of the [[verbal inspiration]] of the Scriptures.{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}} The miracles were proof of the divine nature of the biblical message. Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason (''The Reasonableness of Christianity'', 1695).<ref>{{Citation |first=D |last=Henrich |contribution=Locke, John |title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart |year=1960 |language=German}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, Spalte 426</ref>{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}} Although Locke was an advocate of tolerance, he urged the authorities not to tolerate [[atheism]], because he thought the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 217 ff}} That excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 13}} In Locke's opinion the [[cosmological argument]] was valid and proved God's existence. His political thought was based on Protestant Christian views.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 13}}<ref>{{Citation |quote=[The ''Two Treatises of Government'' are] saturated with Christian assumptions. |first=John |last=Dunn |year=1969 |title=The Political Thought of John Locke: A Historical Account of the Argument of the 'Two Treatises of Government' |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge, UK |page=99}}.</ref> Additionally, Locke advocated a sense of piety out of gratitude to God for giving reason to men.<ref>[[Nicholas Wolterstorff|Wolterstorff, Nicholas]]. 1994. "[https://place.asburyseminary.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1504&context=faithandphilosophy John Locke's Epistemological Piety: Reason Is The Candle Of The Lord]." ''[[Faith and Philosophy]]'' 11(4):572–91.</ref>

=== Philosophy from religion ===
Locke's concept of man started with the belief in creation.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p= 142}} Like philosophers [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]], Locke equated [[natural law]] with the biblical [[revelation]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Elze|first=M|title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart|year=1958|contribution=Grotius, Hugo|language=German}} 2(3):1885–86.</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Hohlwein|first=H|title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart|year=1961|contribution=Pufendorf, Samuel Freiherr von|language=German}}, 5(3):721.</ref>{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 12}} Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts, in particular from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1 and 2 ([[Genesis creation narrative|creation]]), the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]], the [[Golden Rule]], the teachings of Jesus, and the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]].{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 22–43, 45–46, 101, 153–58, 195, 197}} [[Ten Commandments|The Decalogue]] puts a person's life, reputation and property under God's protection.

Locke's philosophy on freedom is also derived from the Bible. Locke derived from the Bible basic human equality (including [[equality of the sexes]]), the starting point of the theological doctrine of [[Imago Dei]].{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 21–43}} To Locke, one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 136}} Locke compared the English monarchy's rule over the British people to Adam's rule over Eve in Genesis, which was appointed by God.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Two Treatises of Government|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=Hafner Publishing Company|year=1947|location=New York|pages=17–18, 35, 38}}</ref>

Following Locke's philosophy, the American [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] founded human rights partially on the biblical belief in creation. Locke's doctrine that governments need the consent of the governed is also central to the Declaration of Independence.<ref>[[Carl L. Becker|Becker, Carl]].
