The Russian state-owned company [[Gazprom]] exports natural gas to Europe. It also controls many [[List of Gazprom's subsidiaries|subsidiaries]], including various infrastructure assets. According to a study published by the [[Research Centre for East European Studies]], the liberalization of the EU gas market has driven Gazprom's expansion in Europe by increasing its share in the European [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] market. It has established sale subsidiaries in many of its export markets, and has also invested in access to industrial and power generation sectors in Western and Central Europe. In addition, Gazprom has established joint ventures to build natural gas pipelines and storage depots in a number of European countries.<ref name=rad34>

In September 2012, the [[European Commission]] opened formal proceedings to investigate whether [[Gazprom]] was hindering competition in Central and Eastern European gas markets, in breach of [[European Union competition law|EU competition law]]. In particular, the Commission looked into Gazprom's usage of 'no resale' clauses in supply contracts, alleged prevention of diversification of gas supplies, and imposition of unfair pricing by linking oil and gas prices in long-term contracts.<ref>European Commission, Antitrust: Commission Opens Proceedings Against Gazprom, [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-937_en.htm IP/12/937]</ref> The Russian Federation responded by issuing blocking legislation, which introduced a default rule prohibiting Russian strategic firms, including Gazprom, to comply with any foreign measures or requests.<ref>Marek Martyniszyn, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2399923 Legislation Blocking Antitrust Investigations and the September 2012 Russian Executive Order], 37(1) World Competition 103 (2014)</ref> Compliance is subject to prior permission granted by the Russian government.

==History==
In the early 1980s there were American efforts, led by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], to convince European countries, through which a proposed Soviet gas pipeline was to be built, to deny firms responsible for construction the ability to purchase supplies and parts for the pipeline and associated facilities. [[Ronald Reagan]] feared that a Kremlin-controlled European natural gas pipeline infrastructure would increase the USSR's influence not only in Eastern Europe, but also in Western Europe. For this reason, during his first term in office, he attempted – unsuccessfully – to stop the first natural gas pipeline from being built between the USSR and Germany. The pipeline was built despite these protests and the rise of large Russian gas firms such as [[Gazprom]] as well as increased Russian fossil fuel production has facilitated a large expansion in the quantity of gas supplied to the European market since the 1990s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Natural Gas as an Instrument of Russian State Power|last=Iftimie|first=Ion|publisher=Westphalia Press|date=22 January 2015|isbn=9781633911390|edition=Second edition, fully revised and updated|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=74|oclc=908407323}}</ref>

To compare with alternative sources, Germany produced 10.5% of its electricity from fossil natural gas in 2019 and 8.6% (44 TWh) from renewable [[biomass]], largely [[biogas]].<ref>Der deutsche Strommix: Stromerzeugung in Deutschland https://strom-report.de/strom/ Retrieved 7 September 2020</ref> As only 13% of Germany's gas use was for power production,<ref>Anteil der Verbrauchergruppen am Erdgasabsatz in Deutschland in den Jahren 2009 und 2019  https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/37985/umfrage/verbrauch-von-erdgas-in-deutschland-nach-abnehmergruppen-2009/ Retrieved 7 September 2020</ref> this replaced just above 1 percent of its overall gas consumption. Replacing natural gas with gas produced with [[Renewable energy]] in [[Power-to-gas]] processes or by direct use of power has more potential for further expansion. Power-to-gas is as yet limited to small-scale demonstration projects, as the carbon dioxide resulting from the combustion of natural gas can be emitted cheaply or for free, and Russia does not take back carbon dioxide from the combustion of Russian gas for underground storage in its depleted gas reservoirs.

[[File:Sergey Kirienko (01113353) (9776894576).jpg|thumb|[[Sergey Kiriyenko]], the head of state-owned nuclear corporation [[Rosatom]] from 2005 to 2016]]
Ukraine has been traditionally sourcing fuel for its [[Nuclear power in Ukraine|nuclear power plants]] from Russia, although with the outbreak of [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Donbass]] it saw an urgent need to at least diversify supplies of fuel and started talks with a number of Western suppliers, most notably [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] branch in Sweden. In response, Russia started an intimidation campaign which included supplying deliberately incorrect technical specifications of the existing fuel supplies, alluding to "second Chernobyl" and staging protests in Kyiv. In spite of these efforts, Ukraine secured a number of framework contracts with numerous suppliers, eventually supplying 50% of the fuel from Russia and 50% from Sweden.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-02-06|title=Kärnfrågan|url=https://www.fokus.se/2015/02/karnfragan/|access-date=2020-06-08|website=Fokus|language=sv-SE}}</ref>
