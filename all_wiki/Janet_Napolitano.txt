Arizona Secretary of State [[Jan Brewer]] became governor of Arizona.

In March 2009, Napolitano told the German news site ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' that while there is always a threat from terrorism, she preferred to talk about "man-caused' disasters" as a way "to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur."<ref>{{cite news | first=Cordula | last=Meyer | title=Away From the Politics of Fear | date=March 16, 2009 | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,613330,00.html | work=Der Spiegel | access-date=March 21, 2009 | archive-date=March 21, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321070712/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,613330,00.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 2009, in an interview defending her plans to tighten the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]], Napolitano incorrectly implied that the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 attack]] perpetrators entered the United States from Canada. This claim was made by several politicians based upon erroneous news reports in the days after the attack. Napolitano explained that she misunderstood the question and was referring to other individuals who had planned attacks and entered through Canada, but Canadian diplomats rebuked her for helping perpetuate a myth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/News/Homeland+Security+boss+rebuked+Canada+erroneous+statement/1519303/story.html |title=Homeland Security boss rebuked by Canada for erroneous 9/11 statement |last=Alberts |first=Sheldon |date=April 21, 2009 |work=[[Canada.com]] |access-date=April 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116081429/http://www.canada.com/News/Homeland%2BSecurity%2Bboss%2Brebuked%2BCanada%2Berroneous%2Bstatement/1519303/story.html |archive-date=January 16, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In response to criticism, she later said that while she knew no 9/11 terrorists entered the U.S. through Canada, "there are other instances … when suspected terrorists have attempted to enter our country from Canada to the United States... [s]ome of these are well known to the public, such as the millennium bomber, while others are not due to security reasons." There has only been one publicly reported case of terrorists coming to the United States through Canada, that of [[Ahmed Ressam]], an Algerian citizen who was in Canada illegally. Nevertheless, Napolitano later claimed that "Canada allows people into its country that we do not allow into ours" as a justification for treating the Mexican and Canadian borders equally.<ref>{{cite news | first=CBC | last=News | title=Canada more lax than U.S. about whom it lets in, Napolitano says | date=April 21, 2009 | url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-more-lax-than-u-s-about-whom-it-lets-in-napolitano-says-1.780826 | work=[[Canada.com]] | access-date=January 26, 2020 | archive-date=November 21, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121173443/https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-more-lax-than-u-s-about-whom-it-lets-in-napolitano-says-1.780826 | url-status=live }}</ref>

===H1N1 flu===
As Secretary, Napolitano was a central leader in the federal response to the [[2009 flu pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20090426/swine_flu_20_us_cases_confirmed|title=Swine Flu: U.S. Declares Public Health Emergency|last=Miranda Hitti|website=WebMD|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164006/https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20090426/swine_flu_20_us_cases_confirmed|url-status=live}}</ref>&nbsp; Rather than closing schools and businesses, which would have led to wide-scale disruption, Napolitano advanced a strategy of proactive education for prevention. This included a basic virus-prevention education program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2009/08/19/federal-guidelines-encourage-employees-plan-flu-season|title=Federal Guidelines Encourage Employees to Plan for Flu Season|date=2009-08-19|website=Department of Homeland Security|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164004/https://www.dhs.gov/news/2009/08/19/federal-guidelines-encourage-employees-plan-flu-season|url-status=live}}</ref> Ultimately, as a result of the programs implemented by Napolitano and others, much of the damage expected from this flu was mitigated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/imm_update_transcript.htm|title=CDC Novel H1N1 Flu {{!}} CDC Response: H1N1 Presentation for Immunization Update 2010|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164005/https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/imm_update_transcript.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Right-wing extremism memo===
Napolitano was the subject of controversy after the release of a Department of Homeland Security [[threat assessment]] report that was seen as derogatory towards armed forces veterans.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The report focused on potential threats from the radical right.<ref name=TP>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/16/napolitano.apology/ |title=Homeland security chief apologizes to veterans groups |publisher=CNN |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |archive-date=January 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105203032/http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/16/napolitano.apology/ |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Rightwing'' {{sic}} ''Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment''<ref name=CNN>{{cite news |url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/04/14/37528/dhs-report-right-wing/ |title=After Obama's Election, Right-Wing Extremists 'May Be Gaining New Recruits' |publisher=Think Progress |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |archive-date=June 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624084442/http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2009/04/14/37528/dhs-report-right-wing/ |url-status=live }}</ref> was made public in April 2009. The report suggested several factors, including the election of the first [[black people|black]] or [[mixed race]] president in Barack Obama, concerns regarding future [[gun control]] measures, [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], the economic downturn beginning in 2008, [[abortion in the United States|abortion controversy]], and disgruntled military veterans' possible vulnerability to recruitment efforts by extremist groups as potential risk factors regarding right-wing extremism recruitment.<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/14/homeland-security-report_n_186834.html "Homeland Security Report Warns Of Rising Right-Wing Extremism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209080645/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/14/homeland-security-report_n_186834.html |date=December 9, 2018 }}, ''Huffington Post''.</ref>

Napolitano made multiple apologies for offending veterans groups by the reference to veterans in the assessment, and promised to meet with those groups to discuss the issue.<ref name=CNN/> The Department of Homeland Security admitted a "breakdown in an internal process" by ignoring objections by the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to a portion of the document.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/news/local/politics/ny-usking1812666218apr17,0,3416042.story "Homeland Security admits error with extremism report"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421115305/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/politics/ny-usking1812666218apr17,0,3416042.story |date=April 21, 2009 }} Newsday.com.</ref>

While the [[American Legion]] reportedly criticized the assessment, Glen M. Gardner Jr., the national commander of the 2.2&nbsp;million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars, generally defended it, saying it "should have been worded differently" but served a vital purpose. "A government that does not assess internal and external security threats would be negligent of a critical public responsibility", he said in a statement.<ref name="TP" />

===Reaction to Northwest Airlines Flight 253===
Napolitano was criticized<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-grenell/youre-doing-a-heck-of-a-j_b_406212.html |title=Richard Grenell: You're Doing a Heck of a Job, Janet |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |archive-date=January 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117022432/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-grenell/youre-doing-a-heck-of-a-j_b_406212.html |url-status=live }}</ref> for stating in an interview with CNN's [[Candy Crowley]] that "the system worked" with regard to an attempted terrorist attack on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]] approaching Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. She said:

<blockquote>What we are focused on is making sure that the air environment remains safe, that people are confident when they travel. And one thing I'd like to point out is that the system worked. Everybody played an important role here. The passengers and crew of the flight took appropriate action. Within literally an hour to 90 minutes of the incident occurring, all 128 flights in the air had been notified to take some special measures in light of what had occurred on the Northwest Airlines flight. We instituted new measures on the ground and at screening areas, both here in the United States and in Europe, where this flight originated. So the whole process of making sure that we respond properly, correctly and effectively went very smoothly.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0912/27/sotu.01.html |title=CNN.com - Transcripts |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=December 27, 2009 |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |archive-date=January 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122013951/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0912/27/sotu.01.html |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

She later went on [[NBC's Today Show]] with host [[Matt Lauer]] and admitted that the security system had indeed failed.<ref name="wsj">Hanrahan, Tim.

In response to the NW253 bomb attempt, Napolitano instituted emergency enhanced pat-down screening until airport security technology could be deployed that could detect non-metallic explosives. After [[full body scanner]]s were deployed, the enhanced pat-downs were used selectively on passengers who triggered an alarm when passing through the detection equipment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2010/03/05/secretary-napolitano-announces-deployments-recovery-act-funded-advanced-imaging|title=Secretary Napolitano Announces Deployments of Recovery Act-Funded Advanced Imaging Technology|date=2010-03-05|website=Department of Homeland Security|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164005/https://www.dhs.gov/news/2010/03/05/secretary-napolitano-announces-deployments-recovery-act-funded-advanced-imaging|url-status=live}}</ref>

===TSA Pre-Check and Global Entry===
To reduce the time consumed by airport security checks Napolitano created the popular program [[TSA PreCheck|TSA Pre Check]], which allows travelers to provide background information about themselves to the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) in return for expedited security screening.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2012/02/08/tsa-pre-check-pilot-expand-busiest-us-airports|title=TSA Pre-Check™ Pilot to Expand to Busiest US Airports|date=2012-02-08|website=Department of Homeland Security|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164004/https://www.dhs.gov/news/2012/02/08/tsa-pre-check-pilot-expand-busiest-us-airports|url-status=live}}</ref>&nbsp;TSA Pre-Check reduces the number of unknown passengers arriving at security screening lines in airports. She also expanded the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] trusted traveler program, Global Entry, to include more American travelers and some from verified partners abroad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/secretary-napolitano-announces-final-rule-permanent-global-entry|title=Secretary Napolitano Announces Final Rule for Permanent Global Entry Program {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164006/https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/secretary-napolitano-announces-final-rule-permanent-global-entry|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Secure Communities===
[[Secure Communities]], or SComm, is a deportation program managed by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], a subdivision of Homeland Security. Napolitano came under scrutiny for contradicting herself about whether the program is voluntary or mandatory for local jurisdictions. On September 7, 2010, Napolitano said in a letter to Congresswoman [[Zoe Lofgren]] that jurisdictions that wished to withdraw from the program could do so. However, in October 2010 a ''Washington Post'' article quoted an anonymous senior ICE official saying: "Secure Communities is not based on state or local cooperation in federal law enforcement ... State and local law enforcement agencies are going to continue to fingerprint people and those fingerprints are forwarded to FBI for criminal checks. ICE will take immigration action appropriately."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093007268.html|title=No opt-out for immigration enforcement|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2010-10-01|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-date=July 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719232956/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093007268.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Napolitano later modified her position: "What my letter said was that we would work with them on the implementation in terms of timing and the like ... But we do not view this as an opt-in, opt-out program."<ref>Renee Feltz. "ICE Attributes Record Deportation Levels to Secure Communities." DeportationNation.

Under Napolitano's leadership, the DHS invested heavily in border security and border security technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2011/01/31/secretary-napolitanos-remarks-border-security-university-texas-el-paso|title=Secretary Napolitano's Remarks on Border Security at the University of Texas at El Paso|date=2011-01-31|website=Department of Homeland Security|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164015/https://www.dhs.gov/news/2011/01/31/secretary-napolitanos-remarks-border-security-university-texas-el-paso|url-status=live}}</ref>&nbsp;These investments included a border security supplement passed by Congress to fund an increase in technology and infrastructure along the southern border with Mexico.&nbsp;This technology was used to replace [[Boeing|Boeing's]] [[SBInet|SBI Net]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/sbinet-replacement-takes-shape|title=SBInet replacement takes shape {{!}} Homeland Security Newswire|website=www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321211047/http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/sbinet-replacement-takes-shape|url-status=live}}</ref> which was widely criticized as expensive and dysfunctional.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg57597/html/CHRG-111hhrg57597.htm|title=- THE SECURE BORDER INITIATIVE: SBINET THREE YEARS LATER|website=www.govinfo.gov|access-date=2019-03-21|archive-date=March 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164004/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg57597/html/CHRG-111hhrg57597.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the [[2010 transatlantic aircraft bomb plot]], which used printer cartridges to conceal bombs, Napolitano issued a ban for [[Ink cartridge|toner and ink cartridges]] weighing more than one pound on passenger flights.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/08/bans-cargo-shipments-somalia/?test=latestnews | work=Fox News | title=U.S. Bans All Cargo Shipments From Somalia | date=November 8, 2010 | access-date=November 9, 2010 | archive-date=November 11, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111140251/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/08/bans-cargo-shipments-somalia/?test=latestnews | url-status=live }}</ref>

DACA was announced by President Obama in a [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] ceremony shortly after its creation.

Napolitano has used her tenure as president to encourage more students to pursue public interest careers. She created a fund for fellowships for undergraduate students to offset costs related to public service internships in Sacramento and Washington D.C.
