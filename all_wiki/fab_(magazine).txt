'''''fab''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[magazine]] which targeted the [[gay]] community, publishing biweekly issues in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] from 1994 to 2013. It published alternate weeks to the city's other biweekly gay publication, ''[[Xtra!]]''. The publication's official spelling uses a lower-case F: ''fab''.

==History==

''fab'' was established in June 1994 by No Fear Publishing,<ref name=now>[http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=191557 "RIP Fab Magazine (1994-2013)"]. ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'', March 12, 2013.</ref> originally as a publication focusing primarily on the city's gay party and club scene.<ref name=announcement />

In 1996, ''fab'' also launched a national edition, known as ''FAB National'' to distinguish itself from the local Toronto publication. The national magazine struggled to build an audience, and was sold in 1998; its new owners ceased publication of the magazine within a few months.

In 2006, under editor-in-chief, Steven Bereznai, ''FabStyle'' — a special issue devoted to fashion and design — was launched as a quarterly publication. However, only two issues were ever produced.

In February 2008, [[Pink Triangle Press]], publishers of ''[[Xtra!]]'', ''[[Xtra! West]]'' and ''[[Capital Xtra!]]'', purchased the assets of ''fab''. The magazine began publishing under the PTP banner in March 2008.<ref name=now /> Due to downsizing efforts, Pink Triangle Press announced the magazine's discontinuation on March 12, 2013;<ref name=now /> the magazine's April 24, 2013 issue was its last.<ref name=announcement>[http://www.fabmagazine.com/fab-blog/fab-magazine-closes-gays-across-the-gta-dress-in-black "Fab magazine to close, gays across GTA dress in black"]. ''fab'', March 12, 2013.</ref> Its past web content and many of its contributors were expected to be integrated into DailyXtra.com, an expansion of ''Xtra!'''s online presence which debuted later in the year.<ref name=announcement />

Described as a "gay scene magazine", ''fab'' covered popular Toronto gay culture, including music and clubbing. Feature articles are usually news-related and deal with literature, AIDS, real estate, music, and other current-affairs topics.

Photo spreads were common, and ''fab'' covers typically feature sexy and provocative male models. Covers also occasionally featured a public figure, when a major feature interview with that person appeared in the magazine — [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] appeared on the cover in a leather jacket,<ref>[http://www.fabmagazine.com/issuecovers/full/244.jpg Issue 244] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002031116/http://www.fabmagazine.com/issuecovers/full/244.jpg |date=2008-10-02 }}</ref> [[Jack Layton]] and [[Olivia Chow]] appeared together flanked by a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officer in dress leathers,<ref>[http://www.fabmagazine.com/issuecovers/full/236.jpg Issue 236] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002031118/http://www.fabmagazine.com/issuecovers/full/236.jpg |date=2008-10-02 }}</ref> and [[Julian Fantino]] posed in his police uniform with a row of otherwise anonymous models dressed as [[Village People|The Village People]].<ref>[http://www.fabmagazine.com/issuecovers/full/252.jpg Issue 252] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203115827/http://www.fabmagazine.com/issuecovers/full/252.jpg |date=December 3, 2010 }}</ref> Exclusive celebrity covers have also included musicians [[Lady Gaga]], [[Blake McGrath]], [[Joel Gibb]], [[Neko Case]] and [[Hawksley Workman]], actors [[Kate Moennig]], [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]], [[Cheyenne Jackson]] and [[Adamo Ruggiero]], and local activists [[George Hislop]] and [[Brent Hawkes]].

==Editors==
The magazine had several editors prior to 1998, when John Kennedy took over. Over the next four years, he increased readership and advertising revenues. After 100 issues, Kennedy was replaced by Mitchel Raphael in 2002; Raphael left the magazine in January 2006 and was replaced by Steven Bereznai. In April 2007, Bereznai stepped down and was replaced by Paul Gallant.

With the purchase of ''fab'' by Pink Triangle Press in February 2008, Gallant was replaced by Matt Thomas and Drew Rowsome. The magazine's final editor, Phil Villeneuve, started in 2012.

==Contributors==

At different times during its run, ''fab''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s regular columnists included Rolyn Chambers, [[Drasko Bogdanovic]], Daniel Paquette, [[Paul Bellini]], Max MacDonald, Heroine Marks, [[Todd Klinck]], [[Nina Arsenault]], [[Richard Burnett]] and [[Brad Fraser]].
