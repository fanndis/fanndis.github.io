The '''Federal Senate''' ({{lang-pt|Senado Federal}}) is the [[upper house]] of the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] of [[Brazil]]. When created within the [[Brazilian Empire]] in 1824, it was based on the British [[House of Lords]], but since the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]] in 1889 the Federal Senate has resembled the [[United States Senate]]. In its current form the Senate has 81 seats, three each for the [[Brazilian Federal District|Federal District]] and the 26 [[States of Brazil|states]]. Senators sit for eight years, and elections are [[Staggered elections|staggered]] so that either a third or two-thirds are up for election every four years.

The current president of the Brazilian Senate is [[Davi Alcolumbre]], from the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] of [[Amapá]]. He was elected in early 2019 for a two-year term.

==Structure==
The Senate has 81 members, serving an eight-year [[term of office]]. There are three Senators from each of the country's 27 federative units, the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] and the 26 [[States of Brazil|states]]. Elections are [[Staggered elections|staggered]] so that either a third or two-thirds of Senators are up for election every four years. The [[2018 Brazilian general election#Federal Senate elections|most recent election]] took place in 2018, where two-thirds of the Senate was elected.

Elections are held under the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] and [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] systems. In years when a third of members are up for election, voters can cast only one vote and the candidate who receives a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes within their state is elected. In years when two-thirds of members are up for election, voters can cast two votes. People can not vote for the same candidate twice, but each party can field up to two candidates in each state. The two highest-placed candidates in each state are elected.

==History==
The Federal Senate of Brazil was established as the ''Senate of the Empire'' by the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Imperial Constitution (1824)|Constitution of 1824]], first enacted after the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. It was modelled on the British [[House of Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.r7.com/brasil/noticias/senado-federal-completa-hoje-185-anos-20110506.html?question=0|title=Senado Federal completa hoje 185 anos|language=portuguese|work=R7|quote=O Senado Federal foi criado com a primeira Constituição do Império, outorgada em 1824, inspirado, primeiramente, na Câmara dos Lordes da Grã-Bretanha. Sua primeira reunião ocorreu em 6 de maio de 1826.|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=22 May 2012}}.</ref>

Following independence, in 1822, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] ordered the convocation of a National Assembly to draft the country's first Constitution. Following several disagreements with the elected deputies (which included representatives from present-day [[Uruguay]], then part of the Brazilian Empire under the name of ''[[History of Uruguay|Província Cisplatina]]''), the Emperor dissolved the Assembly. In 1824, Pedro I implemented the first Constitution which established a Legislative branch with the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] as the [[lower house]], and the Senate as an upper house.

The first configuration of the Senate was a consulting body to the Emperor. [[Senator for life|Membership was for life]] and it was a place of great prestige, to which only a small part of the population could aspire. The original Senate had 50 members, representing all of the [[Provinces of Brazil|Empire's provinces]], each with a number of senators proportional to its population.

Members of the Senate were elected, but they had to be at least 40 years old and have an annual income of 800,000 [[Brazilian real (old)|contos-de-réis]], which limited candidates to wealthy citizens. Voters also faced an income qualification. Voting in an election for the Senate was limited to male citizens with an annual income of at least 200,000 contos-de-réis. Those who qualified for this did not vote directly for Senators; instead, they voted for candidates to be Senate electors. To be a Senate elector required an annual income of 400,000 contos-de-réis. Once elected, these electors would then vote for senator. The election itself would not result in a winner automatically. The three candidates receiving the most votes would make up what was called a "triple list", from which the Emperor would select one individual that would be considered "elected". The Emperor usually chose the candidate with the most votes, but it was within his discretion to select whichever of the three individuals listed. The unelected [[List of Heads of the Brazilian Imperial House|Princes of the Brazilian Imperial House]] were senators by right and would assume their seats in the Senate upon reaching age 25.

Following the adoption of the 1824 Constitution the first session of the Senate took place in May 1826. The Emperor had repeatedly delayed calling the first election, which had led to accusations that he would attempt to establish an [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] government.

The [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]] in 1889 ended the Brazilian Empire in favor of the [[First Brazilian Republic|First Republic]]. The [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Old Republic Constitution (1891)|1891 Constitution]] was then adopted, transforming Brazil's provinces into states and the Senate into an elected body. This was retained under later constitutions, including the current [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Constitution]]. Now known as the Federal Senate, it resembles the [[United States Senate]] in that each state has the same number of Senators.
