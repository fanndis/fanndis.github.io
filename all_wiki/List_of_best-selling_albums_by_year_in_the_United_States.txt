[[File:Harry Belafonte 2011 Shankbone.JPG|190px|thumb|right|alt=A photo of a bald smiling Jamaican man. He is in his 80s and wearing a dark grey suit over a black collared shirt. |[[Harry Belafonte]]'s ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' was labeled the US's top-selling record of 1956.]]

This is a list of the '''best-selling albums by year in the United States'''. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] began publishing year-end lists for album sales in 1956. Until 1991, the ''Billboard'' album chart was based on a survey of representative retail outlets that determined a ranking, not a tally of actual sales. Weekly surveys and year-end charts by ''Billboard'' and other publications such as now defunct [[Cash Box|''Cash Box'' magazine]] sometimes differed. For instance, during the 1960s and 1970s, the number-one album as determined by these two publications differed in 10 out of 20 years. From 1992 onwards, the ''Billboard'' year-end and weekly charts were calculated by [[Nielsen SoundScan]]. Note that this slightly differs from prior ''Billboard'' year-end album charts, which were a measure of chart performances over twelve months from around December to November (cutoff determined by ''Billboard''´s publication schedule) rather than actual total sales.

==Synopsis==
[[Harry Belafonte]]'s 1956 record entitled ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' was the first product to be recognized as a top-selling album for a year once [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] started tracking sales figures. [[Adele]]'s 2011 record ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' currently holds the title for the US's top-selling digital album. American Pop/[[R&B]] singer-songwriter [[Mariah Carey]], singer [[Whitney Houston]], British [[glam rock]] performer [[Elton John]], rapper [[Eminem]], American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], British singer-songwriter [[Adele]], and Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] each have had two of their albums be top sellers in two separate years in the US. Pop singer [[Michael Jackson]]'s 1982 ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' became the best-selling record in the country for two consecutive years in the 1980s (and later became the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]]). Other albums to achieve the same accomplishment included the [[My Fair Lady (Broadway cast recording)|''My Fair Lady'' Original Cast Recording]] from the [[My Fair Lady#Original Broadway production|hit 1956 Broadway production]] between 1957 and 1958, the original soundtrack of [[West Side Story (1961 film)#Soundtrack|West Side Story]] between 1962 and 1963, and the album [[21 (Adele album)|''21'']] by [[Adele]] between 2011 and 2012. That album, along with her follow-up [[25 (Adele album)|''25'']] which was the best selling album of 2015, made Adele the only artist to have the top-selling album of at least three separate years. However, ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' by American rock group [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] currently holds the title of the U.S.'s biggest-selling album, with a 38× Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.

== Notes ==
{{sup|{{note|1|[I]}}}} Each year is linked to the article about music that year.
*After ''Billboard'' began obtaining sales and airplay information from Nielsen SoundScan and [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]], the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales points. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's most popular titles, as an entry that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in March could possibly have earned fewer cumulative points than one spending six weeks at number three in January. Albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked lower than expected on a year-end tally, yet are ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart years. Sometimes, the best-selling album of the year by ''Billboard'' is different than best-selling album of the year of Nielsen SoundScan, because ''Billboard'' calculates the year from December to November and Nielsen calculates the year from January to December.
*In this list, from 1956 to 1991, the ''Billboard'' year-end tracking was used. From 1992 to date, Nielsen SoundScan's year-end tracking was used.
*{{note|album number}}† Beginning in 2015, the ''Billboard'' began using [[album-equivalent unit]]s in its methodology to determine the year's top album.
