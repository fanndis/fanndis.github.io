'''Private equity''' ('''PE''') typically refers to [[investment fund]]s, generally organized as [[limited partnership]]s, that buy and restructure companies that are not [[publicly traded]].

Private equity is a type of [[equity (finance)|equity]] and one of the [[asset classes]] consisting of [[Stock|equity]] [[Security (finance)|securities]] and debt in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a [[stock exchange]].<ref>Investments in private equity [http://www.bvca.co.uk/publications/guide/intro.html An Introduction to Private Equity], including differences in terminology. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105001859/http://www.bvca.co.uk/publications/guide/intro.html |date=5 January 2016 }}</ref>

A private-equity investment will generally be made by a [[private-equity firm]], a [[venture capital]] firm or an [[angel investor]]. Each of these categories of investors has its own set of goals, preferences and investment strategies; however, all provide [[working capital]] to a target company to nurture expansion, new-product development, or restructuring of the company's operations, management, or ownership.<ref name="PrivCo.com Private Company Knowledge Bank">

Common investment strategies in private equity include [[leveraged buyout]]s, [[venture capital]], [[growth capital]], [[distressed securities|distressed investments]] and [[mezzanine capital]]. In a typical leveraged-buyout transaction, a private-equity firm buys majority control of an existing or mature firm. This is distinct from a venture-capital or growth-capital investment, in which the investors (typically venture-capital firms or angel investors) invest in young, growing or [[emerging companies]], and rarely obtain majority control.

Private equity is also often grouped into a broader category called [[private capital]], generally used to describe capital supporting any long-term, [[illiquid]] [[investment strategy]].<ref>[https://www.uspec.org/blog/winning-strategy-for-better-investment-decisions-in-private-equity Winning Strategy For Better Investment Decisions In Private Equity]. ''USPEC'', Retrieved 27 January 2020.</ref>

The key features of private-equity operations are generally as follows.
* A private-equity manager uses the money of investors to fund its acquisitions – investors are e.g. hedge funds, pension funds, university endowments or wealthy individuals.
* It restructures the acquired firm (or firms) and attempts to resell at a higher value, aiming for a high return on equity. The restructuring often involves cutting costs, which produces higher profits in the short term, but can probably do long-term damage to customer relationships and workforce morale.
* Private equity makes extensive use of debt financing to purchase companies in use of [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] – hence the earlier name for private-equity operations: leveraged buy-outs. (A small increase in firm value – for example, a growth of asset price by 20% – can lead to 100% return on equity, if the amount the private-equity fund put down to buy the company in the first place was only 20% down and 80% debt. However, if the private-equity firm fails to make the target grow in value, losses will be large.) Additionally, debt financing reduces corporate taxation burdens, as interest payments are tax-deductible, and is one of the principal ways in which profits for investors are enhanced.  
* Because innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[Founder CEO|founders]] in [[startups]], rather than existing organizations, private equity targets startups to create value by overcoming agency costs and better aligning the incentives of corporate managers with those of their shareholders. This means a greater share of firm retained earnings is taken out of the firm to distribute to shareholders than is reinvested in the firm's workforce or equipment. When private equity purchases a very small startup it can behave like venture capital and help the small firm reach a wider market. However, when private equity purchases a larger firm, the experience of being managed by private equity may lead to loss of product quality and low morale among the employees.<ref>Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt.

* Private-equity investors often syndicate their transactions to other buyers to achieve benefits that include diversification of different types of target risk, the combination of complementary investor information and skillsets, and an increase in future deal flow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Priem |first1=Randy |title=Syndication of European buyouts and its effects on target-firm performance |journal=Journal of Applied Corporate Finance |date=2017 |volume=28 |issue=4 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jacf.12209|doi=10.1111/jacf.12209 |doi-broken-date=24 October 2020 }}</ref>

''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' has called "private equity" a rebranding of leveraged-buyout firms after the 1980s.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

==Strategies==
The strategies private-equity firms may use are as follows, leveraged buyout being the most important.

===Leveraged buyout===
{{Main|Leveraged buyout}}
[[File:Leveraged Buyout Diagram.png|{{largethumb}}|Diagram of the basic structure of a generic leveraged buyout transaction]]

Leveraged buyout, LBO, or Buyout refers to a strategy of making equity investments as part of a transaction in which a company, business unit, or business assets is acquired from the current shareholders typically with the use of [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]].<ref name="Investopedia">{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp |title=Investopedia LBO Definition |publisher=Investopedia.com |date=15 February 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> The companies involved in these transactions are typically mature and generate [[operating cash flow]]s.<ref>[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pecenter/research/Financial_Times.pdf The balance between debt and added value].  Financial Times, 29 September 2006</ref>

Private-equity firms view target companies as either Platform companies which have sufficient scale and a successful business model to act as a stand-alone entity, or as add-on / tuck-in / [[bolt-on acquisition]]s, which would include companies with insufficient scale or other deficits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/tuck-in-acquisition.asp#axzz2H877O8Gh |title=Frequently Asked Question: What is a tuck-in acquisition? |date=30 September 2008 |work=Investopedia |accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.privco.com/knowledge-bank/definition/add-on-bolt-on-acquisition |title=Add-On/Bolt-On Acquisition defined |work=PrivCo |accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>

Leveraged buyouts involve a [[financial sponsor]] agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital required for the acquisition. To do this, the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments.<ref>[http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~igiddy/LBO_Note.pdf Note on Leveraged Buyouts].  Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth: Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship, 2002.  Accessed 20 February 2009</ref> Acquisition debt in an LBO is often [[Nonrecourse debt|non-recourse]] to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor. Therefore, an LBO transaction's financial structure is particularly attractive to a fund's limited partners, allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage. This kind of financing structure leverage benefits an LBO's financial sponsor in two ways: (1) the investor itself only needs to provide a fraction of the capital for the acquisition, and (2) the returns to the investor will be enhanced (as long as the [[return on assets]] exceeds the cost of the debt).<ref>Ulf Axelson, Tim Jenkinson, Per Strömberg, and Michael S. Weisbach.  [http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/corporate_governance/papers/2008fall-Speakers_11-13_Weisbach.pdf Leverage and Pricing in Buyouts: An Empirical Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327052724/http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/corporate_governance/papers/2008fall-Speakers_11-13_Weisbach.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}. 28 August 2007</ref>

As a percentage of the purchase price for a leverage buyout target, the amount of debt used to finance a transaction varies according to the financial condition and history of the acquisition target, market conditions, the willingness of [[bank|lenders]] to extend credit (both to the LBO's [[financial sponsor]]s and the company to be acquired) as well as the interest costs and the ability of the company to [[interest coverage ratio|cover]] those costs. Historically the debt portion of a LBO will range from 60%–90% of the purchase price.<ref>Steven N. Kaplan and Per Strömberg.  [http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/bhagat/LBO-VC.pdf Leveraged Buyouts and Private Equity], Social Science Research Network, June 2008</ref> Between 2000–2005 debt averaged between 59.4% and 67.9% of total purchase price for LBOs in the United States.<ref>Trenwith Group "M&A Review," (Second Quarter, 2006)</ref>

====Simple example of leveraged buyout====
A private-equity fund, ABC Capital II, borrows $9bn from a bank (or other lender). To this, it adds $2bn of ''equity'' – money from its own partners and from ''limited partners''. With this $11bn it buys all the shares of an underperforming company, XYZ Industrial (after ''[[due diligence]]'', i.e. checking the books). It replaces the senior management in XYZ Industrial, and they set out to streamline it. The workforce is reduced, some assets are sold off, etc. The objective is to increase the value of the company for an early sale.

The stock market is experiencing a [[bull market]], and XYZ Industrial is sold two years after the buy-out for $13bn, yielding a profit of $2bn. The original loan can now be paid off with interest of, say, $0.5bn. The remaining profit of $1.5bn is shared among the partners. Taxation of such gains is at capital gains rates.

Note that part of that profit results from turning the company around, and part results from the general increase in share prices in a buoyant stock market, the latter often being the greater component.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peston |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Peston |title=Who runs Britain? |publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]] |year=2008 |location=London |pages=28–67 |isbn=978-0-340-83942-3}}</ref>

Notes:
* The lenders (the people who put up the $9bn in the example) can insure against default by [[Syndicated loan|syndicating the loan]] to spread the risk, or by buying [[credit default swap]]s (CDSs) or selling [[Collateralized debt obligation|collateralised debt obligations]] (CDOs) from/to other institutions (although this is no business of the private-equity firm).
* Often the loan/equity ($11bn above) is not paid off after sale but left on the books of the company (XYZ Industrial) for it to pay off over time. This can be advantageous since the interest is largely offsettable against the profits of the company, thus reducing, or even eliminating, tax.
* Most buyout deals are much smaller; the global average purchase in 2013 was $89m, for example.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bvdinfo.com/BvD/media/General/MandA%20reports/Global-Private-Equity,-FY-2013.pdf |title=Zephyr Annual M&A Report: Global Private Equity, 2013|date=2014 |website=Bureau van Dijk |publisher=[[Bureau van Dijk]] |accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>
* The target company (XYZ Industrials here) does not have to be floated on the stock market; indeed most buyout exits are not IPOs.{{citation needed |date=May 2014}}
* Buy-out operations can go wrong and in such cases, the loss is increased by leverage, just as the profit is if all goes well.{{citation needed |date=May 2014}}

===Growth capital===

{{Main|Growth capital}}
[[Growth capital|Growth Capital]] refers to equity investments, most often minority investments, in relatively mature companies that are looking for capital to expand or restructure operations, enter new markets or finance a major acquisition without a change of control of the business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/g/growth-capital/|title=Growth Capital Law and Legal Definition &#124; USLegal, Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}</ref>

Companies that seek growth capital will often do so in order to finance a transformational event in their life cycle. These companies are likely to be more mature than venture capital-funded companies, able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions, acquisitions or other investments. Because of this lack of scale, these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth, so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion, sales and marketing initiatives, equipment purchases, and new product development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.growthcapital.com/growth/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024152807/http://www.growthcapital.com/growth/|url-status=dead|title=GROWTH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT|archive-date=24 October 2011}}</ref>

The primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone. By selling part of the company to private equity, the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners.<ref>Loewen, Jacoline (2008). Money Magnet: Attract Investors to Your Business: John Wiley & Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-15575-2}}.</ref> Capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a company's balance sheet, particularly to reduce the amount of [[leverage (finance)|leverage (or debt)]] the company has on its [[balance sheet]].<ref>[http://www.privateequitycouncil.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/driving-growth-final.pdf Driving Growth: How Private Equity Investments Strengthen American Companies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107021723/http://www.privateequitycouncil.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/driving-growth-final.pdf |date=7 November 2015 }}.  Private Equity Council.  Accessed 20 February 2009</ref>

A [[Private investment in public equity]], or [[Private investment in public equity|PIPEs]], refer to a form of [[growth capital]] investment made into a [[publicly traded company]]. PIPE investments are typically made in the form of a [[Convertible bond|convertible]] or [[preferred stock|preferred]] security that is unregistered for a certain period of time.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1031F936A35755C0A9629C8B63 When Private Mixes With Public; A Financing Technique Grows More Popular and Also Raises Concerns].

''The New York Times'', 13 August 2006</ref>

The Registered Direct, or RD, is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital. A registered direct is similar to a PIPE but is instead sold as a registered security.

===Mezzanine capital===
{{Main|Mezzanine capital}}
[[Mezzanine capital]] refers to [[subordinated debt]] or [[Preferred stock|preferred equity]] securities that often represent the most junior portion of a company's [[capital structure]] that is senior to the company's [[Common stock|common equity]]. This form of financing is often used by private-equity investors to reduce the amount of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion. Mezzanine capital, which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the [[high-yield debt|high yield market]], allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans.<ref>Marks, Kenneth H. and Robbins, Larry E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=whnjCj-qERQC&pg The handbook of financing growth: strategies and capital structure]. 2005</ref> In compensation for the increased risk, mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders.<ref>[http://www.buyoutsnews.com/story.asp?storycode=31137 Mezz Looking Up; It's Not A Long Way Down]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Smart Business Online, August 2009</ref> Mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon.

===Venture capital===
{{Main|Venture capital}}
Venture capital<ref>In the United Kingdom, venture capital is often used instead of private equity to describe the overall asset class and investment strategy described here as private equity.</ref> or VC is a broad subcategory of private equity that refers to equity investments made, typically in less mature companies, for the launch of a seed or startup company, early-stage development, or expansion of a business. Venture investment is most often found in the application of new technology, new marketing concepts and new products that do not have a proven track record or stable revenue streams.<ref name=whatisvc>Joseph W. Bartlett.

Venture capital is often sub-divided by the stage of development of the company ranging from early-stage capital used for the launch of [[Startup company|startup companies]] to late stage and growth capital that is often used to fund expansion of existing business that are generating revenue but may not yet be profitable or generating cash flow to fund future growth.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/business/07venture.html A Kink in Venture Capital’s Gold Chain].

Investors generally commit to venture capital funds as part of a wider diversified private-equity [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]], but also to pursue the larger returns the strategy has the potential to offer. However, venture capital funds have produced lower returns for investors over recent years compared to other private-equity fund types, particularly buyout.

===Distressed and special situations===
{{Main|Distressed securities}}
[[Distressed securities|Distressed]] or '''Special Situations''' is a broad category referring to investments in equity or debt securities of financially stressed companies.<ref>[http://www.altassets.com/casefor/sectors/2001/nz2639.php The turnaround business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612041440/http://www.altassets.com/casefor/sectors/2001/nz2639.php |date=12 June 2013 }}.

===Secondaries===
{{Main|Private equity secondary market}}
Secondary investments refer to investments made in existing private-equity assets. These transactions can involve the sale of [[private-equity fund]] interests or portfolios of direct investments in [[privately held company|privately held companies]] through the purchase of these investments from existing [[institutional investor]]s.<ref name=2008PEMarket>[http://www.peimedia.com/productimages/Media/000/171/054/Sample_ContentsExtract_Secondaries.pdf The Private Equity Secondaries Market, A complete guide to its structure, operation and performance] The Private Equity Secondaries Market, 2008</ref> By its nature, the private-equity asset class is illiquid, intended to be a long-term investment for [[buy and hold]] investors.

===Other strategies===
Other strategies that can be considered private equity or a close adjacent market include:
* Real estate: in the context of private equity this will typically refer to the riskier end of the investment spectrum including "value-added" and opportunity funds where the investments often more closely resemble leveraged buyouts than traditional real estate investments. Certain investors in private equity consider real estate to be a separate asset class.
* [[Infrastructure]]: investments in various public works (e.g., bridges, tunnels, toll roads, airports, public transportation, and other public works) that are made typically as part of a privatization initiative on the part of a government entity.<ref>[http://www.efinancialnews.com/privateequity/index/content/2449714858/ Investors Scramble for Infrastructure] (Financial News, 2008)</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/business/yourmoney/31infra.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=infrastructure+private+equity&st=nyt&oref=slogin Is It Time to Add a Parking Lot to Your Portfolio?] (''The New York Times'', 2006</ref><ref>[Buyout firms put energy infrastructure in pipeline] (MSN Money, 2008)</ref>
* [[Energy industry|Energy]] and [[Electrical power industry|Power]]: investments in a wide variety of companies (rather than assets) engaged in the production and sale of energy, including fuel extraction, manufacturing, refining and distribution (Energy) or companies engaged in the production or transmission of electrical power (Power).
* [[Merchant Bank|Merchant banking]]: negotiated private-equity investment by financial institutions in the unregistered securities of either privately or publicly held companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/banking/2001sep/article2.html |title=Merchant Banking: Past and Present |publisher=Fdic.gov |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214173115/http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/banking/2001sep/article2.html |archive-date=14 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* [[Fund of funds]]: investments made in a fund whose primary activity is investing in other private-equity funds. The fund of funds model is used by investors looking for:
:* Diversification but have insufficient capital to diversify their portfolio by themselves
:* Access to top-performing funds that are otherwise oversubscribed
:* Experience in a particular fund type or strategy before investing directly in funds in that niche
:* Exposure to difficult-to-reach and/or emerging markets
:* Superior fund selection by high-talent fund of fund managers/teams
* [[Royalty fund]]: an investment that purchases a consistent revenue stream deriving from the payment of royalties. One growing subset of this category is the healthcare [[royalty fund]], in which a private-equity fund manager purchases a royalty stream paid by a pharmaceutical company to a drug patent holder. The drug patent holder can be another company, an individual inventor, or some sort of institution, such as a research university.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.elsevierbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2013/9/9/DRI-Capital-To-Pursue-Phase-III-Assets-With-Some-Of-Its-Third-Royalty-Fund?result=6&total=49&searchquery=%253fq%253dDRI%252520Capital| title=DRI Capital To Pursue Phase III Assets With Some of Its Third Royalty Fund | author=Joseph Haas | publisher=The Pink Sheet Daily | date=9 September 2013}}</ref>

===Origins of the leveraged buyout===
{{Main|History of private equity and venture capital|Early history of private equity}}
The first leveraged buyout may have been the purchase by [[Malcom McLean|McLean Industries, Inc.]] of [[Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company]] in January 1955 and [[Waterman Steamship Corporation]] in May 1955<ref>On 21 January 1955, McLean Industries, Inc. purchased the capital stock of Pan Atlantic Steamship Corporation and Gulf Florida Terminal Company, Inc. from Waterman Steamship Corporation.  In May McLean Industries, Inc. completed the acquisition of the common stock of Waterman Steamship Corporation from its founders and other stockholders.</ref> Under the terms of that transaction, McLean borrowed $42&nbsp;million and raised an additional $7&nbsp;million through an issue of [[preferred stock]]. When the deal closed, $20&nbsp;million of Waterman cash and assets were used to retire $20&nbsp;million of the loan debt.<ref>Marc Levinson, ''[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]'', pp. 44–47 (Princeton Univ. Press 2006).  The details of this transaction are set out in ICC Case No. MC-F-5976, ''McLean Trucking Company and Pan-Atlantic American Steamship Corporation—Investigation of Control'', 8 July 1957.</ref> Lewis Cullman's acquisition of [[Orkin|Orkin Exterminating Company]] in 1964 is often cited as the first leveraged buyout.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yalealumnimagazine.com/obituaries/4913-lewis-b-cullman-41|title=Lewis B.

These investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private-equity firms. In fact it is Posner who is often credited with coining the term "[[leveraged buyout]]" or "LBO".<ref>Trehan, R. (2006). ''[http://www.4hoteliers.com/4hots_fshw.php?mwi=1757 The History Of Leveraged Buyouts]''. 4 December 2006. Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>

The leveraged buyout boom of the 1980s was conceived by a number of corporate financiers, most notably [[Jerome Kohlberg Jr.]] and later his protégé [[Henry Kravis]]. Working for [[Bear Stearns]] at the time, Kohlberg and Kravis along with Kravis' cousin [[George R. Roberts|George Roberts]] began a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive.<ref>[spam filter website: investmentu.com/research/private-equity-history.html The History of Private Equity] (Investment U, The Oxford Club</ref> In the following years the three [[Bear Stearns]] bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals.<ref>Burrough, Bryan. ''[[Barbarians at the Gate]].''  New York : Harper & Row, 1990, p. 133-136</ref> By 1976, tensions had built up between [[Bear Stearns]] and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] in that year.

===Private equity in the 1980s===
{{Main|History of private equity and venture capital|Private equity in the 1980s}}
In January 1982, former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William E. Simon]] and a group of investors acquired [[Gibson Greetings]], a producer of greeting cards, for $80&nbsp;million, of which only $1&nbsp;million was rumored to have been contributed by the investors. By mid-1983, just sixteen months after the original deal, Gibson completed a $290&nbsp;million IPO and Simon made approximately $66&nbsp;million.<ref>Taylor, Alexander L.  "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951242,00.html Buyout Binge]". [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]], 16 July 1984.</ref><ref>David Carey and John E. Morris, [http://king-of-capital.com/ ''King of Capital The Remarkable Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Steve Schwarzman and Blackstone''] (Crown 2010), pp. 15–26</ref>

The success of the Gibson Greetings investment attracted the attention of the wider media to the nascent boom in leveraged buyouts. Between 1979 and 1989, it was estimated that there were over 2,000 leveraged buyouts valued in excess of $250&nbsp;million.<ref>Opler, T. and Titman, S.  "The determinants of leveraged buyout activity: Free cash flow vs. financial distress costs." [[Journal of Finance]], 1993.</ref>

During the 1980s, constituencies within acquired companies and the media ascribed the "[[corporate raid]]" label to many private-equity investments, particularly those that featured a [[hostile takeover]] of the company, perceived [[asset stripping]], major layoffs or other significant corporate restructuring activities. Among the most notable investors to be labeled corporate raiders in the 1980s included [[Carl Icahn]], [[Victor Posner]], [[Nelson Peltz]], [[Robert Bass|Robert M. Bass]], [[T. Boone Pickens]], [[Harold Clark Simmons]], [[Kirk Kerkorian]], [[Sir James Goldsmith]], [[Saul Steinberg (business)|Saul Steinberg]] and [[Asher Edelman]]. [[Carl Icahn]] developed a reputation as a ruthless [[corporate raid]]er after his hostile takeover of [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] in 1985.<ref>King of Capital, pp. 31–44</ref><ref name=IcahnTWA>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1590446,00.html 10 Questions for Carl Icahn] by Barbara Kiviat, [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], 15 February 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/October-2005/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/ TWA – Death Of A Legend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121150300/http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/October-2005/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/ |date=21 November 2008 }} by Elaine X. Grant, St Louis Magazine, Oct 2005</ref> Many of the corporate raiders were onetime clients of [[Michael Milken]], whose investment banking firm, [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt to take over a company and provided [[high-yield debt]] ("junk bonds") financing of the buyouts.

One of the final major buyouts of the 1980s proved to be its most ambitious and marked both a high-water mark and a sign of the beginning of the end of the boom that had begun nearly a decade earlier. In 1989, KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) closed in on a $31.1&nbsp;billion takeover of [[RJR Nabisco]]. It was, at that time and for over 17 years, the largest leveraged buyout in history. The event was chronicled in the book (and later the movie), ''[[Barbarians at the Gate]]: The Fall of RJR Nabisco''. KKR would eventually prevail in acquiring RJR Nabisco at $109 per share, marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that [[Shearson Lehman Hutton]] would take RJR Nabisco private at $75 per share. A fierce series of negotiations and horse-trading ensued which pitted [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|KKR]] against Shearson and later [[Forstmann Little & Co.]] Many of the major banking players of the day, including [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Salomon Brothers]], and [[Merrill Lynch]] were actively involved in advising and financing the parties. After Shearson's original bid, KKR quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain RJR Nabisco for $90 per share—a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of RJR Nabisco's management. RJR's management team, working with Shearson and Salomon Brothers, submitted a bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis's team. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar
figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601881205,00.html Game of Greed] ([[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]], 1988)</ref> At $31.1&nbsp;billion of transaction value, RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyouts in history. In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed that for the first time surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–2007 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. By the end of the 1980s the excesses of the buyout market were beginning to show, with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including [[Robert Campeau]]'s 1988 buyout of [[Federated Department Stores]], the 1986 buyout of the [[Revco]] drug stores, Walter Industries, FEB Trucking and Eaton Leonard. Additionally, the RJR Nabisco deal was showing signs of strain, leading to a recapitalization in 1990 that involved the contribution of $1.7&nbsp;billion of new equity from KKR.<ref>Wallace, Anise C.

===Age of the mega-buyout: 2005–2007===
{{Main|History of private equity and venture capital|Private equity in the 21st century}}
The combination of decreasing interest rates, loosening lending standards and regulatory changes for publicly traded companies (specifically the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]]) would set the stage for the largest boom private equity had seen. Marked by the buyout of [[Dex Media]] in 2002, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed.

July and August saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with few issuers accessing the market. Uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads, which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn. However, the expected rebound in the market after 1 May 2007 did not materialize, and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing. By the end of September, the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including [[Citigroup]] and [[UBS AG]] announced major writedowns due to credit losses.

'''Staying private for longer'''

With the increased availability and scope of funding provided by private markets, many companies are staying private simply because they can. McKinsey & Company reports in its Global Private Markets Review 2018 that global private market fundraising increased by $28.2 billion from 2017, for a total of $748 billion in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/materials/2019/annual_materials/staying_private/|title=Staying Private Longer: Why Go Public?|website=www.americanbar.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Thus, given the abundance of private capital available, companies no longer require public markets for sufficient funding. Benefits may include avoiding the cost of an IPO (the average operating company going public in 2019 paid $750, 000 USD<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upcounsel.com/lectl-how-to-go-public-without-cost|title=Upcounsel}}</ref>), maintaining more control of the company, and having the 'legroom' to think long-term rather than focus on short-term or quarterly figures.  

==Investments in private equity==
[[Image:Private Equity Fund Diagram.png|{{largethumb}}|Diagram of the structure of a generic private-equity fund]]

Although the capital for private equity originally came from individual investors or corporations, in the 1970s, private equity became an asset class in which various [[institutional investor]]s allocated capital in the hopes of achieving risk-adjusted returns that exceed those possible in the [[stock market|public equity markets]]. In the 1980s, insurers were major private-equity investors. Later, public pension funds and university and other endowments became more significant sources of capital.<ref>King of Capital, pp. 213–214</ref> For most institutional investors, private-equity investments are made as part of a broad asset allocation that includes traditional assets (e.g., [[stock|public equity]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) and other [[alternative assets]] (e.g., [[hedge fund]]s, real estate, [[Commodity|commodities]]).

===Investor categories===
US, Canadian and European public and private pension schemes have invested in the asset class since the early 1980s to [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] away from their core holdings (public equity and fixed income).<ref name="academia.edu">M. Nicolas J. Firzli : [https://www.academia.edu/7950514/The_New_Drivers_of_Pension_Investment_in_Private_Equity ‘The New Drivers of Pension Investment in Private Equity’, Revue Analyse Financière, Q3 2014 – Issue N°52]</ref> Today [[pension investment in private equity]] accounts for more than a third of all monies allocated to the [[asset class]], ahead of other institutional investors such as insurance companies, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds.

===Direct vs. indirect investment===
Most institutional investors do not invest directly in [[privately held companies]], lacking the expertise and resources necessary to structure and monitor the investment. Instead, [[institutional investor]]s will invest indirectly through a [[private-equity fund]]. Certain [[institutional investor]]s have the scale necessary to develop a diversified portfolio of private-equity funds themselves, while others will invest through a [[fund of funds]] to allow a portfolio more diversified than one a single investor could construct.

===Investment timescales===
Returns on private-equity investments are created through one or a combination of three factors that include: debt repayment or cash accumulation through cash flows from operations, operational improvements that increase earnings over the life of the investment and multiple expansion, selling the business for a higher price than was originally paid. A key component of private equity as an asset class for institutional investors is that investments are typically realized after some period of time, which will vary depending on the investment strategy. Private-equity investment returns are typically realized through one of the following avenues:
* an ''[[initial public offering]]'' (''IPO'') – shares of the company are offered to the public, typically providing a partial immediate realization to the financial sponsor as well as a public market into which it can later sell additional shares;
* a ''[[merger]]'' or ''[[Takeover|acquisition]]'' – the company is sold for either cash or shares in another company;
* a ''recapitalization'' – cash is distributed to the shareholders (in this case the financial sponsor) and its [[private-equity fund]]s either from cash flow generated by the company or through raising debt or other securities to fund the distribution.

Large institutional asset owners such as pension funds (with typically long-dated liabilities), insurance companies, sovereign wealth and national reserve funds have a generally low likelihood of facing liquidity shocks in the medium term, and thus can afford the required long holding periods characteristic of private-equity investment.<ref name="academia.edu"/>

The median horizon for a LBO transaction is 8 years.<ref>Per Stromberg:[http://www.sifr.org/PDFs/stromberg(demography2008).pdf  'The new demography of Private Equity', Master Thesis, Swedish Institute for Financial Research, Stockholm School of Economics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064203/http://www.sifr.org/PDFs/stromberg(demography2008).pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

==Liquidity in the private-equity market==
[[Image:SecondaryDiagram.png|{{largethumb}}|Diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest. The buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund.]]
{{Main|Private equity secondary market}}
The private-equity secondary market (also often called private-equity secondaries) refers to the buying and selling of pre-existing investor commitments to private equity and other alternative investment funds. Sellers of private-equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds. By its nature, the private-equity asset class is illiquid, intended to be a long-term investment for buy-and-hold investors. For the vast majority of private-equity investments, there is no listed public market; however, there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private-equity assets.

Increasingly, [[private equity secondary market|secondaries]] are considered a distinct asset class with a cash flow profile that is not correlated with other private-equity investments. As a result, investors are allocating capital to secondary investments to diversify their private-equity programs. Driven by strong demand for private-equity exposure, a significant amount of capital has been committed to secondary investments from investors looking to increase and diversify their private-equity exposure.

Investors seeking access to private equity have been restricted to investments with structural impediments such as long lock-up periods, lack of transparency, unlimited leverage, concentrated holdings of illiquid securities and high investment minimums.

Secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories:

; Sale of limited-partnership interests
: The most common secondary transaction, this category includes the sale of an investor's interest in a private-equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investor's limited-partnership interest in the fund(s). Nearly all types of private-equity funds (e.g., including buyout, growth equity, venture capital, mezzanine, distressed and real estate) can be sold in the secondary market. The transfer of the limited partnership interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund.
; Sale of direct interests, secondary directs or synthetic secondaries
: This category refers to the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies, rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds. These portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions.

According to an updated 2017 ranking created by industry magazine Private Equity International<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.privateequityinternational.com/uploadedFiles/Private_Equity_International/PEI/Non-Pagebuilder/Aliased/News_And_Analysis/2017/May/Magazine/Private%20Equity%20International%20-%20PEI300%20-%202017.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185916/https://www.privateequityinternational.com/uploadedFiles/Private_Equity_International/PEI/Non-Pagebuilder/Aliased/News_And_Analysis/2017/May/Magazine/Private%20Equity%20International%20-%20PEI300%20-%202017.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 28 August 2017 |title= PEI 300 |publisher= PEI Media |accessdate= 20 August 2015 }}] from PEI Media</ref> (published by PEI Media called the PEI 300), the largest private-equity firm in the world today is The Blackstone Group based on the amount of private-equity direct-investment capital raised over a five-year window. The 10 most prominent private-equity firms in the world are:

# [[The Blackstone Group]]
# [[Sycamore Partners]]
# [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]]
# [[The Carlyle Group]]
# [[TPG Capital]]
# [[Warburg Pincus]]
# [[Advent International Corporation]]
# [[Apollo Global Management]]
# [[EnCap Investments]]
# [[CVC Capital Partners]]

Because [[List of private-equity firms|private-equity firms]] are continuously in the process of raising, investing and distributing their [[private-equity fund]]s, capital raised can often be the easiest to measure. Other metrics can include the total value of companies purchased by a firm or an estimate of the size of a firm's active portfolio plus capital available for new investments. As with any list that focuses on size, the list does not provide any indication as to relative investment performance of these funds or managers.

[[Preqin]], an independent data provider, ranks the [[Private equity fund of funds|25 largest private-equity investment managers]]. Among the larger firms in the 2017 ranking were [[AlpInvest Partners]], [[Ardian (company)|Ardian]] (formerly AXA Private Equity), [[AIG|AIG Investments]], and [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]]. [[Invest Europe]] publishes a yearbook which analyses industry trends derived from data disclosed by over 1,300 European private-equity funds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investeurope.eu|title=Invest Europe - The Voice of Private Capital|website=www.investeurope.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> Finally, websites such as AskIvy.net<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askivy.net/content/list-london-private-equity-firms |title=London-based PE funds |publisher=Askivy.net |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> provide lists of London-based private-equity firms.

===Versus hedge funds===
The investment strategies of private-equity firms differ to those of [[hedge fund]]s. Typically, private-equity investment groups are geared towards long-hold, multiple-year investment strategies in illiquid assets (whole companies, large-scale real estate projects, or other tangibles not easily converted to cash) where they have more control and influence over operations or asset management to influence their long-term returns. Hedge funds usually focus on short or medium term liquid securities which are more quickly convertible to cash, and they do not have direct control over the business or asset in which they are investing.<ref>[https://www.quantnet.com/threads/private-equity-versus-hedge-funds.562/ Private equity versus hedge funds], QuantNet, 9 July 2007.</ref> Both private-equity firms and hedge funds often specialize in specific types of investments and transactions. Private-equity specialization is usually in specific industry sector asset management while hedge fund specialization is in industry sector risk capital management. Private-equity strategies can include wholesale purchase of a privately held company or set of assets, [[Mezzanine capital|mezzanine financing]] for startup projects, [[growth capital]] investments in existing businesses or [[leveraged buyout]] of a publicly held asset converting it to private control.<ref>[http://www.qfinance.com/asset-management-checklists/understanding-private-equity-strategies-an-overview Understanding private equity strategies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330083024/http://www.qfinance.com/asset-management-checklists/understanding-private-equity-strategies-an-overview |date=30 March 2012 }}, QFinance, June 2008.</ref> Finally, private-equity firms only take [[Long (finance)|long positions]], for [[Short (finance)|short selling]] is not possible in this asset class.

==Private-equity funds==
{{Main|Private-equity fund}}
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2009}}
Private-equity fundraising refers to the action of private-equity firms seeking capital from investors for their funds. Typically an investor will invest in a specific fund managed by a firm, becoming a limited partner in the fund, rather than an investor in the firm itself. As a result, an investor will only benefit from investments made by a firm where the investment is made from the specific fund in which it has invested.
* [[Fund of funds]]. These are private-equity funds that invest in other private-equity funds in order to provide investors with a lower risk product through exposure to a large number of vehicles often of different type and regional focus. Fund of funds accounted for 14% of global commitments made to private-equity funds in 2006. {{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}
* Individuals with substantial net worth. Substantial net worth is often required of investors by the law, since private-equity funds are generally less regulated than ordinary [[mutual fund]]s. For example, in the US, most funds require potential investors to qualify as [[accredited investor]]s, which requires $1&nbsp;million of net worth, $200,000 of individual income, or $300,000 of joint income (with spouse) for two documented years and an expectation that such income level will continue.

As fundraising has grown over the past few years, so too has the number of investors in the average fund. In 2004 there were 26 investors in the average private-equity fund, this figure has now grown to 42 according to [[Preqin]] ltd. (formerly known as Private Equity Intelligence).

The managers of private-equity funds will also invest in their own vehicles, typically providing between 1–5% of the overall capital.

Often private-equity fund managers will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents in order to raise capital for their vehicles. The use of placement agents has grown over the past few years, with 40% of funds closed in 2006 employing their services, according to Preqin ltd. Placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager, and will typically take a fee of around 1% of the commitments that they are able to garner.

The amount of time that a private-equity firm spends raising capital varies depending on the level of interest among investors, which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question. Firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily, often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds, or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest. Other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer, with managers of less popular fund types (such as US and European venture fund managers in the current climate) finding the fundraising process more tough. It is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital, although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months.

Once a fund has reached its fundraising target, it will have a final close. After this point it is not normally possible for new investors to invest in the fund, unless they were to purchase an interest in the fund on the secondary market.

===Size of the industry===
The state of the industry around the end of 2011 was as follows.<ref name="Private Equity Report, 2012">[http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Private-Equity-2.pdf Private Equity Report, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423072103/http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Private-Equity-2.pdf |date=23 April 2015 }}. TheCityUK.</ref>

Private-equity [[assets under management]] probably exceeded $2.0 trillion at the end of March 2012, and funds available for investment totalled $949bn (about 47% of overall assets under management).

Some $246bn of private equity was invested globally in 2011, down 6% on the previous year and around two-thirds below the peak activity in 2006 and 2007. Following on from a strong start, deal activity slowed in the second half of 2011 due to concerns over the global economy and sovereign debt crisis in Europe. There was $93bn in investments during the first half of this year as the slowdown persisted into 2012. This was down a quarter on the same period in the previous year. Private-equity backed buyouts generated some 6.9% of global M&A volume in 2011 and 5.9% in the first half of 2012. This was down on 7.4% in 2010 and well below the all-time high of 21% in 2006.

Global exit activity totalled $252bn in 2011, practically unchanged from the previous year, but well up on 2008 and 2009 as private-equity firms sought to take advantage of improved market conditions at the start of the year to realise investments. Exit activity however, has lost momentum following a peak of $113bn in the second quarter of 2011. TheCityUK estimates total exit activity of some $100bn in the first half of 2012, well down on the same period in the previous year.

The fund raising environment remained stable for the third year running in 2011 with $270bn in new funds raised, slightly down on the previous year's total. Around $130bn in funds was raised in the first half of 2012, down around a fifth on the first half of 2011. The average time for funds to achieve a final close fell to 16.7 months in the first half of 2012, from 18.5 months in 2011. Private-equity funds available for investment ("dry powder") totalled $949bn at the end of q1-2012, down around 6% on the previous year. Including unrealised funds in existing investments, private-equity funds under management probably totalled over $2.0 trillion.

Public pensions are a major source of capital for private-equity funds. Increasingly, [[sovereign wealth funds]] are growing as an investor class for private equity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/swf-article/why-rubenstein-believes-swfs-may-become-the-biggest-single-capital-source-for-private-equity-99331/ |title=Why Rubenstein Believes SWFs May Become the Biggest Single Capital Source for Private Equity |publisher=Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute |date=2014-03-05 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref>

===Private-equity fund performance===
Due to limited disclosure, studying the returns to private equity is relatively difficult. Unlike mutual funds, private-equity funds need not disclose performance data. And, as they invest in private companies, it is difficult to examine the underlying investments. It is challenging to compare private-equity performance to public-equity performance, in particular because private-equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized.

An oft-cited academic paper (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005)<ref name="Kaplan and Schoar, 2005">{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1= Steven Neil |last2= Schoar |first2= Antoinette |year=2005 |title= Private Equity Performance: Returns, Persistence, and Capital Flows |journal= The Journal of Finance |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=1791–1823 |doi= 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00780.x |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jfinan/v60y2005i4p1791-1823.html |accessdate=10 February 2012|hdl= 1721.1/5050 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> suggests that the net-of-fees returns to PE funds are roughly comparable to the S&P 500 (or even slightly under). This analysis may actually overstate the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from [[survivorship bias]] (i.e. funds that fail won't report data). One should also note that these returns are not risk-adjusted. A more recent paper (Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012)<ref name="Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012">{{cite document |ssrn= 1932316 |title= Private Equity Performance: What Do We Know? |last1= Harris |first1= Robert S. |last2=Jenkinson |first2=Tim |last3=Kaplan |first3=Steven N. |date=10 February 2012 |publisher= Social Science Research Network |id= Accessed 10 February 2012}}</ref> found that average buyout fund returns in the U.S. have actually exceeded that of public markets. These findings were supported by earlier work, using a different data set (Robinson and Sensoy, 2011).<ref name="Robinson and Sensoy, 2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.nber.org/public_html/confer/2011/SI2011/PRENT/Robinson_Sensoy.pdf |title=Private Equity in the 21st Century: Liquidity, Cash Flows and Performance from 1984–2010 |last1=Robinson |first1=David T. |last2=Sensoy |first2=Berk A. |date=15 July 2011 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Commentators have argued that a standard methodology is needed to present an accurate picture of performance, to make individual private-equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets and other types of investment. It is also claimed that PE fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers, which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry.<ref name="realdeals.eu.com Academic pans private equity returns ">{{cite web |url=https://realdeals.eu.com/news/2011/06/17/academic-pans-private-equity-returns/ |title=Academic pans PE returns, Real Deals |publisher=Realdeals.eu.com |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523071045/http://realdeals.eu.com/mid_market/academic-pans-private-equity-returns |archive-date=23 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Two other findings in Kaplan and Schoar (2005): First, there is considerable variation in performance across PE funds. Second, unlike the mutual fund industry, there appears to be performance persistence in PE funds. That is, PE funds that perform well over one period, tend to also perform well the next period. Persistence is stronger for VC firms than for LBO firms.

The application of the [[Freedom of information act|Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)]] in certain states in the United States has made certain performance data more readily available. Specifically, FOIA has required certain public agencies to disclose private-equity performance data directly on their websites.<ref>In the United States, FOIA is individually legislated at the state level, and so disclosed private-equity performance data will vary widely.  Notable examples of agencies that are mandated to disclose private-equity information include [[CalPERS]], [[CalSTRS]] and [[Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System]] and the [[Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation]]</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the second largest market for private equity, more data has become available since the 2007 publication of the [[David Walker (chairman)|David Walker]] Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://walkerworkinggroup.com/sites/10051/files/wwg_report_final.pdf |title=Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity |access-date=4 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704132213/http://walkerworkinggroup.com/sites/10051/files/wwg_report_final.pdf |archive-date=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Debate==

===Recording private equity===
There is a debate around the distinction between private equity and [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI), and whether to treat them separately. The difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market. Private equity generally flows to unlisted firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter- or investor-held shares (also known as [[free float|free-floating shares]]). The main point of contention is that FDI is used solely for production, whereas in the case of private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets. At present, most countries report private equity as a part of FDI.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2007/05/01/stories/2007050100040900.htm Private Equity and India's FDI boom] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506141105/http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2007/05/01/stories/2007050100040900.htm |date=6 May 2011 }}.  The Hindu Business Line, 1 May 2007</ref>

===Cognitive bias===
Private-equity decision-making has been shown to suffer from [[cognitive biases]] such as [[illusion of control]] and [[overconfidence]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=S.X. Zhang  |author2=J.
