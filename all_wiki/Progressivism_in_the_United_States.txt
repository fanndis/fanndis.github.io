{{progressivism sidebar|by region}}
'''Progressivism in the United States''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[reform movement]] that reached its height early in the 20th century. Middle class and [[reformist]] in nature, it arose as a response to the vast changes brought by [[modernization]] such as the growth of large corporations, [[pollution]] and rampant [[corruption in the United States|corruption in American politics]].

Historian [[Alonzo Hamby]] describes American [[progressivism]] as a "political movement that addresses ideas, impulses, and issues stemming from modernization of American society. Emerging at the end of the nineteenth century, it established much of the tone of American politics throughout the first half of the century".<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, "Progressivism: A Century of Change and Rebirth", in ''Progressivism and the New Democracy'', ed. Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M. Mileur ([[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1999), (p.?) 40 also notes that "a plethora of scholarship in the last half of the 1950s left the old consensus [about progressives] in shreds while producing a plethora of alternative views that defy rational synthesis."</ref>

In the 21st century, progressives continue to embrace concepts such as [[Environmental movement in the United States|environmentalism]] and [[social justice]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/pr/progrsvsm.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629030845/http://www.bartleby.com/65/pr/progrsvsm.html|archive-date=June 29, 2008|title=Progressivism|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=sixth (2001–2005)|access-date=November 18, 2006}}</ref> While the modern progressive movement may be characterized as largely secular in nature, by comparison, the historical progressive movement was to a significant extent rooted in and energized by religion.<ref>Zoe Trodd, [http://religion.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-462 "Social Progressivism and Religion in America"].

== Progressive Era ==
{{main|Progressive Era}}
Historians debate the exact contours, but they generally date the [[Progressive Era]] in response to the excesses of the [[Gilded Age]] from the 1890s to either [[World War I]] or the onset of the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=Nugent1>{{cite book|last=Nugent|first=Walter|year=2010|title=Progressivism: A Very Short Introduction|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531106-8|quote=Progressivism emerged as a response to the excesses of the Gilded Age [...]. [Progressives] fought for {{sic|worker's}} compensation, child labor laws, minimum wage and maximum hours legislation; they enacted anti-trust laws, improved living conditions in urban slums, instituted the graduated income tax, won woman the right to vote, and laid the groundwork for Roosevelt's New Deal.}}</ref> Many of the core principles of the progressive movement focused on the need for efficiency in all areas of society. Purification to eliminate waste and corruption was a powerful element as well as the progressives' support of worker compensation, improved child labor laws, minimum wage legislation, a limited workweek, graduated income tax and allowed women the right to vote.<ref name=Nugent1/> [[Arthur S. Link]] and Vincent P. De Santis argue that the majority of progressives wanted to purify politics.<ref>Link, Arthur S. (1954). ''Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era: 1913–1917''.</ref><ref>De Santis, Vincent P. (1999). ''The Shaping of Modern America, 1877–1920''. p. 171. "[P]rogressives strove to purify politics".</ref> According to Jimmie Franklin, purification meant taking the vote away from blacks in the South.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Jimmie|date=Spring 1999|title=Blacks and the Progressive Movement: Emergence of a New Synthesis|journal=OAH Magazine of History|publisher=Oxford University Press on behalf of Organization of American Historians|volume=13|issue=3|pages=20–23|jstor=25163288}}</ref>

According to historian [[William Leuchtenburg]], "[t]he Progressives believed in the Hamiltonian concept of positive government, of a national government directing the destinies of the nation at home and abroad. They had little but contempt for the strict construction of the Constitution by conservative judges, who would restrict the power of the national government to act against social evils and to extend the blessings of democracy to less favored lands. The real enemy was particularism, state rights, limited government".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leuchtenburg|first=William|date=December 1952|title=Progressivism and Imperialism: The Progressive Movement and American Foreign Policy, 1898–1916|journal=[[The Journal of American History|The Mississippi Valley Historical Review]]|volume=39|issue=3|pages=483–485|doi=10.2307/1895006|jstor=1895006}}</ref>

== Purifying the electorate ==
Progressives repeatedly warned that illegal voting was corrupting the political system. They especially identified big-city bosses, working with [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] keepers and precinct workers, as the culprits who stuffed the ballot boxes. The solution to purifying the vote included prohibition (designed to close down the saloons), voter registration requirements (designed to end multiple voting), and literacy tests (designed to minimize the number of ignorant voters).<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander Keyssar|title=The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UijIgQP0xF8C|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books, 2nd ed.|pages=103–30|isbn=9780465010141}}</ref>

In the [[Northern United States|Northern states]], progressives such as [[Robert M. La Follette]] and [[William Simon U'Ren]] argued that the average citizen should have more control over his government. The Oregon System of "[[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|Initiative, Referendum, and Recall]]" was exported to many states, including Idaho, Washington and Wisconsin.<ref>{{Citation |chapter=4. Shall the People Rule? |chapter-url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&CISOPTR=52010&CISOSHOW=51998 |title=La Follette campaign literature |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |quote=La Follette has ever sought to give the people greater power over their affairs. He has favored and now favors the direct election of senators ...}}</ref> Many progressives such as George M. Forbes, president of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]'s Board of Education, hoped to make government in the United States more responsive to the direct voice of the American people, arguing:

<blockquote>[W]e are now intensely occupied in forging the tools of democracy, the direct primary, the initiative, the referendum, the recall, the short ballot, commission government. But in our enthusiasm we do not seem to be aware that these tools will be worthless unless they are used by those who are aflame with the sense of brotherhood. [...] The idea [of the social centers movement is] to establish in each community an institution having a direct and vital relation to the welfare of the neighborhood, ward, or district, and also to the city as a whole<ref>Quoted in Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M. Mileur, "Progressivism and the New Democracy," (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1999) 19–20</ref></blockquote>

Philip J. Ethington seconds this high view of direct democracy, saying that "initiatives, referendums, and recalls, along with direct primaries and the direct election of US Senators, were the core achievements of 'direct democracy' by the Progressive generation during the first two decades of the twentieth century".<ref>Philip J. Ethington, "The Metropolis and Multicultural Ethics: Direct Democracy versus Deliberative Democracy in the Progressive Era," in ''Progressivism and the New Democracy,'' ed. Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M. Mileur (Amherst: Massachusetts University Press, 1999), 193</ref>
[[File:Feminist Suffrage Parade in New York City, 1912.jpeg|thumb|Women marching for the right to vote, 1912]]
Progressives fought for [[women's suffrage]] to purify the elections using supposedly purer female voters.<ref>[[Aileen S. Kraditor]], ''The Ideas of the Woman Suffrage Movement'' (1965)</ref> Progressives in the South supported the elimination of supposedly corrupt black voters from the election booth. Historian Michael Perman says that in both Texas and Georgia "disfranchisement was the weapon as well as the rallying cry in the fight for reform". In Virginia, "the drive for disfranchisement had been initiated by men who saw themselves as reformers, even progressives".<ref name="Michael Perman 2001">Michael Perman.''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888–1908''. (University of North Carolina Press, 2001), pp. 63, 85, 177, 186–87; quotes on pp. 223, 298</ref>

While the ultimate significance of the progressive movement on today's politics is still up for debate, Alonzo L. Hamby asks:
<blockquote>What were the central themes that emerged from the cacophony [of progressivism]? Democracy or elitism? Social justice or social control? Small entrepreneurship or concentrated capitalism? And what was the impact of American foreign policy? Were the progressives isolationists or interventionists? Imperialists or advocates of national self-determination? And whatever they were, what was their motivation? Moralistic utopianism? Muddled relativistic pragmatism? Hegemonic capitalism? Not surprisingly many battered scholars began to shout 'no mas!' In 1970, Peter Filene declared that the term 'progressivism' had become meaningless.<ref>Quoted in Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M. Mileur, "Progressivism and the New Democracy," (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1999) 42</ref></blockquote>

== Municipal administration ==
The progressives typically concentrated on city and state government, looking for waste and better ways to provide services as the cities grew rapidly. These changes led to a more structured system, power that had been centralized within the legislature would now be more locally focused. The changes were made to the system to effectively make legal processes, market transactions, bureaucratic administration and democracy easier to manage, putting them under the classification of "Municipal Administration". There was also a change in authority for this system as it was believed that the authority that was not properly organized had now given authority to professionals, experts and bureaucrats for these services. These changes led to a more solid type of municipal administration compared to the old system that was underdeveloped and poorly constructed.<ref>Joseph L. Tropea, "Rational Capitalism and Municipal Government: The Progressive Era." ''Social Science History'' (1989): 137–58</ref><ref>Michael H. Ebner and Eugene M. Tobin, eds., ''The Age of Urban Reform,'' (1977)</ref><ref>Bradley Robert Rice, ''Progressive cities: the commission government movement in America, 1901–1920'' (1977)</ref><ref>Martin J. Schiesl, ''The politics of efficiency: municipal reform in the Progressive Era 1880–1920'' (1972)</ref><ref>Kenneth Fox, ''Better city government: innovation in American urban politics, 1850–1937'' (1977)</ref>

The progressives mobilized concerned middle class voters as well as newspapers and magazines to identify problems and concentrate reform sentiment on specific problems. Many Protestants focused on the saloon as the power base for corruption as well as violence and family disruption, so they tried to get rid of the entire saloon system through prohibition. Others such as [[Jane Addams]] in Chicago promoted [[settlement houses]].<ref>John D. Buenker, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era'' (2005)</ref> Early municipal reformers included [[Hazen S. Pingree]] (mayor of Detroit in the 1890s)<ref>Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969)</ref> and [[Tom L. Johnson]] in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1901, Johnson won election as mayor of Cleveland on a platform of just taxation, home rule for Ohio cities and a 3-cent streetcar fare.<ref>Eugene C. Murdock, ''Tom Johnson in Cleveland'' (1994)</ref> Columbia University President [[Seth Low]] was elected mayor of New York City in 1901 on a reform ticket.<ref>L. E. Fredman, "Seth Low: Theorist of Municipal Reform," ''Journal of American Studies'' 1972 6(1): 19–39</ref>

== Efficiency ==
Many progressives such as [[Louis Brandeis]] hoped to make American governments better able to serve the people's needs by making governmental operations and services more efficient and rational. Rather than making legal arguments against ten-hour workdays for women, he used "scientific principles" and data produced by social scientists documenting the high costs of long working hours for both individuals and society.<ref>''The Americans: Reconstruction to the 21st Century'' (Evanston: McDougall Littell, 2006), 308</ref> The progressives' quest for efficiency was sometimes at odds with the progressives' quest for democracy. Taking power out of the hands of elected officials and placing that power in the hands of professional administrators reduced the voice of the politicians and in turn reduced the voice of the people. Centralized decision-making by trained experts and reduced power for local wards made government less corrupt but more distant and isolated from the people it served. Progressives who emphasized the need for efficiency typically argued that trained independent experts could make better decisions than the local politicians. In his influential ''Drift and Mastery'' (1914) stressing the "scientific spirit" and "discipline of democracy", [[Walter Lippmann]] called for a strong central government guided by experts rather than public opinion.<ref>{{cite book|author=J. Michael Hogan|title=Rhetoric and reform in the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ewMAQAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Michigan State U. Press|isbn=978-0-87013-637-5|page=xv}}</ref>

One example of progressive reform was the rise of the [[city manager]] system in which paid, professional engineers ran the day-to-day affairs of city governments under guidelines established by elected [[city council]]s. Many cities created municipal "reference bureaus" which did expert surveys of government departments looking for waste and inefficiency. After in-depth surveys, local and even state governments were reorganized to reduce the number of officials and to eliminate overlapping areas of authority between departments. City governments were reorganized to reduce the power of local ward bosses and to increase the powers of the city council. Governments at every level began developing budgets to help them plan their expenditures rather than spending money haphazardly as needs arose and revenue became available. Governor [[Frank Lowden]] of Illinois showed a "passion for efficiency" as he streamlined state government.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Thomas Hutchinson|title=Lowden of Illinois: the life of Frank O. Lowden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0hszAQAAIAAJ|year=1957|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|pages=305 vol 1}}</ref>

=== Governmental corruption ===
Corruption represented a source of waste and inefficiency in the government. [[William Simon U'Ren]] in Oregon, [[Robert M. La Follette]] in Wisconsin and others worked to clean up state and local governments by passing laws to weaken the power of [[political machine|machine politicians]] and political bosses. In Wisconsin, La Follette pushed through an [[open primary]] system that stripped party bosses of the power to pick party candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Kevin B.|title=Governing States and Localities|year=2011|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-60426-728-0|pages=189–90}}</ref> The Oregon System included a "Corrupt Practices Act", a public referendum and a state-funded voter's pamphlet, among other reforms which were exported to other states in the Northwest and Midwest. Its high point was in 1912, after which they detoured into a disastrous third party status.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carlos A. Schwantes|title=The Pacific Northwest: An Interpretive History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JImlIbueaXcC&pg=PA347|year=1996|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|pages=347–|isbn=978-0803292284}}</ref>

=== Education ===
Early progressive thinkers such as [[John Dewey]] and [[Lester Ward]] placed a universal and comprehensive system of education at the top of the progressive agenda, reasoning that if a democracy were to be successful, its leaders, the general public, needed a good education.<ref>Ravitch, Diane; Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms; Simon & Schuster</ref> Progressives worked hard to expand and improve public and private education at all levels. They believed that modernization of society necessitated the compulsory education of all children, even if the parents objected. Progressives turned to educational researchers to evaluate the reform agenda by measuring numerous aspects of education, later leading to [[standardized testing]]. Many educational reforms and innovations generated during this period continued to influence debates and initiatives in American education for the remainder of the 20th century. One of the most apparent legacies of the Progressive Era left to American education was the perennial drive to reform schools and curricula, often as the product of energetic grass-roots movements in the city.<ref>William J. Reese, ''Power and the Promise of School Reform: Grassroots Movements during the Progressive Era'' (1986)</ref>

Since progressivism was and continues to be "in the eyes of the beholder", progressive education encompasses very diverse and sometimes conflicting directions in educational policy. Such enduring legacies of the Progressive Era continue to interest historians. Progressive Era reformers stressed "object teaching", meeting the needs of particular constituencies within the school district, equal educational opportunity for boys and girls and avoiding corporal punishment.<ref>Kathleen A. Murphey, "Common School or 'One Best System'? Tracking School Reform in Fort Wayne, Indiana, 1853–75" ''Historical Studies in Education'' 1999 11(2): 188–211</ref>

David Gamson examines the implementation of progressive reforms in three city school districts—[[Denver, Colorado]], [[Seattle, Washington]] and [[Oakland, California]]—during 1900–1928. Historians of educational reform during the Progressive Era tend to highlight the fact that many progressive policies and reforms were very different and at times even contradictory. At the school district level, contradictory reform policies were often especially apparent, though there is little evidence of confusion among progressive school leaders in  Denver, Seattle and Oakland. District leaders in these cities, including [[Frank B. Cooper]] in Seattle and Fred M. Hunter in Oakland, often employed a seemingly contradictory set of reforms. Local progressive educators consciously sought to operate independently of national progressive movements as they preferred reforms that were easy to implement and were encouraged to mix and blend diverse reforms that had been shown to work in other cities.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gamson |first=David |title=District Progressivism: Rethinking Reform in Urban School Systems, 1900–1928 |journal=Paedagogica Historica |year=2003 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=417–34 |doi=10.1080/00309230307479}}</ref>

The reformers emphasized professionalization and bureaucratization. The old system whereby ward politicians selected school employees was dropped in the case of teachers and replaced by a merit system requiring a college-level education in a [[normal school]] (teacher's college).<ref>The politicians still picked the school janitors.</ref> The rapid growth in size and complexity the large urban school systems facilitated stable employment for women teachers and provided senior teachers greater opportunities to mentor younger teachers. By 1900, most women in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] remained as teachers for at least 17.5 years, indicating teaching had become a significant and desirable career path for women.<ref>Victoria-María MacDonald, "The Paradox of Bureaucratization: New Views on Progressive Era Teachers and the Development of a Woman's Profession," ''History of Education Quarterly'' 1999 39(4): 427–53</ref>

== Regulation of large corporations and monopolies ==
[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|300px|"The Bosses of the Senate", a cartoon by [[Joseph Ferdinand Keppler|Joseph Keppler]] depicting corporate interests–from steel, copper, oil, iron, sugar, tin, and coal to paper bags, envelopes and salt–as giant money bags looming over the tiny senators at their desks in the Chamber of the [[United States Senate]]<ref>Published in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' (23 January 1889)</ref>]]
Many progressives hoped that by regulating large [[corporation]]s they could liberate human energies from the restrictions imposed by industrial [[capitalism]]. Nonetheless, the progressive movement was split over which of the following solutions should be used to regulate corporations.

=== Trust busting ===
Pro-[[Organized labor|labor]] progressives such as [[Samuel Gompers]] argued that industrial monopolies were unnatural economic institutions which suppressed the competition which was necessary for progress and improvement.<ref>Samuel Gompers. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IuQkHAAACAAJ Labor and antitrust legislation. The facts, theory and argument: a brief and appeal]''. Amer.

Presidents such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[William Howard Taft]] supported [[trust-busting]]. During their presidencies, the otherwise-conservative Taft brought down 90 trusts in four years while Roosevelt took down 44 in seven and a half years in office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kolasky|first=William|title=Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft: Marching Toward Armageddon|url=http://www.wilmerhale.com/files/Publication/cd677ad9-b23f-446e-baea-cdcd7d707932/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/a0605093-e43a-41be-bbe7-d07e800d543f/Theodore%20Roosevelt%20and%20William%20Howard%20Taft%20Marching%20Toward%20Armageddon.pdf|work=Antitrust, Vol. 25, No. 2, Spring 2011|publisher=the American Bar Association|access-date=5 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Regulation ===
Progressives such as Benjamin Parke De Witt argued that in a modern [[economy]], large corporations and even monopolies were both inevitable and desirable.{{sfn|Gompers|McBride|Green|1916|p=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.166536/page/n147 129]}} With their massive resources and economies of scale, large corporations offered the United States advantages which smaller companies could not offer. However, these large corporations might abuse their great power. The federal government should allow these companies to exist, but otherwise regulate them for the public interest. President Roosevelt generally supported this idea and was later to incorporate it as part of his "[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]".

== Social work ==
Progressives set up training programs to ensure that welfare and charity work would be undertaken by trained professionals rather than warm-hearted amateurs.<ref>Mina Carson, ''Settlement Folk: Social Thought and the American Settlement Movement, 1885–1930'' (1990)</ref>

[[Jane Addams]] of Chicago's [[Hull House]] typified the leadership of residential, community centers operated by social workers and volunteers and located in inner city [[slum]]s. The purpose of the settlement houses was to raise the [[standard of living]] of urbanites by providing adult education and cultural enrichment programs.<ref>Judith Ann Trolander, "Hull-House and the Settlement House Movement: A Centennial Reassessment," ''Journal of Urban History'' 1991 17(4): 410–20</ref>

=== Anti-prostitution ===
During this era of massive reformation among all social aspects, elimination of prostitution was vital for the progressives, especially the women.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Connelly |first1=Mark Thomas |title=The Response to Prostitution in the Progressive Era |date=1980 |publisher=The University of South Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-1424-6}}</ref>

=== Enactment of child labor laws ===
{{main|Child labor laws in the United States}}
[[File:A poster highlighting situation of child labor in USA in early 20th century (10).jpg|thumb|A poster highlighting the situation of child labor in the United States in the early 20th century]]
Child labor laws were designed to prevent the overuse of children in the newly emerging industries. The goal of these laws was to give [[working class]] children the opportunity to go to school and mature more institutionally, thereby liberating the potential of humanity and encouraging the advancement of humanity. Factory owners generally did not want this progression because of lost workers. They used [[Charles Dickens]] as a symbol that the working conditions spark imagination. This initiative failed, with child labor laws being enacted anyway.<ref>Walter I. Trattner, ''Crusade for the Children: A History of the National Child Labor Committee and Child Labor Reform in America'' (1970)</ref><ref>Hugh D. Hindman, ''Child Labor: An American History'' (2002). 431 pp.</ref>

=== Support for the goals of organized labor ===
Labor unions grew steadily until 1916, then expanded fast during the war. In 1919, a wave of major strikes alienated the middle class and the strikes were lost which alienated the workers. In the 1920s, the unions were in the doldrums. In 1924, they supported [[Robert M. La Follette]]'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|Progressive Party]], but he only carried his base in Wisconsin. The [[American Federation of Labor]] under [[Samuel Gompers]] after 1907 began supporting the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], who promised more favorable judges as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] appointed pro-business judges. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his third party also supported such goals as the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]], improved safety and health conditions in factories, [[workers' compensation]] laws and [[minimum wage]] laws for women.<ref>Julie Greene, ''Pure and Simple Politics: The American Federation of Labor and Political Activism, 1881–1917'' (1998)</ref>

=== Prohibition ===
Most progressives, especially in rural areas, adopted the cause of [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]].<ref>James H. Timberlake, ''Prohibition and the Progressive Movement, 1900–1920'' (1970)</ref> They saw the saloon as political corruption incarnate and bewailed the damage done to women and children. They believed the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] limited mankind's potential for advancement.<ref>Norman H. Clark, ''Deliver Us from Evil: An Interpretation of American Prohibition'' (1976)</ref> Progressives achieved success first with state laws then with the enactment of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1919. The golden day did not dawn as enforcement was lax, especially in the cities where the law had very limited popular support and where notorious criminal gangs such as the Chicago gang of [[Al Capone]] made a crime spree based on illegal sales of liquor in speakeasies. The "experiment" (as President [[Herbert Hoover]] called it) also cost the treasury large sums of taxes and the 18th amendment was repealed by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1933.<ref>Daniel Okrent, ''Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Last-Call-Rise-Fall-Prohibition/dp/074327704X/ excerpt and text search]</ref>

=== Eugenics ===
Some progressives sponsored [[eugenics]] as a solution to excessively large or under-performing families, hoping that [[birth control]] would enable parents to focus their resources on fewer, better children.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era.|last=Thomas|first=Leonard|year=2005|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=19|issue=4|pages=207–224|doi=10.1257/089533005775196642|doi-access=free}}</ref> Progressive leaders such as [[Herbert Croly]] and [[Walter Lippmann]] indicated their classical liberal concern over the danger posed to the individual by the practice of eugenics.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Reconstruction of American Liberalism, 1865–1914|url=https://archive.org/details/reconstructionam00cohe|url-access=limited|last=Cohen|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0807853542|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|page=[https://archive.org/details/reconstructionam00cohe/page/n257 243]}}</ref>

== Conservation ==
During the term of the progressive President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1901–1909) and influenced by the ideas of philosopher-scientists such as [[George Perkins Marsh]], [[William John McGee]], [[John Muir]], [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Lester Frank Ward]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/view/2348/2307 |title=Ross, John R.; Man Over Nature – Origins of the Conservation Movement |publisher=Journals.ku.edu |access-date=2012-05-14}}</ref> the largest government-funded conservation-related projects in United States history were undertaken.

=== National parks and wildlife refuges ===
{{further|Antiquities Act|National Park Service Organic Act|National Wildlife Refuge}}
On March 14, 1903, President Roosevelt created the first National Bird Preserve, the beginning of the Wildlife Refuge system, on Pelican Island, [[Florida]]. In all, by 1909, the Roosevelt administration had created an unprecedented 42 million acres (170,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of [[United States National Forest]]s, 53 [[National Wildlife Refuge]]s and 18 areas of "special interest" such as the [[Grand Canyon]].

=== Reclamation ===
In addition, Roosevelt approved the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 which gave subsidies for irrigation in 13 (eventually 20) Western states. Another conservation-oriented bill was the [[Antiquities Act]] of 1906 that protected large areas of land by allowing the president to declare areas meriting protection to be [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]]. The [[Inland Waterways Commission]] was appointed by Roosevelt on March 14, 1907 to study the river systems of the United States, including the development of water power, flood control and land reclamation.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/conConf.htm | title =Conservation Commissions and Conferences under the Roosevelt Administration 1901–1909 | publisher =Theodore Roosevelt Association | access-date =2011-11-19}}</ref>

== National politics ==
In the early 20th century, politicians of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] and [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] parties, [[Lincoln–Roosevelt League]] Republicans (in California) and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive ("Bull Moose") Party]] all pursued environmental, political and economic reforms. Chief among these aims was the pursuit of trust busting, the breaking up very large monopolies and support for labor unions, public health programs, decreased corruption in politics and environmental conservation.<ref>Buenker and Burnham (2006)</ref>

The progressive movement enlisted support from both major parties and from minor parties as well. One leader, the Democratic [[William Jennings Bryan]], had won both the Democratic Party and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] nominations in 1896. At the time, the great majority of other major leaders had been opposed to populism. When Roosevelt left the Republican Party in 1912, he took with him many of the intellectual leaders of progressivism, but very few political leaders.<ref>Lewis Gould, '' Four hats in the ring: the 1912 election and the birth of modern American Politics'' (2008)</ref> The Republican Party then became notably more committed to business-oriented and efficiency-oriented progressivism, typified by [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[William Howard Taft]].<ref>Joan Hoff Wilson, ''Herbert Hoover: Forgotten Progressive'' (1975)</ref>

== Culture ==
The foundation of the progressive tendency was indirectly linked to the unique philosophy of [[pragmatism]] which was primarily developed by [[John Dewey]] and [[William James]].<ref>Robert Brett Westbrook, ''John Dewey and American democracy'' (1991)</ref><ref name="The American Mind 1952">[[Henry Steele Commager]], ''The American Mind'' (1952)</ref>

Equally significant to progressive-era reform were the crusading journalists known as [[muckraker]]s. These journalists publicized to middle class readers economic privilege, political corruption and social injustice. Their articles appeared in ''[[McClure's Magazine]]'' and other reform periodicals. Some muckrakers focused on [[corporate abuses]]. [[Ida Tarbell]] exposed the activities of the [[Standard Oil Company]]. In ''[[The Shame of the Cities]]'' (1904), [[Lincoln Steffens]] dissected corruption in city government. In ''Following the Color Line'' (1908), [[Ray Stannard Baker]] criticized race relations. Other muckrakers assailed the [[United States Senate|Senate]], railroad companies, insurance companies and fraud in [[patent medicine]].<ref>Louis Filler, ''The Muckrakers'' (1976)</ref>

[[File:TheJungleSinclair.jpg|thumb|[[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' exposed Americans to the horrors of the Chicago meatpacking plants]]
Novelists criticized corporate injustices. [[Theodore Dreiser]] drew harsh portraits of a type of ruthless businessman in ''[[The Financier]]'' (1912) and ''[[The Titan (novel)|The Titan]]'' (1914). In ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906), [[socialism|Socialist]] [[Upton Sinclair]] repelled readers with descriptions of Chicago's meatpacking plants and his work led to support for remedial food safety legislation.

Leading intellectuals also shaped the progressive mentality. In ''Dynamic Sociology'' (1883), [[Lester Frank Ward]] laid out the philosophical foundations of the progressive movement and attacked the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies advocated by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]].<ref>Henry Steele Commager, ed., ''Lester Frank Ward and the Welfare State'' (1967)</ref> In ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'' (1899), [[Thorstein Veblen]] attacked the "conspicuous consumption" of the wealthy. Educator [[John Dewey]] emphasized a child-centered philosophy of pedagogy known as [[progressive education]] which affected schoolrooms for three generations.<ref>Buenker and Buenker, eds. ''Encyclopedia of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.'' (2005)</ref>

== In the 21st century ==
Progressivism in the 21st century is significantly different from the historical progressivism of the 19th–20th centuries. According to Princeton economics professor [[Thomas C. Leonard]], "[a]t a glance, there is not much here for 21st-century progressives to claim kinship with. Today’s progressives emphasize racial equality and minority rights, decry U.S. imperialism, shun biological ideas in social science, and have little use for piety or proselytizing". However, both historical progressivism and the modern movement shares the notion that the free markets lead to economic inequalities that must be ameliorated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-dark-heart-of-progressivism/|title='The Dark Heart of Progressivism' by Matthew Harwood (Interview with Princeton economics professor)|last=Thomas C.|first=Leonard|date=29 September 2016|website=The American Conservative|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>

==== Wall Street reform ====
Progressives began to demand stronger Wall Street regulation after they perceived deregulation and relaxed enforcement as leading to the [[financial crisis of 2008]]. Passing the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] financial regulatory act in 2010 provided increased oversight on financial institutions and the creation of new regulatory agencies, but many progressives argue its broad framework allows for financial institutions to continue to take advantage of consumers and the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&sid=88108dc0-09f3-4a5e-8a86-69dcfaace012@sessionmgr4009&hid=4108|title=Fighting for Wall Street Regulation: Who Said It Was Easy?: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-19}}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Among others, [[Bernie Sanders]] has advocated to reimplement [[Glass-Steagall]] for its stricter regulation and to break up the banks because of financial institutions' market share being concentrated in fewer corporations than progressives would like.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://berniesanders.com/yes-glass-steagall-matters-here-are-5-reasons-why/|title=5 Reasons Glass-Steagall Matters – Bernie Sanders|date=2015-11-16|newspaper=Bernie Sanders|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520012951/https://berniesanders.com/yes-glass-steagall-matters-here-are-5-reasons-why/|archive-date=2017-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-street/|title=Reforming Wall Street – Bernie Sanders|newspaper=Bernie Sanders|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221015519/https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-street/|archive-date=2018-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Health care reform ===
[[File:Bernie Sanders in March 2020.jpg|thumb|upright=.66|Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], an advocate of [[single-payer healthcare]]]]
In 2009, the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] (CPC) outlined five key healthcare principles they intended to pass into law. The CPC mandated a nationwide public option, affordable health insurance, insurance market regulations, an employer insurance provision mandate and comprehensive services for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/health-care-reform/cpc-releases-health-care-principles/|title=Congressional Progressive Caucus : Health Care Reform : CPC Releases Health Care Principles|website=cpc-grijalva.house.gov|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref> In March 2010, Congress passed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] which was intended to increase the affordability and efficiency of the [[Health care in the United States|United States healthcare]] system.

Modern progressives advocate for strong environmental protections and measures to reduce or eliminate pollution. One reason for this is the strong link between economic injustice and adverse environmental conditions as groups that are economically marginalized tend to be disproportionately affected by the harms of pollution and environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice|title=Environmental Justice|first=OA|last=US EPA|date=November 3, 2014|website=US EPA}}</ref>

=== Definition ===
With the rise in popularity of self-proclaimed progressives such as [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Andrew Yang]], the term ''progressive'' began to carry greater cultural currency, particularly in the [[2016 Democratic primaries]]. While answering a question from [[CNN]] moderator [[Anderson Cooper]] regarding her willingness to shift positions during an October 2015 debate, [[Hillary Clinton]] referred to herself as a "progressive who likes to get things done", drawing the ire of a number of Sanders supporters and other critics from her left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/583116/hillary-clinton-flipflop-charge-im-progressive-but-im-progressive-who-likes-things-done|title=Hillary Clinton on flip-flop charge: 'I'm a progressive, but I'm a progressive who likes to get things done'|date=13 October 2015|website=[[The Week]] |access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref> Questions about the precise meaning of the term have persisted within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and without since the election of [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election]], with some candidates using it to indicate their affiliation with the left flank of the party. ''Progressive'' and ''progressivism'' are [[essentially contested concepts]], with different groups and individuals defining the terms in different and sometimes contradictory ways towards different and sometimes contradictory ends.

== Progressive parties ==
Following the first progressive movement of the early 20th century, two later short-lived parties have also identified as progressive.

=== Progressive Party, 1912 ===
{{Main|Progressive Party (United States, 1912)}}
The first political party named the Progressive Party was formed for the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]] to elect [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-02-13|title=Transforming American Democracy: TR and The Bull Moose Campaign of 1912 {{!}} Miller Center|url=https://millercenter.org/transforming-american-democracy-tr-and-bull-moose-campaign-1912|access-date=2020-11-14|website=millercenter.org|language=en}}</ref> It was formed after Roosevelt lost his bid to become the republican candidate to [[William Howard Taft]], and became defunct by 1920.

=== Progressive Party, 1924 ===
{{main|Progressive Party (United States, 1924)}}
In 1924, Wisconsin Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket. La Follette won the support of labor unions, Germans and socialists by his crusade. He carried only Wisconsin and the party vanished outside [[Wisconsin Progressive Party|Wisconsin]].<ref>David P. Thelen, ''Robert M. La Follette and the insurgent spirit'' (1976)</ref> There, it remained a force until the 1940s.

=== Progressive Party, 1948 ===
{{main|Progressive Party (United States, 1948)}}
A third party was initiated in 1948 by former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] as a vehicle for his campaign for president. He saw the two parties as reactionary and war-mongering, and attracted support from left-wing voters who opposed the [[Cold War]] policies that had become a national consensus. Most liberals, New Dealers and especially the Congress of Industrial Organizations, denounced the party because in their view it was increasingly controlled by "Communists". It faded away after winning 2% of the vote in 1948.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas W.
