== Origin of the term ==
Although sexual attitudes tracing back to [[Ancient Greece]] (8th to 6th centuries BC to the end of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] (ca. 600 AD) have been termed homophobia by scholars, and it is used to describe an intolerance towards homosexuality and homosexuals that grew during the Middle Ages, especially by adherents of [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]],<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Eric|title=Homophobia (psychology and society)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1758377/homophobia|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> the term itself is relatively new.<ref name="Herek 2004">{{cite journal |last=Herek |first=Gregory M. |date=April 2004 |title=Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Herek_2004_SRSP.pdf |journal=  Sexuality Research and Social Policy|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=6–24 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6|s2cid=145788359 }}</ref>

Conceptualizing anti-LGBT prejudice as a [[social issues|social problem]] worthy of scholarly attention was not new.  A 1969 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described examples of negative attitudes toward homosexuality as "homophobia", including "a mixture of revulsion and apprehension" which some called ''[[homosexual panic]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Behavior: The Homosexual: Newly Visible, Newly Understood|journal=Time|date=October 1969|volume=94|issue=18|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,839116-1,00.html}}</ref> In 1971, Kenneth Smith used ''homophobia'' as a personality profile to describe the psychological aversion to homosexuality.<ref name=Smith1971>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Kenneth T |year=1971 |title=Homophobia: a tentative personality profile |journal=Psychological Reports |pages=1091–4 |volume=29 |issue=3 |oclc=100640283 |pmid=5139344 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1971.29.3f.1091 |s2cid=13323120 }}</ref> Weinberg also used it this way in his 1972 book ''Society and the Healthy Homosexual'',<ref name=Weinberg1972>{{cite book |title=Society and the healthy homosexual |last=Weinberg |first=George |year=1973 |publisher=Garden City, New York Anchor Press Doubleday & Co |isbn=978-0-385-05083-8 |orig-year=1972 |oclc=434538701 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/societyhealthyho00wein }}</ref> published one year before the [[American Psychiatric Association]] voted to remove homosexuality from its list of [[mental disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Recalling APA's Historic Step |url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |first=Alfred M |last=Freedman |periodical=APA News |date=September 1, 2000 |accessdate=2010-08-21 |issn=0033-2704 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203759/http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |archive-date=November 21, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=Macionis2005>{{cite book|last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |year=2005 |title=Sociology: a global introduction |first2=Kenneth |last2=Plummer |edition=3 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-128746-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4z3GgAgMFYC |page=332}}</ref> Weinberg's term became an important tool for gay and lesbian activists, advocates, and their allies.<ref name="Herek 2004"/> He describes the concept as a medical [[phobia]]:<ref name=Weinberg1972 />

In 1981, ''homophobia'' was used for the first time in ''[[The Times]]'' (of London) to report that the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] voted to refuse to condemn homosexuality.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Times|title=Homosexuality best seen as a handicap, Dr Runcie says|date=February 28, 1981|author=Clifford Longley|author-link = Clifford Longley|quote=Let us recognize where the problem lies&nbsp;– in the dislike and distaste felt by many heterosexuals for homosexuals, a problem we have come to call ''homophobia''.|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02-008&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02 | location=London}} and {{cite news|title=New light on Archbishop of Canterbury's view on homosexuality |last=Gledhill |first=Ruth |date=August 7, 2008 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4474226.ece | location=London}}</ref>

However, when taken literally, ''homophobia'' may be a problematic term. Professor David A. F. Haaga says that contemporary usage includes "a wide range of negative emotions, attitudes and behaviours toward homosexual people," which are characteristics that are not consistent with accepted definitions of phobias, that of "an intense, illogical, or abnormal fear of a specified thing." Five key differences are listed as distinguishing homophobia, as often used, from a true phobia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plummer |first1=David |title=One of the boys |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=NY, NY |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h4GDAAAQBAJ&q=why+%22homophobia%22+literal+meaning&pg=PT308 |accessdate=15 August 2019|isbn=9781317712121 }}</ref>

In 1992, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], recognizing the power of the stigma against homosexuality, issued the following statement, reaffirmed by the Board of Trustees, July 2011:
"Whereas homosexuality ''per se'' implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) calls on all international health organizations, psychiatric organizations, and individual psychiatrists in other countries to urge the repeal in their own countries of legislation that penalizes homosexual acts by consenting adults in private. Further, APA calls on these organizations and individuals to do all that is possible to decrease the stigma related to homosexuality wherever and whenever it may occur."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.org/ps2011homosexuality |publisher=American Psychiatric Association|title=Position Statement on Homosexuality }}</ref>

Many world religions contain anti-homosexual teachings, while other religions have varying degrees of ambivalence, neutrality, or incorporate teachings that regard homosexuals as [[third gender]]. Even within some religions which generally discourage homosexuality, there are also people who view homosexuality positively, and some [[religious denomination]]s bless or conduct [[same-sex marriages]].

===== Christianity and the Bible =====
{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality|The Bible and homosexuality}}
Passages commonly interpreted as condemning homosexuality or same-gender sexual relations are found in both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments of the [[Bible]]. [[Leviticus]] 18:22, says "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." The destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] is also commonly seen as a condemnation of homosexuality. Christians and Jews who oppose homosexuality often cite such passages; historical context and interpretation is more complicated. Scholarly debate over the interpretation of these passages has focused on placing them in proper historical context, for instance pointing out that Sodom's sins are historically interpreted as being other than homosexuality, and on the translation of rare or unusual words in the passages in question. In ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex". She states that the Bible has no condemnation for "loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships" and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/|title=The "Gay" Princess Di Bible|date=2 December 2008}}</ref> This view is opposed by a number of conservative evangelicals,<ref>{{cite web |title=HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONS and the BIBLE |url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Homosex_versus_the_Bible.html |website=Peace by Jesus |accessdate=15 August 2019}}</ref> including [[Robert A.

In some cases, the distinction between religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia is not clear, a key example being territories under [[Islamic]] authority. All major [[Islamic sects]] [[Homosexuality and Islam|forbid homosexuality]], which is a crime under [[Sharia Law]] and treated as such in most [[Muslim]] countries. In [[Afghanistan]], for instance, homosexuality carried the death penalty under the [[Taliban]]. After their fall, homosexuality was reduced from a capital crime to one that is punished with fines and prison sentences. The legal situation in the [[United Arab Emirates]], however, is unclear.

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], homosexuality was considered [[sodomy]] and it was punishable by death. Persecutions reached their height during the [[Medieval Inquisition]]s, when the sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were accused of [[fornication]] and sodomy, alongside accusations of [[Satanism]]. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=G. |last1=Legman |title=The Guilt of the Templars |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=1966 |page=11 }}</ref> The theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] was influential in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of [[natural law]], arguing that "special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices."<ref name="civ2">{{cite book |last1=Crompton |first1=Louis |title=Homosexuality and Civilization |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03006-0 |page=187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&pg=PA187 }}</ref>

Researcher Iain R. Williamson, in his 1998 paper "Internalized Homophobia and Health Issues Affecting Lesbians and Gay Men" finds the term ''homophobia'' to be "highly problematic" but for reasons of continuity and consistency with the majority of other publications on the issue retains its use rather than using more accurate but obscure terminology.<ref name=pmid10788206/> The phrase ''internalized sexual stigma'' is sometimes used in place to represent internalized homophobia.<!-- This sentence is grammatically awkward. I'm not sure how to phrase it better though. --><ref name="apa" /> An internalized stigma arises when a person believes negative stereotypes about themselves, regardless of where the stereotypes come from. It can also refer to many stereotypes beyond sexuality and [[gender role]]s. Internalized homophobia can cause discomfort with and disapproval of one's own [[sexual orientation]]. [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] or [[egodystonic]] homophobia, for instance, is a condition characterized by having a sexual orientation or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized [[self-image]], causing [[anxiety]] and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation. Such a situation may cause extreme repression of homosexual desires.<ref name=Adams96 /> In other cases, a conscious internal struggle may occur for some time, often pitting deeply held religious or social beliefs against strong sexual and emotional desires. This discordance can cause [[clinical depression]], and a higher rate of [[suicide among LGBT youth]] (up to 30 percent of [[non-heterosexual]] youth attempt suicide) has been attributed to this phenomenon.<ref name=Gonsiorek>{{cite journal |last1=Gonsiorek |first1=John C. |title=Mental health issues of gay and lesbian adolescents |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health Care |date=March 1988 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=114–122 |doi=10.1016/0197-0070(88)90057-5 |pmid=3283088 }}</ref> Psychotherapy, such as [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]], and participation in a sexual-minority affirming group can help resolve the internal conflicts, such as between religious beliefs and sexual identity.<ref name=apa /> Even informal therapies that address understanding and accepting of non-heterosexual orientations can prove effective.<ref name=Gonsiorek /> Many diagnostic "Internalized Homophobia Scales" can be used to measure a person's discomfort with their sexuality and some can be used by people regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Critics of the scales note that they presume a discomfort with non-heterosexuality which in itself enforces heternormativity.<ref name=Adams96>{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Henry E. |last2=Wright |first2=Lester W. |last3=Lohr |first3=Bethany A. |title=Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal? |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |date=August 1996 |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=440–445 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.105.3.440 |pmid=8772014 |lay-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202035152/http://www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html |s2cid=8349682 |s2cid-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |doi=10.4135/9781483326757.n10 |chapter=Internalized Homophobia: Conceptual and Empirical Issues in Measurement |title=Lesbian and Gay Psychology: Theory, Research, and Clinical Applications |year=1994 |last1=Shidlo |first1=Ariel |pages=176–205 |isbn=9780803953123 }}</ref>

=== Social homophobia ===
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:RyanHalligan.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Suicide of Ryan Halligan|Ryan Halligan]] committed suicide due to bullying which included receiving homophobic messages]] -->
The fear of being identified as gay can be considered as a form of social homophobia. Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay. Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title= Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs}}</ref><ref name=PBS>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref> For this reason, homophobia is allegedly rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters that is considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] male, such as [[association football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change|title= Fans' culture hard to change}}</ref>

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobic thoughts and feelings does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person. This interpretation alludes to the idea that a person may posit violent opposition to "the Other" as a means of establishing their own identity as part of the majority and thus gaining social validation.

Nancy J. Chodorow states that homophobia can be viewed as a method of protection of male masculinity.<ref>Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]</ref>

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].<ref>West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-8166-0812-1}}</ref>

In some cases, the works of authors who merely have the word "Gay" in their name ([[Gay Talese]], [[Peter Gay]]) or works about things also contain the name (''[[Enola Gay]]'') have been destroyed because of a perceived pro-homosexual bias.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Petras |first1=Kathryn |last2=Petras|first2=Ross|title=Unusually Stupid Americans (A compendium of all American Stupidity)|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780965806879 |url-access=registration |year=2003|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9658068-7-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780965806879/page/103 103]}}</ref>

In the United States, attitudes about people who are homosexual may vary on the basis of partisan identification. [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] are far more likely than [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] to have negative attitudes about people who are gay and lesbian, according to surveys conducted by the [[National Election Studies]] from 2000 through 2004. This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or [[conservatism]] with respect to the traditional family.<ref>{{cite book|title=Democrats and Republicans—rhetoric and reality : comparing the voters in statistics and anecdotes |last=Fried |first=Joseph |year=2008 |publisher=Algora Pub |isbn=978-0-87586-605-5 |page=185|oclc=183179592 }}</ref>

In a 1998 address, author, activist, and [[civil rights]] leader [[Coretta Scott King]] stated that "Homophobia is like racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood."<ref>Chicago Defender, April 1, 1998, front page</ref> One study of white adolescent males conducted at the [[University of Cincinnati]] by Janet Baker{{which one|date=October 2020}} has been used to argue that negative feelings towards gay people are also associated with other [[discriminatory]] behaviors.<ref name=jetstudy>{{cite news|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0rkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12|title= Homophobia, racism likely companions, study shows|work= Jet|date= January 10, 1994|page=12|publisher= Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref> According to the study, hatred of gay people, [[anti-Semitism]], and [[racism]] are "likely companions."<ref name=jetstudy /> Baker hypothesized "maybe it's a matter of power and looking down on all you think are at the bottom."<ref name=jetstudy /> A study performed in 2007 in the UK for the charity Stonewall reports that up to 90 percent of the population support [[anti-discrimination laws]] protecting gay and lesbian people.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,,2086335,00.html |title=Majority support gay equality rights, poll finds|date=May 23, 2007|newspaper=Guardian | location=London | first=Hugh | last=Muir | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

There are at least two studies which indicate that homophobia may have a negative economic impact for the countries where it is widespread. In these countries there is a [[Queer migration|flight]] of their LGBT populations —with the consequent loss of talent—, as well as an avoidance of [[LGBT tourism]], that leaves the [[pink money]] in LGBT-friendlier countries. As an example, LGBT tourists contribute 6,800&nbsp;million dollars every year to the [[Spanish economy]].<ref name="Smith">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=David |title=The Hidden Cost of Homophobia in Africa |url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/in-the-news/the-hidden-cost-of-homophobia-in-africa/ |website=the Williams institute |language=en |access-date=26 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626200006/https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/in-the-news/the-hidden-cost-of-homophobia-in-africa/ |archive-date=26 June 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As soon as 2005, an editorial from the ''[[New York Times]]'' related the politics of ''[[don't ask, don't tell]]'' in the [[US Army]] with the lack of translators from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and with the delay in the translation of Arabic documents, calculated to be about 120,000 hours at the time. Since 1998, with the introduction of the new policy, about 20 Arabic translators had been expelled from the Army, specifically during the years the US was involved in wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Price of Homophobia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/20/opinion/the-price-of-homophobia.html |access-date=10 December 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=20 January 2005}}</ref>

M. V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], presented in March 2014 in a meeting of the [[World Bank]] the results of a study about the economical impact of homophobia in [[India]]. Only in health expenses, caused by depression, suicide, and [[HIV]] treatment, India would have spent additional 23,100 million dollars due to homophobia. On top, there would be costs caused by violence, workplace loss, rejection of the family, and bullying at school, that would result in a lower education level, lower productivity, lower wages, worse health, and a lower life expectancy among the LGBT population.<ref name="Alimi">{{cite web|last=Alimi |first=Adebisi |title=The development costs of homophobia |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/development-policy/development-costs-homophobia-302899 |language=en |date=19 June 2014 |access-date=10 December 2015}}</ref> In total, she estimated for 2014 in India a loss of up to 30,800 million dollars, or 1,7 % of the Indian [[GDP]].<ref name="Smith"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Badgett |first=M.V.

The LGBT activist Adebisi Alimi, in a preliminary estimation, has calculated that the economic loss due to homophobia in [[Nigeria]] is about 1% of its GDP. Taking into account that in 2015 homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 54 African countries, the money loss due to homophobia in the continent could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars every year.<ref name="Smith"/>

Another study regarding socioecological measurement of homophobia and its public health impact for 158 countries was conducted in 2018. It found that the prejudice against gay people has a worldwide economic cost of $119.1 billion. Economical loss in Asia was 88.29 billion dollars due to homophobia, and in Latin America & the Caribbean it was 8.04 billion dollars. Economical cost in East Asia and Middle Asia was 10.85 billion dollars. Economical cost in Middle East and North Africa was 16.92 billion dollars. The researcher suggested that a 1% decrease in the level of homophobia is associated with a 10% increase in the gross domestic product per capita.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamontagne |first1=Erik |last2=d’Elbée |first2=Marc |last3=Ross |first3=Michael W |last4=Carroll |first4=Aengus |last5=Plessis |first5=André du |last6=Loures |first6=Luiz |title=A socioecological measurement of homophobia for all countries and its public health impact |journal=European Journal of Public Health |date=3 March 2018 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=967–972 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky023 |pmid=29514190 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

A newer study from March 2018 done by [[Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy|The Williams Institute]] ([[UCLA]] School of Law) concludes that there is a positive correlation between LGBT inclusion and GDP per capita.

Most international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994, the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] has also ruled that such laws violated the [[right to privacy]] guaranteed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In 2008, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] issued a statement which "urges States to do away with criminal penalties against [homosexual persons]." The statement, however, was addressed to reject a resolution by the UN Assembly that would have precisely called for an end of penalties against homosexuals in the world.<ref name="vatican.va">{{cite web|url= https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html|title= Statement of the Holy See Delegation at the 63rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity|date=18 December 2008|publisher=vatican.va}}</ref> In March 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, described by CoE Secretary General as the first legal instrument in the world dealing specifically with one of the most long-lasting and difficult forms of discrimination to combat.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Council of Europe to advance human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons |publisher=Council of Europe |date=1 April 2010 |url=https://rm.coe.int/168071fd86 |accessdate=October 16, 2020 }}</ref>

To combat homophobia, the LGBT community uses events such as [[gay pride parade]]s and [[political activism]] (''See [[gay pride]]).'' In August 2019, the [[Pride in London]] community took a different initiative to “show solidarity with the LGBT+ community” and colored the crossings in rainbow colors for the annual parades. The first permanent crossings have been put on roads in [[Lambeth]]. Others were painted in [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/49394056|title=The UK's first rainbow crossing|accessdate=20 August 2019|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

In addition to public expression, legislation has been designed, controversially, to oppose homophobia, as in [[hate speech]], [[hate crime]], and laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Successful preventative strategies against homophobic prejudice and bullying in schools have included teaching pupils about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/26/gay-history-lessons-bullying-schools |title=Lessons on gay history cut homophobic bullying in north London school |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |first=Jessica |last=Shepherd}}</ref>

Some argue that anti-LGBT prejudice is immoral and goes above and beyond the effects on that class of people. Warren J. Blumenfeld argues that this emotion gains a dimension beyond itself, as a tool for extreme right-wing conservatives and fundamentalist religious groups and as a restricting factor on gender-relations as to the weight associated with performing each role accordingly.<ref name=Blumenfeld1992>{{cite book|title=Homophobia : how we all pay the price |url=https://archive.org/details/homophobia00warr |url-access=registration |last=Blumenfeld |first=Warren J |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-7919-5 |oclc=24544734 }}</ref> Furthermore, Blumenfeld in particular stated:

Drawing upon research by [[Arizona State University]] Professor Elizabeth Segal, [[University of Memphis]] professors Robin Lennon-Dearing and Elena Delavega argued in a 2016 article published in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]'' that homophobia could be reduced through exposure (learning about LGBT experiences), explanation (understanding the different challenges faced by LGBT people), and experience (putting themselves in situations experienced by LGBT people by working alongside LGBT co-workers or volunteering at an LGBT community center).<ref name="journaldosocialworkersapply">{{cite journal|last1=Delavega|first1=Elena|last2=Lennon-Dearing|first2=Robin|title=Do Social Workers Apply "Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself" to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transpersons in the South?|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2016|volume=63|issue=9|pages=1171–1193|doi=10.1080/00918369.2016.1150058|pmid=26849856|s2cid=205471075}}</ref>

== Criticism of meaning and purpose ==
=== Distinctions and proposed alternatives ===
Researchers have proposed alternative terms to describe prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. Some of these alternatives show more [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]] while others do not include -''[[phobia]]'':

*''Homoerotophobia'', being a possible precursor term to ''homophobia'', was coined by Wainwright Churchill and documented in ''Homosexual Behavior Among Males'' in 1967.
*The etymology of ''homophobia'' citing the union of ''homos'' and ''phobos'' is the basis for [[LGBT history|LGBT historian]] Boswell's criticism of the term and for his suggestion in 1980 of the alternative ''homosexophobia''.<ref name = BOS1980>{{cite book|title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: Gay people in Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century |url=https://archive.org/details/christianitysoci00bosw |url-access=registration |first=John |last=Boswell |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1980}}</ref>
*''Homonegativity'' is based on the term ''homonegativism'' used by Hudson and Ricketts in a 1980 paper; they coined the term for their research in order to avoid ''homophobia'', which they regarded as being unscientific in its presumption of motivation.<ref name=Hudson1980>{{cite journal|title=A strategy for the measurement of homophobia |last1=Hudson |first1=WW |last2=Ricketts |first2=WA |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |pages=357–72 |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=1980 |oclc=115532547 |doi=10.1300/J082v05n04_02 |pmid=7204951 }}</ref>
*''[[Heterosexism]]'' refers to a system of negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favour of opposite-sex sexual orientation and relationships.<ref name="JungSmith">{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|author2=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-7914-1696-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/heterosexismethi0000jung}}</ref><sup> p.&nbsp;13</sup> It can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[norm (sociology)|norm]]{{fact|date=October 2020}} and therefore superior.
*''Sexual prejudice'' – Researcher at the [[University of California, Davis]] [[Gregory M. Herek]] preferred ''sexual prejudice'' as being descriptive, free of presumptions about motivations, and lacking value judgments as to the irrationality or immorality of those so labeled.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Herek GM |title=The context of anti-gay violence: Notes on cultural and psychological heterosexism |journal=J Interpers Violence |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=316–333 |year=1990 |doi=10.1177/088626090005003006 |s2cid=145678459 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herek |first1=Gregory M. |title=The Psychology of Sexual Prejudice |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2000 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=19–22 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00051 |s2cid=36963920 }}</ref> He compared ''homophobia'', ''heterosexism'', and ''sexual prejudice'', and, in preferring the third term, noted that ''homophobia'' was "probably more widely used and more often criticized." He also observed that "Its critics note that homophobia implicitly suggests that antigay attitudes are best understood as an irrational fear and that they represent a form of individual [[psychopathology]] rather than a socially reinforced prejudice."

==== Non-neutral phrasing ====
Use of ''homophobia'', ''homophobic'', and ''homophobe'' has been criticized as [[pejorative]] against [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights opponents]]. [[behavioral science|Behavioral scientists]] [[William O'Donohue]] and Christine Caselles stated in 1993 that "as [''homophobia''] is usually used, [it] makes an illegitimately pejorative evaluation of certain open and debatable value positions, much like the former disease construct of homosexuality" itself, arguing that the term may be used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument against those who advocate values or positions of which the user does not approve.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=William |last1=O'Donohue|first2=Christine |last2=Caselles |title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues |journal=J Psychopathol Behav Assess |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=September 1993 |doi=10.1007/BF01371377 |pages=177–195|s2cid=144801673}}</ref> Philosopher Gary Colwell stated in 1999 that "the boundary of the term 'homophobia' is made so elastic that it can stretch around, not just phobias, but every kind of rational fear as well; and not just around every kind of fear, but also around every critical posture or idea that anyone may have about the practice of homosexuality".<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gary Colwell|title=Turning the Tables with 'Homophobia' |journal=[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]|volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=207–222 |date=1999|jstor = 24354374|doi=10.1111/1468-5930.00124 }}</ref>

In 2012 the [[Associated Press Stylebook]] was revised to advise against using non-clinical words with the suffix -phobia, including homophobia, in "political and social contexts." AP Deputy Standards Editor Dave Minthorn said the word homophobia suggests a severe mental disorder, and that it could be substituted with "anti-gay" or similar phrasing.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP nixes 'homophobia', 'ethnic cleansing'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/11/ap-nixes-homophobia-ethnic-cleansing-150315.html|last=Byers|first=Dylan|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Words with negative power|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-05/news/ct-oped-1205-page-20121205_1_homophobia-islamophobia-fear|first=Clarence|last=Page|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=5 December 2012|work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> The AP's decision was criticized in some media outlets, especially those in the [[Gay media|LGBT area]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Huffington Post discussion|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/05/associated-press-ban-homophobia-discussion_n_2245697.html|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=5 December 2012|first=Noah|last=Michelson}}</ref> who argued that homophobia did not necessarily have to be interpreted in a strict clinical sense.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-ap-homophobia-style-book-20121128,0,2905541.story|title=No more 'homophobia'?

Francoeur{{pn|date=October 2020}}</ref> To date, the existence or extent of heterophobia is mostly unrecognized by sexologists.<ref name="noonan1999" /> Beyond sexology there is no consensus as to the meaning of the term because it is also used to mean "fear of the opposite" such as in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]'s ''The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and Its Doubles'' (2001).

Referring to the debate on both meaning and use, [[State University of New York|SUNY]] lecturer Raymond J. Noonan, in his 1999 presentation to The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS) and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) Conference,<ref name="noonan1999">{{cite web|url=http://home.bway.net/rjnoonan/Conf1999.html|title=Heterophobia: The Evolution of an Idea|author=Raymond J. Noonan|date=November 6, 1999|publisher=Dr. Ray Noonan’s 1999 Conference Presentations|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref> states:
<blockquote>
The term heterophobia is confusing for some people for several reasons. On the one hand, some look at it as just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.</blockquote>

Stephen M. White and Louis R. Franzini introduced the related term ''heteronegativism'' to refer to the considerable range of negative feelings that some gay individuals may hold and express toward heterosexuals. This term is preferred to ''heterophobia'' because it does not imply extreme or irrational fear.<ref name="Franzini">{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=Stephen M. |last2=Franzini |first2=Louis R. |title=Heteronegativism: The Attitudes of Gay Men and Lesbians Toward Heterosexuals |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |date=24 February 1999 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=65–79 |doi=10.1300/J082v37n01_05 |pmid=10203070 }}</ref>
