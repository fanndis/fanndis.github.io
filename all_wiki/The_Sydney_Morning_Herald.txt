==History==
[[File:First smh cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of the newspaper's first edition, on 18 April 1831]]
[[File:Herald Office, Sydney (3003586345).jpg|thumb|Sydney Morning Herald building on the corner of Pitt and Hunter Streets, built 1856, demolished in the 1920s for a larger building]]
In 1831 three employees of the now-defunct ''[[Sydney Gazette]]'', Ward Stephens, Frederick Stokes and [[William McGarvie]], founded ''The Sydney Herald''. In 1931 a Centenary Supplement (since digitised) was published.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/gj1ymc/centenary%20%281%29.pdf|title=The Sydney Morning Herald Centenary Supplement 1831 - April 18th - 1931|date=1831|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=20 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921181405/http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/gj1ymc/centenary%20%281%29.pdf|archive-date=21 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The original four-page weekly had a print run of 750. In 1840, the newspaper began to publish daily. In 1841, an Englishman named [[John Fairfax]] purchased the operation, renaming it ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Sydney-Morning-Herald|title=The Sydney Morning Herald {{!}} Australian newspaper|work=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|access-date=4 September 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904212804/https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Sydney-Morning-Herald|archive-date=4 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Fairfax, whose family were to control the newspaper for almost 150 years, based his editorial policies "upon principles of candour, honesty and honour. We have no wish to mislead; no interest to gratify by unsparing abuse or indiscriminate approbation."

During the 1890s [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]], who invented a predecessor of the [[teleprinter]], worked there.<ref name="ATM-C">[http://oztypewriter.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/new-zealands-donald-murray-father-of.html New Zealand’s Donald Murray: The Father of the Remote Typewriter], Australian Typewriter Museum, [[Canberra]], 9 March 2012; accessed 10 March 2012</ref>

The ''SMH'' was late to the trend of printing news rather than just advertising on the front page, doing so from 15 April 1944. Of the country's metropolitan dailies, only ''[[The West Australian]]'' was later in making the switch. In 1949, the newspaper launched a Sunday edition, ''The Sunday Herald''. Four years later, this was merged with the newly acquired ''Sun'' newspaper to create ''The Sun-Herald'', which continues to this day.

By the mid-1960s a new competitor had appeared in Rupert Murdoch's national daily The Australian, which was first published on 15 July 1964.

In 1995, the company launched the newspaper's web edition ''smh.com.au''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/|title=Australian Breaking News Headlines & World News Online|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=23 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223223429/http://www.smh.com.au/|archive-date=23 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The site has since grown to include interactive and multimedia features beyond the content in the print edition. Around the same time, the organisation moved from Jones Street to new offices at Darling Park and built a new printing press at [[Chullora]], in the city's west. The ''SMH'' later moved with other Sydney Fairfax divisions to a building at Darling Island.

In May 2007, [[Fairfax Media]] announced it would be moving from a [[broadsheet]] format to the smaller [[compact (newspaper)|compact]] or [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid-size]], in the footsteps of ''[[The Times]]'', for both ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' and ''The Age''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/smage-journos-must-adapt/story-e6frg996-1111113457677 |title='Smage' journos must adapt |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate = 5 July 2011 |date=3 May 2007 |author=Tabakoff, Nick }}</ref> Fairfax Media dumped these plans later in the year. However, in June 2012, Fairfax Media again announced it planned to shift both broadsheet newspapers to tabloid size, in March 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Souter|first=Gavin|title=History makes way for compact future|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/history-makes-way-for-compact-future-20130228-2f8xj.html|accessdate=1 March 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302155321/http://www.smh.com.au/national/history-makes-way-for-compact-future-20130228-2f8xj.html|archive-date=2 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Fairfax also announced it would cut staff across the entire group by 1,900 over three years and erect [[paywall]]s around the papers' websites.<ref name=digital>{{cite web| last=Zappone| first=Chris| title=Fairfax to shed 1900 staff, erect paywalls| url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/fairfax-to-shed-1900-staff-erect-paywalls-20120618-20ix1.html| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| date=18 June 2012| accessdate=18 June 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619054053/http://www.smh.com.au/business/fairfax-to-shed-1900-staff-erect-paywalls-20120618-20ix1.html| archive-date=19 June 2012| url-status=live}}</ref> The subscription type is to be a [[freemium]] model, limiting readers to a number of free stories per month, with a payment required for further access.<ref name="subscription model">{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/fairfax-moves-to-freemium-model-20120618-20jgq.html| title=Fairfax moves to 'freemium' model| last=Simpson| first=Kirsty| date=18 June 2012| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| accessdate=18 June 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620214628/http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/fairfax-moves-to-freemium-model-20120618-20jgq.html| archive-date=20 June 2012| url-status=live}}</ref> The announcement was part of an overall "digital first" strategy of increasingly [[digital content|digital]] or [[on-line]] content over printed delivery, to "increase sharing of editorial content", and to assist the management's wish for "full integration of its online, print and mobile platforms".<ref name=digital/>

In July 2013 it was announced that the ''SMH'' 's news director, Darren Goodsir, would become Editor-in-Chief, replacing Sean Aylmer.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Sydney Morning Herald Editor-in-Chief announced|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/new-sydney-morning-herald-editorinchief-announced-20130730-2qwwc.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 July 2013|access-date=30 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801162832/http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/new-sydney-morning-herald-editorinchief-announced-20130730-2qwwc.html|archive-date=1 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Political viewpoint==
According to Irial Glynn, the newspaper's editorial stance is generally centrist.<ref name="Glynn">Irial Glynn, ''Asylum Policy, Boat People and Political Discourse: Boats, Votes and Asylum in Australia and Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), p. 10: "the generally centrist ''Sydney Morning Herald''"</ref> According to one commentator it is seen as the most centrist among the three major Australian non-tabloids (the other two being the ''Australian'' and the ''Age'').<ref name="Everett">Andrea L.

The newspaper did not endorse the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] for federal office in the first six decades of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]], but did endorse the party in [[1961 Australian federal election|1961]], [[1984 Australian federal election|1984]], and [[1987 Australian federal election|1987]]. During the [[2004 Australian federal election]], the ''Herald'' announced it would "no longer endorse one party or another at election time" but that this policy might yet be revised in the future: "A truly awful government of any colour, for example, would bring reappraisal."<ref name="2004Ed"/>

==Ownership==
{{main|Nine Entertainment Co.}}
Fairfax went public in 1957 and grew to acquire interests in magazines, radio and television. The group collapsed spectacularly on 11 December 1990 when [[Warwick Fairfax]], great-great-grandson of John Fairfax, attempted to privatise the group by borrowing $1.8 billion. The group was bought by [[Conrad Black]] before being re-listed in 1992. In 2006, Fairfax announced a merger with [[Rural Press]], which brought in a Fairfax family member, John B. Fairfax, as a significant player in the company.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Ruth Park]] | title=Ruth Park's Sydney | publisher=Duffy & Snellgrove | year=1999 | isbn=978-1-875989-45-4}}</ref> From 10 December 2018 Nine and Fairfax Media merged into one business known as Nine.
