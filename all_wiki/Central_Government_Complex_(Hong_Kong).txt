The '''Central Government Complex''' has been the headquarters of the [[Government of Hong Kong]] since 2011. Located at the [[Tamar site]], the complex comprises the Central Government Offices, the [[Legislative Council Complex]] and the [[Office of the Chief Executive (building)|Office of the Chief Executive]] of Hong Kong. The complex has taken over the roles of several buildings, including the [[former Central Government Offices]], [[Murray Building]] and the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|former Legislative Council Building]].

==History==
By 2001, existing government offices at Murray Building and the former Central Government Offices were considered to be too small.<ref name="PLB(CR) 21/36">{{cite report |author=Planning and Lands Bureau|date=30 April 2002 |title=Legislative Council Brief: Use of the Tamar Site for the Development of the Central Government Complex |url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr01-02/english/panels/plw/papers/plb(cr)21_36(2001)pt.7(eng).pdf |id=PLB(CR) 21/36 (2001) Pt. 7 |access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Maintenance of the buildings was also increasingly costly, and the age of the buildings limited the technology used in them.<ref name="PLB(CR) 21/36"/>{{rp|3}} The Legislative Council Building on Jackson Road was also too small to house the entire LegCo Secretariat and all members' offices.<ref name="PLB(CR) 21/36"/>{{rp|3}}

A new government complex at Tamar was approved by the [[Executive Council (Hong Kong)|Executive Council]] on 30 April 2002 under the [[Tung Chee-hwa]] administration.<ref name="PLB(CR) 21/36"/>{{rp|1}} The new complex was to be the headquarters of the government, the Legislative Council and other community facilities, including a gallery, leisure facilities, open spaces and a waterfront promenade.<ref name="PLB(CR) 21/36"/>{{rp|1–2}} At the time, the construction was estimated to cost [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]6.4 billion. 

The building was delivered through a design-build contract won by the [[Gammon Construction|Gammon]]-[[Hip Hing Construction|Hip Hing]] joint venture.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joint venture wins Tamar project|url=http://archive.news.gov.hk/isd/ebulletin/en/category/administration/080110/html/080110en01001.htm|publisher=Information Services Department|date=10 January 2008|access-date=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104145327/http://archive.news.gov.hk/isd/ebulletin/en/category/administration/080110/html/080110en01001.htm|archive-date=4 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Construction was due to begin in mid-February 2008, for completion in 2011. It engaged more than 3,000 workers.<ref>[http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/080128/html/080128en06004.htm Tamar contract signed<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421153437/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/080128/html/080128en06004.htm |date=April 21, 2008 }}</ref>

==Architecture==
The architect was [[Rocco Design Architects|Rocco Yim]], who premised the massing on the concept of "door always open".<ref name=ArchDaily>{{cite news|title=HKSAR Government Headquarters / Rocco Design Architects|url=http://www.archdaily.com/481237/hksar-government-headquarters-rocco-design-architects|work=ArchDaily|date=28 February 2014}}</ref> The new government building uses neither [[China|Chinese]] nor [[Europe]]an government building designs, but instead it is a mix of [[postmodern architecture]] and low-frills [[International style (architecture)|international]] design. The building initially had an open design, but has been heavily fortified after various protests.

==Public realm==
The complex was originally designed by Yim under the concept of "Door Always Open", symbolising the pride that Hong Kong holds in its "openness and transparency of governance". In keeping with this theme, the complex was meant to be accessible to the public and integrated with the surrounding urban context, and incorporates a range of public spaces.<ref name=ArchDaily/> [[Tamar Park]] passes through the complex, leading to the waterfront promenade on [[Victoria Harbour]].

The [[Civic Square (Hong Kong)|Civic Square]] in front of the complex's East Wing has been blocked off from public access with a permanent fence.
