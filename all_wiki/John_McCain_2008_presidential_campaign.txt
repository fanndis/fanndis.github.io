{{Wikinews|Barack Obama elected 44th President of the United States}}
The '''2008 presidential campaign of [[John McCain]]''', the longtime senior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Arizona]], was launched with an informal announcement on February 28, 2007, during a live taping of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and formally launched at an event on April 25, 2007.  His second candidacy for [[President of the United States|the Presidency of the United States]], he had previously run for his party's nomination in the [[2000 Republican Party presidential primaries|2000 primaries]] and was considered as a potential running mate for his party's nominee, then-Governor [[George W. Bush]] of [[Texas]]. After winning a majority of delegates in the [[2008 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican primaries of 2008]], on August 29, leading up to the convention, McCain selected [[Governor of Alaska|Governor]] [[Sarah Palin]] of [[Alaska]] as his [[running mate]] for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Five days later, at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], McCain was formally selected as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential nominee in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]].

McCain began the campaign as the apparent frontrunner among Republicans, with a strategy of appearing as the establishment, inevitable candidate; his campaign website featured an [[Associated Press]] article describing him as "[a] political celebrity".<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated Press |author-link=Associated Press |title=McCain Talks To Letterman About April Candidacy Announcement |work=JohnMcCain.com |date=March 1, 2007 |url=http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/News/NewsReleases/b1b85afb-cd0c-4a74-997d-dfee1a3f8098.htm |access-date=August 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314053528/http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/News/NewsReleases/b1b85afb-cd0c-4a74-997d-dfee1a3f8098.htm |archive-date=March 14, 2012 }}</ref> He made substantial overtures towards elements of the Republican base that had resisted his [[John McCain 2000 presidential campaign|2000 insurgency campaign]].<ref name="tny121707">{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/17/071217fa_fact_lizza|title=Return of the Nativist|author=Ryan Lizza|author-link=Ryan Lizza|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=December 17, 2007|access-date=December 12, 2007}}</ref> However, he soon fell behind in polls and fundraising; by July 2007 his campaign was forced to restructure its size and operations. The tide of Republican sentiment against immigration reform legislation he sponsored also led to the erosion of his lead.<ref name="tny121707" />

Towards the end of 2007, McCain began a resurgence, which was capped by his January 2008 wins in the [[2008 New Hampshire Republican primary|New Hampshire]], [[2008 South Carolina Republican primary|South Carolina]], and [[2008 Florida Republican primary|Florida]] primaries. This made him the front-runner for the Republican nomination. On [[Super Tuesday (2008)|Super Tuesday]], McCain won both the majority of states and [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s in the [[2008 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican primaries]], giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination. McCain clinched a majority of the delegates and became the presumptive Republican nominee with wins in several more primaries on March 4.<ref name="cnn030408"/> The following day, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] endorsed McCain at the [[White House]].

In the general election, facing Democratic nominee, Senator [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], McCain was trailing during most of the season, only gaining a lead in national polls for a period after the Palin announcement and the [[2008 Republican National Convention]]. The dominant issue of the campaign became the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. Unable to gain traction against Obama in presidential debates, the final stages of the campaign saw McCain criticizing Obama for being a "redistributionist" and adopting symbols such as [[Joe the Plumber]].

On November 4, 2008, McCain lost to [[Barack Obama]] in the general election, receiving 173 votes of the [[electoral college vote|electoral college]] to Obama's 365 and gaining 46 percent of the popular vote to Obama's 53 percent. Had McCain been elected, he would have been the first President not born in the 50 states, as he was born in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] (a U.S. Territory at the time of McCain's birth). McCain would've also been the first president from the state of [[Arizona]], whereas Palin would have been the first female vice president, as well as the first vice president from [[Alaska]] and outside the mainland United States.

He was well known for his military service (including years as a tortured [[Prisoner of war|POW]]) and competing in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential campaign]], in which he won the [[New Hampshire primary]] before eventually losing the nomination to [[George W. Bush]]. McCain also impressed many Republicans with his strong support for [[George W. Bush 2004 presidential campaign|President Bush's re-election campaign in 2004]], and his role in the confirmation of many of Bush's judicial nominees.<ref name=loyalists/> Since 1993, he also has served as chairman of the [[International Republican Institute]], a U.S. government-funded organization involved in supporting political democracy around the world.

A [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] poll dated January 2007 showed McCain deadlocked with possible Democratic opponent Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] at 46%; in the same poll McCain trailed Democratic Senator [[Barack Obama]] 41% to 48%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1711123,00.html|title=Time Poll: Clinton More Beatable than Obama|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 7, 2007|author=Tony Karon|access-date=November 25, 2007}}</ref> An earlier ''Time'' poll indicated that more Americans were familiar with McCain than any of the other frontrunners, including Obama and Republican candidate and former [[Mayor of New York]] [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1582130,00.html|title=+Time Poll: Hillary vs. McCain?|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=January 25, 2007|author=Tony Karon|access-date=November 25, 2007}}</ref> During the 2006 election cycle, McCain attended 346 events and raised more than $10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates.

In May 2006, McCain gave the commencement address at [[Jerry Falwell]]'s [[Liberty University]]. During his 2000 presidential bid, McCain had called Falwell an "agent of intolerance." With significant coverage during the campaign, McCain said that he would never back down from his earlier statement. His later appearance at Liberty University prompted questions about the McCain–Falwell relationship and a possible presidential run in 2008. McCain backtracked and stated that Falwell is no longer as divisive and the two have discussed their shared values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/2006/04/02/mccain-falwell|title=McCain Says Jerry Falwell is No Longer an 'Agent of Intolerance'|work=Think Progress|format=video|date=April 2, 2006|access-date=August 15, 2006}}</ref> McCain delivered a similar address at [[The New School]] commencement in [[Madison Square Garden]].

By a few weeks prior to making his announcement on ''Letterman'', McCain was already beginning to trail behind former [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] in the polls, a situation attributed to his steadfast support for the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070227/1a_cover27.art.htm|title=McCain firm on Iraq war despite cost to candidacy|last=Page|first=Susan|date=February 27, 2007|publisher=[[USA Today]]|page=A1|access-date=August 26, 2008}}</ref>

In March 2007, with considerable press attention and in hopes of reigniting his efforts, McCain brought back the "Straight Talk Express" [[campaign bus]] that he had used to much positive effect in his outsider run in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tapper|first=Jake|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2955714&page=1|title=Bringing Back the Bus|publisher=ABC News|date=March 15, 2007|access-date=March 18, 2007}}</ref> Like many candidates, McCain took to the internet in order to help boost his campaign; appealing to younger audiences by creating Facebook and MySpace pages, along with an account on [[YouTube]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

From March to May, McCain only attended three-floor votes in the Senate, though none of McCain's missed votes altered a bill's fate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2007/05/mccain_misses_42_straight_vote.html|title=McCain Misses 42nd Straight Vote ... and Counting|access-date=June 21, 2007|work=The Washington Post|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515163558/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2007/05/mccain_misses_42_straight_vote.html|archive-date=May 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> According to ''[[Washington Post]]'' statistics, McCain missed more votes than any Senator including [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota politician)|Tim Johnson]], who missed many votes after suffering a brain hemorrhage in December 2006.

===Immigration bill===
As early as 2005, McCain conducted bipartisan efforts with fellow Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to create a bill—the [[Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act]]—that would have changed America's immigration policy and provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.<ref name="immbill2005">{{cite web|title=Democrats are flocking to McCain's immigration bill|url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/democrats-are-flocking-to-mccains-immigration-bill-2005-08-17.html|access-date=June 21, 2007}}</ref> Later McCain championed the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]].

In an interview in June 2007, potential candidate [[Fred Thompson]] criticized [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Reagan's immigration policy of 1986]], saying: "Twelve million illegal immigrants later, we are now living in a nation that is beset by people who are suicidal maniacs and want to kill countless innocent men, women and children around the world. We're sitting here now with essentially open borders."<ref name="openborders">{{cite web|title=Fred Thompson Raps 'Open Border' Immigration|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/5/25/214417.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528072430/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/5/25/214417.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 28, 2007|access-date=June 21, 2007}}</ref> McCain responded, "I travel around the country extensively and that's certainly not the impression I have. I have not detected a nation full of suicidal maniacs."<ref name="openborders"/> A Thompson spokesman said he was not calling immigrants "suicidal maniacs" but rather saying that terrorists could infiltrate the borders.<ref name="openborders"/>

===Iowa Straw Poll===
In June 2007, McCain drew some criticism for dropping out of the August [[Iowa Straw Poll (1979-2011)|Iowa Straw Poll]].<ref name="dissiowa">"[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-06-06-iowa-straw-poll_N.htm McCain, Giuliani skip Iowa straw poll]." ''The Des Moines Register'', June 7, 2007.</ref> Some Republican officials felt the move could be seen as "dissing Iowa."<ref name="dissiowa"/> In response, a man in a chicken suit, known as the [[Iowa Chicken]], began demonstrating at McCain's appearances in Iowa and carrying a sign reading "you balked at the straw poll."<ref name="IAchicken">"[http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/24280 Chickens, bunnies, felons and other candidate stalkers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624092238/http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/24280 |date=June 24, 2007 }}".

''Associated Press'', June 11, 2007.</ref> Some political observers have opined that the Straw Poll results are bought by campaigns.<ref name="dissiowa"/>

However, polls taken in June showed that McCain's Iowa support had dropped to the single digits, from the mid-20s to 6%.<ref name="sixpercent">"[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/06/21/mccain-not-worried-about-latest-poll-numbers/ McCain not worried about latest poll numbers]".

===Campaign downsizing and restructuring===
McCain's second quarter 2007 fundraising results and campaign financials were poor. Both McCain supporters and political observers pointed to McCain's support for the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]], very unpopular among the Republican base electorate, as a primary cause of his fundraising problems.<ref name="cnn070207">[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/07/02/mccain-lags-in-fundraising-cuts-staff/ "McCain lags in fundraising, cuts staff"], [[cnn.com]], July 2, 2007.

Retrieved July 6, 2007.</ref>

Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, with 50 to 100 staffers let go and others taking pay cuts or switching to no pay. McCain's aides said the campaign was considering taking public matching funds, and would focus its efforts on the early primary and caucus states. McCain however said he was not considering dropping out of the race.<ref name="cnn070207"/><ref name="npr070207"/>

Fellow Senator, but Immigration Reform Act opponent, [[Tom Coburn]], wrote a piece for ''[[National Review]]'' praising McCain for showing great political courage in sticking behind the Act even though it was damaging his presidential hopes.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tom Coburn|author-link=Tom Coburn|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/221454/mccains-courage/tom-coburn|title=McCain's Courage: A rare American politician|publisher=[[National Review Online]]|date=June 29, 2007|access-date=July 6, 2007}}</ref>

Campaign shakeups reached the top level on July 10, 2007, when campaign manager [[Terry Nelson (political consultant)|Terry Nelson]] and campaign chief strategist John Weaver both departed. Another senior aide and co-author of McCain's books, [[Mark Salter]], reduced his role in the campaign as well (he would later return to a full role).<ref name="tnr042308">{{cite news|url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=f555f3f5-dc82-4193-a381-1b97a47d7a09|title=Papa John|author=Jason Zengerle|publisher=[[The New Republic]]|date=April 23, 2008|access-date=April 11, 2008}}</ref> McCain's co-chair for his Florida campaign, State Rep [[Bob Allen (Florida politician)|Bob Allen]], was arrested on July 11, 2007, on charges of sexual solicitation (prostitution).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/13670554/detail.html|title=State Rep.

==="Living off the Land"===
Following the upheaval, the new McCain campaign put out a plan for how to continue on. Entitled "Living Off the Land: A Plan for Financial Viability", it called for expenses to be greatly cut and for McCain to take advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events.<ref name="pol071907">{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0707/McCains_comeback_plan.html|title=McCain's comeback plan|author=Jonathan Martin|publisher=[[The Politico]]|date=July 19, 2007|access-date=December 12, 2007|author-link=Jonathan Martin (journalist)}}</ref> McCain would focus on the early caucus and primary states, instead of trying to run a nationally-scoped effort, would try to "win debates and outperform other candidates," and thereby regain momentum and recapture the faith of potential donors.<ref name="pol071907"/>

McCain's strategy was hampered by several other events within the Republicans dominating the political discussion in the ensuing months: [[Fred Thompson]]'s entry into the race in early September; the focus in debates over battles between [[Rudy Giuliani]] and [[Mitt Romney]];<ref name="abc121007"/> and the discussion over the impact of Romney's religion.<ref name="abc121007"/> [[Mike Huckabee]]'s sudden surge from the second tier into near-frontrunner status dominated much of the news in November and December 2007.<ref name=abc121007>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=3976728&page=1|title=Analysis: How McCain Could Still Win|author=Ron Claiborne|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=December 10, 2007|access-date=December 16, 2007}}</ref> Nevertheless, McCain persevered, riding his "Straight Talk Express" bus through New Hampshire and, as in the past, granting reporters and bloggers far more direct access than would other campaigns.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2007/11/30/22298/on-board-mccains-2008-straight.html|title=On board McCain's 2008 'Straight Talk Express'|author=Matt Barnes|author-link=Matt Barnes|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]]|date=December 30, 2007|access-date=December 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228103717/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2007/11/30/22298/on-board-mccains-2008-straight.html|archive-date=December 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the final months before the caucuses and primaries began, McCain had still not nearly reclaimed his previous front-runner status. However, the Republican race was quite unsettled, with none of the top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities. Huckabee's ascendence was damaging to Romney, as they traded shots during the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses. Romney and Huckabee put much of their early efforts into Iowa, making the caucus particularly crucial for each of them.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gop22dec22,1,510780.story Romney, Huckabee sharpen barbs], LA Times, Dec. 22, 2007.</ref> Giuliani's campaign was suffering from conflicts regarding strategy, damaging revelations about his personal life and the federal indictment of longtime ally and friend [[Bernard Kerik]].<ref>Andrew Nagourney, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/24/us/politics/24giuliani.html Giuliani Hits a Rocky Stretch as Voting Nears] New York Times, Dec. 24, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://gothamist.com/2007/12/15/giuliani_campai_1.php Giuliani Campaign Hitting Potholes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119060418/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/15/giuliani_campai_1.php |date=January 19, 2008 }}, The Gothamist, Dec. 15, 2007.</ref> Thompson's campaign had not gained momentum after his late entry to the race and had been described as "lackluster".<ref name="CNN October">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/16/schneider.poll/|title=Poll: As Thompson's star fades, Clinton's on the rise|author=Bill Schneider|publisher=CNN|date=October 16, 2007|access-date=October 17, 2007}}</ref> Through November, McCain had put little effort into Iowa,<ref name="abc121007"/> instead focusing on New Hampshire, where he had staged a big win in his 2000 campaign.

The first vote of the 2008 election season took place in [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2008|the Iowa caucuses]] on January 3, 2008. McCain came in fourth place, with 13.1% of the vote.

===Michigan===
With different winners in Iowa and New Hampshire—and Mitt Romney taking the lower-profile [[Wyoming Republican county conventions, 2008|Wyoming caucus]]—the January 15 [[2008 Michigan Republican primary|Michigan primary]] loomed as an important battle, despite the state's delegation size being cut in half for holding the primary too early.

===Romney ends campaign===
Both McCain and Romney addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, D.C., on February 7. Romney used his speech to announce the end of his campaign, solidifying McCain's status as the likely Republican nominee. McCain spoke about an hour later, again appealing to conservative uncertainty about his ideology. He focused on his opposition to abortion and gun control, as well as his support for lower taxes and free-market health care solutions.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-goprace8feb08,1,6814954.story Romney's exit hands McCain the nomination] LA Times, Feb. 8, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/0208fri1-08.html Into the lion's den] Arizona Republic, Feb. 8, 2008.</ref> He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as "a foot soldier in the [[Reagan administration|Reagan Revolution]]", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration—one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain.

{{Main|John McCain lobbyist controversy}}
On February 20, 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' broke a story involving an alleged romantic affair eight years earlier between McCain and lobbyist [[Vicki Iseman]], both of whom deny the allegations. The relationship allegedly existed during [[John McCain 2000 presidential campaign|McCain's 2000 presidential campaign]]. In separate interviews with ''The New York Times'', two unnamed former associates of McCain said they "became convinced" that a romantic relationship existed and warned him that he was risking his campaign and his political career. Both said McCain acknowledged behaving inappropriately and that he pledged to keep his distance from Iseman. The associates said they had become disillusioned with the senator, spoke independently of each other and provided details that were corroborated by others.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 21, 2008|last=Rutenberg|first=Jim|author2=Thompson, Marilyn W.|author3=Kirkpatrick, David D.|author4=Labaton, Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/politics/21mccain.html|title=For McCain, Self-Confidence on Ethics Poses Its Own Risk|work=New York Times|access-date=February 20, 2008}}</ref>

===Bush endorsement===
On March 5, 2008, President Bush welcomed McCain to the White House and officially endorsed the man who would be his party's standard-bearer in November. The endorsement was seen as helping McCain rally conservatives, and brought with it the promise of much-needed fundraising help heading in to the general election. Democrats painted a different picture, hoping to capitalize on Bush's low approval ratings. The [[Democratic National Committee]] said that McCain would offer a "third term of George W. Bush".<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSWAT00907320080306 Bush endorses McCain for presidency] Bloomberg.com, March 5, 2008.</ref>

===Establishing himself===
McCain turned his attention to the November general election, while the Democratic primaries continued to be a battle between Clinton and Obama. McCain faced the challenge of staying in the news as the Democrats garnered headlines with their protracted nomination battle, which showed no signs of ending before the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in late August. However, having the nomination locked up early also gave McCain time to build a national organization and put his general election strategy into action for the six months leading up to the [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. McCain planned to raise money and visit several sites in the U.S. before embarking on a tour of Europe and the Middle East as part of a congressional delegation.

McCain began his overseas trip on March 16, arriving in Baghdad to meet with U.S. military officials as well as Iraqi political leaders. While the campaign was not involved in the trip, which was official Senate business, it served as a chance for McCain to highlight his credentials in foreign affairs, seen to be the main strength of his candidacy. After Iraq, the group planned to travel to Israel, London and Paris.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/world/middleeast/17mccain.html McCain Visits Iraq as a Senator, but Iraqis See a Candidate's Agenda] Wall Street Journal, March 17, 2008.</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSL0157942120080316 John McCain in Iraq], Reuters, March 16, 2008.</ref>

===Reiterating and elaborating positions===
On March 26, McCain gave his first major speech on foreign policy since securing the nomination. While McCain warned that national security could not be achieved through "passive" measures, he sounded a conciliatory tone in regards to foreign policy in general. Speaking to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, he stressed the need for more cooperation with allies, called for nuclear disarmament and said that he "detest[s]" war. He stated that America's power "does not mean we can do whatever we want, whenever we want."<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/la-na-mccain27mar27,0,3564351.story McCain stresses cooperation in L.A.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511154339/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/la-na-mccain27mar27,0,3564351.story |date=May 11, 2008 }} Chicago Tribune, March 27, 2008.</ref>

On March 31, McCain began a "biographical tour", visiting several places that were key to his [[Early life and military career of John McCain|early life and military career]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/31/mccain.tour/|title=McCain tells his story to voters|publisher=CNN|date=March 31, 2008|access-date=April 16, 2008}}</ref>

In early April, McCain said he had compiled a list of roughly 20 potential running mates, and that he hoped to have selected a Vice President well before the Republican Convention in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bulletin/bulletin_080403.htm|title=McCain Says He Has List Of About 20 Possible Running Mates|work=Usnews.com|date=April 3, 2008|access-date=September 20, 2009}}</ref>

Despite the earlier opposition from conservatives, in April 2008, there were signs that the Republican Party base was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/''New York Times'' poll showed that McCain was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. Bush at the same time in 2000.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9727.html McCain overcomes rank-and-file concerns] Politico.com, April 20, 2008.</ref>
On May 5, 2008, the McCain campaign announced the launch of a Spanish-language site call Bienvenidos McCain or "McCain Welcomes." It presents the candidates positions and appeals in Spanish.

During a May 15 speech in [[Columbus, Ohio]], McCain laid out his vision for January 2013, which would be the end of his first term had he won the presidency. He predicted that the Iraq War would be won by that time, and that most American troops would be out of the country.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5isA8k_ixGbCYfRef-s5Bec7H_MngD90MB7CG0 McCain believes Iraq war can be won by 2013] Associated Press, May 15, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604101900/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5isA8k_ixGbCYfRef-s5Bec7H_MngD90MB7CG0 |date=June 4, 2008 }}</ref> He pledged a bipartisan approach to governing a robust economy as well, and the implementation of a [[flat tax]] rate.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120914064301/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23710226-5013948,00.html John McCain sets out lofty presidential ambitions] The Australian, May 17, 2008.</ref>

Obama commented on Palin in an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'':

{{quote|Well, I don't know Governor Palin, I have not met her before. I had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck—but, not too much luck!—on the campaign trail. And she seems to have a compelling life story. Obviously, she's a fine mother and an up-and-coming public servant. So, it's too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate she'll be. My sense is that she subscribes to John McCain's agenda.

Gibson also asked Palin about a prayer she had offered with regard to soldiers in Iraq. Commentators' reactions varied.

==Campaign opinion and projections==

===Opinion polling===
{{Further|Nationwide opinion polling for the 2008 United States presidential election|Statewide opinion polling for the 2008 United States presidential election}}
An average of fifteen national polls taken between October 29 and November 3 showed an average 7.6% lead for McCain's opponent [[Barack Obama]] before [[Election Day (United States)|election day]]. The poll average was off by 0.3%, with Obama instead gaining only 7.3% more of the popular vote than McCain. The poll average projected McCain would receive 44.5% of the popular vote. He bested this by 1.1%, actually garnering 45.6% of the popular vote.<ref name="rcpgenelection">[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html General Election: McCain vs. Obama], [[RealClearPolitics]]. Retrieved November 13, 2008.</ref>

Poll numbers varied greatly the day before the election and through the election season. This can be attributed to varying polling methods, demographics, and sample sizes between pollsters, amongst other things. Final polls ranged from an 11% advantage for Obama to only a 2% advantage. The most accurate final poll numbers were from [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], [[Ipsos]]/[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]], and [[CNN]]/Opinion Research which predicted a 7% advantage for Obama. [[Rasmussen Reports]] and Pew Research predicted a 6% advantage.<ref name="rcpgenelection"/>

During the election season, McCain's highest support among an average of national polls was 2.9% on September 8, four days after the end of the [[2008 Republican National Convention]]. Amongst individual polls, before the primary season McCain's highest support was recorded in a Fox News poll conducted between December 5 and December 6 showing a 19% lead. After the primaries, McCain's highest support was recorded in a [[USA Today]]/[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll conducted between September 5 and September 7 showing a 10% lead.<ref name="rcpgenelection"/>

Gallup conducted weekly polls of registered voters to measure support among the candidates by political ideology. The last poll conducted before election day, taken between October 27 and November 2, showed 32% of pure Independents supporting McCain, leading Obama's 24% support. McCain's Independent support peaked at 38% the week of September 15–21.<ref>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/108049/Candidate-Support-Political-Party-Ideology.aspx Candidate Support by Political Party and Ideology].

Leading up to the day before the general election, the [[RealClearPolitics]] electoral map, an average of statewide opinion polls, projected 132 electoral votes for McCain/Palin and an electoral majority of 278 votes for opponents Obama/Biden. 128 electoral votes were considered toss ups.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/?map=5 RealClearPolitics Electoral College: RealClear Electoral Count], [[RealClearPolitics]].

Retrieved November 19, 2008.</ref> With the election already decided, the close results in Missouri were not contested, and Missouri was called for McCain.

McCain ultimately underperformed his projected electoral vote count. Toss-ups such as North Carolina, Indiana, and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district went for Obama. Opinion poll averages prior to the election projected these votes for McCain.

===Favorability===
An average of four national polls measuring favorable/unfavorable opinions taken between October 31 and November 2 showed an average 52.3% favorable opinion and 41.5% unfavorable opinion of McCain before election day. Favorable and unfavorable opinions of McCain varied during the election season, but his favorable opinion remained higher than his unfavorable opinion throughout the duration of the election season according to poll averages. McCain's highest ratings was 57.6% favorable and 35.2% unfavorable on July 13.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/mccain_favorableunfavorable-642.html McCain: Favorable/Unfavorable], [[RealClearPolitics]].

Although McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, his opponent did not, and McCain criticized Obama for becoming the first major party candidate in history to opt out of public financing.<ref>Wayne, Leslie.

The McCain campaign received US$7 million in contributions in a single day after announcing Palin as the presumptive vice-presidential nominee.<ref name="Mosk"/>

Nevertheless, down the stretch run of the general election campaign, McCain was outspent by Obama by a four-to-one margin.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> In the end, from September 1 to the end of the campaign, McCain spent directly the $84 million allotted to him by the public financing rules, while Obama, having opted out of that system, spent $315 million directly during the same period.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28060983 "Obama raised $104 million as campaign ended"], [[NBC News]], December 4, 2008.</ref>

McCain condemned Hagee's sermon as "crazy and unacceptable".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7416257.stm|title=McCain drops backer over sermon|publisher=BBC|access-date=May 23, 2008|date=May 23, 2008}}</ref>
