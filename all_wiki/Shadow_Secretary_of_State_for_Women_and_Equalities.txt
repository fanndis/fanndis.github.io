The '''Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities''' (previously '''Shadow Minister for Women''', '''Shadow Minister for Women and Equality''' and '''Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities''') is a position in the United Kingdom's [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Official Opposition]], and sits in the Shadow Cabinet. The Shadow Secretary of State is responsible for holding the [[Minister for Women and Equalities]], responsible for the [[Government Equalities Office]], to account and is responsible for Opposition policy on women's and equality issues.

The post was upgraded to the Shadow [[Cabinet rank]] of [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Shadow Secretary of State]] following the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|snap general election of 2017]], with [[Jeremy Corbyn]] indicating that if Labour win office at the next election, Women and Equalities will be upgraded to the full status of a [[government department]]. Previously, the post was often held together with a [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] post, but sometimes as a Shadow Cabinet post in its own right.

The position has been held by [[Marsha de Cordova]] since 6 April 2020.

Before the Conservatives' defeat, [[Gillian Shephard]], [[John Major]]'s Education Secretary, spoke on women's issues. She largely delegated the responsibility to a junior minister, [[Cheryl Gillan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/jowell-to-be-britains-first-guardian-of-public-health-1260126.html |title=Jowell to be first guardian of public health |last=Abrams |first=Fran |work=The Independent |date=7 May 1997 |url-status=live |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> The only parliamentary debate that obviously fell under the portfolio of the Minister for Women during the term of Harriet Harman (May 1997 to July 1998) occurred on 27 February 1998. It was a set-piece debate, meaning the order of speakers was opening minister, opening shadow minister, backbenchers, closing shadow minister, closing minister. Harman opened, followed by Shepard. The closing speeches were given by Gillan for the Conservatives and [[Joan Ruddock]], Harman's deputy, for the Government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1998/feb/27/women-government-priorities#S6CV0307P0_19980227_HOC_29 |title=House of Commons Debates, 27 February 1998 c. 607–80 |url-status=live |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> A similar debate was held on 8 March 1999. The Minister for Women was a peer, [[Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington|Baroness Jay of Paddington]], so her deputy, [[Tessa Jowell]], opened the debate for the Government; [[Theresa May]] opened for the Conservatives. [[Virginia Bottomley]] closed for the Opposition, and [[Margaret Hodge]] did so for Labour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1999/mar/08/women#S6CV0327P0_19990308_HOC_176 |title=House of Commons Debates 8 March 1999 c. 34–120 |url-status=live |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref>|group=n}}
