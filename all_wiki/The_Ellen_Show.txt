'''''The Ellen Show''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] created by and starring [[Ellen DeGeneres]] that was broadcast during the 2001–02 season on [[CBS]], aired from September 24, 2001, to January 11, 2002. It was DeGeneres's second attempt at a sitcom, following ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (1994–98), but it was unable to attract strong ratings and was quickly cancelled after 13 episodes, leaving 5 episodes unaired.

DeGeneres [[coming out|came out]] as a [[lesbian]] in ''Ellen'', and her character on ''The Ellen Show'', Ellen Richmond, was also a lesbian, although the show did not focus as heavily on the character's [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] unlike the final season of her first sitcom.

''The Ellen Show'' also starred [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Martin Mull]], [[Kerri Kenney]], [[Jim Gaffigan]], and [[Emily Rutherfurd]].

==Plot==
After her internet company Homelearn.com goes bankrupt, Ellen Richmond decides to move back to her hometown to live with her eccentric mother, Dot, and scatter-brained sister, Catherine. At home, Ellen becomes reacquainted with her senior prom date, Rusty, who thinks they can pick up where they left off (which, since she is a [[lesbian]], seems unlikely), and her befuddled high school teacher, Mr. Munn. Though worlds apart from the people who love her, Ellen begins to adjust to a very different way of life and takes a job as a guidance counselor at her former high school.
