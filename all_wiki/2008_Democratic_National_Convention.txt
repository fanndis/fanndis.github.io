The United States '''2008 Democratic National Convention''' was a quadrennial [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating convention]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] where it adopted its national platform and officially nominated its candidates for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. The convention was held in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], from August 25 to 28, 2008, at the [[Pepsi Center]]. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barack Obama]] from [[Illinois]] gave his acceptance speech on August 28 at [[Broncos Stadium at Mile High|Invesco Field]] in what the party called an "Open Convention".<ref name="event">{{cite web| title = ''Open Convention''| url = https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/openconvention1| accessdate = July 7, 2008| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080710013752/https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/openconvention1| archivedate = July 10, 2008| df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="news1">{{cite news|title=Obama accepts Democrat nomination |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7586375.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105234449/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7586375.stm |archivedate=January 5, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Denver last hosted the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[1908 Democratic National Convention|1908]].

==Schedule==
{{Main|Schedule for the 2008 Democratic National Convention}}
Choosing to hold the convention the day after the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympic Games]] concluded, the Democratic Party convened in Denver in the last week of August, a week before the [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. The decision was made, according to the party, to "maximize momentum for our Democratic ticket in the final months of the Presidential election".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.democrats.org/a/2005/11/week_in_review_9.php | title=Week In Review: National Organizing Kickoff a Great Success | publisher=democrats.org | date=November 11, 2005 | accessdate=December 28, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080310194635/http://www.democrats.org/a/2005/11/week_in_review_9.php  |archivedate = March 10, 2008}}</ref>  Customarily, the party of the incumbent president holds its convention after the opposing party has held their meeting.

The Democratic National Committee presented themes for each day of the convention. The August 25 theme was "One Nation". The August 26 theme was "Renewing America's Promise" while its August 27 theme was "Securing America's Future". The August 28 theme highlights Obama's campaign motto, "Change We Can Believe In". Featured speakers crafted their messages to the theme of the day.

==Early party division==
With close delegate counts for [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|Hillary Clinton]], there was early speculation of the first [[brokered convention]] in decades. [[Democratic National Committee]] Chair [[Howard Dean]] sought to avoid such a circumstance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Democratic dead-heat 'not good news' says Dean |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gr19amb8dYUFiBqyY2_ht5d7lkwA |agency=AFP |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=February 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523214004/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gr19amb8dYUFiBqyY2_ht5d7lkwA |archivedate=May 23, 2008 }}</ref>

In addition to the possibility of a brokered convention, a dispute over seating delegates from Florida and [[Michigan]] led some to compare the year's convention with the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], which ended in a divided party and unhappiness over the outcome.<ref>{{cite news|first=Carolyn |last=Lochhead |title=Brokered Dem convention looking more likely |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/07/MNN0UT8M5.DTL&type=politics |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210024808/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2008%2F02%2F07%2FMNN0UT8M5.DTL&type=politics |archivedate=February 10, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>  This speculation ended when Obama was declared the presumptive nominee on June 3, 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.democrats/index.html |title=CNN projects Obama clinches nomination |publisher=CNN |date=June 3, 2008 |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112011028/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.democrats/index.html |archivedate=January 12, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> and Clinton officially announced later that week that she was suspending her campaign and was fully endorsing Obama.<ref name="ap060708">{{cite news | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/24993082 | title=Clinton ends historic bid, endorses Obama | publisher=Associated Press for NBC News | date=June 7, 2008 | accessdate=June 7, 2008}}</ref>

==Rules==
On February 2, 2007, the Democratic Party published "Call for the 2008 Democratic National Convention,"<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Democratic National Committee |authorlink=Democratic National Committee |title=''Call for the 2008 Democratic National Convention'' |publisher=Democratic National Committee |date=February 2, 2007 |url=http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/call.pdf |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608092338/http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/call.pdf |archivedate=June 8, 2011 }}</ref> the rules governing the convention. There were 3,409.5 pledged delegates, those committed to vote for a particular candidate, selected by primary voters and caucus participants. There were about [[Democratic Party (United States) superdelegates, 2008|823.5 unpledged delegates]], those free to vote for any candidate, [[colloquially]] known as [[superdelegates]], for a total of about 4,233 delegates, requiring 2,117 votes to constitute a majority of the convention.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  The superdelegates consisted of DNC members, Democratic Congress members and Governors, and other prominent Democrats.<ref>{{Cite news | title = The Primary Season: 2008 Democratic Calendar| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| url = http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/primaries/democraticprimaries/index.html | accessdate=September 4, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905215618/http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/primaries/democraticprimaries/index.html%20| archivedate= September 5, 2008| url-status= live}}</ref>

The pledged delegates were allocated among the states, the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Puerto Rico]] according to two main criteria: 1) proportion of votes each state gave the candidate in the last three Presidential elections; and 2) percentage of votes each state has in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. Fixed numbers of delegates were allocated for [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], and [[Democrats Abroad]]. Under the party's ''Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Democratic National Committee |authorlink=Democratic National Committee |title=''Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention'' |publisher=Democratic National Committee |date=August 19, 2006 |url=http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/rules.pdf |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006191218/http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/rules.pdf |archivedate=October 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> delegates were awarded through [[proportional representation]] with a minimum threshold of 15% of votes in a state or congressional district to receive delegates. The delegate population must reflect the state's ethnic distribution; and at least 50% of the delegates must be women.

Part way through the roll call (the New Mexico delegation first yielded to the Illinois delegation, who then yielded to the New York delegation), Senator Clinton of New York stated, "Madame Secretary, I move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote. All votes cast by the delegates will be counted, and that I move Senator Barack Obama of Illinois be selected by this convention by [[acclamation]] as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States." This was done and the verbal roll call vote was halted. Earlier the same day, Clinton had released her delegates, allowing them to vote for Obama.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7584307.stm |title=Bill Clinton hails Barack Obama |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=September 1, 2008 |publisher=BBC News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080901064745/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7584307.stm| archivedate= September 1, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Along with the verbal roll call, a paper ballot was taken.

Only three cities submitted final proposals to host the convention: Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and New York. New Orleans had submitted an initial bid, but on July 12, the city dropped out.

On September 27, the Republicans announced they would have their 2008 convention in St. Paul, removing it from consideration and leaving only Denver and New York as potential hosts. Despite hard lobbying by New York party boosters, then-Republican Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] dealt the campaign a major blow when he announced the city lacked the financial means to support a convention.<ref>[http://www.cqpolitics.com/2007/01/cqpolitics_news_alert_denver_g.html Politics Home Page : Roll Call] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125090450/http://www.cqpolitics.com/2007/01/cqpolitics_news_alert_denver_g.html |date=January 25, 2007 }}</ref>  Denver was chosen as the host on January 11, 2007, as Democrats looked to make gains in the "Purple West" states of Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico.

Convention organizers, including the Democratic National Convention Committee and the [[Denver 2008 Convention Host Committee]], expected 50,000 attendees, out of which 5,000 were delegates and 15,000 media personnel.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.demconvention.com/frequently-asked-questions/ |publisher=Demconvention.com |accessdate=February 6, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430112640/http://www.demconvention.com/frequently-asked-questions/ |archivedate = April 30, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, they anticipated 75,000 people coming to watch Obama accept the nomination on Thursday.<ref name="event" />

===Labor issues===
The head of the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] Local No. 7, Jim Taylor, refused to sign a no-strike agreement for the convention.

See, that's why Barack's running: to end the war in Iraq responsibly...<br />
... to build an economy that lifts every family, to make sure health care is available for every American, and to make sure that every single child in this nation has a world-class education all the way from preschool to college.
That's what Barack Obama will do as president of the United States of America.<br />
He'll achieve these goals the same way he always has, by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are. You see, Barack doesn't care where you're from, or what your background is, or what party, if any, you belong to. See, that's just not how he sees the world.
He knows that thread that connects us – our belief in America's promise, our commitment to our children's future – he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/conventions/videos/transcripts/20080825_OBAMA_SPEECH.html|title=Michelle Obama's Speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention|work=the New York Times|accessdate=November 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080918190601/http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/conventions/videos/transcripts/20080825_OBAMA_SPEECH.html| archivedate= September 18, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Ohio Representative [[Dennis Kucinich]], who had also run as a presidential candidate in the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, gave a spirited speech structured around the refrain "Wake up America!" The speech levies trenchant criticism of the perceived abuses of power of the [[George W. Bush]] administration, attacks the corporate control of the American political and economic systems and rallies for a program of universal health coverage, universal higher education, tax reform, trade policy reform, energy regulation, civil liberties and de-militarization. At the end of the speech, Kucinich endorses Barack Obama and Joe Biden for president and vice-president.

[[File:Barack Obama and Joe Biden 2008 DNC (04) (cropped2).jpg|thumb|right|Obama and Biden appear after Biden's speech]]
The theme for the day was "Securing America's Future". It featured a speech by [[Joe Biden]], the [[Democratic Party (United States) vice presidential candidates, 2008|Vice Presidential candidate]].<ref name=secondlist/> Before his speech he was introduced by his oldest son [[Beau Biden]], Delaware's Attorney General.

In that speech Beau talked about how his father would tuck him and his siblings into bed each night after returning home, how he refused invitations to cocktail parties in DC because he did not want to miss his granddaughter (Beau's daughter) Natalie's birthday. He remembered the accident that killed his mother and sister and how his father took the Senate oath at his and his brother's bedside. Several years later his father remarried "their Mom Jill" and their family was rebuilt. In the end Beau, whose Delaware National Guard unit where he is Captain was to be deployed to Iraq, said that while his father was always there for him, his duties that fall would prevent him from being there for his Dad. Thus he asked his family and everyone else to be there in November for his father and to be there for Barack Obama and make this country better again.

Joe Biden, in his speech, contrasted the two presidential candidates:<blockquote>

You know, you can learn a lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him, seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind. But even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.<br />
I watched how Barack touched people, how he inspired them. And I realized he had tapped into the oldest belief in America: We don't have to accept the situation we cannot bear; we have the power to change it.<br />
And change it – and changing it is exactly what Barack Obama will do. That's what he'll do for this country.<br />
You know, John McCain is my friend. And I know you hear that phrase used all the time in politics. I mean it. John McCain is my friend. We've traveled the world together. It's a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by John still amazes me.<br />
But I profoundly – I profoundly disagree with the direction John wants to take this country, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Amtrak to veterans. John thinks that, during the Bush years, quote, "We've made great economic progress." I think it's been abysmal. And in the Senate, John has voted with President Bush 95 percent. And that is very hard to believe.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/conventions/videos/transcripts/20080827_BIDEN_SPEECH.html|title=Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s Convention Speech|last=Transcript|work=the New York Times|accessdate=November 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080918190745/http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/conventions/videos/transcripts/20080827_BIDEN_SPEECH.html| archivedate= September 18, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref></blockquote>
Other speakers included former president [[Bill Clinton]], 2004 presidential candidate Sen. [[John Kerry]] ([[Massachusetts|MA]]), and Sen. [[Evan Bayh]] ([[Indiana|IN]]).<ref name=secondlist/> In his remarks, Clinton assessed Obama's readiness to be president:<blockquote>
Clearly, the job of the next president is to rebuild the American dream and to restore American leadership in the world.<br />
And here's what I have to say about that. Everything I learned in my eight years as president, and in the work I have done since in America and across the globe, has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job.<br />
Now, he has a remarkable ability to inspire people, to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose. He has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs. His policies on the economy, on taxes, on health care, on energy are far superior to the Republican alternatives.<br />
He has shown – he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military.  His family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an ever more interdependent world.<br />
The long, hard primary tested and strengthened him. And in his first presidential decision, the selection of a running mate, he hit it out of the park.<br />
With Joe Biden's experience and wisdom, supporting Barack Obama's proven understanding, instincts, and insight, America will have the national security leadership we need.
</blockquote>

After [[Joe Biden]] spoke, his first address as Vice Presidential Nominee, [[Barack Obama]] made a surprise appearance praising the convention.<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1131991,CST-NWS-dem28.article Obama makes surprise appearance]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918141916/http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1131991%2CCST-NWS-dem28.article |date=September 18, 2008 }}</ref>

In his speech, Obama said, "Our government should work for us, not against us. It should ensure opportunity, not for just those with the most money and influence, but for every American who is willing to work. That's the promise of America, the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise and fall as one nation, the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper.

===Gitmo on the Platte===
'''Gitmo on the Platte''', was the colloquial name for the "Temporary Arrestee Processing Center," [[Denver, Colorado|Denver, CO]] set up to hold mass-arrested protesters during the 2008 Democratic National Convention which was held at the Pepsi Center in Denver from August 25 to August 28, 2008.<ref name=kos01a>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2008/8/15/568534/- |title=Gitmo On The Platte: The Police State Lives In Denver |author= davidseth |date=August 28, 2008 |website=www.dailykos.com |publisher=Daily Kos |access-date=October 19, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=huffpost01a>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-tucker/gitmo-on-the-platte-every_b_120365.html |title=Gitmo On The Platte?

Later that day, the protesters were asked by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department to remove the sign. No citations were issued, though the group did violate two open space regulations of not applying for a special activity permit and going into a restricted and closed area that is considered sensitive to wildlife.<ref name="9News" />
