'''Meg Ryan''' (born '''Margaret Mary Emily Hyra'''; November 19, 1961)<ref>[http://www.superiorpics.com/meg_ryan Meg Ryan profile], Superiorpics.com; accessed October 5, 2014.</ref> is an American actress and producer. Ryan began her acting career in 1981 in minor roles before joining the cast of the [[CBS]] soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'' in 1982. Subsequently, she began to appear in supporting roles in films during the mid 1980s like box office hit ''[[Top Gun]]'', achieving recognition in independent films such as [[Promised Land (1987 film)|''Promised Land'']] (1987) before her performance in the [[Rob Reiner]]-directed romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989) brought her widespread attention and her first [[Golden Globe]] nomination.

Ryan subsequently established herself, both nationally and internationally,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=megryan.htm |title=Meg Ryan |publisher=box office mojo |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref> as one of the most successful actresses in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly in [[romantic comedy]] films such as ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[French Kiss (1995 film)|French Kiss]]'' (1995), ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' (1998), and ''[[Kate & Leopold]]'' (2001). Her other films include ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991), ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), ''[[When a Man Loves a Woman (film)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]'' (1994), ''[[Courage Under Fire]]'' (1996), ''[[Addicted to Love (film)|Addicted to Love]]'' (1997), ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]'' (1998), ''[[Proof of Life]]'' (2000), and ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'' (2008). In 2015, she made her directorial debut with ''[[Ithaca (film)|Ithaca]]'', a film in which she also acted.

Her father has Polish ancestry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105982,00.html|title=Educating Meg|work=People |date=August 2, 1993|access-date=November 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Graham"/><ref name=bookref1>{{cite book |title=The Hollywood Book of Breakups |author=Parish, J.R. |date=2010 |publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-111804067-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSh2HyQ8OsQC |accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref> She was raised [[Catholic]]<ref name="Davidson"/> and attended St. Pius X Elementary School in Fairfield. She has two sisters, Dana (born 1960) and Annie (born 1965), and a brother, musician Andrew Hyra (born 1963), a member of the band [[Billy Pilgrim (band)|Billy Pilgrim]]. Her parents divorced in 1976 when she was 15 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800017434/bio |title=Meg Ryan profile at |publisher=Yahoo!

==Career==

===Early work===
After her film debut in [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous]]'', Ryan played [[Betsy Stewart]] in the daytime drama ''[[As the World Turns]]'', from 1982 to 1984, and her character was featured in a [[Steve Andropoulos and Betsy Stewart|popular romantic story arc]]. 
She also appeared in some television commercials during the early 1980s for [[Burger King]] and [[Aim toothpaste]], among others. Several television films and smaller film roles followed, including appearances in ''[[Charles in Charge]]'', ''[[Armed and Dangerous (1986 film)|Armed and Dangerous]]'', ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'' and ''[[Promised Land (1987 film)|Promised Land]]''; for her role in the lattermost she received her first [[Independent Spirit Award]] nomination. In 1986, she played Carole Bradshaw, the wife of [[Naval Flight Officer]] Nick "Goose" Bradshaw (played by [[Anthony Edwards]]) in ''[[Top Gun]]''. Ryan appeared in the film ''[[Innerspace]]'' (1987) with her future husband [[Dennis Quaid]], and later in the remake of ''[[D.O.A. (1988 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1988) and in ''[[Flesh and Bone (film)|Flesh and Bone]]'' (1993).

=== 1989–1999: Commercial breakthrough ===
Her first leading role was the romantic comedy film ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), which paired her with comedic leading man [[Billy Crystal]] and earned her a [[Golden Globe]] nomination. Her portrayal of Sally Albright includes an oft-recounted scene in which her character, lunching with Crystal in [[Katz's Delicatessen]] in [[Manhattan]], theatrically demonstrates for him how easy it is for a woman to fake an [[orgasm]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Twenty-Five Years After 'When Harry Met Sally,' People Still Fake Orgasms in Katz's Deli |url=http://www.newsweek.com/twenty-five-years-later-people-still-wont-stop-faking-orgasms-katzs-deli-258596 |accessdate=13 June 2015 |publisher=newsweek.com}}</ref>

Ryan next starred in ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', which was moderately successful, and ''[[Prelude to a Kiss (film)|Prelude to a Kiss]]'', which flopped.<ref>{{cite web |title=Prelude to a Kiss |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=preludetoakiss.htm |publisher=boxofficemojo |accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> The year 1993 saw the release of the hugely successful romantic comedy ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', which paired Ryan for a second time with [[Tom Hanks]]. They had previously been paired as romantic leads in the film ''[[Joe Versus the Volcano]]''—a commercial disappointment which later developed a cult following. Hanks and Ryan would be paired for a third time in the film ''[[You've Got Mail]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan to reunite on-screen in 'Ithaca': report |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/tom-hanks-meg-ryan-reunite-screen-report-article-1.1844986 |accessdate=13 June 2015 |agency=nydailynews.com |date=26 June 2014}}</ref> She was offered the role of the protagonist [[Clarice Starling]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), but rejected it due to its gruesome and violent themes.

In 1994, Ryan took a role that differed from the romantic-comedy [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] character for which she had become famous. In [[Luis Mandoki]]'s ''[[When a Man Loves a Woman (film)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]'' (1994), a romantic social drama film also starring [[Andy Garcia]], she played an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] high-school guidance counselor. The film and her performance were both well received by critics.<ref name="Kate & Leopold 2001">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kate_and_leopold/ |title=''Kate & Leopold'' (2001) |publisher=[[Flixster]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref> One critic called the film "a first-class production, accentuated by fine performances and an unflinching script",<ref name="variety10">{{cite magazine |first=Leonard |last=Klady |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117902641.html |title=''When a Man Loves a Woman'' review |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 24, 1994 |accessdate=September 19, 2010}}</ref> and another praised Ryan for her "roller-coaster role".<ref name="variety10"/> The film was a notable success in its domestic run, grossing $50&nbsp;million in the United States alone,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1994/0WMLW.php |title=''When a Man Loves a Woman'' (1994) |publisher=The-Numbers.com |accessdate=September 19, 2010}}</ref> and garnered the actress her first [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role - Motion Picture|Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination.<ref name="awards">{{Cite web |last=Wilson |first=John |authorlink=John Wilson (Golden Raspberry) |title=29th Annual Golden Raspberry (Razzie) Award "Winners" |work=Home of the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation |publisher=Golden Raspberry Award Foundation |url=http://www.razzies.com/history/08winners.asp |accessdate=May 1, 2009|year=2009}}</ref> The same year, Ryan returned to type, starring alongside [[Tim Robbins]] in [[Fred Schepisi]]'s romantic comedy ''[[I.Q. (film)|I.Q.]]'' The film centers on a mechanic and a [[Princeton University|Princeton]] doctoral candidate who fall in love, with the aid of the graduate student's uncle, [[Albert Einstein]] (played by [[Walter Matthau]]). Ryan later won Harvard's [[Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year]] award, and ''[[People Magazine]]'' dubbed her one of "the 50 most beautiful people in the world".

In 1995, critic [[Richard Corliss]] called her "the current soul of romantic comedy". That same year, she appeared opposite [[Kevin Kline]] in [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s ''[[French Kiss (1995 film)|French Kiss]]'', a romantic comedy that catered to her "America's Sweetheart" image, and Ryan was awarded the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards#THE CRYSTAL AWARD|Crystal Award]]. (This award is given to "outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry".)<ref name="wif">{{cite web |url=http://wif.org/past-recipients |title=404 |publisher=wif.org |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724120329/http://www.wif.org/past-recipients |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

In 1996, Ryan starred in the film ''[[Courage Under Fire]]'' alongside [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Matt Damon]]. The following year, she voiced the lead role in the animated film ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'', which garnered good reviews and enjoyed box office success. She also appeared opposite [[Matthew Broderick]] in ''[[Addicted to Love (film)|Addicted to Love]]'' playing a female lead at least superficially different from her usual direction, as one of a pair of jilted lovers bent on revenge.

In 1998, she starred in two films. ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]'' drew positive reviews and became a financial success, topping nearly $200&nbsp;million worldwide. ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' once again paired Ryan with Hanks, earning her a third Golden Globe nomination and making over $250&nbsp;million worldwide. She also appeared in 1998's ''[[Hurlyburly (film)|Hurlyburly]]'' with [[Sean Penn]].

===2000–2006: Breaking away from usual roles===
Ryan's first film of the 2000s was ''[[Hanging Up]]'', a [[Diane Keaton]]-directed family comedy-drama about a trio of sisters who bond over the approaching death of their curmudgeonly father. Also starring Keaton, [[Lisa Kudrow]] and [[Walter Matthau]], the film adaptation of [[Delia Ephron]]'s 1995 novel received poor reviews from critics.

The same year, Ryan was cast in the action thriller ''[[Proof of Life]]'' with [[Russell Crowe]], directed by [[Taylor Hackford]]. In the film, she portrayed the distraught wife of a kidnapped engineer, played by [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], while relying on a resourceful troubleshooter who makes a profession of dealing with international bandits. While the film became a lukewarm critical and commercial success, grossing $63&nbsp;million worldwide, it garnered much reportage in the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press in association with Ryan and Crowe's affair.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2000/PLIFE.php |title=''Proof of Life'' (2000) |publisher=The-Numbers.com |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref> Stephen Holden, film critic for ''[[The New York Times]],'' did not think the film worked well and opined that the actors did not connect.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Stephen |last=Holden |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=Proof%20of%20Life%20%28Movie%29%20%20&title2=&reviewer=Stephen%20Holden&pdate=20001208&v_id=227134 |title=Where Cynicism Rules, Integrity Can Be Heroic |work=The New York Times |date=December 8, 2000 |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Meg Ryan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ryan in September 2006]]
A year later, she once again returned to her romantic comedy roots with ''[[Kate & Leopold]]'' (2001), alongside [[Hugh Jackman]]. A film about a British Duke who [[time travel|travels through time]] from New York in 1876 to the present and falls in love with a successful market researcher in the modern New York, the [[James Mangold]]-directed film received a mixed-to-positive response,<ref name="Kate & Leopold 2001" /> with Lael Loewenstein of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' summing it as "a mostly charming and diverting tale".<ref name="klv">{{Cite web |first=Lael |last=Loewenstein |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117916612.html |title=Also Playing |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 16, 2001 |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref> At a total gross of $70&nbsp;million, it would be Ryan's highest-grossing film of the decade.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/KALEO.php |title=''Kate & Leopold'' (2001) |publisher=The-Numbers.com |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

In 2003, Ryan broke away from her usual roles, starring alongside [[Mark Ruffalo]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] in [[Jane Campion]]'s [[erotic thriller]] film ''[[In the Cut (film)|In the Cut]]''. Co-producer [[Nicole Kidman]] had originally been cast in the lead, but the actress eventually dropped out after five years of development, leaving the role to Ryan, who appeared nude in a lengthy and rather graphic love scene for the first time in her career. Although her image-conflicting depiction earned Ryan and the film much media attention, the film failed with critics and grossed only $23&nbsp;million in theaters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/INCUT.php |title=''In the Cut'' (2003) |publisher=The-Numbers.com |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

She continued the strategy of acting against type with a leading role in [[Charles S. Dutton]]'s directorial debut ''[[Against the Ropes]]'' (2004), a fictionalized [[sport film|sport drama]] about American boxing manager [[Jackie Kallen]], the first woman to become a success in the sport. The film grossed less than $6&nbsp;million in the U.S. and was panned by critics, in part because of its resemblance to other boxing films, such as the ''[[Rocky]]'' series.

===2007–2009: Independent films===
Following a three-year hiatus, Ryan returned to film with [[Jon Kasdan]]'s 2007 independent film ''[[In the Land of Women]]''. Starring alongside [[Kristen Stewart]] and [[Olympia Dukakis]], she played Sarah Hardwicke, a mother and wife facing breast cancer, who connects with her neighbor's much younger grandson, played by [[Adam Brody]]. Released to mixed reviews by critics,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/inthelandofwomen |title=''In the Land of Women'' (2007): Reviews |accessdate=September 12, 2007 |publisher=[[CBS]] |work=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> the film grossed $17.5&nbsp;million worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=inthelandofwomen.htm |title=''In the Land of Women'' |publisher=IMDB |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=September 12, 2007}}</ref> exceeding its budget of $10&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://behindthescenestv.net/interview/interview-writer-director-jonathan-kasdan-arrives-with-in-the-land-of-women |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409110043/http://behindthescenestv.net/interview/interview-writer-director-jonathan-kasdan-arrives-with-in-the-land-of-women |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 9, 2018 |title=INTERVIEW: Writer-Director Jonathan Kasdan arrives with ''In the Land of Women'' |work=BehindScenesTV |publisher=BehindScenesTV.com |accessdate=September 4, 2010 }}</ref> Ryan received a positive response for her performance, with [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noting it "the best work [she] has done in forever".<ref>{{Cite web |first=Kenneth |last=Turan |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-land20apr20,0,2972335.story |title=''In the Land of Women'' Review |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=CalendarLive.com |date=April 20, 2007 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

Ryan's first film release of 2008 was ''[[The Deal (2008 film)|The Deal]]'', a [[satirical]] [[comedy film]] based on [[Peter Lefcourt]]'s 1991 novel of the same title about Hollywood. Directed by [[Steven Schachter]] and co-starring [[William H. Macy]], the film was shot in [[Cape Town]] and other South African locations and celebrated its world premiere at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]]. Garnering generally mixed to negative reviews, it failed to draw interest among film studios, resulting in a [[straight-to-DVD]] release in January 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Perez |last=Hilton |url=http://perezhilton.com/2009-01-27-whatever-happened-to-meg-ryans-career |title=Whatever Happened To Meg Ryan's Career??? |publisher=PerezHilton.com |date=September 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029211954/http://perezhilton.com/2009-01-27-whatever-happened-to-meg-ryans-career |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In his review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Peter Debruge said, "The characters seem to be doing all the laughing, while the general public has nothing to cling to but the horndog flirtation between mismatched leads William H.

[[File:Meg Ryan Cannes 2010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ryan at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Ryan's last film of 2008 was ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'', a remake of the [[The Women (1939 film)|1939 production]]. The all-female cast comprises [[Annette Bening]], [[Debra Messing]], and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]].<ref name="ew">{{Cite news |first=Missy |last=Schwartz |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20041695,00.html |title=Wonder Women |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> Written, produced and directed by [[Diane English]], the film centers on a group of four female [[Manhattan]] socialites whose primary interest is idle [[gossip]], with Ryan portraying a wealthy woman whose husband is cheating on her with a shop girl, played by [[Eva Mendes]]. Ryan was the first actress to join the long-delayed production, which struggled to find financing since the early 1990s, resulting in an independent production budgeted at $18&nbsp;million.<ref name="ew" /> Upon its release, ''The Women'' received a disastrous response from critics, with [[Richard Schickel]] of ''Time'' calling it "one of the worst movies I've ever seen".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Schickel |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1840522,00.html |title=''The Women'': Sex Crime |work=Time |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> The film was a financial success, however, becoming Ryan's most successful film since 2001's ''Kate & Leopold'' with a worldwide gross of $50&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/WOMEN.php |title=''The Women'' (2008) |publisher=The-Numbers.com |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

In 2009, Ryan starred alongside [[Kristen Bell]] and [[Justin Long]] in the independent comedy film ''[[Serious Moonlight (2009 film)|Serious Moonlight]]''. In this film, directed by actress [[Cheryl Hines]] and based on a screenplay by late writer [[Adrienne Shelly]], who was murdered a year prior to filming, Ryan portrayed a high-powered female attorney who learns that her husband, played by [[Timothy Hutton]], is about to leave their troubled marriage, and decides to hold him captive by duct-taping him to a toilet.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Christopher |last=Campbell |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/12/01/up-in-the-air-serious-moonlight-and-loot-in-this-weeks-unlimited/ |title=''Up In The Air'', ''Serious Moonlight'' and ''Loot'' In This Week's unLimited |publisher=MTV's Movie Blog |work=[[MTV News]] |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref> Picked up by [[Magnolia Pictures]], the production received a limited release throughout North America only and grossed less than $150,000 worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2009/SMNLT.php |title=''Serious Moonlight'' (2009) |publisher=The-Numbers.com |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref> Critical reaction to the film was generally mixed-to-negative,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/serious_moonlight/?name_order=asc |title=''Serious Moonlight'' Reviews |publisher=[[Flixster]] | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}</ref> although Ryan was praised for her "terrific" performance.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Doris |last=Toumarkine |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/serious-moonlight-film-review-1003969546.story |title=''Serious Moonlight'' – Film Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 5, 2009 |accessdate=September 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205134533/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/serious-moonlight-film-review-1003969546.story |archivedate=December 5, 2009}}</ref> Also in 2009, Ryan guest-starred on the seventh season of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.

===Directing: 2010–present===

May 26, 2011</ref>—all of which failed to materialize.

In October 2012, Ryan was featured in the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Half the Sky|Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]]''.
