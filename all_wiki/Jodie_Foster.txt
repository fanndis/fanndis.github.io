Foster began her professional career as a child model when she was three years old, and she made her acting debut in 1968 in the television sitcom ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'' In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she worked in several television series and made her film debut with [[Disney]]'s ''[[Napoleon and Samantha]]'' (1972). Following appearances in the musical ''[[Tom Sawyer (1973 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' (1973) and [[Martin Scorsese]]'s comedy-drama ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), Foster's breakthrough came with Scorsese's psychological thriller ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), in which she played a child prostitute; she received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Her other roles as a teenager include the musical ''[[Bugsy Malone]]'' (1976) and the thriller ''[[The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane]]'' (1976), and she became a popular teen idol by starring in Disney's ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (1976) and ''[[Candleshoe]]'' (1977), as well as ''[[Carny (1980 film)|Carny]]'' (1980) and ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]'' (1980).

After attending college at [[Yale University|Yale]], Foster struggled to transition into adult roles until she gained critical acclaim for playing a rape survivor in the legal drama ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'' (1988), for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She won her second Academy Award three years later for the psychological horror ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), in which she portrayed [[Clarice Starling]]. Foster made her debut as a film director the same year with ''[[Little Man Tate]]'', and founded her own production company, Egg Pictures, in 1992. The company's first production was ''[[Nell (film)|Nell]]'' (1994), in which she also played the title role, garnering her fourth nomination for an Academy Award. Her other successful films in the 1990s were the romantic drama ''[[Sommersby]]'', western comedy ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' (1994), science fiction ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), and period drama ''[[Anna and the King]]'' (1999).

Foster experienced career setbacks in the early 2000s, including the cancellation of a film project and the closing down of her production company, but she then starred in four commercially successful thrillers: ''[[Panic Room]]'' (2002), ''[[Flightplan]]'' (2005), ''[[Inside Man]]'' (2006), and ''[[The Brave One (2007 film)|The Brave One]]'' (2007).

{{main|Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan}}

During her freshman year at Yale in 1980–1981, Foster was stalked by [[John Hinckley Jr.|John W. Hinckley, Jr.]], who had developed an obsession with her after watching ''[[Taxi Driver]]''.<ref name=hbooks>Sonneborn, p. 74; Ewing & McCann, pp. 91–102</ref> He moved to New Haven and tried to contact her, both through letters and by phone.<ref name=hbooks/><ref name=trial>{{cite news|first=Stuart Jr.|last=Taylor|title=TV Barred From Tapes Of Jodie Foster Testimony|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/01/us/tv-barred-from-tapes-of-jodie-foster-testimony.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 1, 1982}}</ref> On March 30, 1981, Hinckley [[Reagan assassination attempt|attempted to assassinate]] U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], wounding him and three other people, claiming that his motive was to impress Foster.<ref name=hbooks/> The incident attracted intense media attention, and she was accompanied by bodyguards while on campus.<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name="Sonneborn, p. 74"/> Although Judge [[Barrington D. Parker]] confirmed that Foster was wholly innocent in the case and had been "unwittingly ensnared in a third party's alleged attempt to assassinate an American President", her videotaped testimony was played at Hinckley's trial.<ref name=observer/><ref name=trial/> While at Yale, Foster also had other stalkers, including a man who planned to kill her but changed his mind after watching her perform in a college play.<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name="Sonneborn, p. 74"/>

The experience was difficult for Foster, and she has rarely commented publicly about it.<ref name="NYT 1991"/> In the aftermath of the events, she wrote an essay, "Why Me?", which was published in 1982 by ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' on the condition that "there be no cover lines, no publicity and no photos".<ref name=rollingstone/> In 1991, she canceled an interview with NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction, and the producers were unwilling to change it.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chronicle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/05/style/chronicle-512691.html|work=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1991}}</ref> She discussed Hinckley with [[Charlie Rose]] of ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' in 1999, explaining that she does not "like to dwell on it too much... I never wanted to be the actress who was remembered for that event. Because it didn't have anything to do with me. I was kind of a hapless bystander. But... what a scarring, strange moment in history for me, to be 17 years old, 18 years old, and to be caught up in a drama like that."<ref name="60Minutes"/> She stated that the incident had a major impact on her career choices, and acknowledged that her experience was minimal compared to the suffering of Reagan's press secretary [[James Brady]], who was permanently disabled in the shooting and died as a result of his injuries 33 years later, and his loved ones: "whatever bad moments that I had certainly could never compare to that family".<ref name="60Minutes"/>
