==History==
The University of Chicago Medicine and Biological Sciences, one of the nation's leading academic medical institutions, was founded in 1927 when it first opened to patients. Today, it comprises the [[University of Chicago]] [[Pritzker School of Medicine]]; the University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division, a section committed to scientific discovery; and the University of Chicago Medical Center. Twelve Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine have been affiliated with the University of Chicago Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Nobel Laureates|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/about/awards/nobel.html|website=University of Chicago Medicine|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref>

In 1988, the University of Chicago Medicine decided to close its adult trauma center. At the time, the decision was made because the trauma center was losing a large amount of money and taking away resources from other specialties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagomaroon.com/2015/02/17/history-of-trauma-center-closing/|title=History of trauma center closing|website=chicagomaroon.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>

University of Chicago Medicine physicians are members of the University of Chicago Physicians Group, which includes about 900 physicians and covers the full array of medical and surgical specialties. The physicians are faculty members of the [[Pritzker School of Medicine]].

These organizations are headed by Kenneth S. Polonsky, MD, Dean of the Biological Sciences Division and the Pritzker School of Medicine, and executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the University of Chicago Medicine|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/about/index.html|website=University of Chicago Medicine website|publisher=University of Chicago Medicine|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref>

The Center for Care and Discovery (CCD) opened in 2013 and to date serves as the flagship hospital for UChicago Medicine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Center for Care and Discovery - Hyde Park - UChicago Medicine |url=https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-location/uchicago-medicine-center-for-care-and-discovery-hyde-park |website=uchicagomedicine.org |access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> The 10-story facility has 436 beds in all private rooms, 52 intensive care beds, 9 suites for advanced imaging and interventional procedures and 23 operating rooms designed to accommodate hybrid and robotic procedures.

In December 2015, the university announced plans to expand the University of Chicago Medical Center. The center now includes 188 additional beds and has increased the hospital to its biggest size since the 1970s. The expansion was in response to an increased demand for bed space, as the medical center had been operating near capacity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2016/20160510-trauma.html|title=UChicago Medicine's bold expansion plan moves forward - The University of Chicago Medicine|website=uchospitals.edu|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-u-of-c-hospital-expansion-0511-biz-20160510-story.html|title=State approves U. of C. hospital expansion, adding South Side trauma center|last=Tribune|first=Chicago|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref>

In December 2017, a new adult emergency room connected to the Center for Care and Discovery opened for patient care. Later in May 2018, the Level I trauma center completed its expansion and opened after years of campaigning and protests by area residents.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Olumhense |first1=Lisa Schencker and Ese |title=University of Chicago's new trauma center opens, with cautious optimism |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-u-of-c-trauma-center-opening-may-1-20180424-story.html |website=chicagotribune.com |access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> The center is expected to serve between 2,700 and 4,000 patients a year and is the South Side's first Level I trauma center since the late 1980s. The remainder of the expansion is expected to be finished by 2022.

As of 2019, [[National Institute of Health]] research funding reached $168 million annually.
