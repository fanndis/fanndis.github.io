A '''state visit''' is a formal visit by a [[head of state]] to a foreign country, at the invitation of the head of state of that foreign country, with the latter also acting as the [[Hospitality|official host]] for the duration of the state visit. Speaking for the host, it is generally called a '''state reception'''. State visits are considered to be the highest expression of friendly [[Bilateralism|bilateral relations]] between two [[sovereign state]]s, and are in general characterised by an emphasis on official public ceremonies.

Less formal visits than a state visit to another country with a lesser emphasis on ceremonial events, by either a head of state or a [[head of government]], can be classified (in descending order of magnitude) as either an '''official visit''', an official working visit, a working visit, a guest of government visit, or a private visit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-and-guest-of-government-visits-april-to-october-2016|title=State and Guest of Government visits - April to October 2016 - Publications - GOV.UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Moffett|first1=Julie|title=World: How The U.S. Ranks the Visits of Foreign Heads of State|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/1086035.html|accessdate=3 June 2019|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]|date=9 August 1997}}</ref>

In [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]], while heads of state in such systems of government may formally issue and accept invitations, they do so on the [[constitutional advice|advice]] of their [[head of government|heads of government]], who usually decides on when the invitation is to be issued or accepted in advance.

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] is "the most travelled head of state in the world," having made 261 official overseas visits and 96 state visits to 116 countries by the time of her [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Sophie|title=Queen's Diamond Jubilee: sixty years of royal tours|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-sixty-years-of-royal-tours/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=The Telegraph|issue=Online edition|date=11 May 2012}}</ref> Although she is sovereign of each of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, in practice, she usually performs full state visits as [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]], while the relevant [[Governor-general#Modern Commonwealth|governor-general]] undertakes state visits for his or her respective country on the sovereign's behalf. However, the Queen has occasionally made some state and official visits representing one of her other Commonwealth realms.

==Components of a state visit==
[[File:Rosalynn Carter and Jimmy Carter host state dinner for German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Mrs. Helmut Schmidt. - NARA - 175460.tif|thumb|A [[state dinner]] at the [[White House]], held for [[Helmut Schmidt]]. State dinners are a typical component of a state visit.]]
State visits typically involve some or all the following components (each host country has its own traditions):

* The visiting [[head of state]] is immediately greeted upon arrival by the host (or by a lesser [[official]] representative, if the two heads of state are to meet later at another location) and by his or her [[ambassador]] (or other [[head of mission]]) [[Diplomatic accreditation|accredited to the host country]].
* A [[21-gun salute]] is fired in honor of the visiting head of state.
* The playing of the two [[national anthem]]s by a [[military band]]. The guest country's anthem is usually played first.
* A review of a military [[guard of honour]].
* The visiting head of state is formally introduced to senior officials/representatives of the host country and the hosting head of state is introduced to the delegation accompanying the visiting head of state.
* An exchange of gifts between the two heads of state.
* A [[state dinner]], either [[white tie]] or [[black tie]], is mounted by the hosting head of state, with the visiting head of state being the guest of honor.
* A visit to the [[legislature]] of the host country, often with the visiting head of state being invited to deliver a formal address to the assembled members of the legislature.
* High-profile visits by the visiting heads of state to host country [[landmark]]s such as laying a wreath at a military shrine or [[cemetery]].
* The staging of cultural events celebrating links between the two nations.
[[File:PGHGermany123.png|thumb|The German presidential standard displayed at the [[President's Guest House]] during a German state visit to the United States. Several countries maintain guest houses used for state visits.]]
The visiting head of state is usually accompanied by a senior government minister, usually by a [[foreign minister]]. Behind the [[Protocol (diplomacy)|diplomatic protocol]], delegations made up from [[trade]] organizations also accompany the visiting head of state, offer an opportunity to network and develop economic, cultural, and social links with industry leaders in the nation being visited. At the end of a state visit, the foreign head of state traditionally issues a formal invitation to the head of state of the nation being visited who at another time in the future, would pay a reciprocal state visit.

While the costs of a state visit are usually borne by state funds of the host country, most nations host fewer than ten state visits per year, with some as few as two. Most foreign heads of state will stay in the [[official residence]] of the head of state who is hosting the state visit, in a guest house reserved for foreign visitors, or in their own nation's [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] located in the foreign nation being visited.

State visits by well-known global leaders or figures, such as [[Elizabeth II]], the [[President of the United States]] or the [[Pope]], often draw much publicity and large crowds. Occasionally, these include protesters.

==State visits by country==
===Armenia===
{{See also|List of visitors to Tsitsernakaberd}}
State visits to [[Armenia]] are held in the capital of [[Yerevan]], with a welcoming ceremony usually being held at [[Zvartnots International Airport]]. Foreign heads of state are welcomed at the [[President's Residence, Yerevan|President's Residence]] while heads of government are welcomed at the [[Prime Minister's Residence, Yerevan|Residence of the Prime Minister]]. These visits consist of the following components:

Since 1991, foreign leaders who embark on visits to Armenia have paid tribute to the victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]] at the [[Tsitsernakaberd]] complex.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Crescent and star: Turkey between two worlds|year=2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=9780374531409|page=91}}</ref> During a visit to the complex, most leaders receive a tour of the museum, plant trees near the memorial, and lay wreaths at the eternal flame.

===Belgium===
A state visit in Belgium starts with an inspection of the troops in front of the [[Royal Palace of Brussels]], whereafter the [[List of Belgian monarchs|King]] and [[List of Belgian consorts|Queen]] have a private audience with the visiting head of state and his or her spouse. The first day of the state visit traditionally comes to a close with a state banquet at the [[Castle of Laeken]], which is the official residence of the King of the Belgians.

It is customary to be awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] during state visits.

===Canada===
{{See also|List of state and official visits by Canada}}
[[File:Sergio Mattarella al Rideau Hall 09.jpg|thumb|The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] typically mounts the [[guard of honour]] during state visits to Canada, here during the visit of Italian president [[Sergio Mattarella]].]]
The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]], one of two [[Household Division|household]] [[Foot Guards]], take part in state and official visits to [[Ottawa]]. Arrival ceremonies take place at either [[Parliament Hill]] or [[Rideau Hall]], where they will be received by the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and the [[Governor General of Canada]] respectively. State visits also include a visit to the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]]. The Office of Protocol coordinates the operational aspects of state and official visits to Canada and manages all events that are related to the visit. It also defines the protocol standards for state visits of heads of state and government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=Office of Protocol of Canada|date=21 August 2018|accessdate=11 February 2019|publisher=Government of Canada|work=Global Affairs Canada}}</ref>

[[List of state and official visits by Canada|State and official visits by Canada]] are performed by the [[Monarch of Canada]] or a representative—the Governor General, a [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]], or another member of the Royal Family. The first state visit by Canada was to the United States in 1937, when the United States accorded the Governor General the equivalent status given to a visiting head of state.<ref name=GGoC>{{cite web|url=https://www.gg.ca/en/governors-general-representing-canada-home-and-abroad|title=Governors General representing Canada at home and abroad|work=Governor General of Canada|publisher=Office of the Governor General of Canada|year=2019|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref> However, the Governor General was not formally empowered to represent Canada for state visits until 1947, when the ''[[Letters Patent, 1947|Letters Patent]]'' came into effect.<ref name=GGoC/>

Tours of Canada by the Monarch of Canada (and other members of the Royal Family) are not state/official visits, as the monarch conducts their [[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal tours]] in their capacity as the Canadian head of state, and not as a foreign head of state. Additionally, because the Canadian sovereign is shared with 15 other [[Commonwealth realms]], state visits are not conducted between Canada and the other Commonwealth realms, with official visits performed by the realms' respective [[governor-general]], or [[prime minister]].

===China, People's Republic of===

As the military band plays the national anthems of the two countries, an artillery battery fires a 21-Gun Salute. After the band finishes its performance, the two leaders then inspect the guard of honour at the invitation of the guard commander. Following the inspection, both leaders embrace schoolchildren who wave flowers and the flags of both countries. At this time, the band performs a military march or folk song from the guest country. If a Prime Minister or Chancellor or Crown Prince visits China, the welcoming ceremony is held by the Premier. If a President, Governor-General or King visits, the welcoming ceremony is held by the President. 

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Honor Guard then marches off the square to the tune of the [[Military Anthem of the People's Liberation Army|March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army]]. The ceremony ends with the marching band of the PLA performing an [[Exhibition drill|exhibition of military drill]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

During state visits, national awards are presented to visiting dignitaries, including the [[Order of Friendship (China)|Order of Friendship]]. Since 1954, the State Protection Unit has provided [[motorcade]]s for visiting dignitaries traveling from the airport to their meeting place.<ref>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HEFQ5JOiNlY</ref>

Currently, only Moldovan Premier [[Maia Sandu]] and Danish Prime Minister [[Mette Frederiksen]] have had to be received under this arrangement.<ref>https://www.rferl.org/a/merkel-urges-moldova-to-speed-up-reform-pace/30058617.html</ref>
