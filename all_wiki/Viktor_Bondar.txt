From 2015 - the head of the «Party Vidrodzhennya», the нead of the deputy group «Party Vidrodzhennya».

Viktor Bondar became a [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election|presidential candidate]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukrinform.net/amp/rubric-polytics/2633573-cec-registers-30-presidential-candidates.html|title=CEC registers 30 presidential candidates|website=Ukrinform|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>

==Political views==
From July 2008 to April 2009 he was the deputy leader of the party «United Centre», the creation initiative of which belonged to the head of the administration of President Yushchenko — Viktor Baloha. Having organized the financing of a party cell in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as a result of contradictions about the role of the party in the presidential election, I wrote a letter of withdrawal from the party [2].

After the First Round of the  Ukrainian presidential election, 2010 (when President Yushchenko won only about 5% of the vote) in January 2010, Viktor Bondar began working to the victory of  Yulia Tymoshenko, despite the fact that President Viktor Yushchenko actually worked to the victory  of Yanukovych, calling on «the orange voter» to vote «against all» («the orange voter » could potentially vote precisely for Tymoshenko, and not for Yanukovych, so Yushchenko's appeal «against all» was precisely harm for Tymoshenko). February 4, 2010 President Yushchenko fired Viktor Bondar from his post as governor (the Head of the Dnipropetrovsk Regional State Administration) — the decisive Second Round of the Ukrainian presidential election, 2010 took place on February 7. And Bondar also noted that his dismissal from the post of the Head of the Regional State Administration was absolutely political and connected with the refusal to help Yushchenko-Yanukovych during the presidential elections [3].

May 26, 2010 the Cabinet of Ministers introduced the additional post of the deputy Head of the State Customs Service of Ukraine (already had six deputies) and appointed Viktor Bondar to the post according to the quota of the Communist Party of Ukraine, which was a part of the ruling coalition with the «Party of Regions»[4].

June 16, 2010 (when the first arrests of Tymoshenko's comrades began) Victor Bondar made a statement that generally he goes out of politics [5].

Nevertheless, on December 24, 2010, Bondar was arrested - the case was initiated on the grounds of crimes, provided for by Part 5 of Article 27, Part 2 of Article 194 and Article 353 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (aiding in the deliberate destruction of another's property, inflicted property damage on a particularly large scale, associated with the unauthorized granting of authority). Most experts are inclined to believe that the arrest was politically motivated and illegal. Victor Bondar was accused of complicity in the deliberate destruction of the unfinished construction of the bus terminal «Teremky» in Kyiv in 2006 (then Bondar worked in the Yekhanurov government in the position of Deputy Transport Minister of Yevhen Chervonenko), that his actions caused losses to the state in the amount of more than five and a half million hryvnias (that is, about $1 million)[6]. Prosecutor General Pshonka commented that his arrest as evidence that «the power of Yanukovych» arrests not only oppositionists, but also «officials of his government» [7]. Thus, Pshonka tried to justify the criminal actions of the then government and to divert attention from the «political» arrests of the opposition.

Bondar was under arrest for only a few days, and already on December 28, 2010 he was released under «a recognizance not to leave» [8].

Despite the “a recognizance not to leave” and the investigation, Bondar was not relieved of his post as Deputy Head of the Customs Service. March 23, 2011 by decrees of President Yanukovych, Deputies Head of the State Customs Service were dismissed from their posts: Viktor Bondar, Serhiy Somka, Ihor Tymofyeyev, Hennadiy Heorhiyenko, Pavlo Pashko, but all of them, on the orders of the Head of the State Customs Service of Ukraine Ihor Kalietnik, are intended by the directors of the departments of State Customs Service of Ukraine[9]. That is, Bondar continued to work as Director of department of the State Customs Service.

Only on September 27, 2012 it became known that in September 2011 - the case against Bondar was closed «due to a lack of evidence» [10].

In 2011-2012, Bondar did not participate in politics, but in the fall of 2012, Viktor Bondar took a part in the parliamentary elections as an «independent candidate» (registered as a non-partisan self-promoted candidate) — in the majority constituency number 191 in Western Ukraine, in the Khmelnytskyi Oblast [11]. He won the election by defeating the nominee from the Party of Regions, Mykola Derikot the Head of the Khmelnitskyi Regional State Administration [12]. Bondar in the Verkhovna Rada, along with other self-promoted activists Khmelnitskyi joined the Party of Regions. At the same time, Bondar publicly refused to join the Party of Regions itself, and also to give them his deputy card for voting [13].

But, despite the entry into the Party of Regions faction, Viktor Bondar repeatedly voted against the party majority. For example, on January 11, 2013, he voted («together with other seven deputies from the Party of Regions faction») «for the Law on the decriminalization of articles of the Criminal Code, under which Tymoshenko and Lutsenko were convicted»  [14]. Perhaps it was his firm and decisive position that provoked hostility towards to him from the side of Yanukovych's entourage.

February 19, 2014 Victor Bondar announced his withdrawal from the Party of Regions faction. He explained his step by saying that during the elections he promised to voters the European course of development of the country. But the country's leadership by its sole decision changed this course to the opposite, which almost provoked a civil war in the country.[15]. After that, Bondar became one of the co-founders of the «Sovereign European Ukraine» deputy group.

October 26, 2014 Victor Bondar won the extraordinary parliamentary elections in a one-standard district No. 191 (Khmelnytskyi Oblast) and he was elected as a people's deputy of Ukraine of the 8th convocation [16].  Bondar in the Verkhovna Rada joined to the deputy group «People's Will ».

From June 5, 2015 — the Head of the political party «Revival».

From September 5, 2017 - the Head of the deputy group «Party „Revival“».

In the [[2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] Bondar was re-elected in district № 191
