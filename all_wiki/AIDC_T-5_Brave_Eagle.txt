The '''AIDC T-5 Brave Eagle''' ({{zh|s=|t=|c=勇鷹|p=Yǒngyīng}}) is a supersonic [[advanced jet trainer]] under development by the [[Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation]] (AIDC) of [[Taiwan]].

== Development ==
=== Advanced Jet Trainer Program ===
The Advanced Jet Trainer Program (AJT) began in the early 2000s as the [[Republic of China Air Force]] sought a replacement for its fleet of [[AIDC AT-3]] and [[Northrop F-5]] advanced trainers with 66 newly built aircraft. Three designs were proposed, a modernized AT-3 branded as the AT-3 MAX, an evolution of the [[AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo|AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo]] called the XAT-5, or the [[Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minnick |first1=Wendell |title=Taiwan Exhibits New Fighter Trainers at Expo |url=https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2015/08/14/taiwan-exhibits-new-fighter-trainers-at-expo/ |website=defensenews.com |publisher=Defense News |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> In 2014 AIDC signed a memorandum of understanding with Alenia Aermacchi to assemble the M-346 in Taiwan. The engines of all M-346 are assembled in Taiwan by the International Turbine Engine Company, a joint partnership of [[Honeywell]] and AIDC.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wendell Minnick and |first1=Tom Kington |title=Taiwan Advanced Jet Trainer Nears Bidding Process |url=https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2016/08/10/taiwan-advanced-jet-trainer-nears-bidding-process/ |website=defensenews.com |publisher=Defense News |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> The MOD also evaluated the South Korean [[KAI T-50 Golden Eagle]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pocock |first1=Chris |title=Taiwan Confirms Indigenous Jet Trainer Development |url=https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-02-16/taiwan-confirms-indigenous-jet-trainer-development |website=ainonline.com |publisher=The Convention News Company, Inc. |accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref>

In 2017 it was announced that the XAT-5 had won the tender with development and production to be undertaken by a partnership of AIDC and the [[National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology]] with delivery scheduled to begin in 2026. Four prototypes are to be produced and the total program cost is projected to be TWD68.6 billion (US$2.2 billion).<ref>{{cite web |last1=J.R.

=== Naming ===
AIDC had used Blue Magpie, for the [[Taiwan blue magpie]], as the project name. However in 2018 the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] announced a contest to pick an official name for the aircraft. Taiwanese citizens are invited to submit a name with a short proposal with the winner receiving a NTD 30,000 prize.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yeh |first1=Joseph |title=Military launches naming contest for its new jets |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201811270008.aspx |website=focustaiwan.tw |publisher=Focus Taiwan |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref> On 24 September 2019, the president [[Tsai Ing-wen]] officially named the new aircraft "Brave Eagle" (''Yǒngyīng'') during first prototype aircraft roll-out ceremony.<ref name="AIDC">{{cite web|url=http://www.aidc.com.tw/en/News/386|title=Advanced Jet Trainer Rollout Ceremony|date=24 September 2019|publisher=AIDC|accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201909240008.aspx|title=Taiwan unveils prototype of indigenous advanced jet trainer|publisher=Central News Agency|work=Focus Taiwan|date=24 September 2019|accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref>

=== Production ===
In 2017, the United States approved the export of components for 132 [[Honeywell/ITEC F124]] engines for the XAT/AT-5.<ref>{{cite web |title=TRADE REGISTERS |url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php |website=armstrade.sipri.org |publisher=SIPRI |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref> In 2018, AIDC announced that the first prototype would be rolled out in September 2019 with flight tests to start in June 2020.<ref name="Janes 2018">{{cite web |last1=Grevatt |first1=Jon |title=Taiwan starts production of XAT-5 prototype |url=https://www.janes.com/article/80587/taiwan-starts-production-of-xat-5-prototype |website=janes.com |publisher=Janes |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> In 2019 Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense testified to the country’s legislature that the maiden flight is scheduled for June 2020, small scale production is to start in November 2021, and mass production is scheduled to commence March 2023.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liao |first1=George |title=Taiwan plans to start mass-producing trainer aircraft in 2023 |url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3672539 |website=www.taiwannews.com.tw |publisher=Taiwan News |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref>

== Design ==
[[File:09.24 總統出席「空軍新式高教機出廠典禮」 (48785698978).jpg|thumb|A1 Prototype]]
The design is based on the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo and shares the same engines, but will have 80% new components including a composite body. Compared to the F-CK-1 it will have advance avionics, increased fuel capacity, and be a little larger.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Banks |first1=Martin |title=In Face of Chinese ‘Aggression’ Taiwan Beefs Up its Own Defenses |url=https://intpolicydigest.org/2019/05/01/in-face-of-chinese-aggression-taiwan-beefs-up-its-own-defenses/ |website=intpolicydigest.org |publisher=International Policy Digest |accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref> The aerofoil is slightly revised, with the wings being thicker than on the F-CK-1<ref>{{cite web |title=Taiwan to purchase 66 advanced training airplanes |url=https://www.janes.com/article/73223/taiwan-makes-progress-with-new-jet-trainer-male-uav |website=janes.com |publisher=Janes |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> in order to increase stability at low speed and low altitude as well as to provide increased fuel storage.<ref name="Flight Global 2019" /> The ram air scoop of the F-CK-1 has been redesigned in partnership with the [[Eaton Corporation]] with two aluminum [[Selective laser melting|laser powder bed fusion]] printed parts replacing 22 original parts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eaton Uses Additive Manufacturing to Supply Parts to Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eaton-uses-additive-manufacturing-supply-050000932.html |website=finance.yahoo.com |publisher=Yahoo |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> [[Meggitt]] will supply the main wheels, carbon brakes and brake control systems as they do on the AT-3 and F-CK-1.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff Writer |first1=DP |title=Meggitt Begins Delivery of Braking Systems for Taiwan’s AIDC XAT-5 Blue Magpie Advanced Jet Trainer |url=https://defpost.com/meggitt-begins-delivery-of-braking-systems-for-taiwans-aidc-xat-5-blue-magpie-advanced-jet-trainer/ |website=defpost.com |publisher=Def Post |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> [[Martin-Baker]] will provide the [[ejection seat]] systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Writer |first1=Staff |title=AIDC, Martin-Baker sign deal on AJT ejection seats |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2017/12/14/2003683921 |website=www.taipeitimes.com |publisher=Taipei Times |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> More than 55% of its components are made in Taiwan.

===Avionics and sensors===
NCSIST is developing an airborne [[AESA radar]] for the T-5 Brave Eagle but private Taiwanese firm Tron Future Tech has also bid their [[gallium nitride]] based AESA for the program.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minnick |first1=Wendell |title=Taiwan AESA Radar to Challenge International Market Share |url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/taiwan-aesa-radar-challenge-international-market-share-36867 |website=nationalinterest.org |publisher=National Interest |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref> In 2019 it was announced that Pyras Technology would supply the radar and communications antennas for the platform.<ref name="Flight Global 2019" />
