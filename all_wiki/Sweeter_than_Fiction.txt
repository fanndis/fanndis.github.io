"'''Sweeter than Fiction'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for the British film ''[[One Chance (film)|One Chance]]'' (2013). The song was written and produced by Swift along with [[Jack Antonoff]], best known as the [[guitarist]] for [[indie pop]] band [[Fun (band)|Fun]], and was released through [[Big Machine Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the [[soundtrack album]] on October 21, 2013.

==Background and release==
''One Chance'' producer [[Simon Cowell]] approached Swift with the idea of becoming involved with the project. The song was co-written by [[Jack Antonoff]], who claims "Sweeter than Fiction" has a [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] vibe, and who tweeted he "[LOVED] working with" Swift.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Ivy|title=Taylor Swift Releases New Song 'Sweeter than Fiction' - Listen|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/10/21/taylor-swift-sweeter-than-fiction-listen-one-chance/|work=Hollywood Life|publisher=PMC|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>

Swift revealed in an interview with country music blog ''[[Taste of Country]]'' that she viewed the film as a love story in addition to a chronicling of a man's road to success, and approached the songwriting process from that perspective: "I’m very inspired by the concept of love. And this movie is, in a lot of ways, ... a story of the love his wife … has for him," Swift explained. "That was the story that hit me and really affected me. I wanted to tell a story musically from that perspective."<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinson|first=Christina|title=Taylor Swift Dishes on Inspiration for 'Sweeter than Fiction' at 'One Chance' Premiere|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-one-chance-sweeter-than-fiction/|work=Taste of Country|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>
