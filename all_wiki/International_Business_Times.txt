==History==
[[File:Ibtfxdrawing.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A hand-drawn blueprint, created in 2007 by Davis, outlining what would become the [[IBTimes]] FX editor]]

Founder Etienne Uzac, a native of France, came up with the idea for the global business news site while a student at the [[London School of Economics]]. He found that the strongest business newspapers had a focus on the United States and Europe and planned to provide broader geographic coverage. Uzac recruited Johnathan Davis to join him in the enterprise.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.digiday.com/publishers/the-newest-media-mogul/ | title=Company Timeline|magazine=[[Digiday]] |accessdate=September 17, 2012}}</ref> In late 2005, Uzac and Davis moved to [[New York City]] to launch the site, with Uzac primarily focused on business strategy, while Davis coded the site and wrote the first articles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/aboutus/timeline.htm | title=Company Timeline|work=International Business Times |accessdate=October 12, 2011}}</ref>

In May 2012, the company announced the appointment of [[Jeffery Rothfeder]] as [[editor-in-chief]] and the promotion of Davis from [[executive editor]] to [[chief content officer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/accomplished-news-executive-jeffrey-rothfeder-named-editor-in-chief-at-international-business-times-2012-05-23|title=Marketwatch |publisher=Marketwatch.com |accessdate=June 2, 2012 }}</ref>

On August 4, 2013, [[Newsweek Media Group|IBT Media]] announced its purchase of ''[[Newsweek]]'' and the domain newsweek.com from [[IAC (company)|IAC/InterActiveCorp]]. The purchase did not include ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/newsweek-purchased-by-international-business-times-owner/2013/08/04/403c6c10-fd2a-11e2-8294-0ee5075b840d_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805174313/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/newsweek-purchased-by-international-business-times-owner/2013/08/04/403c6c10-fd2a-11e2-8294-0ee5075b840d_story.html |archive-date=August 5, 2013 |title= Newsweek purchased by International Business Times owner |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 4, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Peter S.

From March to July 2016, IBT laid off an estimated thirty percent of its editorial staff.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Lloyd|title=Pay Up: Journalists Twitter-Shame IBT Bosses Over Severance Pay|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/29/pay-up-journalists-twitter-shame-ibt-bosses-over-severance-pay.html|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=The Daily Beast|date=July 29, 2016}}</ref> This period marked a new era for the company as it expanded into branded content and events with its sister publication ''[[Newsweek]]''. At the same time, [[Dev Pragad]], who had started the [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa]] (EMEA) business in 2009, was promoted from [[managing director]] of Europe to global CEO of ''Newsweek'' and IBT.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/media/ibt-media-layoffs-announces-leadership-team/305002/|title=IBT Media, Following Layoffs, Announces New Leadership Structure|access-date=March 31, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://digiday.com/uk/battered-us-ibt-media-chases-overseas-revenue-new-branded-content-arm/|title=Battered in the US, IBT Media is expanding in Europe|date=August 17, 2016|work=[[Digiday]]|access-date=March 31, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> This was followed in January 2017 by the appointment of [[Alan Press]] in the "newly created, strategic role of President".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=244528005|title=IBT Media, Inc.: Private Company Information|work=Bloomberg|access-date=March 31, 2017}}</ref>

In September 2018, Newsweek Media Group once again became IBT Media with ''Newsweek'' spun off as an independent company.<ref name="Newsweek IBT Media slpit" />

==Content quality==
In late 2011, Google allegedly moved the outlet's articles down in search results in response to excessive [[search engine optimization]] activity. An internal ''IBT'' memo allegedly advised ''IBT'' journalists on how to "re-work a story you've already done and re-post it in the hopes that it will chart better via Google... Some people have been just re-posting the exact same story, with a new headline. We're not doing that anymore."<ref name=guardian_unconventional />

Reporting in 2014, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' claimed that IBT journalists are subject to constant demand to produce [[clickbait]]; one former employee reportedly complained that management issued "impossible" demands, including a minimum of 10,000 hits per article, and fired those who couldn't deliver. Of 432 articles published by ''IBT Japan'' in a certain time interval, 302 were reportedly created by copying sentences from Japanese media and combining them, "collage-style", to create stories that seemed new; ''IBT Japan'' apologized for the behavior and blamed it on a contract employee.<ref name=Dooley /> Similarly, employees told ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2014 that at times they seemed to operate more as "content farms" demanding high-volume output than a source of quality journalism. At least two journalists were allegedly threatened with firing unless traffic to their articles increased sharply.<ref name=guardian_unconventional />

In 2016, ''IBT'' hired [[John Crowley (journalist)|John Crowley]], the [[The Wall Street Journal|''Wall Street Journal''<nowiki/>'s]] EMEA digital editor, as its UK editor-in-chief. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Crowley said his focus would be on helping the site break exclusives, in-depth storytelling and new forms of digital journalism. He said ''IBT'' was putting together a UK business desk and hiring an audience team." Crowley stated, "We are not a [[wire service]] or so-called [[paper of record]]... but I have a vision of where I want to take a site... we've got to have a USP (unique selling proposition)... make ourselves distinctive in journalistic terms."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Jasper|title=International Business Times appoints WSJ's John Crowley as UK editor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/24/international-business-times-wsj-john-crowley-uk-editor|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]] (UK)|date=February 24, 2016}}</ref> 

In early 2017, ''International Business Times'' UK joined a partnership along with the likes of [[Bloomberg News|''Bloomberg'']], [[Channel 4 News|''Channel 4'']] and the [[BBC News|BBC]] to work together to combat the spread of [[fake news]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://digiday.com/uk/european-newsrooms-forming-united-front-fake-news/|title=European newsrooms are forming a united front against fake news|date=March 17, 2017|work=[[Digiday]]|access-date=March 31, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>

In June 2017, Jason Murdock — who covers [[cybersecurity]] for the ''International Business Times UK'' — won Digital Writer of the year at the Drum Online Media Awards, which according to InPublishing magazine “identify the cleverest, boldest and most original purveyors of news and views from around the world.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.inpublishing.co.uk/news/articles/the_drum_online_media_awards__the_winners_11105.aspx|title=The Drum Online Media Awards – the winners|last=InPublishing|access-date=August 30, 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref>

[[Media Matters for America]], a [[progressivism|politically progressive]] journalism watchdog, labeled an ''IBT'' article linking [[Hillary Clinton]]'s policies to the gun used in the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] a "false and sloppy smear" that was based on a misreading of government documents.<ref>{{cite news|title=This False And Sloppy Smear Links Hillary Clinton To The Sandy Hook Massacre|url=https://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/04/19/false-and-sloppy-smear-links-hillary-clinton-sandy-hook-assacre/209980|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=[[Media Matters for America]]|date=April 19, 2016}}</ref>

In the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', contributing editor [[Trudy Lieberman]] credited ''IBT''{{'}}s [[David Sirota]]'s investigative reporting for helping to drive a call for reform in Connecticut health insurance regulation.<ref>{{cite news|title=How IBT's reporting is driving a controversy over a major healthcare merger in Connecticut|url=https://www.cjr.org/the_second_opinion/sirota_ct_insurance_merger.php|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]}}</ref>

==Labor relations==
Early in its history, IBT Media allegedly employed immigrant students of [[Olivet University]] who were not authorized to work in the United States to translate English content into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and other languages, paying them less than [[minimum wage]] to do so.<ref name=Dooley>{{cite news|last=Dooley|first=Ben|title=Who's Behind Newsweek?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/03/newsweek-ibt-olivet-david-jang|accessdate=October 30, 2014|newspaper=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=March 31, 2014}}</ref> In 2016, employees complained publicly about missed payroll, meager or nonexistent [[severance package]]s, and one-sided [[nondisclosure agreement]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Laid-off IBT journalists make news of their own in Twitter protest|url=https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/ibt_journalists_protest_layoffs_twitter.php|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kludt|first1=Jackie Wattles and Tom|title=IBT Media's fired workers say company has no 'human decency'|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/07/28/media/ibt-media-layoffs/|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=CNNMoney|date=July 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Relationship to "The Community"==
The nature of the connection between IBT and The Community, a Christian sect led by [[David Jang]], is disputed; IBT states that many reports about its connections to The Community are false or exaggerated.<ref name=Dooley />

Davis and Uzac both have ties to [[Olivet University]], an evangelical institution founded by  Jang. Graduates of Olivet are known to work at Newsweek Media Group, which has donated money to Olivet. Davis was formerly on faculty at Olivet, where his wife serves as university president. Uzac has served on the Olivet [[board of trustees]]; his wife has worked as [[press secretary]] for the [[World Evangelical Alliance]], of which Olivet is a member. Davis has personally endorsed the view that [[homosexuality]] can be caused by childhood [[sexual abuse]] and cured by [[conversion therapy|therapy]], although he declines to elaborate on his [[homosexuality and religion|religious views]] regarding homosexuality, stating that he separates his work from his faith.<ref name=guardian_unconventional>{{cite news|last1=Swaine|first1=Jon|title=Faith and a media icon: Newsweek's unconventional new owners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/28/newsweek-new-owners-background|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=March 28, 2014}}</ref>

''[[Christianity Today]]'' claimed in 2012 that it had obtained an email in which Davis stated that he could not join a certain Jang-affiliated organization because his "commission is inherently covert". Davis denied the claim.<ref name=guardian_unconventional /> According to ''[[Business Insider]]'', Jang's concept of journalism may involve infusing the "[[Gospel message]]" into media.<ref>{{cite news|title=Newsweek Backers Tied To Program Seeking To 'Propagate The Gospel' Through Journalism|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/olivet-university-newsweek-2014-3|accessdate=December 21, 2016|work=Business Insider}}</ref>
