'''École Polytechnique''' ({{IPA-fr|e'kɔl pɔlitɛk'nik|lang}}; also known by the nickname "'''X'''") is one of the most respected and selective elite universities in France (known as ''[[grandes écoles]]''). It is a French public institution of higher education and research in [[Palaiseau]], a suburb south of [[Paris]]. The school was a founding member of the [[University of Paris-Saclay]], but later left to join the [[Polytechnic Institute of Paris]] since summer 2019.

The school was established in 1794 by the mathematician [[Gaspard Monge]] during the [[French Revolution]],<ref>[http://www.bretagne.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/l-ecole/histoire/les-ecoles-de-l-an-iii-106752.kjsp?RH=1189690570769 Michel Nusimovici, ''Les écoles de l'an III'', 2010.]</ref> and it was once previously a military academy under [[Napoleon I]] in 1804. However, Polytechnique is no longer a military academy, although the institution is still supervised by the [[French Ministry of Defence]]. Initially located in the [[Quartier Latin|Latin Quarter]] of central Paris, the establishment's main buildings were moved in 1976 to Palaiseau on the [[plateau de Saclay|Saclay Plateau]], southwest of Paris.<ref name="WebsiteHistory">{{cite web|title=École Polytechnique – History and heritage|url=http://www.polytechnique.edu/home/about-ecole-polytechnique/history-and-heritage/|publisher=École Polytechnique|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>

It is a founding member of [[ParisTech]], a grouping of Paris-area engineering colleges established in 2007. In 2014, it became a founding member of the confederal "[[University of Paris-Saclay|University of Paris in Saclay]]". Among [[List of École Polytechnique alumni|its alumni]] are three [[Nobel prize]] winners,<ref>[[Henri Becquerel|Becquerel]], [[Maurice Allais|Allais]] and [[Jean Tirole|Tirole]].</ref> one [[Fields Medal]]ist,<ref>[[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]] (1994) ; Yoccoz was not a student at Polytechnique because he chose to be educated at [[École Normale Supérieure]] (1975-1979), but he completed his Ph.D. under [[Michael Herman (mathematician)|Michael Herman]] in 1985 in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Centre de mathématiques Laurent Schwartz|fr}} of École Polytechnique, a research centre which had been created by another Field medalist and a professor at Polytechnique : [[Laurent Schwartz]].</ref> three [[Presidents of France]]<ref>[[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (who was the nephew of [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot the physicist]] and the grandson of [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot the ''École'' founder]]), [[Albert Lebrun|Lebrun]] and [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Giscard]].</ref> and many CEOs of French and international companies. It was ranked 61st internationally by the [[QS World University Rankings]] 2021, 93rd by the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] 2020, and 2nd by the Times Higher Education Small University Rankings.<ref>[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-small-universities]</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=QS World University Rankings 2021 |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021 |accessdate=20 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=THE World University Rankings 2020 |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats |accessdate=20 June 2020}}</ref>

== History==
[[File:Arms of the École Polytechnique.svg|200px|thumb|Emblem of the school]]
[[File:Statue X DSC08329.JPG|thumb|upright|The cadets of ''Polytechnique'' rushed to the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|defence of Paris]] against the foreign armies in 1814. A statue set in the honour courtyard of the school commemorates this deed. A copy was installed in [[West Point]].]]

In 1794, The ''École centrale des travaux publics'' was founded by [[Lazare Carnot]] and [[Gaspard Monge]], during the [[French Revolution]], at the time of the [[National Convention]]. It was renamed "''École polytechnique''" one year later. In 1805, French Emperor [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] moved the École to [[Montagne Sainte-Geneviève]], in the [[Quartier Latin]] of central Paris, as a military academy and gave it its motto ''Pour la Patrie, les Sciences et la Gloire'' (For the Nation, Science, and Glory). In 1814, students took part in fighting to defend Paris from the [[Sixth Coalition]]. In 1830, fifty students participated in the [[July Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}
 
During the [[First World War]], students were mobilised and the school building was transformed into a hospital. More than two hundred students died during the war. During the [[Second World War]], the Polytechnique was moved to Lyon in the free zone. More than four hundred students died during the war ([[Free French]], [[French Resistance]], [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi camps]]). In 1970, the ''École'' became a state supported civilian institution, under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence. In 1972, female students were admitted for the first time. In 1976, the ''École'' moved from central Paris to [[Palaiseau]] in the southern suburbs. In 1985, it started awarding PhD degrees. In 1994, celebration of the bicentennial was chaired by President [[François Mitterrand]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

== Locations==
[[File:Entrée Ecole polytechnique.JPG|thumb|right|Historical entrance of the École Polytechnique Paris' campus at the junction of the rue de la Montagne Saint-Genevieve and rue Descartes]]
[[File:Campus Polytechnique.svg|thumb|right|École Polytechnique Saclay's campus map]]

===Early locations===
In 1794, ''Polytechnique'' was initially hosted in the [[Palais Bourbon]]. One year later, it moved to Hôtel de Lassay, an [[hôtel particulier]] in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris]].

===Montagne Saint-Geneviève (1805-1976)===
Napoleon moved ''Polytechnique'' to the [[Quartier Latin]] in 1805 when he set the school under a military administration. The Paris' campus takes place near the [[Panthéon]], in Descartes Street, 5. It is nicknamed "Carva" by the students.

=== Palaiseau (from 1976)===
Located in the outskirts of Paris – approximately 9 miles from the city center – ''École Polytechnique'' is a campus-based institution. It offers about teaching facilities, student housing, food services and hospitality and a range of sports facilities dedicated to the 4,600 people who live on a daily basis campus. The nearest regional train (RER) station is Lozère ([[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] line B, in zone 4). A number of buses also connects the ''Ecole Polytechnique'' with the larger RER and [[TGV]] station Massy-Palaiseau.<ref>[http://www.polytechnique.edu/accueil/vie-sur-le-campus/ École Polytechnique – Un cadre unique]. Polytechnique.edu. Retrieved on 16 June 2014.</ref> The campus is close to other scientific institutions in Saclay ([[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives]]), Orsay ([[Université Paris-Sud]]) and Bures ([[Institut des hautes études scientifiques]] and some [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] labs).

==Organization and administration==

===Specific status===
[[File:0539-14072010- preview ecran.jpg|thumb|Polytechnique flag guard on [[Bastille Day Military Parade]] 2010]]
''Polytechnique'' is a higher education establishment<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006525297 ''Code de l'éducation, L675-1'']</ref> running under the supervision of the [[Minister of Defense (France)|French ministry of Defence]], through the [[General Directorate for Armament]]<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006245718&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006052532 ''Arrêté du 12 septembre 2005''] ''relatif à l'exercice de la tutelle du ministre de la défense sur divers organismes publics confiés à la délégation générale pour l'armement, article 1''</ref> (administratively speaking, it is a national public establishment of an administrative character). It has a double status, being both an engineering school that formed civilian engineers and scientists (the quasi totality of French higher administration in technical ministries is issued from ''Polytechnique'', but also officers for the three French armies. These two components being part of the same project of providing French state with a scientific and technical elite. These two components, formation of civil servants and officers, have weakened after 1950, and nowadays only 10 to 20% of the school students take place in the ranks of the administration or the army (whereas 20% go into research and the rest in engineering or management jobs) {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}.

Though no longer a [[military academy]], it is headed by a general officer (as of 2012, by a [[:fr:Ingénieur du corps de l'armement|General engineer of Armament]], whereas previous directors were generally Army generals), and employs military personnel in executive, administrative and sport training positions.<ref>''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006542786&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005622333 Décret n°96-1124 du 20 décembre 1996] relatif à l'organisation et au régime administratif et financier de l'École polytechnique''</ref> Both male and female French undergraduate ''polytechniciens'' are regular officers<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000019478016 Décret n° 2008-960 du 12 septembre 2008] fixant certaines dispositions d'ordre statutaire applicables aux élèves français de l'École polytechnique</ref> and have to go through a period of military training before the start of studies.<ref>[http://www.polytechnique.edu/page.php?MID=173 First Period : General Education], web site</ref><ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000591004 Arrêté du 14 août 2001] ''relatif à la formation militaire et à la formation à l'exercice des responsabilités des élèves français de l'École polytechnique prévues à l'article 2 du décret n° 2000-900 du 14 septembre 2000 fixant certaines dispositions d'ordre statutaire applicables aux élèves français de l'École polytechnique''</ref>

However, the military aspects of the school have lessened with time, with a reduced period of preliminary military training, and fewer and fewer students pursuing careers as military officers after leaving the school. {{anchor|Uniform}}On special occasions, such as the military parade on the [[Champs-Élysées]] on [[Bastille Day]], the ''polytechniciens'' wear the 19th-century-style ''grand uniform'', with the ''[[bicorne]]'', or [[cocked hat]], but students have not typically worn a uniform on campus since the elimination of the 'internal uniform' in the mid-1980s. The students also wear ''grand uniform'' in day-use for special events on the campus, such as important conferences, formal events, or important lessons.

=== Activities and teaching staff===
Polytechnique has a combined undergraduate-graduate general engineering teaching curriculum as well as a graduate school. In addition to the faculty coming from its local laboratories, it employs many researchers and professors from other institutions, including other CNRS, INRIA and CEA laboratories as well as the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and nearby institutions such as the [[Supélec|École Supérieure d'Électricité]] (''Supélec''), the [[École supérieure d'optique|Institut d'Optique]] or the [[Paris-Sud 11 University|Université Paris-Sud]], creating a varied and high-level teaching environment.<ref>[http://www.polytechnique.edu/page.php?MID=30 Partners], official web site</ref>

Contrary to French public universities, the teaching staff at Polytechnique are ''not'' civil servants (''fonctionnaires'')<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006369988&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006065849 Décret 87-16 du 14 janvier 1987]: by exception to the general rule that staff in public establishments of an administrative character are civil servants, the teaching staff of Polytechnique is hired on contracts.</ref> but contract employees operating under regulations different from those governing university professors. An originality of Polytechnique is that in addition to full-time teaching staff (''exercice complet''), who do research at the École in addition to a full teaching service, there are partial-time teaching staff (''exercice incomplet'') who do not do research on behalf of the École and carry only a partial teaching load.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000400226 Décret n°2000-497 du 5 juin 2000] fixant les dispositions applicables aux personnels enseignants de l'École polytechnique</ref> Part-time teaching staff are often recruited from research institutions (CNRS, CEA, INRIA...) operating inside the École campus, in the Paris region, or even sometimes elsewhere in France.

== Academic programs==
[[File:Mandelbrot p1130876.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benoît Mandelbrot]] during his speech at the ceremony when he was made an officer of the Legion of Honour on 11 September 2006, at the École polytechnique]]

=== The ''<nowiki/>'Polytechnicien Engineer''' program ===
The program awards the prestigious ''[[diplôme d'ingénieur]]'' degree, and is selective upon entry. The subjects are often including advanced topics beyond one's specialty, and the course is centered around a generalized education for cross fertilization purposes between different fields.

In addition to the 2000 polytechnic engineer students (yearly class size of 500), the institution has about 439 master students and 572 doctoral students, for a total enrollment of 2,900.<ref name="WebsiteAbout"/>

==== Admission====
[[File:0094 dre 28092 preview ecran.jpg|thumb|right|Foreign students of the École]]
The undergraduate admission to Polytechnique in the ''polytechnicien'' cycle is made through two ways: the first pathway which is a selective examination which requires at least two years of intensive preparation after high school in ''[[classes préparatoires]]'', and the other pathway by following undergraduate study at another university. Admission includes a week of written examinations during the spring followed by oral examinations that are handled in batches over the summer.<ref>[http://www.polytechnique.edu/page.php?MID=29 The French 'Grandes Écoles'], École Poytechnique web site</ref>

About 400 French nationals are admitted to the school each year.<ref>Until 1988, the number of newly admitted French students was around 300 on a yearly basis ; and until 1952, it was between 200 and 250.</ref> Foreign students who have followed a ''classe préparatoire'' curriculum (generally, French residents or students from former French colonies in Africa) can also enter through the same competitive exam (they are known as "EV1"). Other foreign students can also apply for the ''polytechnicien'' cycle through a "second track" ("EV2") following undergraduate studies. In total, there are about 100 foreign students admitted to this cycle each year.<ref name="WebsiteInternational">{{cite web|title=An International Institute|url=http://www.polytechnique.edu/home/international-affairs/an-international-institute/|publisher=Ecole Polytechnique|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref> 
Foreign students from other universities in Europe or the USA may also be accepted to study undergraduate courses as a exchange program at polytechnique for a semester or one year, without being part of the ''polytechnicien'' cycle.<ref>[http://www.polytechnique.edu/page.php?MID=35 International Exchange Program]</ref>

==== Curriculum====
Four years of study are required for the engineering degree:<ref>[http://www.polytechnique.edu/home/curriculum-and-programs/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program-24180.kjsp?RH=1255531167452 Ingénieur Polytechnicien Program], an English-language page from the school's website, describing the engineering degree.</ref> one year of [[military service]] (for French nationals only) and scientific "common curriculum" (eight months and four months, respectively), one year of multidisciplinary studies, and one year of specialized studies ("majors"). With the X2000 reform, a fourth year of studies, in another institution than Polytechnique, was introduced.

[[File:Présentation au drapeau 2012 École polytechnique.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Students wearing the uniform of Polytechnique]]
;First year
The curriculum begins with eight months of compulsory military service for students of French nationality. In the past, this service lasted 12 months and was compulsory for all French students; the suppression of the [[Conscription|draft]] in France made this requirement of Polytechnique somewhat anachronistic, and the service was recast as a period of "human and military formation". All the French students spend one month together in [[La Courtine]] in a military training center. By the end of this month, they are assigned either to a civilian service or to the [[French Army|Army]], [[French Navy|Navy]], [[French Air Force|Air Force]] or [[Gendarmerie]]. Students who are assigned to a military service complete a two-month military training in French officer schools such as [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] or [[École Navale]]. Finally, they are spread out over a wide range of units for a five-month assignment to a French military unit (which can include, but is not limited to, infantry and artillery regiments, naval ships and air bases).<ref name="pdfguide">{{cite web|url= http://www.polymedia.polytechnique.fr/EnLignes/Files/ens_07_08_US.pdf |title=Ingenieur Polytechnicien }}&nbsp;{{small|(5.79&nbsp;MB)}} p. 74</ref>
While French students stay under military status during their studies at Polytechnique, and participate in a variety of ceremonies and other military events, for example national ceremonies, such as those of Bastille Day or anniversaries of the [[armistice]]s of the [[World War]]s, they do not undergo military training per se after having completed their service in the first year.<ref name="pdfguide"/> They receive at the end of the first year the [[#Uniform|full dress uniform]], which comprises black trousers with a red stripe (a skirt for females), a coat with [[brass]] buttons and a belt, a [[small sword]] and a [[cocked hat]] (officially called a ''[[bicorne]]''). Francophone foreign students do a civilian service. Civilian service can, for instance, consist of being an assistant in a high school in a disadvantaged French suburb.

Then, a four-month period begins in which all students take the same five courses: Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and Economics.

;Second year
The second year is a year of multidisciplinary studies. The set of disciplines spans most areas of science (mathematics, applied mathematics, mechanics, computing science, biology, physics, chemistry, economics) and some areas in the humanities (foreign languages, general humanities...). Students have to choose twelve courses in at least five different disciplines.

;Third year
In the third year, students have to choose an in-depth program (''programme d'approfondissement''), which often focuses on a discipline or sometimes an interdisciplinary subject. This year is ended by a research internship (four to six months).

;Fourth year
The fourth year is the beginning of more specialized studies: students not entering a Corps de l'État must join either a Master's program, a doctorate program, another [[ParisTech]] college or institute such as the [[Mines ParisTech|École des mines de Paris]] or [[École nationale de la statistique et de l'administration économique|ENSAE]], or a specialization institute such as [[Supaéro]] in Toulouse or [[IFP School|ENSPM]] in Rueil-Malmaison. The reason for this is that the generic education given at Polytechnique is more focused on developing thinking skills than preparing for the transition to an actual engineering occupation, which requires further technical education.

==== Class rank and career path====
Grades of the second year of the curriculum are used to rank the students. Traditionally, this individual exit ranking had a very high importance for French students in École Polytechnique, and some peculiarities of the organizations of studies and grading can be traced to the need for a fair playing ground between students.

For French nationals, this ranking is actually part of a government recruitment program: a certain number of seats in civil or military Corps, including elite civil servant Corps such as the [[Corps des Mines]] or [[Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests]], are open to the student body each year. These specific civil servant corps, that provide the top managers of public administration, are only opened to ''Polytechnique'' students (and recently very few students from [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]]). At some point during their course of study, students specify a list of Corps that they would like to enter in order of preference, and they are enrolled into the highest one according to their ranking. The next stepping stone for these French graduates in Polytechnique, or ''polytechniciens'', on this path is to enter one of four technical civil service training schools: the [[Mines ParisTech|École des mines]], the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées|École des ponts et chaussées]], the [[Télécom ParisTech]], the [[ENSTA Paris]] or the [[École nationale de la statistique et de l'administration économique|ENSAE]], thus joining one of the civil service bodies known as the ''[[French Civil Service#Great corps of the State|grands corps techniques de l'État]]''. Those who pursue this path are known as [[X-Mines]], [[X-Ponts]], [[X-Télécoms]] and [[X-INSEE]], respectively, with the X prefix, for Polytechnique, identifying them as the most particularly top qualified elite members of Corps among all other graduates of the Polytechnique.

Since the X2000 reform, the importance of the ranking has lessened. Except for the Corps curricula, universities and schools where the Polytechniciens complete their educations now base their acceptance decisions on transcripts of all grades.

Of the 47% of graduates which decide to pursue a professional career in the private sector, the majority (58%) is based in the [[Paris metropolitan area|Greater Paris]] area, 8% in the rest of France, while 34% is based outside of France. Only 12% of the cohort works under a non-French work contract. Polytechnique students earn on average €44,000 a year after graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 20 des écoles d'ingénieurs qui paient le mieux à la sortie |url=https://start.lesechos.fr/etudes-formations/universites-grandes-ecoles/top-20-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs-qui-paient-le-mieux-a-la-sortie-7372.php |website=Les Echos |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>

==== Tuition and financial obligations====
For French nationals who gain admission to Polytechnique, tuition is free as long as the full curriculum is completed, and additional monetary allowance is received throughout the school years at the level of a reserve officer in training. French students, through the student board (''Caisse des élèves'' or ''Kès''), can redistribute a part of this money to foreign students.

There is no particular financial obligation for students following the curriculum, and then entering an application school or graduate program that Polytechnique approves of. However, French students who choose to enter a civilian or military corps after Polytechnique are expected to complete 10 years of public service following their admission to the school (i.e. their 3 years at school count towards their time of service).
If a student enters a Corps but does not fulfill those 10 years of public service (e.g. resigns from his or her Corps), the tuition fees are due to the school. Sometimes, when an alumnus quits a Corps to join a private company, that company or the alumni will pay for the tuition fees which are then called the ''pantoufle'' (slipper).{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

=== Bachelor program===

The Bachelor is a three-year program fully taught in English which opened in 2017. Either French nationals or international students are eligible. Applications are opened to final year high school students. Selection is made through an online application file and an oral interview.<ref>https://portail.polytechnique.edu/bachelor/en/admissions/interview</ref> During the first year of the programme, students follow a pluridisciplinary curriculum based on mathematics. On the second year, students have to choose between three double majors (Maths-Physics, Maths-Economics, Maths-Computer Science).

=== Master's program===
Ecole Polytechnique organizes various [[Master's degree|Master]]'s programmes (which are more specialized trainings compared to the Polytechnien Engineer programme), by itself or in association with other schools and universities (in the Paris region, [[École Normale Supérieure]], [[Université Paris-Sud]], [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Université Paris VI]], [[École Supérieure d'Électricité]] (''Supélec''), other member institutions of [[ParisTech]], Toulouse area and foreign partner universities) on a wide variety of topics. Previous Polytechnicien undergraduates make up about one half of the students. The following Master's programmes are offered:

* Applied Mathematics (Mathematics and Modelling – Probability Theory and Finance – Probability Theory and Aleatory Models)
* Chemistry (Molecular Chemistry)
* Complex Information Systems (Design and Management of Complex Information Systems)
* Computer Science (Fundamental Computer Science)
* Economics (Quantitative Economics & Finance [M1] – Economic Analysis and Policy – Economics of Energy, Environment, Sustainable Development – Economics of Markets and Organizations)
*Electrical Engineering 
* Mathematics (Analysis, Arithmetic and Geometry)
* Mechanics (Multiscales and Multiphysics Modeling of Materials and Structures – Materials and Structural Mechanics – Sustainable Building Materials – Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications – Oceans, Atmosphere, Climate, Space Observations)
* Molecular and Cellular Biology (Structural and Functional Engineering of Biomolecules)
* Physics and Applications (Fundamental Concepts in Physics: Theoretical, Quantum, Solid State, Liquid & Soft Matter Physics – Optics, Matter and Plasmas – Materials Science and Nano-Objects – Fusion Sciences – Quantum Devices – Nanosciences – High Energy Physics)
* Sciences, Technologies, Society (Project, Innovation, Conception – Network Industry and Digital Economy – LoPHiSS/Science of Cognition & Complex Systems)

Polytechnique also takes part in two degrees awarded by [[ParisTech]]:
* Nuclear Energy
* Transportation and Sustainable Development: Master ParisTech – Fondation Renault

Most master courses are taught in English.

[[File:Campus Ecole polytechnique de palaiseau.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the École polytechnique campus]]

=== Doctoral program===
The school also has a doctoral program open to students with a master's degree or equivalent.<ref>[http://www.polytechnique.edu/page.php?MID=21 Admission] École Polytechnique web site</ref> Doctoral students generally work in the laboratories of the school; they may also work in external institutes or establishments that cannot, or will not, grant doctorates.

About 40% of doctoral students come from abroad.<ref name="WebsiteAbout"/>

=== Research centers===
Polytechnique has many research laboratories operating in various scientific fields ([[physics]], mathematics, [[computer science]], economics, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], etc.), most operated in association with national scientific institutions such as [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|CNRS]], [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|CEA]], or also [[INRIA]].

== People==

=== Student life===
Students are represented by a board of 16 students known as "la Kès", elected each November. La Kès manages the relationships with teachers, management, alumni and partners. It publishes a weekly students paper, ''InfoKès''.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== Sports ===

Sports are a large part of the X life, as it is required for all students (except those in exchange programs) to do 6 hours of sport a week.  There are competitive sports and club sports ranging from parachuting and judo to circus or hiking.  There are two swimming pools, dojo and fencing rooms, and an equestrian center on campus.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The "Jumping de l'X" is an international jumping competition hosted by the school.

==Criticisms==

French ''[[grandes écoles]]'', including École polytechnique, are criticized for being "elitist" and therefore lacking diversity within its students' cohorts. In particular, the [[INSEE]] has found that children of parents who work in the national education or are directors are more likely to join the ''écoles'' than children of families with lower incomes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Les inégalités sociales d'accès aux grandes écoles - Insee |publisher=INSEE |url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/fichier/1375870/es361b.pdf |accessdate=20 June 2020}}</ref> A more recent report found that children of white-collar workers are 50 times more likely to be at Ecole polytechnique than children of blue-collar workers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Des classes préparatoires et des grandes écoles toujours aussi fermées |url=https://www.inegalites.fr/Des-classes-preparatoires-et-des-grandes-ecoles-toujours-aussi-fermees |website=Inegalites |accessdate=20 June 2020}}</ref>
