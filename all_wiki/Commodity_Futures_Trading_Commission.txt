The '''Commodity Futures Trading Commission''' ('''CFTC''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the US government]] created in 1974, that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, which includes [[futures contract|futures]], [[Swap (finance)|swaps]], and certain kinds of [[option (finance)|options]].

The Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA"), {{UnitedStatesCode|7|1}} ''et seq.'', prohibits fraudulent conduct in the trading of futures, swaps, and other derivatives.  The stated mission of the CFTC is to promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cftc.gov/About/MissionResponsibilities/index.htm|title=Mission & Responsibilities {{!}} U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION|website=cftc.gov|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> After the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and since 2010 with the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], the CFTC has been transitioning to bring more transparency and sound regulation to the multitrillion dollar swaps market.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news |last1= Ackermann |first=Andrew |date=April 9, 2014 |title=Senate Panel Approves Three Nominees to CFTC – WSJ  |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB20001424052702304819004579489384108138464 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019105655/https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB20001424052702304819004579489384108138464 |archive-date=October 19, 2015 |access-date=April 14, 2018|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

==History==

[[Futures contracts]] for agricultural [[commodities]] have been traded in the U.S. for more than 150 years and have been under federal regulation since the 1920s.<ref>''See'' the [[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and [[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]] 262 US 1 (1923).</ref> The [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 set the basic authority and was changed by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).<ref>{{CRS|article = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition |url=http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|author= {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }} Jasper Womach |publisher=ncseonline.org|year=2005}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftchome.htm |publisher=CFTC |title=About}}</ref>

Since the 1970s,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Futures Markets: Their Purpose, Their History, Their Growth, Their Successes and Failures |author=Dennis W. Carlton |journal=Journal of Futures Markets |year=1984 |volume=4 |number=3 |pages=237–71 |doi=10.1002/fut.3990040302|id={{ProQuest|228205962}} }}</ref> trading in futures contracts has rapidly expanded beyond traditional physical and agricultural commodities into a vast array of financial instruments, including foreign currencies, U.S. and foreign government securities, and U.S. and foreign stock indices.

Congress created the CFTC in 1974 as an independent federal regulatory agency. The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974]] (P.L. 93-463) created the CFTC to replace the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Commodity Exchange Authority]].  The Act made extensive changes to the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936, which itself amended the original [[Grain Futures Act of 1922]].  (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{CRS|article = Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition|url = http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf|author= {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }} Jasper Womach |year=2005}}</ref>

The CFTC's mandate was renewed and expanded in December 2000 when Congress passed the [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]], which instructed the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and the CFTC to develop a joint regulatory regime for [[single-stock futures]], the products of which began trading in November 2002.

In 2010, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] expanded the CFTC's regulatory authority into the [[derivatives market|swaps markets]]. The swaps markets currently have a notional value of more than $400 trillion.

==Regulated markets==
The CFTC oversees the derivatives markets by encouraging their competitiveness and efficiency, ensuring their integrity, protecting market participants against manipulation, abusive trading practices, fraud, and ensuring the financial integrity of the [[Clearing (finance)|clearing process]]. The CFTC generally does not directly regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, with the exception of newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants, for whom it sets capital standards pursuant to Dodd-Frank.<ref name=murphy>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Edward V|title=Who Regulates Whom and How?

As of 2014 the CFTC oversees 'designated contract markets' (DCMs) or [[exchange (organized market)|exchanges]], [[Swap Execution Facility|swap execution facilities]] (SEFs), derivatives [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing organizations]], [[Trade Repository|swap data repositories]] (SDRs), [[derivative|swap]] dealers, [[futures commission merchant]]s, [[commodity pool operator]]s and other intermediaries. The CFTC coordinates its work with foreign regulators, such as its UK counterpart, the [[Financial Conduct Authority]], which supervises the [[London Metal Exchange]].<ref name=McGonagle>{{cite web|title=Testimony of Vincent McGonagle, Director Division of Market Oversight, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Before the Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection Subcommittee Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs |url=https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamcgonagle011514|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref>

===Over-the-counter derivatives===
[[File:Brooksley Born.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brooksley Born]]]]
In 1998 CFTC chairperson [[Brooksley Born|Brooksley E.

Two actions by the CFTC in 1998 led some market participants to express concerns that the CFTC might modify the "Swap Exemption" and attempt to impose new regulations on the swaps market.<ref name="wg_otc_deriv">{{citation|title=Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act |url=http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/otcact.pdf |publisher=President's [[Working Group on Financial Markets]] |work=press release |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013165049/http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/otcact.pdf |archivedate=October 13, 2010 }}</ref> First, in a February 1998 comment letter addressing the SEC's "broker-dealer lite" proposal, the CFTC stated that the SEC's proposal would create the potential for conflict with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to the extent that certain OTC derivative instruments fall within the ambit of the CEA and are subject to the exclusive statutory authority of the CFTC.<ref>Letter from Jean A. Webb, Secretary, CFTC, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (February 26, 1998).</ref>

In May 1998 the CFTC issued a 'concept release' requesting comment on whether regulation of OTC derivatives markets was appropriate and, if so, what form such regulation should take.<ref>Over-the-Counter Derivatives, 63 Fed. Reg. 26,114 (May 12, 1998).</ref> Legislation enacted in 1999 at the request of the [[US Treasury]], the [[Federal Reserve Board]], and the SEC limited the CFTC's rulemaking authority with respect to swaps and hybrid instruments until March 30, 1999, and froze the pre-existing legal status of swap agreements and hybrid instruments entered into in reliance on the 'Swap Exemption', the 'Hybrid Instrument Rule', the 'Swap Policy Statement, or the 'Hybrid Interpretation'.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ277/html/PLAW-105publ277.htm | title= Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, § 760, as enacted in Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub.

Shortly after Congress had passed this legislation prohibiting CFTC from regulating derivatives, Born resigned.<ref name="the_warning"/> She later commented the failure of [[Long-Term Capital Management]] and the subsequent bailout as being indicative what she had been trying to prevent.<ref name="the_warning"/><ref group=notes>Born was the focus of an October 2009 Frontline documentary titled "The Warning" and was also chronicled in the documentary ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]''.

===Regulating digital currencies===
In March 2014 the CFTC acknowledged it was considering the regulation of Bitcoin.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. swaps watchdog says considering bitcoin regulation|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-bitcoin-regulation-idUSBREA2A1W020140311 |accessdate=March 11, 2014|newspaper=Reuters.com|date=March 11, 2014}}</ref> The CFTC has since taken the position that Bitcoin is a commodity under the CEA. In October 2019, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert declared that ether was also a commodity under the CEA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cftc-says-cryptocurrency-ether-is-a-commodity-and-is-open-to-ether-derivatives-133455545.html|title=CFTC says cryptocurrency ether is a commodity, and ether futures are next|website=finance.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>

In 2015, the CFTC ruled that for purposes of trading, cryptocurrencies were legally classified as commodities.<ref>{{cite web |title=A CFTC Primer on Virtual Currencies |url=https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/documents/file/labcftc_primercurrencies100417.pdf |website=U.S. Consumer Commodities Trading Commission |publisher=U.S. Government |accessdate=7 February 2019}}</ref> However, in view of market volatility and other factors, the CFTC noted several risks associated with trading virtual currencies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understand the Risks of Virtual Currency Trading |url=https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@customerprotection/documents/file/customeradvisory_urvct121517.pdf |website=Commodities Futures Trading Commission |accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref> In 2017, the CFTC cited the US SEC’s warning against digital token sales and initial coin offerings (ICOs) that can “improperly entice investors with promises of high returns”.<ref>{{cite web |title=Investor Bulletin: Initial Coin Offerings |url=https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_coinofferings |publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=16 November 2018}}</ref> In recent years, the CFTC has expanded its efforts to civilly prosecute fraud and misappropriation in the digital asset markets.

==Organization==
===The Commission===
Based in Washington, D.C., the CFTC maintains regional offices in Chicago, New York and Kansas City, Missouri. The Commission consists of five [[Commissioners of the CFTC|Commissioners]] appointed by the President of the United States to serve staggered five-year terms. The President, with the consent of the [[United States Senate]], designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairman. No more than three commissioners at any one time may be from the same political party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/2|title=7 U.S. Code § 2 - Jurisdiction of Commission; liability of principal for act of agent; Commodity Futures Trading Commission; transaction in interstate commerce|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>

==Funding/budget==
Unlike the other four main financial regulators, the CFTC does not have self-funding. A transaction fee has been "requested" for several years but Congress has not taken any legislative action. During the government shut down in October 2013, SEC and Federal Reserve stayed open, but "futures and most swaps markets were left with essentially no cop on the beat".<ref name=Chilton />

In 2007, the CFTC's  budget was $98 million and it had 437 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). After 2008, funding increased by 80% to $205 million and 687 FTEs for fiscal year (FY) 2012, but was cut to $180.4 million and 682 FTEs for FY 2013.<ref>{{cite news |title=House panel sticks with CFTC funding cut|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/19/us-usa-cftc-funding-idUSBRE85I1FD20120619|accessdate=March 14, 2014|newspaper=Reuters.com|date=Jun 19, 2012|quote=Georgia Republican Jack Kingston faulted the CFTC for not preventing or foreseeing the collapse of M.F.

In February 2014, Commissioner Scott D.
