Additionally, [[Omotic languages]] are spoken by ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions. [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] are also spoken by the nation's [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic minorities. [[Oromo language|Oromo]] is the most populous language by native speakers, while [[Amharic]] is the most populous by number of total speakers. [[Ge'ez]] remains important as a [[liturgical language]] for both the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and for the Beta Israel.

A majority of the population adheres to [[Christianity]] (mainly the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[P'ent'ay]]), and the historical Kingdom of Aksum was one of the first states to officially adopt the religion. A third follow [[Islam]], primarily [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]. The country is the site of the Islamic [[Migration to Abyssinia]] and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa, at [[Negash]]. A substantial population of Ethiopian [[Jews]], known as [[Bete Israel]], also resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s.<ref>Weil, Shalva (2008) "Jews in Ethiopia", pp. 467–75 in ''Encyclopaedia of the Jewish Diaspora'', Vol. 2.

==Etymology==

The [[Greek language|Greek]] name [[Aethiopia|Αιθιοπία]] (from {{lang|grc|Αιθίοψ}}, ''Aithiops'', "an Ethiopian") is a compound word, derived from the two Greek words, from {{lang|grc|αἴθω}} + {{lang|grc|ὤψ}} (''aitho'' "I burn" + ''ops'' "face"). According to the [[A Greek–English Lexicon|Liddell-Scott Jones Greek-English Lexicon]], the designation properly translates as ''Burnt-face'' in noun form and ''red-brown'' in adjectival form.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%232329&redirect=true |contribution=Aithiops|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus|accessdate=16 March 2009}}</ref> The historian [[Herodotus]] used the appellation to denote those parts of Africa South of the [[Sahara]] that were then known within the [[Ecumene]] (inhabitable world).<ref name=Herodotus1>For all references to Ethiopia in Herodotus, see: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/nebrowser?query=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&id=tgn%2C7000489 this list] at the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu Perseus project].</ref> However, the Greek formation may be a [[folk etymology]] for the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] term ''athtiu-abu'', which means 'robbers of hearts'.<ref>Partridge, Eric. Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. 1966, p. 188.</ref> This Greek name was borrowed into [[Amharic language|Amharic]] as ኢትዮጵያ, ''ʾĪtyōṗṗyā''.

In [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Roman Empire|Roman]] epigraphs, ''Aethiopia'' was a specific toponym for ancient [[Nubia]].<ref name="Hatke">{{cite book|last1=Hatke|first1=George|title=Aksum and Nubia: Warfare, Commerce, and Political Fictions in Ancient Northeast Africa|date=2013|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-6066-6|pages=52–53|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=PA4UCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52}}</ref> At least as early as c. 850,<ref>[[Etymologicum Genuinum]] s.v. Αἰθιοπία; see also [[Aethiopia]]</ref> the name ''Aethiopia'' also occurs in many translations of the [[Old Testament]] in allusion to Nubia. The ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts identify Nubia instead as [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]].<ref>Cp. Ezekiel 29:10</ref> However, in the [[New Testament]], the Greek term Aithiops does occur, referring to a servant of the [[Kandake]], the queen of Kush.<ref>Acts 8:27</ref>

Following the Hellenic and Biblical traditions, the [[Monumentum Adulitanum]], a third century inscription belonging to the [[Aksumite Empire]], indicates that Aksum's then ruler governed an area which was flanked to the west by the territory of Ethiopia and Sasu. The Aksumite King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] would eventually conquer Nubia the following century, and the Aksumites thereafter appropriated the designation "Ethiopians" for their own kingdom. In the [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] version of the Ezana inscription, Aἰθιόποι is equated with the unvocalized ''Ḥbšt'' and ''Ḥbśt'' (Ḥabashat), and denotes for the first time the highland inhabitants of Aksum. This new demonym would subsequently be rendered as '''ḥbs'' ('Aḥbāsh) in [[Sabaic language|Sabaic]] and as ''Ḥabasha'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name="Hatke"/>

In the 15th-century Ge'ez ''[[Book of Aksum]]'', the name is ascribed to a legendary individual called ''[[Ityopp'is]]''. He was an extra-Biblical son of [[Cush (Bible)|Cush, son of Ham]], said to have founded the city of [[Axum]].<ref name="Agrvt">{{cite book|title=Africa Geoscience Review, Volume 10|date=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>

In English, and generally outside of Ethiopia, the country was once historically known as Abyssinia. This [[toponym]] was derived from the Latinized form of the ancient ''Habash''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schoff|first1=Wilfred Harvey|title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: travel and trade in the Indian Ocean|date=1912|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|page=62|url=https://archive.org/stream/periplusoferythr00schouoft#page/62/mode/2up|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>

Several important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of&nbsp;[[palaeontology]]. The oldest [[Hominidae|hominid]] discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2&nbsp;million year old ''[[Ardipithecus|Ardipithicus ramidus]]'' ([[Ardi]]) found by [[Tim D.

===Antiquity===
{{Main|Dʿmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}
[[File:ET Axum asv2018-01 img37 Stelae Park.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Obelisk of Aksum]]]]

Around the 8th century BC, a kingdom known as [[Dʿmt]] was established in [[Tigray Region|Tigray]], in northern Ethiopia, and [[Eritrea]]. The polity's capital was located at [[Yeha]], in northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]]-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the Red Sea.<ref name="Munro-Hay57"/>

Other scholars regard Dʿmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local [[Agaw people]]s and Sabaeans from [[South Arabia]]. However, [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]], one of the [[South Semitic languages]]. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed.<ref>Tamrat, Taddesse (1972) ''Church and State in Ethiopia: 1270–1527''. London: Oxford University Press, pp. 5–13.</ref><ref>Uhlig, Siegbert (ed.) (2005) ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]'', "Ge'ez". Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, p. 732.</ref> Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.<ref name="Munro-Hay57"/>
[[File:KingEndybisEthiopia227-235CE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aksumite currency]] of the Aksumite king [[Endubis]], 227–35, at the [[British Museum]]. The inscriptions in [[Ancient Greek]] read "ΑΧΩΜΙΤΩ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ" ("KING OF AXUM") and "ΕΝΔΥΒΙΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ" ("KING ENDUBIS"), the Greek language was the [[lingua franca]] by that time so the [[Axumite kings]] used it in coins to simplify foreign trade.]]
After the fall of Dʿmt during the fourth century BC, the Ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the first century AD, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in what is now [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] and Eritrea. According to the medieval ''[[Book of Aksum]]'', the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.<ref name="Agrvt"/> Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.<ref>{{cite book |first=David W. |last=Phillipson |title=Ancient Ethiopia.

Around 316 AD, [[Frumentius]] and his brother Edesius from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as [[Slavery in Ethiopia|slaves]]. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity.

The weakened Axumite dynasty came to an end in the 9th century when Yodit defeated the last king of the dynasty. Empress Yodit's reign, which lasted for 40 years, aimed to abolish Christianity (a religion first accepted by King Ezana of the Axumite dynasty) by burning down churches and crucifying people who remained faithful to the orthodox Tewahedo church, which at the time was considered as the religion of the state. The Empress tried to force many people to change their religion and destroyed much historical heritage of the Axumite dynasty earning her the epithet of Yodit Gudit (in Amharic ዮዲት ጉዲት). Her reign finally came to an end in 912 following her defeat by the first leader of the Zagwe dynasty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tegelachen|last=Haile Mariam|first=Mengistu|publisher=corneal Mengistu Haile Mariam|year=2004|location=Ethiopia|pages=16–21}}</ref> The reign of the Zagwe dynasty came to an end by the rise of [[Yekuno Amlak]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville |author2=Stuart Christopher Munro-Hay|title=Islam: An Illustrated History|date=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6533-6|pages=177–78|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=3fKoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA177}}</ref>

The [[Zagwe dynasty]] ruled many parts of present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea between the early 12th and late 13th century. The name of the [[dynasty]] is derived from the Cushitic-speaking [[Agaw people|Agaw]] of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 AD until the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' (Age of Princes), the [[Solomonic dynasty]] governed the [[Ethiopian Empire]].<ref>A.K.

===Aussa Sultanate===
{{Main|Sultanate of Aussa|Mudaito Dynasty}}

The [[Sultanate of Aussa]] or "Afar Sultanate" succeeded the earlier [[Imamate of Aussa]]. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577 when [[Muhammed Jasa]] moved his capital from [[Harar]] to Aussa ([[Asaita]]) with the split of the [[Adal Sultanate]] into the Sultanate of Aussa and the [[Sultanate of Harar]]. At some point after 1672, the Sultanate of Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam [[Umar Din bin Adam]]'s recorded ascension to the throne.<ref>[[#Abir|Abir]], p. 23 n.1.</ref>

The Sultanate was subsequently re-established by [[Kedafu]] around the year 1734. It was thereafter ruled by his [[Mudaito Dynasty]].<ref>[[#Abir|Abir]], pp. 23–26.</ref> The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver [[Baton (military)|baton]], which was considered to have magical properties.<ref>Trimingham, J.

Between 1755 and 1855, Ethiopia experienced a period of isolation referred to as the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]'' or "Age of Princes". The Emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like [[Ras (title)|''Ras'']] [[Mikael Sehul]] of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], [[Ras (title)|''Ras'']] [[Wolde Selassie]] of Tigray, and by the Were Sheh[[Yejju Oromo tribe|Yejju Oromo dynasty]], such as ''Ras'' [[Gugsa of Yejju]]. Prior to the Zemene Mesafint, King Iyoas had introduced Oromo as the language of the court from Amharic to [[Oromo language|Afaan Oromo]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Pankhurst, Richard|title=The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1967|pages=139–143}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx |title=Political Program of the Oromo People's Congress (OPC) |publisher=Gargaaraoromopc.org |date=23 April 1996 |accessdate=16 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307213227/http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:Téwodros II.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia]]]]
Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that the Amhara kingdoms of northern Ethiopia (Gonder, Gojam, Shoa) were briefly united after the power of the Emperor was restored beginning with the reign of [[Tewodros II]].  Tewodros had been born in [[Begemder]] from a nobleman of [[Qwara Province|Qwara]], where the [[Qwara dialect]] of the Agaw language is spoken.

Upon his ascent, he began [[Modernization theory|modernizing]] Ethiopia and recentralizing power in the Emperor. Ethiopia began to take part in world affairs once again.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://africanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-279|chapter=Ethiopia in the Nineteenth Century|last=Tibebu|first=Teshale|date=June 2018|title=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|access-date=|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.279|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref>

But Tewodros suffered several rebellions inside his empire. Northern Oromo militias, Tigrayan rebellion, and the constant incursion of Ottoman Empire and Egyptian forces near the Red Sea brought the weakening and the final downfall of Tewodros II. He killed himself in 1868 during his last fight with the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]] at the [[Battle of Magdala]].

After Tewodros' death, [[Tekle Giyorgis II]] was proclaimed Emperor but was defeated in the Battles of Zulawu (21 June 1871) and Adua (11 July 1871).

For his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II is heralded as a national hero. Menelik had signed the Treaty of Wichale with Italy in May 1889 in which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (now part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims.

The early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] ''(Ras Tafari)''. Haile Selassie I was born to parents with ethnic links to three of Ethiopia's Afroasiatic-speaking populations: the ''Oromo'' and ''Amhara'', the country's two largest ethnic groups, as well as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]]. He came to power after [[Iyasu V]] was deposed, and undertook [[Modernization under Haile Selassie I|a nationwide modernization campaign]] from 1916, when he was made a ''Ras'' and Regent (''Inderase'') for the [[Queen regnant|Empress Regnant]], [[Zewditu]], and became the ''de facto'' ruler of the Ethiopian Empire. Following Zewditu's death, on 2{{nbsp}}November 1930, he succeeded her as emperor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merit.unu.edu/publications/publications-search/|title=U.S. and Soviet Foreign Aid during the Cold War – A Case Study of Ethiopia|last=Broich|first=Tobias|date=2017|website=The United Nations University – Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (UNU-MERIT)|access-date=}}</ref>

The independence of Ethiopia was interrupted by the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], beginning when it was invaded by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] in early October 1935, and Italian occupation of the country (1936–1941).<ref>Clapham, Christopher (2005) "Ḫaylä Śəllase" in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha''.

The Italians made investments in Ethiopian infrastructure development during their occupation. They created the so-called "imperial road" between Addis Ababa and Massaua.<ref>[http://media.tecnici.it/file/novecento/autocamionale_assab_addis-abeba.pdf 1940 Article on the special road Addis Ababa-Assab and map (in Italian)]</ref> More than 900&nbsp;km of railways were reconstructed, dams and hydroelectric plants were built, and many public and private companies were established.

Following the entry of Italy into World War II, [[British Empire]] forces, together with the ''[[Arbegnoch]]'' (literally, "patriots", referring to armed resistance soldiers) restored the sovereignty of Ethiopia in the course of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] in 1941. An [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla warfare campaign]] continued until 1943. This was followed by British recognition of Ethiopia's full [[sovereignty]], without any special British privileges, when the [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement]] was signed in December 1944.<ref>Clapham, "Ḫaylä Śəllase", ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'', p. 1063.</ref> Under the peace treaty of 1947, Italy recognised the sovereignty and independence of Ethiopia.

In 1952, Haile Selassie orchestrated a [[Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea|federation with Eritrea]]. He dissolved this in 1962 and [[Annexation|annex]]ed Eritrea, resulting in the [[Eritrean War of Independence]]. Haile Selassie played a leading role in the formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blackpast.org/1963-haile-selassie-towards-african-unity|title=(1963) Haile Selassie, "Towards African Unity"|date=7 August 2009|website=BlackPast.org|access-date=}}</ref>

Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie I owing to the worldwide [[1973 oil crisis]]. This oil crisis caused a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974; food shortages; uncertainty regarding the succession; border wars; and discontent in the middle class created through modernization.<ref name="Black Book">''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', pp. 687–95</ref> The high gasoline prices motivated taxi drivers and teachers to go on strike on 18 February 1974, and students and workers in Addis Ababa began demonstrating against the government on 20 February 1974.<ref>[[#Valdes Vivo|Valdes Vivo]], p. 115.</ref> The feudal oligarchical cabinet of Akilou Habte Wolde was toppled, and a new government was formed with [[Endelkachew Makonnen]] serving as Prime Minister.<ref>[[#Valdes Vivo|Valdes Vivo]], p. 21.</ref>

The ensuing government suffered several coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and a huge refugee problem. In 1977, Somalia, which had previously been receiving assistance and arms from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], invaded Ethiopia in the [[Ogaden War]], capturing part of the Ogaden region.

The [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]] affected around eight million people, resulting in one million dead. Insurrections against Communist rule sprang up, particularly in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. The [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements in 1989, to form the coalition known as the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Genocide in Africa |last=Stapleton |first=Timothy J. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-4408-3052-5 |location= |page=163}}</ref>

Concurrently, the Soviet Union began to retreat from building world communism under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' policies, marking a dramatic reduction in aid to Ethiopia from Socialist Bloc countries. This resulted in more economic hardship and the collapse of the military in the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north. The collapse of Marxism–Leninism in general, and in [[eastern Europe]] during the [[revolutions of 1989]], coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990. The strategic outlook for Mengistu quickly deteriorated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://memory.loc.gov/frd/etsave/et_04_08.html |title=Foreign Policy |last= |first= |date= |website=Library of Congress – American Memory: Remaining Collections. |access-date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2110/1/U613342.pdf |title=Restructuring the Soviet–Ethiopian Relationship: A Csse Study in Asymmetric Exchange |last=Crowell Anderson-Jaquest |first=Tommie |date=May 2002 |website=London School of Economics and Political Science |access-date= }}</ref>

The politics of Ethiopia takes place in a framework of a [[Federalism|federal]] [[parliamentary republic]], wherein the [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]].

The [[President of Ethiopia|President]] is the [[head of state]] but with largely ceremonial powers. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament. On the basis of Article 78 of the 1994 Ethiopian Constitution, the [[Judiciary]] is completely independent of the executive and the legislature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.civicwebs.com/cwvlib/constitutions/ethiopia/constitution_1994.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509194433/http://www.civicwebs.com/cwvlib/constitutions/ethiopia/constitution_1994.htm|url-status=dead|title=Constitution of Ethiopia – 8 December 1994|archivedate=9 May 2008}}</ref> In 2015, the realities of this provision were questioned in a report prepared by [[Freedom House]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/ethiopia|title=Ethiopia {{!}} Country report {{!}} Freedom in the World {{!}} 2015|last=|first=|date=21 January 2015|website=freedomhouse.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118081031/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/ethiopia|archive-date=18 January 2017|url-status=live|access-date=8 January 2017}}</ref>

However, since the appointment of [[Abiy Ahmed]] as prime minister in 2018, the situation has rapidly evolved. {{clarify | how so?|date=February 2020}}

===Governance===
{{Main|Government of Ethiopia}}

The election of Ethiopia's 547-member constituent assembly was held in June 1994. This assembly adopted the [[Constitution of Ethiopia|constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] in December 1994. The elections for Ethiopia's first popularly chosen national parliament and regional legislatures were held in May and June 1995. Most opposition parties chose to boycott these elections. There was a landslide victory for the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF). International and non-governmental observers concluded that opposition parties would have been able to participate had they chosen to do so.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} The current government of Ethiopia was installed in August 1995. The first President was [[Negasso Gidada]]. The EPRDF-led government of Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] promoted a policy of [[ethnic federalism]], devolving significant powers to regional, ethnically based authorities. Ethiopia today has ten semi-autonomous administrative regions that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues. Under the present government, some fundamental freedoms, including [[freedom of the press]], are circumscribed.<ref name="FH Ethiopia">{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2007/ethiopia?page=22&year=2007&country=7175 |year=2007 |title=Map of Freedom 2007 |publisher=Freedom House |accessdate=25 December 2007}}</ref>

Citizens have little access to media other than the state-owned networks, and most private newspapers struggle to remain open and suffer periodic harassment from the government.<ref name="FH Ethiopia"/> Since the 2005 elections, at least 18 journalists who had written articles critical of the government, were arrested on genocide and treason charges.

Meles' government was elected in 2000 in Ethiopia's first-ever multiparty elections; however, the results were heavily criticized by international observers and denounced by the opposition as fraudulent. The EPRDF also won the 2005 election returning Meles to power. Although the opposition vote increased in the election, both the opposition and observers from the European Union and elsewhere stated that the vote did not meet international standards for fair and free elections.<ref name="FH Ethiopia"/> Ethiopian police are said to have massacred 193 protesters, mostly in the capital [[Addis Ababa]], in the violence following the May 2005 elections in the [[Ethiopian police massacre]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ethiopian probe team criticises judge over report. |url=http://www.kilil5.com/node/4419 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907072116/http://www.kilil5.com/node/4419 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2012 |agency=Reuters |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=21 July 2007 }}</ref>

The government initiated a crackdown in the provinces as well; in Oromia state the authorities used concerns over insurgency and terrorism to use torture, imprisonment, and other repressive methods to silence critics following the election, particularly people sympathetic to the registered opposition party [[Oromo National Congress]] (ONC).<ref name="HRW Ethiopia"/> The government has been engaged in a conflict with rebels in the [[Ogaden]] region since 2007. The biggest opposition party in 2005 was the [[Coalition for Unity and Democracy]] (CUD). After various internal divisions, most of the CUD party leaders have established the new [[Unity for Democracy and Justice]] party led by Judge [[Birtukan Mideksa]]. A member of the country's [[Oromo people|Oromo]] ethnic group, Ms. Birtukan Mideksa is the first woman to lead a political party in Ethiopia.

In 2008, the top five opposition parties were the Unity for Democracy and Justice led by Judge Birtukan Mideksa, [[United Ethiopian Democratic Forces]] led by Dr. [[Beyene Petros]], [[Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement]] led by Dr. [[Bulcha Demeksa]], [[Oromo People's Congress]] led by Dr. Merera Gudina, and [[Ethiopian Democratic Party|United Ethiopian Democratic Party – Medhin Party]] led by [[Lidetu Ayalew]]. <!-- Please clarify the following before reinstating it: The prominent leader of the Unity (Birtukan) is rearrested after accusing her based on "reckless" accusation of her speech in Sweden about her pardon after the 2005 Ethiopian election. --> After the 2015 elections, Ethiopia lost its single remaining opposition MP;<ref name = "AJE opposition">{{Cite web | title = Ethiopia election: No seat in parliament for opposition | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2015/06/ethiopia-election-seat-parliament-opposition-150623150257749.html | website = aljazeera.com | date = 23 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 June 2015 }}</ref> there are now no opposition MPs in the Ethiopian parliament.<ref name = "BBC Obama trip">{{Cite news | title = Obama in Ethiopia for key talks with regional leaders | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33671340 | website = BBC News | date = 27 July 2015 | accessdate = 27 July 2015 }}</ref>

===Military===

[[File:Map of zones of Ethiopia.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of Ethiopia's [[Regions of Ethiopia|regions]] and [[list of zones of Ethiopia|zones]]]]

Before 1996, Ethiopia was divided into thirteen [[Provinces of Ethiopia|provinces]], many derived from historical regions. The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' ("neighbourhoods").

Ethiopia is divided into ten ethnically based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.

The constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.

Article 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').

[[File:Köppen climate types of Ethiopia.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Köppen climate classification]] of Ethiopia]]

At {{convert|426372.61|sqmi|km2|0|order=flip}},<ref name="CIA World Factbook">{{cite web |title=CIA World Factbook – Rank Order – Area |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html |accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> Ethiopia is the world's 28th-largest country, comparable in size to [[Bolivia]]. It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].

The major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.

Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] ("Simien fox"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.

===Climate===
{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}
[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]

The predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|–|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.
[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]
The modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.

There are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|°C|°F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|°C|°F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|°C|°F|1}}.

Most major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier.

Ethiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.<ref name="Massicot"/> The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at [[Finicha'a]], this canid is thought to be potentially [[local extinction|locally extinct]]. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.

Ethiopia is a global center of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lepage|first=Denis|title=Bird Checklists of the World|url=http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/checklist.jsp?region=et&list=clements|publisher=Avibase|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered.

In spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. However, with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks, Ethiopia's economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in Africa.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-industrialoutput-idUSL8N1343EO20151109|title=Ethiopia to launch four more industry parks within two years|date=9 November 2015|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> In 2019 a law was passed allowing expatriate Ethiopians to invest in Ethiopia's financial service industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://w7news.com/ethiopia-to-open-banks-for-ethiopian-investors-in-the-diaspora/|title=Ethiopia to Open Banks for Ethiopian Investors in the Diaspora|last=Sze|first=Mari|website=W7 News|language=en-US|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>

The Ethiopian [[constitution]] defines the right to own land as belonging only to "the state and the people", but citizens may lease land (up to 99 years), and are unable to mortgage or sell. Renting of land for a maximum of twenty years is allowed and this is expected to ensure that land goes to the most productive user. Land distribution and administration is considered an area where corruption is institutionalized, and facilitation payments as well as bribes are often demanded when dealing with land-related issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business Corruption in Ethiopia|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/ethiopia/business-corruption-in-ethiopia.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=8 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406173808/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/ethiopia/business-corruption-in-ethiopia.aspx|archive-date=6 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> As there is no land ownership, infrastructural projects are most often simply done without asking the land users, which then end up being displaced and without home or land. A lot of anger and distrust sometimes results in public protests. In addition, agricultural productivity remains low, and frequent droughts still beset the country, also leading to internal displacement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Six_million_children_threatened_by_Ethiopia_drought_UN_999.html |title=Six million children threatened by Ethiopia drought: UN |publisher=Terradaily.com |accessdate=16 March 2009}}</ref>

===Energy and hydropower===
{{see also|Energy in Ethiopia|List of power stations in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Renaissance Dam site.jpg|thumb|Layout of the [[Grand Renaissance Dam]]]]

Ethiopia has 14 major rivers flowing from its highlands, including the [[Nile]]. It has the largest water reserves in Africa. {{as of|2012}}, hydroelectric plants represented around 88.2% of the total installed electricity generating capacity.

The remaining electrical power was generated from fossil fuels (8.3%) and renewable sources (3.6%).

The electrification rate for the total population in 2016 was 42%, with 85% coverage in urban areas and 26% coverage in rural areas. {{as of|2016}}, total electricity production was 11.15&nbsp;TW⋅h and consumption was 9.062&nbsp;TW⋅h. There were 0.166&nbsp;TW⋅h of electricity exported, 0&nbsp;kW⋅h imported, and 2.784&nbsp;GW of installed generating capacity.<ref name="CIA"/>

Ethiopia delivers roughly 81% of water volume to the Nile through the river basins of the [[Blue Nile]], [[Sobat River]] and [[Atbara]]. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a bilateral treaty, the [[Water politics in the Nile Basin|1959 Nile Waters Agreement]], which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt has discouraged almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries. This had the effect of discouraging external financing of hydropower and irrigation projects in western Ethiopia, thereby impeding water resource-based economic development projects. However, Ethiopia is in the process of constructing a large 6,450 MW hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile river. When completed, this [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] is slated to be the largest hydroelectric power station in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/31/business/ethiopia-grand-renaissance-dam/index.html|title=Ethiopia powers on with controversial dam project |author1= Victoria Eastwood |author2=Nima Elbagir|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref>

The [[Gilgel Gibe III Dam|Gibe III]] hydroelectric project is so far the largest in the country with an installed capacity of 1,870&nbsp;MW. For the year 2017–18 (2010 E.C) this hydro electric dam generated 4,900&nbsp;GW⋅h.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2015/10/power-generation-begins-at-1-870-mw-gibe-iii-hydroelectric-project-in-ethiopia.html|title=Power generation begins at 1,870-MW Gibe III hydroelectric project in Ethiopia|website=www.hydroworld.com|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
[[File:Tef in Ethiopia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Eragrostis tef|Tef]] field near [[Mojo, Ethiopia|Mojo]]]]

Agriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the [[gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref name=CIA/> Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include [[coffea|coffee]], [[legume]]s, [[rapeseed|oilseeds]], [[cereal]]s, potatoes, [[sugarcane]], and vegetables. Ethiopia is also a [[Center of origin|Vavilov]] center of diversity for domesticated crops, including [[Ensete ventricosum|enset]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wilkin|first1=Paul|last2=Demissew|first2=Sebsebe|last3=Willis|first3=Kathy|last4=Woldeyes|first4=Feleke|last5=Davis|first5=Aaron P.|last6=Molla|first6=Ermias L.|last7=Janssens|first7=Steven|last8=Kallow|first8=Simon|last9=Berhanu|first9=Admas|title=Enset in Ethiopia: a poorly characterized but resilient starch staple|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=123|issue=5|pages=747–766|language=en|doi=10.1093/aob/mcy214|pmid=30715125|pmc=6526316|year=2019}}</ref> [[Coffee bean|coffee]] and [[teff]].

Cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation. In [[East Africa]], over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels.

This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions, and promote regional integration.<ref name=ODI/> However, the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.<ref name=ODI/> Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.<ref name=ODI/>

The country also has large mineral resources and oil potential in some of the less inhabited regions. Political instability in those regions, however, has inhibited development. Ethiopian geologists were implicated in a major gold swindle in 2008. Four chemists and geologists from the Ethiopian Geological Survey were arrested in connection with a fake gold scandal, following complaints from buyers in South Africa. Gold bars from the National Bank of Ethiopia were found by police to be gilded metal, costing the state around US$17&nbsp;million, according to the Science and Development Network website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scidev.net/en/sub-suharan-africa/news/sub-saharan-africa-news-in-brief-13-25-march.html |title=Sub-Saharan Africa news in brief: 13–25 March |publisher=SciDev.Net |date=28 March 2008 |accessdate=16 March 2009}}</ref>

The country's population is highly diverse, containing over 80 different ethnic groups. According to the Ethiopian national census of 2007, the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, at 34.4% of the nation's population. The [[Amhara people|Amhara]] represent 27.0% of the country's inhabitants, while [[Somalis]] and [[Tigrayans]] represent 6.2% and 6.1% of the population, respectively.

[[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic-speaking]] communities make up the majority of the population. Among these, Semitic speakers often collectively refer to themselves as the [[Habesha people]].

Ethiopia's principal orthography is the [[Ge'ez script]].

Ethiopia has close historical ties with all three of the world's major [[Abrahamic religions]]. In the 4th century, the Ethiopian empire was one of the first in the world to officially adopt [[Christianity]] as the state religion.

There is a small, yet significant number of [[Judaism|Jews]] in Ethiopia, who claim to be one of the [[lost tribes of Israel]]. In the 1980s, the number of [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian-Jews]] decreased, as many started moving to [[Israel]]. The tribe has been given the name [[Beta Israel]] / ቤታ እስራኤል / ביתא ישראל. There are a higher number of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian-Jews]] living in Israel today, though, in certain Ethiopian towns and villages such as [[Wolleka]], near the Ethiopian city of [[Gondar]], the concentration of Ethiopian-Jews reaches an estimated 100%. The US also has a significant number of Ethiopian-Jews, with a population slightly less than that of Ethiopia.

===Urbanization===
{{Main|List of cities and towns in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Addis Abeba07 (Sam Effron).jpg|thumb|Street in Addis Ababa]]

Population growth, migration, and urbanization are all straining both governments' and ecosystems' capacity to provide people with basic services.<ref>Racin, L. (4 March 2008) [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/future-shock-how-environmental-change-and-human-impact-are-changing-the-global-map "Future Shock: How Environmental Change and Human Impact Are Changing the Global Map"]. Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</ref> Urbanization has steadily been increasing in Ethiopia, with two periods of significantly rapid growth. First, in 1936–1941 during the Italian occupation under Mussolini's fascist government, and from 1967 to 1975 when the populations of urban centers tripled.<ref name="countrystudies1991">Ofcansky, T and Berry, L. "Ethiopia: A Country Study". Edited by Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991. [http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia Countrystudies.us]</ref>

In 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia, building infrastructure to connect major cities, and a dam providing power and water.<ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008" /> This along with the influx of Italians and labourers was the major cause of rapid growth during this period. The second period of growth was from 1967 to 1975 when rural populations migrated to urban centers seeking work and better living conditions.<ref name="countrystudies1991"/>

This pattern slowed due to the 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which provided incentives for people to stay in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970–1983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act.<ref name="Anderson, Frank 1991.

====Rural and urban life====
[[File:Gonder from the Goha hotel.jpg|thumb|[[Gondar]] skyline]]

Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. In peasant associations daily life is a struggle to survive. About 16% of the population in Ethiopia are living on less than one dollar per day (2008). Only 65% of rural households in Ethiopia consume the [[World Health Organization]]'s minimum standard of food per day (2,200 kilocalories), with 42% of children under 5 years old being underweight.<ref name="Crawley">Crawley, Mike.

Most poor families (75%) share their sleeping quarters with livestock, and 40% of children sleep on the floor, where nighttime temperatures average 5 degrees Celsius in the cold season.<ref name="Crawley"/> The average family size is six or seven, living in a 30-square-meter mud and thatch hut, with less than two hectares of land to cultivate.<ref name="Crawley"/>

The peasant associations face a cycle of poverty. Since the landholdings are so small, farmers cannot allow the land to lie fallow, which reduces soil fertility.<ref name="Crawley"/> This [[land degradation]] reduces the production of fodder for livestock, which causes low milk yields.<ref name="Crawley"/> Since the community burns livestock manure as fuel, rather than plowing the nutrients back into the land, the crop production is reduced.<ref name="Crawley"/> The low productivity of agriculture leads to inadequate incomes for farmers, hunger, malnutrition and disease. These unhealthy farmers have difficulty working the land and the productivity drops further.<ref name="Crawley"/>

Although conditions are drastically better in cities, all of Ethiopia suffers from [[poverty]] and poor [[sanitation]]. However, poverty in Ethiopia fell from 44% to 29.6% during 2000–2011, according to the World Bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2015/01/20/poverty-ethiopia-down-33-percent|title=Poverty in Ethiopia Down 33 Percent Since 2000|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> In the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]], 55% of the population used to live in slums.<ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008"/> Now, however, a construction boom in both the private and the public sector has led to a dramatic improvement in living standards in major cities, particularly in Addis Ababa.

Despite the living conditions in the cities, the people of Addis Ababa are much better off than people living in the peasant associations owing to their educational opportunities. Unlike rural children, 69% of urban children are enrolled in primary school, and 35% of those are eligible to attend secondary school.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}<ref name="Accessed 15 May 2008"/> Addis Ababa has its own [[Addis Ababa University|university]] as well as many other secondary schools.

The Government of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia is signatory to various international conventions and treaties that protect the rights of women and children. Its constitution provides for the fundamental rights and freedoms for women. There is an attempt being made to raise the social and economic status of women through eliminating all legal and customary practices, which hinder women's equal participation in society and undermine their social status.

The National Mental Health Strategy, published in 2012, introduced the development of policy designed to improve mental health care in Ethiopia. This strategy mandated that mental health be integrated into the primary health care system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mhinnovation.net/resources/national-mental-health-strategy-ethiopia|title=National Mental Health Strategy of Ethiopia|date=14 August 2014|website=Mental Health Innovation Network}}</ref> However, the success of the National Mental Health Strategy has been limited.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Addis Abeba University (Sam Effron).jpg|thumb|Entrance of [[Addis Ababa University]]]]

Education in Ethiopia was dominated by the Tewahedo Church for many centuries until secular education was adopted in the early 1900s. The current system follows school expansion schemes which are very similar to the system in the rural areas during the 1980s, with an addition of deeper regionalization, providing rural education in students' own languages starting at the elementary level, and with more budget finances allocated to the education sector. The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Teferra|first1=Damtew|last2=Altbach|first2=Philip G.|title=African Higher Education: An International Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RROdAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34186-0|pages= 316–25}}</ref>

Access to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly. Approximately three million people were in primary school in 1994/95, and by 2008/09, primary enrolment had risen to 15.5&nbsp;million – an increase of over 500%.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Engel|first1=Jakob|title=Ethiopia's progress in education: A rapid and equitablension of access – Summary|url=http://www.developmentprogress.org/sites/developmentprogress.org/files/case-study-summary/ethiopia_web_master_final_summary.pdf|website=Development Progress|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref> In 2013/14, the country had witnessed significant boost in gross enrolment across all regions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/en/search/site?f[0]=im_field_countries%3A1076|title=Search Result: Ethiopia's plans and policies|last=IIEP-UNESCO|date=2017|website=Planipolis|access-date=}}</ref> The national GER was 104.8% for boys, 97.8% for girls and 101.3% across both sexes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002317/231724e.pdf|title=National EFA review, 2015|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|page=8}}</ref>

===Naming===
{{Main|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}

Ethiopians have a different naming system to the [[family name]]-based Western system. Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.

Everyone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''አቶ''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''ወይዘሮ''') for married women; and ''Weyzerīt'' ('''ወይዘሪት''') for unmarried women.

===Calendar===
{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}
[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]

Ethiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.

Like the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day—which in essence is a [[leap day]]—is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}Mäskäräm, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].

Another calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>

===Time===

[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called "8 at night" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called "2 in the evening".

===Cuisine===

{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}
[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]

The best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entrées and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others in your group with your own hands—a tradition referred to as "[[Ethiopian cuisine#Gursha|gursha]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Simpsons Episode Well-Received by Ethiopians On Social Media|url=http://www.tadias.com/12/01/2011/the-simpsons-episode-well-received-by-ethiopians-on-social-media-elsewhere/|publisher=Tadias Magazine|date=1 December 2011}}</ref> Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no [[pork]] or [[shellfish]] of any kind, as they are forbidden in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Christian, Islamic and Jewish faiths.

The [[music of Ethiopia]] is extremely diverse, with each of the country's 80 ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Ethiopian music uses a distinct [[Musical mode|modal system]] that is [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]], with characteristically long intervals between some notes. As with many other aspects of Ethiopian culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in neighboring Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, and Sudan.<ref name="Abdullahi">{{cite book |last=Abdullahi |first=Mohamed Diriye |title=Culture and Customs of Somalia |year=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-31333-2 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Nu918tYMB8C&pg=PA170 |quote=Somali music, a unique kind of music that might be mistaken at first for music from nearby countries such as Ethiopia, the Sudan, or even Arabia, can be recognized by its own tunes and styles.}}</ref><ref name="Tekle">{{cite book |last=Tekle |first=Amare |title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: from conflict to cooperation |year=1994 |publisher=The Red Sea Press |isbn=978-0-932415-97-4 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC&pg=PA197 |quote=Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan have significant similarities emanating not only from culture, religion, traditions, history and aspirations&nbsp;...

Traditionally, lyricism in Ethiopian song writing is strongly associated with views of patriotism or national pride, romance, friendship, and a most unique type of memoire known as 'Tizita'.

===Sport===

Other notable Ethiopian athletes are [[Mamo Wolde]], [[Miruts Yifter]], [[Derartu Tulu]], [[Meseret Defar]], [[Almaz Ayana]], [[Birhane Adere]], [[Tiki Gelana]], [[Genzebe Dibaba]], [[Tariku Bekele]], and [[Gelete Burka]]. {{As of|2012}} and going into 2013, the current national [[Ethiopia national football team|Ethiopian national football team]] (nicknamed the Walayia Antelopes) made history by qualifying for the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations]] and reached the last 10 African football teams in the last stage of [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Noted players include captain [[Adane Girma]] and top scorer [[Saladin Said]].
