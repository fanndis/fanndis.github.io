'''Ernesto''' "'''Che'''" '''Guevara''' ({{IPA-es|ˈtʃe ɣeˈβaɾa|lang}};<ref>[http://www.forvo.com/word/che_guevara#es How to pronounce Che Guevara] – Forvo features various sound clips of international Spanish speakers enunciating his name.</ref> 14 June 1928<ref name="birthdate">The date of birth recorded on [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Ernesto_Guevara_Acta_de_Nacimiento.jpg his birth certificate] was 14 June 1928, although one tertiary source, (Julia Constenla, quoted by [[Jon Lee Anderson]]), asserts that he was actually born on 14 May of that year. Constenla alleges that she was told by Che's mother, Celia de la Serna, that she was already pregnant when she and Ernesto Guevara Lynch were married and that the date on the birth certificate of their son was forged to make it appear that he was born a month later than the actual date to avoid scandal. ([[Che Guevara#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 3, 769.)</ref> – 9 October 1967) was an Argentine [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary, physician, author, [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leader, diplomat, and [[military theorist]]. A major figure of the [[Cuban Revolution]], his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] symbol of rebellion and global insignia [[Che Guevara in popular culture|in popular culture]].<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 128.</ref>

As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout [[South America]] and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed.<ref name="RevMedicine">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1960/08/19.htm On Revolutionary Medicine] Speech by Che Guevara to the Cuban Militia on 19 August 1960. "Because of the circumstances in which I traveled, first as a student and later as a doctor, I came into close contact with poverty, hunger and disease; with the inability to treat a child because of lack of money; with the stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment, to the point that a father can accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident, as occurs often in the downtrodden classes of our American homeland. And I began to realize at that time that there were things that were almost as important to me as becoming famous or making a significant contribution to medical science: I wanted to help those people."</ref><ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 90-91.</ref> His burgeoning desire to help overturn the [[Informal empire|capitalist exploitation of Latin America]] by the United States prompted his involvement in [[Guatemala]]'s social reforms under President [[Jacobo Árbenz]], whose eventual [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|CIA-assisted overthrow]] at the behest of the [[United Fruit Company]] solidified Guevara's political ideology.<ref name="RevMedicine"/> Later in [[Mexico City]], Guevara met [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]] and [[Fidel Castro]], joined their [[26th of July Movement]], and sailed to [[Cuba]] aboard the yacht ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]].<ref>[[#refBeaubien2009|Beaubien, NPR Audio Report, 2009]], 00:09–00:13.</ref> Guevara soon rose to prominence among the [[Insurgency|insurgents]], was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.<ref name="Castrosbrain1960">''"[[#refCastrosbrain1960|Castro's Brain]]"'', 1960.</ref>

Following the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the [[revolutionary tribunal (Cuba)|revolutionary tribunals]],<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 267.</ref> instituting [[Agrarian Reform Laws of Cuba#First agrarian reform law under Che Guevara|agrarian land reform]] as minister of industries, helping spearhead a successful nationwide [[Cuban Literacy Campaign|literacy campaign]], serving as both national bank president and instructional director for [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces|Cuba's armed forces]], and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]],<ref name="Kellner89pg69">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], pp. 69–70.</ref> and bringing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] [[ballistic missile]]s to Cuba, which preceded the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 526–530.</ref> Additionally, Guevara was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal [[Guerrilla Warfare (book)|guerrilla warfare manual]], along with a best-selling [[memoir]] about his youthful [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|continental motorcycle journey]]. His experiences and studying of [[Marxism–Leninism]] led him to posit that the [[Third World]]'s [[underdevelopment]] and [[Dependency theory|dependence]] was an intrinsic result of [[imperialism]], [[neocolonialism]] and [[state monopoly capitalism|monopoly capitalism]], with the only remedy being [[proletarian internationalism]] and [[world revolution]].<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1964/03/25.htm "On Development"] Speech delivered by Che Guevara at the plenary session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva, Switzerland on 25 March 1964. "The inflow of capital from the developed countries is the prerequisite for the establishment of economic dependence. This inflow takes various forms: loans granted on onerous terms; investments that place a given country in the power of the investors; almost total technological subordination of the dependent country to the developed country; control of a country's foreign trade by the big international monopolies; and in extreme cases, the use of force as an economic weapon in support of the other forms of exploitation."</ref><ref name="AfroAsian1965">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] A speech by Che Guevara to the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria on 24 February 1965."The struggle against imperialism, for liberation from colonial or neocolonial shackles, which is being carried out by means of political weapons, arms, or a combination of the two, is not separate from the struggle against backwardness and poverty. Both are stages on the same road leading toward the creation of a new society of justice and plenty.&nbsp;... Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries. To raise the living standards of the underdeveloped nations, therefore, we must fight against imperialism.&nbsp;... The practice of proletarian internationalism is not only a duty for the peoples struggling for a better future, it is also an inescapable necessity."</ref> Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment revolution abroad, first [[Simba Rebellion|unsuccessfully]] in [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Kinshasa]], then throughout the African continent with other Cuban advisors. Guevara worked in Algeria, Zaire, and Angola, as well as with African liberation movements in exile like the [[Zimbabwe African National Union|Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU)]] and [[FRELIMO|Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO)]] in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Later he travelled to [[Ñancahuazú Guerrilla|Bolivia]] to aid in revolution and there he was captured by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-assisted Bolivian forces and [[Summary execution|summarily executed]].<ref>[[Che Guevara#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], p. 4.</ref>

Guevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, polarized in the collective imagination in a [[Bibliography of works on Che Guevara|multitude of biographies]], memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. As a result of his perceived martyrdom, poetic invocations for [[Class conflict|class struggle]], and desire to create the consciousness of a "new man" driven by moral rather than material incentives,<ref>Footnote for ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm Socialism and man in Cuba]'' (1965): "Che argued that the full liberation of humankind is reached when work becomes a social duty carried out with complete satisfaction and sustained by a value system that contributes to the realization of conscious action in performing tasks. This could only be achieved by systematic education, acquired by passing through various stages in which collective action is increased. Che recognized that this to be difficult and time-consuming. In his desire to speed up this process, however, he developed methods of mobilizing people, bringing together their collective and individual interests. Among the most significant of these instruments were moral and material incentives, while deepening consciousness as a way of developing toward socialism. See Che's speeches: ''Homage to Emulation Prize Winners'' (1962) and ''A New Attitude to Work'' (1964)."</ref> Guevara has evolved into a quintessential icon of various [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] movements. In contrast, his ideological critics on [[Right-wing politics|the right]] accuse him of [[authoritarianism]] and sanctifying violence against his political opponents. Despite disagreements on [[Legacy of Che Guevara|his legacy]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential]] people of the 20th century,<ref>[[#refDorfman1999|Dorfman 1999]].</ref> while an [[Alberto Korda]] photograph of him, titled ''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]'', was cited by the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] as "the most famous photograph in the world".<ref>Maryland Institute of Art, referenced at [[#CITEREFBBCNews2001b|BBC News 26 May 2001]].</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:Chefamily.jpg|thumb|right|A teenage Ernesto (left) with his parents and siblings, c. 1944, seated beside him from left to right: Celia (mother), Celia (sister), Roberto, Juan Martín, Ernesto (father) and Ana María]]
Ernesto Guevara was born to Ernesto Guevara Lynch and Celia de la Serna y Llosa, on <!-- Note: Please do not change birth date without discussing on talk page first. -->14 June 1928,<ref name=birthdate/> in [[Rosario]], [[Argentina]]. He was the eldest of five children in a middle-class [[Argentine people|Argentine]] family of [[Spanish immigration to Argentina|Spanish]] (including [[Basque Argentine|Basque]] and [[Cantabrian people|Cantabrian]]) descent, as well as [[Irish Argentine|Irish]] by means of his patrilineal ancestor [[Patrick Lynch (Argentina)|Patrick Lynch]].<ref>Che's last name ''Guevara'' derives from the [[Castilian Spanish|Castilianized]] form of the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''[[Guevara, Spain|Gebara]]'', a [[habitational name]] from the province of [[Álava]], while his grandmother, Ana Lynch, was a descendant of [[Patrick Lynch (Argentina)|Patrick Lynch]], who emigrated from [[County Galway, Ireland|County Galway]], Ireland in the 1740s.</ref><ref>[[#refGuevaraLynch2007|Guevara Lynch 2007]], pp. i. "The father of Che Guevara, Ernesto Guevara Lynch was born in Argentina in 1900 of Irish and Basque origin."</ref><ref>[http://www.euskalnet.net/laviana/gen_bascas/guevaraelche.html The Origins of Guevara's Name] - written in Spanish</ref> Although Guevara's legal name on his birth certificate was "Ernesto Guevara", his name sometimes appears with "de la Serna" and/or "Lynch" accompanying it.<ref>In Spanish a person may carry the surname of his or her father as well as that of his or her mother, albeit in that order. Some people carry both, others only that of their father. In Guevara's case, many people of Irish descent will add "Lynch" to emphasize his Irish relations. Others will add "de la Serna" to give respect to Guevara's mother.</ref> Referring to Che's "restless" nature, his father declared "the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Irish rebels]]".<ref>[[#refLavretsky1976|Lavretsky 1976]].</ref>

Very early on in life, Ernestito (as he was then called) developed an "affinity for the poor".<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 23.</ref> Growing up in a family with [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] leanings, Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,872604,00.html Argentina: Che's Red Mother] ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 14 July 1961.</ref> His father, a staunch supporter of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] from the [[Spanish Civil War]], often hosted many veterans from the conflict in the Guevara home.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 22–23.</ref>

Despite suffering crippling bouts of acute [[asthma]] that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete, enjoying swimming, football, golf, and shooting, while also becoming an "untiring" cyclist.<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 8.</ref><ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 24.</ref> He was an avid [[rugby union]] player,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/brendangallagher/2322711/Argentine-rugby-inspired-by-Che-Guevara.html Argentine Rugby Inspired by Che Guevara] by Brendan Gallagher, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 October 2007</ref> and played at [[fly-half]] for [[Club Universitario de Buenos Aires]].<ref>Cain, Nick & Growden, Greg.

===Intellectual and literary interests===
[[File:CheG1951.jpg|thumb|upright|22-year-old Guevara in 1951]]

Guevara learned [[chess]] from his father, and began participating in local tournaments by the age of 12. During adolescence and throughout his life he was passionate about poetry, especially that of [[Pablo Neruda]], [[John Keats]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Gabriela Mistral]], [[César Vallejo]], and [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name="Hart 2004, pg 98">[[#refHart2004|Hart 2004]], p. 98.</ref> He could also recite [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s "[[If—]]" and [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]]'s ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' by heart.<ref name="Hart 2004, pg 98"/> The Guevara home contained more than 3,000 books, which allowed Guevara to be an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests including [[Karl Marx]], [[William Faulkner]], [[André Gide]], [[Emilio Salgari]] and [[Jules Verne]].<ref>[[#refHaney2005|Haney 2005]], p. 164.</ref> Additionally, he enjoyed the works of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]; as well as [[Anatole France]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Robert Frost]].<ref name="ReferenceC">([[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 37–38).</ref>

As he grew older, he developed an interest in the Latin American writers [[Horacio Quiroga]], [[Ciro Alegría]], [[Jorge Icaza]], [[Rubén Darío]] and [[Miguel Asturias]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Many of these authors' ideas he cataloged in his own handwritten notebooks of concepts, definitions, and philosophies of influential intellectuals. These included composing analytical sketches of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Aristotle]], along with examining [[Bertrand Russell]] on love and patriotism, [[Jack London]] on society and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] on the idea of death. [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ideas fascinated him as he quoted him on a variety of topics from [[Dream interpretation|dreams]] and [[libido]] to [[narcissism]] and the [[Oedipus complex]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/> His favorite subjects in school included philosophy, [[mathematics]], engineering, [[political science]], [[sociology]], history and [[archaeology]].<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 10.</ref><ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 26.</ref>

Years later, a declassified CIA 'biographical and personality report' dated 13 February 1958 made note of Guevara's wide range of academic interests and intellect, describing him as "quite well read" while adding that "Che is fairly intellectual for a Latino."<ref>[[#refRatner1997|Ratner 1997]], p. 25.</ref>

===Motorcycle journey===
{{Main|The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries (film)}}
[[File:CheOnRaft1952.jpg|thumb|alt=black and white photograph of two men on a raft, fitted with a large hut. The far bank of the river is visible in the far distance|Guevara (right) with [[Alberto Granado]] (left) in June 1952 on the [[Amazon River]] aboard their "Mambo-Tango" wooden raft, which was a gift from the [[lepers]] whom they had treated<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 89.</ref>]]

In 1948, Guevara entered the [[University of Buenos Aires]] to study medicine. His "hunger to explore the world"<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 64.</ref> led him to intersperse his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that fundamentally changed the way he viewed himself and the contemporary economic conditions in Latin America. The first expedition in 1950 was a 4,500-kilometer (2,800&nbsp;mi) solo trip through the rural provinces of [[Argentine Northwest|northern Argentina]] on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 59–64.</ref> This was followed in 1951 by a nine-month, 8,000-kilometer (5,000&nbsp;mi) continental motorcycle trek through part of South America. For the latter, he took a year off from his studies to embark with his friend [[Alberto Granado]], with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo [[leper colony]] in [[Peru]], on the banks of the [[Amazon River]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 83.</ref>

[[File:Che Guevara-Granado - Mapa 1er viaje - 1952.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A map of Guevara's 1952 trip with [[Alberto Granado]] (the red arrows correspond to air travel)]]

In [[Chile]], Guevara found himself enraged by the working conditions of the miners in [[Anaconda Copper|Anaconda]]'s [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine and moved by his overnight encounter in the [[Atacama Desert]] with a persecuted [[Communist Party of Chile|communist]] couple who did not even own a blanket, describing them as "the shivering flesh-and-blood victims of capitalist exploitation".<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 75–76.</ref> Additionally, on the way to [[Machu Picchu]] high in the [[Andes]], he was struck by the crushing poverty of the remote rural areas, where peasant farmers worked small plots of land owned by wealthy landlords.<ref name="Kellner89pg27">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 27.</ref> Later on his journey, Guevara was especially impressed by the camaraderie among those living in a leper colony, stating, "The highest forms of human solidarity and loyalty arise among such lonely and desperate people."<ref name="Kellner89pg27"/> Guevara used notes taken during this trip to write an account, titled ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', which later became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-seller]],<ref>NYT bestseller list: [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/books/bestseller/0220bestpapernonfiction.html #38 Paperback Nonfiction on 2005-02-20], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E5D6123DF934A35752C1A9629C8B63 #9 Nonfiction on 2004-10-07] and on more occasions.</ref> and was adapted into a 2004 [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)#Awards|award-winning]] [[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|film of the same name]].

The journey took Guevara through Argentina, Chile, Peru, [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Panama]], and [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], Florida, for 20 days,<ref>[http://miamiherald.typepad.com/cuban_colada/2008/07/che-guevara-spe.html Che Guevara spent time in Miami] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130204225416/http://miamiherald.typepad.com/cuban_colada/2008/07/che-guevara-spe.html |date=4 February 2013 }} by Alfonso Chardy, ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' 8 July 2008</ref> before returning home to [[Buenos Aires]]. By the end of the trip, he came to view Latin America not as a collection of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united [[Hispanic America]] sharing a common Latino heritage was a theme that recurred prominently during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his studies and received his medical degree in June 1953, making him officially "Dr. Ernesto Guevara".<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 98.</ref><ref>A copy of Guevara's University transcripts showing conferral of his medical diploma can be found on p. 75 of ''Becoming Che: Guevara's Second and Final Trip through Latin America'', by Carlos 'Calica' Ferrer (Translated from the Spanish by Sarah L. Smith), Marea Editorial, 2006, {{ISBN|987-1307-07-1}}. Ferrer was a longtime childhood friend of Che, and when Guevara passed the last of his 12 exams in 1953, he gave him a copy to prove to Ferrer, who had been telling Guevara that he would never finish, that he had finally completed his studies.</ref>

Guevara later remarked that through his travels in Latin America, he came in "close contact with poverty, hunger and disease" along with the "inability to treat a child because of lack of money" and "stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment" that leads a father to "accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident". Guevara cited these experiences as convincing him that in order to "help these people", he needed to leave the realm of medicine and consider the political arena of armed struggle.<ref name="RevMedicine" />

==Guatemala, Árbenz, and United Fruit==
{{Main|1954 Guatemalan coup d'état}}
On 7 July 1953, Guevara set out again, this time to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. On 10 December 1953, before leaving for Guatemala, Guevara sent an update to his Aunt Beatriz from [[San José, Costa Rica]]. In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing the dominion of the [[United Fruit Company]], a journey which convinced him that the Company's capitalist system was a terrible one.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 126.</ref> This affirmed indignation carried the more aggressive tone he adopted in order to frighten his more Conservative relatives, and ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then recently deceased [[Joseph Stalin]], not to rest until these "octopuses have been vanquished".<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 31.</ref> Later that month, Guevara arrived in Guatemala where President [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]] headed a democratically elected government that, through [[land reform]] and other initiatives, was attempting to end the ''[[latifundia]]'' system. To accomplish this, President Árbenz had enacted a [[Decree 900|major land reform program]], where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants. The biggest land owner, and one most affected by the reforms, was the [[United Fruit Company]], from which the Árbenz government had already taken more than {{convert|225,000|acre|ha}} of uncultivated land.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 31.</ref> Pleased with the road the nation was heading down, Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to "perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary."<ref name="Kellner89pg31">[[#refGuevaraLynch2000|Guevara Lynch 2000]], p. 26.</ref>

In [[Guatemala City]], Guevara sought out [[Hilda Gadea|Hilda Gadea Acosta]], a Peruvian economist who was well-connected politically as a member of the left-leaning Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA, [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]]).

Guevara then established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to [[Fidel Castro]] through the 26 July 1953 [[Moncada Barracks#Attack on Moncada Barracks|attack]] on the [[Moncada Barracks]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. During this period, he acquired his famous nickname, due to his frequent use of the Argentine [[Filler (linguistics)|filler]] syllable ''[[Che (interjection)|che]]'' (a multi-purpose [[discourse marker]], like the syllable "[[eh]]" in Canadian English).<ref>[[#refIgnacio2007|Ignacio 2007]], p. 172.</ref> During his time in Guatemala, Guevara was helped by other Central American exiles, one of whom, [[Helena Leiva de Holst]], provided him with food and lodging,<ref name="Anderson (2010)">{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Jon|title=Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life|date=2010|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-802-19725-2|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCw19CUXpqkC&lpg=PA139|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref> discussed her travels to study Marxism in Russia and China,<ref>"Anderson (2010)", p 126</ref> and to whom, Guevara dedicated a poem, "Invitación al camino".<ref>{{cite news|title=Poetry of Che is presented with great success in Guatemala |url=http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2007/11/26/7281/poetry_of_che_is_presented_with_great_success_in_guatemala.html |publisher=Cuba Headlines |date=26 November 2007 |language=en}}</ref>

In May 1954, a shipment of infantry and light artillery weapons was dispatched from [[Czechoslovakia#Communist Czechoslovakia|Communist Czechoslovakia]] for the Arbenz Government and arrived in [[Puerto Barrios]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=155–160}} As a result, the United States government—which since 1953 had been tasked by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] to remove Arbenz from power in the multifaceted CIA operation code-named [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état#Operation PBSuccess|PBSuccess]]—responded by saturating Guatemala with anti-Arbenz propaganda through radio and dropped leaflets, and began bombing raids using unmarked airplanes.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161-163}} The United States also sponsored a force of several hundred Guatemalan refugees and mercenaries who were headed by [[Carlos Castillo Armas|Castillo Armas]] to help remove the Arbenz government. On 27 June, Arbenz decided to resign.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=345–349}}  This allowed Armas and his CIA-assisted forces to march into Guatemala City and establish a [[military junta]], which elected Armas as President on 7 July.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=354–357}} Consequently, the Armas regime then consolidated power by rounding up and executing suspected communists,{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=198–201}} while crushing the previously flourishing labor unions{{sfn|Cullather|2006|p=113}} and reversing the previous agrarian reforms.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=382}}

Guevara himself was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed [[militia]] organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose, but frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. Guevara's repeated calls to resist were noted by supporters of the coup, and he was marked for murder.<ref name="Kellner89pg32">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 32.</ref> After Hilda Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the [[Diplomatic missions of Argentina|Argentine consulate]], where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to [[Mexico]].<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 39.</ref>

The overthrow of the Arbenz regime and establishment of the right-wing Armas dictatorship cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] power that opposed and attempted to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries.<ref name="Kellner89pg31"/> In speaking about the coup, Guevara stated:

{{quote|The last Latin American revolutionary democracy – that of Jacobo Arbenz – failed as a result of the cold premeditated aggression carried out by the United States. Its visible head was the Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]], a man who, through a rare coincidence, was also a stockholder and attorney for the [[United Fruit Company]].<ref name="Kellner89pg32"/>}}

Guevara's conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions was thus strengthened.<ref>[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch24x.html Che Guevara 1960–67 by Frank E. Smitha].</ref> Gadea wrote later, "It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism.

During this time he renewed his friendship with Ñico López and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala. In June 1955, López introduced him to [[Raúl Castro]], who subsequently introduced him to his older brother, [[Fidel Castro]], the revolutionary leader who had formed the [[26th of July Movement]] and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. During a long conversation with Fidel on the night of their first meeting, Guevara concluded that the Cuban's cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of the [[July 26 Movement]].<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], p. 55.</ref> Despite their "contrasting personalities", from this point on Che and Fidel began to foster what dual biographer Simon Reid-Henry deemed a "revolutionary friendship that would change the world", as a result of their coinciding commitment to [[anti-imperialism]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/interactive/2009/jan/09/fidel-castro-che-guevara-biography ''Fidel and Che: A Revolutionary Friendship'' by Simon Reid-Henry] audio slideshow by ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 January 2009</ref>

By this point in Guevara's life, he deemed that U.S.-controlled [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] installed and supported repressive regimes around the world. In this vein, he considered Batista a "[[Puppet state|U.S. puppet]] whose strings needed cutting".<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 28.</ref> Although he planned to be the group's [[combat medic]], Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement. The key portion of training involved learning hit and run tactics of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Guevara and the others underwent arduous 15-hour marches over mountains, across rivers, and through the dense undergrowth, learning and perfecting the procedures of ambush and quick retreat. From the start Guevara was [[Alberto Bayo|Alberto Bayo's]] "prize student" among those in training, scoring the highest on all of the tests given.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 37.</ref> At the end of the course, he was called "the best guerrilla of them all" by their instructor, General Bayo.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 194.</ref>

==Cuban Revolution==
{{Main|Cuban Revolution|Battle of Santa Clara|Foco}}

===Invasion, warfare, and Santa Clara===
The first step in Castro's revolutionary plan was an assault on Cuba from Mexico via the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]],'' an old, leaky [[cabin cruiser]]. They set out for Cuba on 25 November 1956. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture; only 22 found each other afterwards.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 213.</ref> During this initial bloody confrontation Guevara laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, proving to be a symbolic moment in Che's life.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 211.</ref>

[[File:CheMuleFull.jpg|thumb|left|Guevara atop a mule in [[Santa Clara Province|Las Villas province]], Cuba, November 1958]]

Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains, where they received support from the [[Urban guerrilla warfare|urban guerrilla]] network of [[Frank País]], 26 July Movement, and local campesinos. With the group withdrawn to the Sierra, the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when the interview by [[Herbert Matthews]] appeared in ''The New York Times''. The article presented a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas. Guevara was not present for the interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale diminished, and with an allergy to mosquito bites which resulted in agonizing walnut-sized [[cysts]] on his body,<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 32.</ref> Guevara considered these "the most painful days of the war".<ref>[[#refDePalma2006|DePalma 2006]], pp. 110–11.</ref>

During Guevara's time living hidden among the poor [[subsistence farmers]] of the Sierra Maestra mountains, he discovered that there were no schools, no electricity, minimal access to healthcare, and more than 40 percent of the adults were [[illiterate]].<ref name = "LiteracyC" /> As the war continued, Guevara became an integral part of the rebel army and "convinced Castro with competence, diplomacy and patience".<ref name="Castrosbrain1960"/> Guevara set up factories to make grenades, built ovens to bake bread, and organized schools to teach illiterate campesinos to read and write.<ref name="Castrosbrain1960"/> Moreover, Guevara established health clinics, workshops to teach military tactics, and a newspaper to disseminate information.<ref name="kellner">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 45.</ref> The man whom ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' dubbed three years later "Castro's brain" at this point was promoted by [[Fidel Castro]] to ''Comandante'' (commander) of a second army column.<ref name="Castrosbrain1960"/>

{{anchor|Eutímio Guerra}}
As second in command, Guevara was a harsh disciplinarian who sometimes shot defectors. Deserters were punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send squads to track those seeking to go [[AWOL]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 269–270.</ref> As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness.<ref>[[#refCastañeda1998|Castañeda 1998]], pp. 105, 119.</ref> During the guerrilla campaign, Guevara was also responsible for the [[summary execution]]s of a number of men accused of being [[Informant|informers]], [[Desertion|deserters]] or [[Espionage|spies]].<ref name="execution-squads">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], pp. 237–238, 269–270, 277–278.</ref> In his diaries, Guevara described the first such execution of Eutímio Guerra, a peasant army guide who admitted treason when it was discovered he accepted the promise of ten thousand pesos for repeatedly giving away the rebel's position for attack by the Cuban air force.<ref name="Lutherpg97-99">[[#refLuther2001|Luther 2001]], pp. 97–99.</ref> Such information also allowed Batista's army to burn the homes of peasants sympathetic to the revolution.<ref name="Lutherpg97-99"/> Upon Guerra's request that they "end his life quickly",<ref name="Lutherpg97-99"/> Che stepped forward and shot him in the head, writing "The situation was uncomfortable for the people and for Eutimio so I ended the problem giving him a shot with a .32 pistol in the right side of the brain, with exit orifice in the right temporal [lobe]."<ref name="Andersonpg237">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 237.</ref> His scientific notations and matter-of-fact description, suggested to one biographer a "remarkable detachment to violence" by that point in the war.<ref name="Andersonpg237"/> Later, Guevara published a literary account of the incident, titled "Death of a Traitor", where he transfigured Eutimio's betrayal and pre-execution request that the revolution "take care of his children", into a "revolutionary [[parable]] about redemption through sacrifice".<ref name="Andersonpg237"/>

[[File:ChePipe.jpg|thumb|Smoking a pipe at his guerrilla base in the [[Escambray Mountains]]]]

Although he maintained a demanding and harsh disposition, Guevara also viewed his role of commander as one of a teacher, entertaining his men during breaks between engagements with readings from the likes of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], and Spanish [[lyric poetry|lyric poets]].<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 35.</ref> Together with this role, and inspired by [[José Martí]]'s principle of "literacy without borders", Guevara further ensured that his rebel fighters made daily time to teach the uneducated campesinos with whom they lived and fought to read and write, in what Guevara termed the "battle against ignorance".<ref name = "LiteracyC" /> Tomás Alba, who fought under Guevara's command, later stated that "Che was loved, in spite of being stern and demanding. We would (have) given our life for him."<ref>[http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_18610.shtml Cuba Remembers Che Guevara 40 Years after his Fall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213092006/http://www.ezilon.com/information/article_18610.shtml |date=13 February 2008 }} by Rosa Tania Valdes, ''[[Reuters]]'', 8 October 2007</ref>

His commanding officer [[Fidel Castro]] described Guevara as intelligent, daring, and an exemplary leader who "had great moral authority over his troops".<ref>[[#refIgnacio2007|Ignacio 2007]], p. 177.</ref> Castro further remarked that Guevara took too many risks, even having a "tendency toward foolhardiness".<ref>[[#refIgnacio2007|Ignacio 2007]], p. 193.</ref> Guevara's teenage lieutenant, Joel Iglesias, recounts such actions in his diary, noting that Guevara's behavior in combat even brought admiration from the enemy. On one occasion Iglesias recounts the time he had been wounded in battle, stating "Che ran out to me, defying the bullets, threw me over his shoulder, and got me out of there. The guards didn't dare fire at him&nbsp;... later they told me he made a great impression on them when they saw him run out with his pistol stuck in his belt, ignoring the danger, they didn't dare shoot."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/companero.htm Poster Boy of The Revolution] by [[Saul Landau]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 19 October 1997, p.

Guevara was instrumental in creating the [[Pirate radio|clandestine radio station]] ''[[Radio Rebelde]]'' (Rebel Radio) in February 1958, which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by 26 July movement, and provided [[radiotelephone]] communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]].<ref name="radio">{{cite web|url=http://www.pateplumaradio.com/central/cuba/rebel1.html|title=Revolution! Clandestine Radio and the Rise of Fidel Castro|first=Don|last=Moore|publisher=Patepluma Radio}}</ref>

To quell the rebellion, Cuban government troops began executing rebel prisoners on the spot, and regularly rounded up, tortured, and shot civilians as a tactic of intimidation.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 42.</ref> By March 1958, the continued atrocities carried out by Batista's forces led the United States to stop selling arms to the Cuban government.<ref name="kellner"/> Then in late July 1958, Guevara played a critical role in the [[Battle of Las Mercedes]] by using his column to halt a force of 1,500 men called up by Batista's General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro's forces. Years later, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Larry Bockman of the [[United States Marine Corps]] analyzed and described Che's tactical appreciation of this battle as "brilliant".<ref>[[#refBockman1984|Bockman 1984]].</ref> During this time Guevara also became an "expert" at leading hit-and-run tactics against Batista's army, and then fading back into the countryside before the army could counterattack.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 40.</ref>

[[File:Che SClara.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Battle of Santa Clara]], 1 January 1959]]

As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards [[Havana]]. Travelling by foot, Guevara embarked on a difficult 7-week march, only travelling at night to avoid an ambush and often not eating for several days.<ref name="Kellner1989pg47">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 47.</ref> In the closing days of December 1958, Guevara's task was to cut the island in half by taking [[Las Villas (Cuba)|Las Villas]] province. In a matter of days he executed a series of "brilliant tactical victories" that gave him control of all but the province's capital city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]].<ref name="Kellner1989pg47" /> Guevara then directed his "suicide squad" in the [[Battle of Santa Clara|attack on Santa Clara]], which became the final decisive military victory of the revolution.<ref>[[#refCastro1972|Castro 1972]], pp. 439–442.</ref><ref>[[#refDorschner1980|Dorschner 1980]], pp. 41–47, 81–87.</ref> In the six weeks leading up to the battle, there were times when his men were completely surrounded, outgunned, and overrun. Che's eventual victory despite being outnumbered 10:1 remains in the view of some observers a "remarkable tour de force in modern warfare".<ref>[[#refSandison1996|Sandison 1996]], p. 39.</ref>

Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara's column had [[Battle of Santa Clara|taken Santa Clara]] on New Year's Eve 1958. This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media, which had at one stage reported Guevara's death during the fighting. At 3 am on 1 January 1959, upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with Guevara, [[Fulgencio Batista]] boarded a plane in Havana and fled for the [[Dominican Republic]], along with an amassed "fortune of more than $300,000,000 through graft and payoffs".<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 48.</ref> The following day on 2 January, Guevara entered [[Havana]] to take final control of the capital.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 13.</ref> Fidel Castro took six more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on 8 January 1959.

In 1959 the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals, captured and tried after the revolution.

Those persons executed by Guevara or on his orders were condemned for the usual crimes punishable by death at times of war or in its aftermath: desertion, treason or crimes such as rape, torture or murder. I should add that my research spanned five years, and included anti-Castro Cubans among the Cuban-American exile community in Miami and elsewhere.

Although accounts vary, it is estimated that several hundred people were executed nationwide during this time, with Guevara's jurisdictional death total at La Cabaña ranging from 55 to 105.<ref>Different sources cite differing numbers of executions attributable to Guevara, with some of the discrepancy resulting from the question of which deaths to attribute directly to Guevara and which to the regime as a whole. [[#refAnderson1997|Anderson (1997)]] gives the number specifically at La Cabaña prison as 55 (p. 387.), while also stating that "several hundred people were officially tried and executed across Cuba" as a whole (p. 387). ([[#refCastañeda1998|Castañeda 1998]]) notes that historians differ on the total number killed, with different studies placing it as anywhere from 200 to 700 nationwide (p. 143), although he notes that "after a certain date most of the executions occurred outside of Che's jurisdiction" (p. 143). These numbers are supported by the opposition-based [[#refFreeSoc|''Free Society Project / Cuba Archive'']], which gives the figure as 144 executions ordered by Guevara across Cuba in three years (1957–1959) and 105 "victims" specifically at La Cabaña, which according to them were all "carried out without due process of law". Of further note, much of the discrepancy in the estimates between 55 versus 105 executed at La Cabaña revolves around whether to include instances where Guevara had denied an appeal and signed off on a death warrant, but where the sentence was carried out while he traveled overseas from 4 June to 8 September, or after he relinquished his command of the fortress on 12 June 1959.</ref> Conflicting views exist of Guevara's attitude towards the executions at La Cabaña. Some exiled opposition biographers report that he relished the rituals of the firing squad, and organized them with gusto, while others relate that Guevara pardoned as many prisoners as he could.<ref name="Castañeda 1998 p 143-144">[[#refCastañeda1998|Castañeda 1998]], pp. 143–144.</ref> All sides acknowledge that Guevara had become a "hardened" man who had no qualms about the death penalty or about summary and collective trials. If the only way to "defend the revolution was to execute its enemies, he would not be swayed by humanitarian or political arguments".<ref name="Castañeda 1998 p 143-144" /> In a 5 February 1959, letter to Luis Paredes López in [[Buenos Aires]] Guevara states unequivocally: "The executions by firing squads are not only a necessity for the people of Cuba, but also an imposition of the people."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 375.</ref>

Along with ensuring "revolutionary justice", the other key early platform of Guevara was establishing agrarian [[land reform]]. Almost immediately after the success of the revolution, on 27 January 1959, Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about "the social ideas of the rebel army". During this speech he declared that the main concern of the new Cuban government was "the social justice that [[land redistribution]] brings about".<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 54.</ref> A few months later, 17 May 1959, the [[Agrarian Reform Laws of Cuba|Agrarian Reform Law]], crafted by Guevara, went into effect, limiting the size of all farms to {{convert|1000|acre|ha}}. Any holdings over these limits were expropriated by the government and either redistributed to peasants in {{convert|67|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcels or held as state-run communes.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 57.</ref> The law also stipulated that foreigners could not own Cuban sugar-plantations.<ref name="Kellner58" />

On 12 June 1959, Castro sent Guevara out on a three-month tour of 14 mostly [[Asian-African Conference|Bandung Pact]] countries (Morocco, Sudan, Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, [[Indonesia]], Japan, [[Yugoslavia]], Greece)<!-- Only 13 countries listed, not 14... --> and the cities of Singapore and Hong Kong.<ref>[[#refTaibo1999|Taibo 1999]], pp. 282–285.</ref> Sending Guevara away from Havana allowed Castro to appear to distance himself from Guevara and his [[Marxism|Marxist]] sympathies, which troubled both the United States and some of the members of Castro's 26 July Movement.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 423.</ref> While in [[Jakarta]], Guevara visited Indonesian president [[Sukarno]] to discuss the recent [[Indonesian revolution|revolution of 1945-1949 in Indonesia]] and to establish trade relations between their two countries.

During the visit he refused to visit and lay a wreath at Japan's [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] commemorating soldiers lost during [[World War II]], remarking that the Japanese "imperialists" had "killed millions of Asians".<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 431">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 431.</ref> Instead, Guevara stated that he would visit [[Hiroshima]], where the American military had [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|detonated]] an [[Little Boy|atom-bomb]] 14 years earlier.<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 431" /> Despite his denunciation of [[Imperial Japan]], Guevara considered [[Harry S.

Upon Guevara's return to Cuba in September 1959, it became evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures in accordance with the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low-interest "bonds", a step which put the United States on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of [[Camagüey]] mounted a campaign against the land redistributions and enlisted the newly-disaffected rebel leader [[Huber Matos]], who along with the anti-Communist wing of 26 July Movement, joined them in denouncing "Communist encroachment".<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 435">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 435.</ref> During this time Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] was offering assistance to the "[[Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean]]" which was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force, composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans, but also of Croatians, Germans, Greeks, and right-wing mercenaries, was plotting to topple Castro's new regime.<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 435"/>

[[File:KordaOfCheWalking.jpg|thumb| Guevara in 1960, walking through the streets of Havana with his wife [[Aleida March]] (right)]]

Such threats were heightened when, on 4 March 1960, two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'']], which was carrying [[FN FAL|Belgian munitions]] from the port of [[Antwerp]], and was docked in [[Havana Harbor]]. The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred, with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims. Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of "an act of terrorism" and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast.<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 25.</ref> At the memorial service [[Alberto Korda]] took the famous photograph of Guevara, now known as [[Che Guevara (photo)|''Guerrillero Heroico'']].<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], pp. 25–50.</ref>

Perceived threats prompted Castro to eliminate more "[[counter-revolutionaries]]" and to utilize Guevara to drastically increase the speed of [[land reform]]. To implement this plan, a new government agency, the [[National Institute of Agrarian Reform]] (INRA), was established by the Cuban Government to administer the new Agrarian Reform law. INRA quickly became the most important governing body in the nation, with Guevara serving as its head in his capacity as minister of industries.<ref name="Kellner58">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 58.</ref>{{qn|date=June 2019}} Under Guevara's command, INRA established its own 100,000-person militia, used first to help the government seize control of the expropriated land and supervise its distribution, and later to set up cooperative farms. The land confiscated included {{convert|480000|acre|ha}} owned by United States corporations.<ref name="Kellner58" /> Months later, in retaliation, US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sharply reduced United States imports of Cuban sugar (Cuba's main cash crop), which led Guevara on 10 July 1960 to address over 100,000 workers in front of the [[Museum of the Revolution (Cuba)|Presidential Palace]] at a rally to denounce the "economic aggression" of the United States.<ref name="Kellner55">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 55.</ref> [[Time (magazine)|''Time Magazine'']] reporters who met with Guevara around this time described him as "guid(ing) Cuba with icy calculation, vast competence, high intelligence, and a perceptive sense of humor."<ref name="Castrosbrain1960" />

Along with land reform, Guevara stressed the need for national improvement in [[literacy]]. Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60–76%, with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factors.<ref name="Kellnerpg61">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 61.</ref> As a result, the Cuban government at Guevara's behest dubbed 1961 the "year of education" and mobilized over 100,000 volunteers into "literacy brigades", who were then sent out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate ''guajiros'' (peasants) to read and write.<ref name = "LiteracyC">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html Latin lessons: What can we Learn from the World's most Ambitious Literacy Campaign?] by ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 November 2010</ref><ref name="Kellnerpg61"/> Unlike many of Guevara's later economic initiatives, this campaign was "a remarkable success". By the completion of the [[Cuban Literacy Campaign]], 707,212 adults had been taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96%.<ref name="Kellnerpg61"/>

Accompanying literacy, Guevara was also concerned with establishing universal access to higher education. To accomplish this the new regime introduced [[affirmative action]] to the universities. While announcing this new commitment, Guevara told the gathered faculty and students at the [[University "Marta Abreu" of Las Villas|University of Las Villas]] that the days when education was "a privilege of the white middle class" had ended. "The University" he said, "must paint itself black, mulatto, worker, and peasant."

===Marxist ideological influence===

In September 1960, when Guevara was asked about Cuba's ideology at the First Latin American Congress, he replied, "If I were asked whether our revolution is Communist, I would define it as [[Marxism|Marxist]]. Our revolution has discovered by its methods the paths that Marx pointed out."<ref>[http://www.unz.org/Pub/NewRepublic-1960sep12-00008  Cuba: A Dissenting Report], by Samuel Shapiro, [[The New Republic|''New Republic'']], 12 September 1960, pp. 8-26, 21.</ref> Consequently, when enacting and advocating Cuban policy, Guevara cited the political philosopher [[Karl Marx]] as his ideological inspiration. In defending his political stance, Guevara confidently remarked, "There are truths so evident, so much a part of people's knowledge, that it is now useless to discuss them. One ought to be Marxist with the same naturalness with which one is '[[Newtonian dynamics|Newtonian]]' in [[physics]], or '[[Louis Pasteur|Pasteurian]]' in [[biology]]."<ref name = "Notes1960" /> According to Guevara, the "practical revolutionaries" of the Cuban Revolution had the goal of "simply fulfill(ing) laws foreseen by Marx, the scientist."<ref name = "Notes1960" /> Using Marx's predictions and system of [[dialectical materialism]], Guevara professed that "The laws of [[Marxism]] are present in the events of the Cuban Revolution, independently of what its leaders profess or fully know of those laws from a theoretical point of view."<ref name = "Notes1960" />

At this stage, Guevara acquired the additional position of Finance Minister, as well as President of the [[National Bank of Cuba|National Bank]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://banconacionaldecuba.com/ernesto-che-guevara/|title=Ernesto "Che" Guevara}}</ref> These appointments, combined with his existing position as Minister of Industries, placed Guevara at the zenith of his power, as the "virtual czar" of the Cuban economy.<ref name="Kellner55"/> As a consequence of his position at the head of the central bank, it became Guevara's duty to sign the Cuban currency, which per custom bore his signature. Instead of using his full name, he signed the bills solely "''Che''".<ref name="Crompton2009">[[#refCrompton2009|Crompton 2009]], p. 71.</ref> It was through this symbolic act, which horrified many in the Cuban financial sector, that Guevara signaled his distaste for money and the class distinctions it brought about.<ref name="Crompton2009"/> Guevara's long time friend Ricardo Rojo later remarked that "the day he signed ''Che'' on the bills, (he) literally knocked the props from under the widespread belief that money was sacred."<ref name="kellner60">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 60.</ref>

In an effort to eliminate [[Social inequality|social inequalities]], Guevara and Cuba's new leadership had moved to swiftly transform the political and economic base of the country through [[nationalization|nationalizing]] factories, banks, and businesses, while attempting to ensure affordable housing, healthcare, and employment for all Cubans.<ref name = "Hansing4142">[[#refHansing2002|Hansing 2002]], pp 41–42.</ref> In order for a genuine transformation of consciousness to take root, it was believed that such structural changes had to be accompanied by a conversion in people's [[social relation]]s and [[Value system|values]]. Believing that the attitudes in Cuba towards race, women, [[individualism]], and manual labor were the product of the island's outdated past, all individuals were urged to view each other as equals and take on the values of what Guevara termed ''"el Hombre Nuevo"'' (the New Man).<ref name= "Hansing4142" /> Guevara hoped his "new man" to be ultimately "selfless and cooperative, obedient and hard working, [[gender-blind]], incorruptible, [[Anti-consumerism|non-materialistic]], and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]".<ref name= "Hansing4142" /> To accomplish this, Guevara emphasized the tenets of [[Marxism–Leninism]], and wanted to use the state to emphasize qualities such as [[egalitarianism]] and [[self-sacrifice]], at the same time as "unity, equality, and freedom" became the new maxims.<ref name= "Hansing4142" />  This conversion of social relations and values is embodied in its abandonment of [[Machismo|machismo.]] Culturally this abandonment is shown through the cinema of the [[Cuban Revolution]].  In revolutionary Cuba where public political discourse was limited, films provide a platform for political discourse in Cuba by tackling controversial issues in a complex manner.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Granados|first=Omar|date=2014|title=Children, Material Culture and the 'New Man' Ideology in Contemporary Cuban Film|url=http://nebula.wsimg.com/0fbbcea7c288f891df908b790186c8c2?AccessKeyId=F0152308703B0C3D5115&disposition=0&alloworigin=1|journal=Redfeather Journal|volume=|pages=42-56|via=ebsco}}</ref>  Films like ''[[De Cierta Manera]]'' exemplify these shifts in Cuban society through its use of a female director and subversive plot.  The film sees a relationship blossom between a low class [[mulatto]] and a middle class pale teacher.  The plot, "exposes and subverts the traditional notion of spectator identification and thus posits a truly ‘revolutionary’ and potentially subversive character representation."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=Guy|date=2010-03-01|title=The Illusion of Equality: Machismo and Cuban Cinema of the Revolution|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1470-9856.2010.00383.x|journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=354–366|doi=10.1111/j.1470-9856.2010.00383.x}}</ref>  The revolutionary notions of the film can be seen through a romantic relationship sparking across racial and class lines.  Subversive films like De Cierta Manera challenged the Latin American idea of [[Machismo]].  The Film ''[[Up to a Certain Point|Up to a certain point]]'' establishes a need for the abandonment of machismo in order for Cuba to be a true socialist state. Although subversive films like these were released to cement the ideal "new man" in Cuban culture, some films like ''[[Hasta cierto punto]]'' challenge the idea of Machismo, but depict the male view as dominant and instead depict the illusion of change.  The abandonment of machismo is present in Cuban film although some scholars argue that it was merely surface level and represent the views of gender roles in Cuban society as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=Guy|date=2010-03-01|title=The Illusion of Equality: Machismo and Cuban Cinema of the Revolution|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1470-9856.2010.00383.x|journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=354–366|doi=10.1111/j.1470-9856.2010.00383.x}}</ref>  This is shown in the role of women in revolutionary society.  Although the revolution allowed women control over their personal, professional, and reproductive lives there was a persistent view that Cuba was built by a brotherhood of men.  This saw women as "revolutionary mothers" who were subalterns of the state.<ref>{{Citation|last=Vangipurapu|first=Ira|title=Gender Revolution in Socialist Cuba: Up to a Certain Point|date=2015-09-19|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-81-322-2437-2_9|work=Transcultural Negotiations of Gender|pages=93–101|place=New Delhi|publisher=Springer India|isbn=978-81-322-2436-5|access-date=2020-12-04}}</ref>  The idea that gender equality was surface level can be shown in the [[:es:Código_de_familia|Codigo de la Familia]] which called for men to take a more active role in the household, but was rarely enforced.  Another example of this surface level equality is shown in Guevara's book , "[https://webs.ucm.es/info/bas/utopia/html/actual07.htm El hombre Nuevo]"(1965).  Women are first and foremost depicted as wives of revolutionaries, however they also have the additional roles of militants and volunteer workers.  Women's commitment to the revolution directly influenced their desirability to men.  This led to hypersexualized depictions of women who abided by the revolution while showing non revolutionary women as undesirable to men in mass media.  Guevara was connecting traditional Latin American gender concepts of femininity to the socialist revolution by stating that women's commitment to the revolution was not important for the outcome of the revolution but rather for their overall desirability to men.  Guevara's book continues to outline the role of women in society by dictating how they should look for men in addition to what to look for in a man.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zaviezo|first=Gabriela|date=2016|title=The New New Man: (Re)articulations of masculinity in post revolutionary Cuba|url=https://scholarship.miami.edu/discovery/fulldisplay/alma991031447192302976/01UOML_INST:ResearchRepository|journal=dissertation|volume=|pages=214|via=Proquest}}</ref>  Cuban cartoons depict desirable Cuban women as revolutionary and voluptuous while depicting the undesirable Cuban man as Americanized.  The desirable Cuban man was seen as industrious and willing to serve the state when he was called upon.  The Cuban man often had to participate in voluntary agricultural work to help the agricultural production of the state.  This was tied to the idea that the Cuban "new man" was essential for the survival of a socialist state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tome|first=Lester|date=|title=Swans in Sugarcane Fields: Proletarian Ballet Dancers and the Cuban Revolution's Industrious New Man.|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/dance-research-journal/article/abs/swans-in-sugarcane-fields-proletarian-ballet-dancers-and-the-cuban-revolutions-industrious-new-man/C664DB5A77C61D98B4C965484C92316A|journal=Dance Research Journal|volume=49|pages=22|via=EBSCO}}</ref>  The depiction of women and men in Cuban media influenced gender relations in Cuban society as a whole.  The outcomes of the depictions and legislations brought forth by Guevara's "New Man" are shown in the role of women in revolutionary society which saw their role in the domestic sphere mostly unchanged and pre existing notions of masculinity and femininity still being dominant in the political theatre.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchens|first=Rex R.|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/5506143|title=The Education of Cuban Women: An Analysis of the Politics of Gender|last2=Chilcott|first2=John|date=1989|publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>  The aftermath of Guevara's "new man" ideology can be seen in the dynamics of post revolutionary romantic relationships and society.  In post revolutionary Cuban society, men were in constant fear of infidelity as the importance of capitalism increased in Cuba. Now that monetary exchange had value in Cuba, daily necessitates were no longer provided for by the government which meant money was needed for day to day life.  This meant that women would often leave their partner for someone who was wealthy or foreign because migration became an important part of Cuban society.  Machismo is still present at this point and is embodied in men's paranoia, women were often controlled by their partners to ensure their faithfulness .<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=HÄRKÖNEN|first=Heidi|date=2013|title=LOVE, JEALOUSY AND GENDER IN POST-SOVIET HAVANA.|url=https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/love-jealousy-and-gender-in-post-soviet-havana|journal=Journal of Finnish Anthropological society|volume=38|pages=9|via=EBSCO}}</ref> The impact of this shift in gender is seen in Cuban society as a whole.  New class disparities emerge amongst poor Cuban men, wealthy Cuban men, and tourists.  Cuban women are searching for wealthy men which in turn attracts more wealthy tourists to the island, leading to a further dominance of monetary exchange in Cuba which leads to a further class disparity between rich and poor Cubans.<ref name=":0" />  The economic goal of Guevara's new man was undone with the rise of capitalism in Cuba.  Guevara's first desired economic goal of the new man, which coincided with his aversion for [[wealth condensation]] and [[economic inequality]], was to see a nationwide elimination of material incentives in favor of [[Morality|moral]] ones. He negatively viewed capitalism as a "contest among wolves" where "one can only win at the cost of others" and thus desired to see the creation of a "new man and woman".<ref name="SocialismAndMan" /> Guevara continually stressed that a socialist economy in itself is not "worth the effort, sacrifice, and risks of war and destruction" if it ends up encouraging "greed and individual ambition at the expense of [[collectivism|collective spirit]]".<ref name="Kellner62">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 62.</ref> A primary goal of Guevara's thus became to reform "individual consciousness" and values to produce better workers and citizens.<ref name="Kellner62" /> In his view, Cuba's "new man" would be able to overcome the "[[egotism]]" and "[[selfishness]]" that he loathed and discerned was uniquely characteristic of individuals in capitalist societies.<ref name="Kellner62" /> To promote this concept of a "new man", the government also created a series of party-dominated institutions and mechanisms on all levels of society, which included organizations such as [[Labour movement|labor groups]], [[Young Communist League|youth leagues]], [[List of women's organizations|women's groups]], [[Community centre|community centers]], and [[Palace of Culture|houses of culture]] to promote state-sponsored art, music, and literature. In congruence with this, all educational, mass media, and artistic community based facilities were nationalized and utilized to instill the government's official [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist]] ideology.<ref name= "Hansing4142" /> In describing this new method of "development", Guevara stated:

{{quote|There is a great difference between free-enterprise development and revolutionary development. In one of them, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a fortunate few, the friends of the government, the best wheeler-dealers.

A further integral part of fostering a sense of "unity between the individual and the mass", Guevara believed, was volunteer work and will. To display this, Guevara "led by example", working "endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane" on his day off.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_guevara.html PBS: Che Guevara, Popular but Ineffective].</ref> He was known for working 36 hours at a stretch, calling meetings after midnight, and eating on the run.<ref name="Kellner62" /> Such behavior was emblematic of Guevara's new program of moral incentives, where each worker was now required to meet a quota and produce a certain quantity of goods. As a replacement for the pay increases abolished by Guevara, workers who exceeded their quota now only received a certificate of commendation, while workers who failed to meet their quotas were given a pay cut.<ref name="Kellner62" /> Guevara unapologetically defended his personal philosophy towards motivation and work, stating:

In the face of a loss of commercial connections with Western states, Guevara tried to replace them with closer commercial relationships with [[Eastern Bloc]] states, visiting a number of Marxist states and signing trade agreements with them. At the end of 1960 he visited [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Soviet Union]], North Korea, Hungary and [[East Germany]] and signed, for instance, a trade agreement in [[East Berlin]] on 17 December 1960.<ref>{{cite journal|date=23 March 1984|title=Latin America Report|issue=JPRS–LAM–84–037|page=24|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA351284|publisher=Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS)|access-date=30 October 2010}}</ref> Such agreements helped Cuba's economy to a certain degree but also had the disadvantage of a growing economic dependency on the Eastern Bloc. It was also in East Germany where Guevara met [[Tamara Bunke]] (later known as "Tania"), who was assigned as his interpreter, and who joined him years later, and was killed with him in Bolivia.

=== Bay of Pigs, and missile crisis ===
{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
{{anchor|gunaccident}} On 17 April 1961, 1,400 U.S.-trained Cuban exiles invaded Cuba during the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. Guevara did not play a key role in the fighting, as one day before the invasion a warship carrying Marines faked an invasion off the West Coast of [[Pinar del Río]] and drew forces commanded by Guevara to that region. However, historians give him a share of credit for the victory as he was director of instruction for Cuba's armed forces at the time.<ref name="Kellner89pg69" /> Author [[Tad Szulc]] in his explanation of the Cuban victory, assigns Guevara partial credit, stating: "The revolutionaries won because Che Guevara, as the head of the Instruction Department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in charge of the militia training program, had done so well in preparing 200,000 men and women for war."<ref name="Kellner89pg69" /> It was also during this deployment that he suffered a bullet grazing to the cheek when his pistol fell out of its holster and accidentally discharged.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 507.</ref>

[[File:CheyFidel.jpg|thumb|left|Guevara (left) and [[Fidel Castro]], photographed by Alberto Korda in 1961]]

In August 1961, during an economic conference of the [[Organization of American States]] in [[Punta del Este]], Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note of "gratitude" to United States President [[John F. Kennedy]] through [[Richard N. Goodwin]], Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. It read "Thanks for Playa Girón (Bay of Pigs). Before the invasion, the revolution was shaky. Now it's stronger than ever."<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 509.</ref> In response to United States Treasury Secretary [[Douglas Dillon]] presenting the [[Alliance for Progress]] for ratification by the meeting, Guevara antagonistically attacked the United States claim of being a "democracy", stating that such a system was not compatible with "financial [[oligarchy]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|discrimination against blacks]], and outrages by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]".<ref name="PuntaDelEsteChe">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1961/08/08.htm "Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics"] speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on 8 August 1961.</ref> Guevara continued, speaking out against the "persecution" that in his view "drove scientists like [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] from their posts, deprived the world for years of the marvelous voice of [[Paul Robeson]], and sent [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|the Rosenbergs]] to their deaths against the protests of a shocked world."<ref name="PuntaDelEsteChe"/> Guevara ended his remarks by insinuating that the United States was not interested in real reforms, sardonically quipping that "U.S. experts never talk about agrarian reform; they prefer a safe subject, like a better water supply. In short, they seem to prepare the revolution of the toilets."<ref name="Kell1">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 78.</ref> Nevertheless, Goodwin stated in his memo to President Kennedy following the meeting that Guevara viewed him as someone of the "newer generation"<ref name=goodwinche /> and that Guevara, whom Goodwin alleged sent a message to him the day after the meeting through one of the meeting's Argentine participants whom he described as "Darretta,"<ref name=goodwinche /> also viewed the conversation which the two had as "quite profitable."<ref name=goodwinche>http://americancentury.omeka.wlu.edu/files/original/3e027f808b843322ec9f28e8e78e93b7.pdf</ref>

Guevara, who was practically the architect of the [[Cuban–Soviet relations|Soviet–Cuban relationship]],<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 492.</ref> then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] [[ballistic missile]]s that precipitated the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 530.</ref> A few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'', Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.<ref name="Anderson 1997 p 545">[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 545.</ref> While expounding on the incident later, Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global "imperialist aggression" would ultimately have been worth the possibility of "millions of atomic war victims".<ref>[[#refGuevaraDeutschmann1997|Guevara 1997]], p 304</ref> The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the world's two superpowers (the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward, he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 73.</ref>

==International diplomacy==
[[File:CheGuevaraCountries.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Countries Che Guevara visited (red) and those in which he participated in armed revolution (green)]]

In December 1964, Che Guevara had emerged as a "revolutionary statesman of world stature" and thus traveled to New York City as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the United Nations.<ref name="kellner60"/> On 11 December 1964, during Guevara's hour-long, impassioned address at the UN, he criticized the United Nations' inability to confront the "brutal [[South Africa under apartheid|policy of apartheid]]" in South Africa, asking "Can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?"<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1964/12/11.htm "Colonialism is Doomed"] speech to the 19th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York City by Cuban representative Che Guevara on 11 December 1964.</ref> Guevara then denounced the [[Jim Crow laws|United States policy towards their black population]], stating:

{{quote|Those who kill their own children and discriminate daily against them because of the color of their skin; those who let the murderers of blacks remain free, protecting them, and furthermore punishing the black population because they demand their legitimate rights as free men—how can those who do this consider themselves guardians of freedom?<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/>}}

An indignant Guevara ended his speech by reciting the ''Second Declaration of Havana'', decreeing Latin America a "family of 200 million brothers who suffer the same miseries".<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/> This "epic", Guevara declared, would be written by the "hungry Indian masses, peasants without land, exploited workers, and progressive masses". To Guevara the conflict was a struggle of masses and ideas, which would be carried forth by those "mistreated and scorned by [[imperialism]]" who were previously considered "a weak and submissive flock". With this "flock", Guevara now asserted, "Yankee monopoly capitalism" now terrifyingly saw their "gravediggers".<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/> It would be during this "hour of vindication", Guevara pronounced, that the "anonymous mass" would begin to write its own history "with its own blood" and reclaim those "rights that were laughed at by one and all for 500 years". Guevara closed his remarks to the General Assembly by hypothesizing that this "wave of anger" would "sweep the lands of Latin America" and that the labor masses who "turn the wheel of history" were now, for the first time, "awakening from the long, brutalizing sleep to which they had been subjected".<ref name="GuevaraUnitedNations"/>

Guevara later learned there had been two failed attempts on his life by [[Cuban exiles]] during his stop at the UN complex.<ref name="NYTDec1964">[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/belligerence/bazooka.htm Bazooka Fired at UN as Cuban Speaks] by [[Homer Bigart]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 December 1964, p. 1.</ref> The first from Molly Gonzales, who tried to break through barricades upon his arrival with a seven-inch hunting knife, and later during his address by Guillermo Novo, who fired a timer-initiated bazooka from a boat in the [[East River]] at the [[United Nations Headquarters]], but missed and was off target. Afterwards Guevara commented on both incidents, stating that "it is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than by a man with a gun", while adding with a languid wave of his cigar that the explosion had "given the whole thing more flavor".<ref name="NYTDec1964"/>

[[File:CheinMoscow.jpg|thumb|upright|Walking through [[Red Square]] in Moscow, November 1964]]

While in New York, Guevara appeared on the [[CBS]] Sunday news program ''[[Face the Nation]],''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPCuzfDeUpc CBS Video] of Che Guevara being interviewed by ''[[Face the Nation]]'' on 13 December 1964, (29:11)</ref> and met with a wide range of people, from United States Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]<ref>[[#refHart2004|Hart 2004]], p. 271.</ref> to associates of [[Malcolm X]]. The latter expressed his admiration, declaring Guevara "one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now" while reading a statement from him to a crowd at the [[Audubon Ballroom]].<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 618.</ref>

On 17 December, Guevara left New York for Paris, France, and from there embarked on a three-month world tour that included visits to the People's Republic of China, North Korea, the [[United Arab Republic]], Algeria, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Dahomey, Congo-Brazzaville and Tanzania, with stops in Ireland and [[Prague]]. While in Ireland, Guevara embraced his own Irish heritage, celebrating [[Saint Patrick's Day]] in [[Limerick]] city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/che_guevara_irish_roots.htm |title=Che Guevara: Father Of Revolution, Son Of Galway |publisher=Fantompowa.net |access-date=31 October 2010}}</ref> He wrote to his father on this visit, humorously stating "I am in this green Ireland of your ancestors. When they found out, the television [station] came to ask me about the Lynch genealogy, but in case they were horse thieves or something like that, I didn't say much."<ref>[http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Gerry-Adam-featured-in-new-Che-Guevara-documentary-57716202.html Gerry Adams Featured in New Che Guevara Documentary] by Kenneth Haynes, ''Irish Central'', 8 September 2009</ref>

During this voyage, he wrote a letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of a Uruguayan weekly, which was later retitled ''Socialism and Man in Cuba''.<ref name="SocialismAndMan">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm "Socialism and Man in Cuba"] A letter to [[Carlos Quijano]], editor of ''[[Marcha (newspaper)|Marcha]]'', a weekly newspaper published in Montevideo, Uruguay; published as "From Algiers, for Marcha: The Cuban Revolution Today" by Che Guevara on 12 March 1965.</ref> Outlined in the treatise was Guevara's summons for the creation of a new consciousness, a new status of work, and a new role of the individual. He also laid out the reasoning behind his [[anti-capitalist]] sentiments, stating:

{{quote|The laws of capitalism, blind and invisible to the majority, act upon the individual without his thinking about it. He sees only the vastness of a seemingly infinite horizon before him. That is how it is painted by capitalist propagandists, who purport to draw a lesson from the example of [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]]—whether or not it is true—about the possibilities of success. The amount of poverty and suffering required for the emergence of [[Rockefeller family|a Rockefeller]], and the amount of depravity that the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude entails, are left out of the picture, and it is not always possible to make the people in general see this.<ref name="SocialismAndMan"/>}}

Guevara ended the essay by declaring that "the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love" and beckoning on all revolutionaries to "strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into acts that serve as examples", thus becoming "a moving force".<ref name="SocialismAndMan"/> The genesis for Guevara's assertions relied on the fact that he believed the example of the Cuban Revolution was "something spiritual that would transcend all borders".<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

===Algiers, the Soviets, and China===
In [[Algiers]], Algeria, on 24 February 1965, Guevara made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity.<ref>[[#refGuevara1969|Guevara 1969]], p. 350.</ref><ref>{{cite web

He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of [[imperialism]].<ref>[[#refGuevara1969|Guevara 1969]], pp. 352–59.</ref> Having criticized the Soviet Union (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on 14 March to a solemn reception by Fidel and Raúl Castro, Osvaldo Dorticós and Carlos Rafael Rodríguez at the Havana airport.

As revealed in his last public speech in Algiers, Guevara had come to view the [[Northern Hemisphere]], led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. He strongly supported Communist [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Vietnam War]], and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create "many Vietnams".<ref name="MessTricont1967">[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1967/04/16.htm Message to the Tricontinental] (1967) A letter sent by Che Guevara from his jungle camp in Bolivia, to the Tricontinental Solidarity Organisation in Havana, Cuba, in the Spring of 1967.</ref> Che's denunciations of the Soviets made him popular among intellectuals and artists of the Western European left who had lost faith in the Soviet Union, while his condemnation of imperialism and call to revolution inspired young radical students in the United States, who were impatient for societal change.<ref name="Michiko">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/books/21kaku.html Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer's Dream] by [[Michiko Kakutani]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 April 2009</ref>

In Guevara's private writings from this time (since released), he displays his growing criticism of the Soviet political economy, believing that the Soviets had "forgotten [[Karl Marx|Marx]]".<ref name = "Yaffe2006">[http://www.marxists.org/subject/economy/authors/yaffeh/che-critic.htm Ernesto 'Che' Guevara: A Rebel Against Soviet Political Economy] by Helen Yaffe (author of ''Che Guevara: The Economics of Revolution''), 2006</ref> This led Guevara to denounce a range of Soviet practices including what he saw as their attempt to "air-brush the inherent violence of [[class struggle]] integral to [[Communization|the transition]] from capitalism to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]", their "dangerous" policy of [[peaceful co-existence]] with the United States, their failure to push for a "change in consciousness" towards the idea of work, and their attempt to "[[Liberalization|liberalize]]" the socialist economy. Guevara wanted the complete elimination of money, [[interest]], [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|commodity production]], the [[market economy]], and "[[Mercantilism|mercantile relationships]]": all conditions that the Soviets argued would only disappear when [[world communism]] was achieved.<ref name="Yaffe2006"/> Disagreeing with this incrementalist approach, Guevara criticized the ''Soviet Manual of Political Economy'', correctly predicting that if USSR did not abolish the [[law of value]] (as Guevara desired), it would eventually return to capitalism.<ref name="Yaffe2006"/>

Two weeks after his Algiers speech and his return to Cuba, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether.<ref>[[#refAbrams2010|Abrams 2010]], p. 100</ref> His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the Cuban industrialization scheme he had advocated while minister of industries, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials who disapproved of Guevara's pro-[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] stance on the [[Sino-Soviet split]], and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.<ref>[[#refAbrams2010|Abrams 2010]], p. 103.</ref> Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on 16 June 1965, that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Still, rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba concerning the missing Guevara's whereabouts.

On 3 October 1965, Castro publicly revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara around seven months earlier which was later titled Che Guevara's "farewell letter". In the letter, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the Cuban government and communist party, and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.<ref>[[#refGuevara1965|Guevara 1965]].</ref>

==Congo==
[[File:CheInCongo1965.jpg|thumb|upright|left|37-year-old Guevara, holding a Congolese baby and standing with a fellow [[Afro-Cuban]] soldier in the [[Congo Crisis]], 1965]]

In early 1965, Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing [[Simba Rebellion|conflict in the Congo]]. According to Algerian President [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link and so had enormous revolutionary potential.<ref>[[#refBenBella1997|Ben Bella 1997]].</ref> Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who had fraternal relations with Che since his 1959 visit, saw Guevara's plan to fight in Congo as "unwise" and warned that he would become a "[[Tarzan]]" figure, doomed to failure.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 624.</ref> Despite the warning, Guevara traveled to Congo using the alias Ramón Benítez.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 629.</ref> He led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing Congo crisis. Guevara, his second-in-command [[Víctor Dreke]], and 12 other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in Congo on 24 April 1965, and a contingent of approximately 100 [[Afro-Cuban]]s joined them soon afterward.<ref>[[#refGalvez1999|Gálvez 1999]], p. 62.</ref><ref>[[#refGott2004|Gott 2004]] p. 219.</ref> For a time, they collaborated with guerrilla leader [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], who had helped supporters of the overthrown president [[Patrice Lumumba]] to lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier. As an admirer of the late Lumumba, Guevara declared that his "murder should be a lesson for all of us".<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 86.</ref> Guevara, with limited knowledge of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and the local languages, was assigned a teenage interpreter, Freddy Ilanga. Over the course of seven months, Ilanga grew to "admire the hard-working Guevara", who "showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4522526.stm DR Congo's Rebel-Turned-Brain Surgeon] by Mark Doyle, ''BBC World Affairs'', 13 December 2005.</ref> Guevara soon became disillusioned with the poor discipline of Kabila's troops and later dismissed him, stating "nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour".<ref>[[#CITEREFBBCNews2001a|BBC News]] 17 January 2001.</ref>

As an additional obstacle, white mercenary troops of the [[Force Publique|Congo National Army]], led by [[Mike Hoare]] and supported by anti-Castro Cuban pilots and the CIA, thwarted Guevara's movements from his base camp in the mountains near the village of [[Fizi]] on [[Lake Tanganyika]] in southeast Congo. They were able to monitor his communications and so pre-empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines. Although Guevara tried to conceal his presence in Congo, the United States government knew his location and activities. The [[National Security Agency]] was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the {{USNS|Private Jose F. Valdez|T-AG-169}}, a floating listening post that continuously cruised the Indian Ocean off [[Dar es Salaam]] for that purpose.<ref>"The intercept operators knew that Dar-es-Salaam was serving as a communications center for the fighters, receiving messages from Castro in Cuba and relaying them on to the guerrillas deep in the bush." ([[#refBamford2002|Bamford 2002]], p. 181)</ref>

Guevara's aim was to [[export the revolution]] by instructing local anti-[[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] Simba fighters in [[Marxist]] ideology and [[foco theory]] strategies of [[guerrilla warfare]]. In his ''Congo Diary'' book, he cites a combination of incompetence, intransigence and infighting among the Congolese rebels as key reasons for the revolt's failure.<ref>[[#CITEREFIreland's Own2000|Ireland's Own 2000]].</ref> Later that year, on 20 November 1965, suffering from [[dysentery]] and acute asthma, and disheartened after seven months of defeats and inactivity, Guevara left Congo with the six Cuban survivors of his 12-man column. Guevara stated that he had planned to send the wounded back to Cuba and fight in Congo alone until his death, as a revolutionary example. But after being urged by his comrades, and two Cuban emissaries personally sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave Africa. During that day and night, Guevara's forces quietly took down their base camp, burned their huts, and destroyed or threw weapons into Lake Tanganyika that they could not take with them, before crossing the border by boat into Tanzania at night and traveling by land to Dar es Salaam. In speaking about his experience in Congo months later, Guevara concluded that he left rather than fight to the death because: "The human element failed. There is no will to fight. The [rebel] leaders are corrupt. In a word&nbsp;... there was nothing to do."<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 87.</ref> Guevara also declared that "we can not liberate, all by ourselves, a country that does not want to fight."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/12/cuba.artsandhumanities From Cuba to Congo, Dream to Disaster for Che Guevara] by ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 August 2000</ref> A few weeks later, he wrote the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, that began: "This is the story of a failure."<ref>[[#refGuevara2000|Guevara 2000]], p. 1.</ref>

Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba, because Castro had already made public Guevara's "farewell letter"—a letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death—wherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world.<ref>[[#refCastañeda1998|Castañeda 1998]], p. 316.</ref> As a result, Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely at the Cuban embassy in [[Dar es Salaam]] and later at a Cuban safehouse in [[Prague]].<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/129231 Che Guevara's Central Bohemian Hideaway] article and audio by Ian Willoughby, ''[[Czech Radio|Český rozhlas]]'', 27 June 2010</ref> While in Europe, Guevara made a secret visit to former Argentine president [[Juan Perón]] who lived in exile in [[Francoist Spain]] where he confided in Perón about his new plan to formulate a communist revolution to bring all of Latin America under socialist control. Perón warned Guevara that his plans for implementing a communist revolution throughout Latin America, starting with Bolivia, would be suicidal and futile, but Guevara's mind was already made up. Later, Perón remarked that Guevara was "an immature utopian... but one of us. I am happy for it to be so because he is giving the Yankees a real headache."<ref name=ODonnell>{{cite news |last=O'Donnell |first=Pacho |title=Opiniones de Perón sobre el Che|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/subnotas/178453-56017-2011-10-08.html |newspaper=[[Página/12]] |access-date=23 May 2015|language=es}}</ref>

During this time abroad, Guevara compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy and the other on economics. As Guevara prepared for Bolivia, he secretly traveled back to Cuba on 21 July 1966 to visit Castro, as well as to see his wife and to write a last letter to his five children to be read upon his death, which ended with him instructing them:

In late 1966, Guevara's location was still not public knowledge, although representatives of Mozambique's independence movement, the [[FRELIMO]], reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project, an offer which they ultimately rejected.<ref>[[#refMittleman1981|Mittleman 1981]], p. 38.</ref> In a speech at the 1967 [[International Workers' Day]] rally in Havana, the acting minister of the armed forces, Major [[Juan Almeida]], announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:CheinBolivia1.jpg|thumb|Guevara in rural Bolivia, shortly before his death (1967)]]

Three days after his arrival in Bolivia, Guevara left La Paz for the rural south east region of the country to form his guerrilla army. Guevara's first base camp was located in the [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|montane dry forest]] in the remote Ñancahuazú region. Training at the camp in the Ñancahuazú valley proved to be hazardous, and little was accomplished in way of building a guerrilla army. The [[Argentine]]-born [[East German]] operative [[Tamara Bunke|Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider]], better known by her ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Tania", had been installed as Che's primary agent in [[La Paz]].<ref name="#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985">[[#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985]].</ref><ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 693.</ref>

Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 men<ref>[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/che/bolivia-guerrillas.htm Members of Che Guevara's Guerrilla Movement in Bolivia] by the ''Latin American Studies Organization''
</ref> and operating as the ELN (''Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia'', "[[National Liberation Army of Bolivia]]"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian army regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous [[Camiri]] region during the early months of 1967. As a result of Guevara's units' winning several skirmishes against Bolivian troops in the spring and summer of 1967, the Bolivian government began to overestimate the true size of the guerrilla force.<ref>[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 97.</ref>

Researchers hypothesize that Guevara's plan for fomenting a revolution in Bolivia failed for an array of reasons:
* Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents that he did not receive, nor did he receive support from Bolivia's Communist Party under the leadership of [[Mario Monje]], which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana. In Guevara's own diary captured after his death, he wrote about the [[Communist Party of Bolivia]], which he characterized as "distrustful, disloyal and stupid".<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837605,00.html Bidding for Che]", ''Time Magazine'', 15 December 1967.</ref>
* He had expected to deal only with the Bolivian military, who were poorly trained and equipped, and was unaware that the United States government had sent a team of the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] commandos and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The [[Bolivian Army]] was also trained, advised, and supplied by [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]], including an elite battalion of U.S. [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] trained in [[jungle warfare]] that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the location of Guevara's guerrillas.<ref>[[#refUSArmy1967|US Army 1967]] and [[#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], pp. 82–102, ''inter alia''. "US military personnel in Bolivia never exceeded 53 advisers, including a sixteen-man Mobile Training Team from the [[8th Special Forces Group (United States)|8th Special Forces Group]] based at [[Fort Gulick]], [[Panama Canal Zone]]" ([[#refSelvage1985|Selvage 1985]]).</ref>
* He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. The two [[shortwave radio]] transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty; thus, the guerrillas were unable to communicate and be resupplied, leaving them isolated and stranded.

In addition, Guevara's known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local rebel leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<ref>[[#refGuevara1972|Guevara 1972]].</ref> This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.<ref>[[#refCastañeda1998|Castañeda 1998]], pp. 107–112; 131–132.</ref>

The end result was that Guevara was unable to attract inhabitants of the local area to join his militia during the eleven months he attempted recruitment. Many of the inhabitants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the guerrillas and their movements in the area. Near the end of the Bolivian venture, Guevara wrote in his diary that "the peasants do not give us any help, and they are turning into informers."<ref>[[#refWright2000|Wright 2000]], p. 86.</ref>

Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of [[La Higuera]] on the evening of 8 October. For the next half day, Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and only spoke quietly to Bolivian soldiers. One of those Bolivian soldiers, a helicopter pilot named Jaime Nino de Guzman, describes Che as looking "dreadful". According to Guzman, Guevara was shot through the right calf, his hair was matted with dirt, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths. Despite his haggard appearance, he recounts that "Che held his head high, looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke." De Guzman states that he "took pity" and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe, and that Guevara then smiled and thanked him.<ref name="The Man Who Buried Che">"[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/cheremains111897.html The Man Who Buried Che] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207082403/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/cheremains111897.html |date=2008-12-07 }}" by Juan O.

The following morning on 9 October, Guevara asked to see the school teacher of the village, a 22-year-old woman named Julia Cortez. She later stated that she found Guevara to be an "agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance" and that during their conversation she found herself "unable to look him in the eye" because his "gaze was unbearable, piercing, and so tranquil".<ref name="Michèle"/> During their short conversation, Guevara pointed out to Cortez the poor condition of the schoolhouse, stating that it was "anti-[[Pedagogy|pedagogical]]" to expect campesino students to be educated there, while "government officials drive [[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]] cars"; Guevara said "that's what we are fighting against."<ref name="Michèle"/>

[[File:Vallegrande location.png|thumb|Location of [[Vallegrande]] in Bolivia]]

Later that morning on 9 October, Bolivian President [[René Barrientos]] ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed to the unit holding Guevara by Félix Rodríguez reportedly despite the United States government's desire that Guevara be taken to Panama for further interrogation.<ref>[[#refGrant2007|Grant 2007]]</ref> The executioner who volunteered to kill Guevara was [[Mario Terán]], a 27-year-old sergeant in the Bolivian army who while [[Alcohol intoxication|half-drunk]] requested to shoot Guevara because three of his friends from B Company, all with the same first name of "Mario", had been killed in a firefight several days earlier with Guevara's band of guerrillas.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story that the Bolivian government planned to release to the public, Félix Rodríguez ordered Terán not to shoot Guevara in the head, but to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.<ref>[[#refGrant2007|Grant 2007]]. René Barrientos has never revealed his motives for ordering the summary execution of Guevara rather than putting him on trial or expelling him from the country or turning him over to the United States authorities.</ref> Gary Prado, the Bolivian captain in command of the army company that captured Guevara, said that the reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara were so there could be no possibility for Guevara to escape from prison, and also so there could be no drama of a public trial where adverse publicity might happen.<ref>Almudevar, Lola.

About 30 minutes before Guevara was killed, Félix Rodríguez attempted to question him about the whereabouts of other guerrilla fighters who were currently at large, but Guevara continued to remain silent. Rodríguez, assisted by a few Bolivian soldiers, helped Guevara to his feet and took him outside the hut to parade him before other Bolivian soldiers where he posed with Guevara for a [[photo opportunity]] where one soldier took a photograph of Rodríguez and other soldiers standing alongside Guevara. Afterwards, Rodríguez told Guevara that he was going to be executed. A little later, Guevara was asked by one of the Bolivian soldiers guarding him if he was thinking about his own immortality. "No," he replied, "I'm thinking about the immortality of the revolution."<ref>[[#refTime1970|''Time'' magazine 1970]].</ref> A few minutes later, Sergeant Terán entered the hut to shoot him, whereupon Guevara reportedly stood up and spoke to Terán what were his last words: "I know you've come to kill me. Shoot, coward! You are only going to kill a man!" Terán hesitated, then pointed his self-loading [[M1 carbine|M2 carbine]]<ref>{{cite web

Months earlier, during his last public declaration to the [[Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America|Tricontinental Conference]],<ref name="MessTricont1967"/> Guevara had written his own [[epitaph]], stating: "Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/19/che-guevara-obituary-guardian-archive Obituary: Che Guevara, Marxist Architect of Revolution] by Richard Bourne, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 October 1967</ref>

==Post-execution and memorial==
[[File:FreddyAlbertoChe.jpg|thumb|left|The day after his execution on 10 October 1967, Guevara's corpse was displayed to the news media in the laundry house of the Vallegrande hospital.

After his execution, Guevara's body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby [[Vallegrande]], where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Señora de Malta.<ref>[[#refAlmudevar2007|Almudevar 2007]] and [[#refGott2005|Gott 2005]].</ref> Several witnesses were called to confirm his identity, key amongst them the British journalist [[Richard Gott]], the only witness to have met Guevara when he was alive. Put on display, as hundreds of local residents filed past the body, Guevara's corpse was considered by many to represent a "Christ-like" visage, with some even surreptitiously clipping locks of his hair as divine relics.<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 179.</ref> Such comparisons were further extended when English art critic [[John Berger]], two weeks later upon seeing the post-mortem photographs, observed that they resembled two famous paintings: [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' and [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]''.<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], p. 183.</ref> There were also four correspondents present when Guevara's body arrived in Vallegrande, including [[Björn Kumm]] of the Swedish ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', who described the scene in a 11 November 1967, exclusive for ''[[The New Republic]]''.<ref>[http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/the-death-che-guevara The Death of Che Guevara] by [[Bjorn Kumm]], ''[[The New Republic]]'', Originally published on 11 November 1967.</ref>

A declassified memorandum dated 11 October 1967 to [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] from his [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Walt Whitman Rostow]], called the decision to kill Guevara "stupid" but "understandable from a Bolivian standpoint".<ref>[[#refLacey2007a|Lacey 2007a]].</ref> After the execution, Rodríguez took several of Guevara's personal items, including a watch which he continued to wear many years later, often showing them to reporters during the ensuing years.<ref>After the Cuban revolution, seeing that Guevara had no watch, his friend Oscarito Fernández Mell gave him his own gold watch. Sometime later, Che handed him a piece of paper; a receipt from the National Bank declaring that Mell had "donated" his gold wristband to Cuba's gold reserve. Guevara was still wearing his watch, but it now had a leather wristband ([[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 503).</ref> Today, some of these belongings, including his flashlight, are on display at the CIA.<ref>[[#refKornbluh1997|Kornbluh 1997]].</ref> After a military doctor [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara's body to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated.

On 15 October in Havana, [[Fidel Castro]] publicly acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout Cuba.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 740.</ref> On 18 October, Castro addressed a crowd of one million mourners in Havana's [[Plaza de la Revolución]] and spoke about Guevara's character as a revolutionary.<ref>[[#refAnderson1997|Anderson 1997]], p. 741.</ref> Fidel Castro closed his impassioned eulogy thus:

Also removed when Guevara was captured were his 30,000-word, hand-written diary, a collection of his personal poetry, and a short story he had authored about a young Communist guerrilla who learns to overcome his fears.<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837605,00.html Bidding for Che]", ''Time'' Magazine, 15 December 1967.</ref> His diary documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia,<ref>[[#refGuevara1967|Guevara 1967]].</ref> with the first entry on 7 November 1966, shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last dated 7 October 1967, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely because of discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Communist Party of Bolivia that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected, and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, partly because the guerrilla group had learned [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], unaware that the local language was actually a [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language.<ref>[[#refRyan1998|Ryan 1998]], p. 45.</ref> As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill.

French [[intellectual]] [[Régis Debray]], who was captured in April 1967 while with Guevara in Bolivia, gave an interview from prison in August 1968, in which he enlarged on the circumstances of Guevara's capture. Debray, who had lived with Guevara's band of guerrillas for a short time, said that in his view they were "victims of the forest" and thus "eaten by the jungle".<ref name="Nadle">{{cite journal|title=Régis Debray Speaks from Prison|first=Marlene|last=Nadle|journal=Ramparts Magazine|date=24 August 1968|page=42}}</ref> Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara's men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men. Debray recounts that Guevara and the others had been suffering an "illness" which caused their hands and feet to swell into "mounds of flesh" to the point where you could not discern the fingers on their hands. Debray described Guevara as "optimistic about the future of Latin America" despite the futile situation, and remarked that Guevara was "resigned to die in the knowledge that his death would be a sort of renaissance", noting that Guevara perceived death "as a promise of rebirth" and "ritual of renewal".<ref name="Nadle"/>

To a certain extent, this belief by Guevara of a metaphorical resurrection came true. While pictures of the dead Guevara were being circulated and the circumstances of his death were being debated, Che's legend began to spread. Demonstrations in protest against his "assassination" occurred throughout the world, and articles, tributes, and poems were written about his life and death.<ref>[[#refDurschmied2002|Durschmied 2002]], pp. 307–09.</ref> Rallies in support of Guevara were held from "Mexico to [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Algiers, Algeria|Algiers]] to Angola, and [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]] to [[Calcutta, India|Calcutta]]".<ref>[[#refDurschmied2002|Durschmied 2002]], p. 305.</ref> The population of [[Budapest, Hungary|Budapest]] and [[Prague, Czech Republic|Prague]] lit candles to honor Guevara's passing; and the picture of a smiling Che appeared in London and Paris.<ref>[[#refDurschmied2002|Durschmied 2002]], pp. 305–06.</ref> When a few months later riots broke out in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]], [[May 1968 protests in France|France]], and [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|Chicago]], and the unrest spread to the American college campuses, young men and women wore Che Guevara T-shirts and carried his pictures during their protest marches. In the view of military historian [[Erik Durschmied]]: "In those [[Protests of 1968|heady months of 1968]], Che Guevara was not dead. He was very much alive."<ref>[[#refDurschmied2002|Durschmied 2002]], p. 306.</ref>

===Retrieval of remains===
{{Main|Che Guevara Mausoleum}}
[[File:Che Guevara - Grab in Santa Clara, Kuba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Che Guevara Mausoleum|Che Guevara's Monument and Mausoleum]] in [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], Cuba]]

In late 1995, the retired [[Bolivia]]n General Mario Vargas revealed to [[Jon Lee Anderson]], author of ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', that Guevara's corpse lay near a [[Vallegrande]] airstrip. The result was a multi-national search for the remains, which lasted more than a year. In July 1997 a team of Cuban geologists and Argentine [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] discovered the remnants of seven bodies in two mass graves, including one man without hands (as Guevara would have been). Bolivian government officials with the Ministry of Interior later identified the body as Guevara when the excavated teeth "perfectly matched" a plaster mold of Che's teeth made in Cuba prior to his Congolese expedition. The "clincher" then arrived when Argentine forensic anthropologist Alejandro Inchaurregui inspected the inside hidden pocket of a blue jacket dug up next to the handless cadaver and found a small bag of pipe tobacco. Nino de Guzman, the Bolivian helicopter pilot who had given Che a small bag of tobacco, later remarked that he "had serious doubts" at first and "thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che"; but "after hearing about the tobacco pouch, I have no doubts."<ref name="The Man Who Buried Che"/> On 17 October 1997, Guevara's remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built [[Mausoleo Che Guevara|mausoleum]] in the Cuban city of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], where he had commanded over the [[Battle of Santa Clara|decisive military victory]] of the [[Cuban Revolution]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/17/cuba.che/ Cuba salutes 'Che' Guevara: Revolutionary Icon Finally Laid to Rest], CNN, 17 October 1997</ref>

In July 2008, the Bolivian government of [[Evo Morales]] unveiled Guevara's formerly-sealed diaries composed in two frayed notebooks, along with a logbook and several black-and-white photographs. At this event Bolivia's vice-minister of culture, Pablo Groux, expressed that there were plans to publish photographs of every handwritten page later in the year.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN0743477420080707?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0 Bolivia unveils original Che Guevara diary] by Eduardo Garcia, Reuters, 7 July 2008.</ref> Meanwhile, in August 2009 anthropologists working for Bolivia's Justice Ministry discovered and unearthed the bodies of five of Guevara's fellow guerrillas near the Bolivian town of [[Teoponte]].<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090821-che-guevara-find-video-ap.html Slain Che Guevara Soldiers Found?] video report by ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', 21 August 2009.</ref>

Guevara's life and legacy remain contentious.

Che's history continues to be rewritten and re-imagined.<ref>[[#refLowy1973|Löwy 1973]], pp. 7, 9, 15, 25, 75, 106.</ref><ref name="Löwy">[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1144 The Spark That Does Not Die] by [[Michael Löwy]], ''International Viewpoint'', July 1997</ref> Moreover, [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Michael Löwy]] contends that the many facets of Guevara's life (i.e. doctor and economist, revolutionary and banker, military theoretician and ambassador, deep thinker and political agitator) illuminated the rise of the "Che myth", allowing him to be invariably crystallized in his many [[metanarrative]] roles as a "Red [[Robin Hood]], [[Don Quixote]] of communism, new [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]], Marxist [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint Just]], [[El Cid|Cid Campeador]] of [[the Wretched of the Earth]], [[Galahad|Sir Galahad]] of the beggars&nbsp;... and [[Bolshevik]] devil who haunts the dreams of the rich, kindling braziers of subversion all over the world".<ref name="lowy" />[[File:Chile quema libros 1973.JPG|thumb|upright|The burning of a painting containing Che's face, following the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 coup]] that installed the [[Military government of Chile (1973–1990)|Pinochet regime]] in Chile]]

As such, various notable individuals have lauded Guevara; for example, [[Nelson Mandela]] referred to him as "an inspiration for every human being who loves freedom",<ref name="Guevara2009pgII"/> while [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described him as "not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age".<ref>[[#refMoynihan2006|Moynihan 2006]].</ref> Others who have expressed their admiration include authors [[Graham Greene]], who remarked that Guevara "represented the idea of gallantry, chivalry, and adventure",<ref>[[#refSinclair1968/06|Sinclair 1968/2006]], p. 80.</ref> and [[Susan Sontag]], who supposed that "[Che's] goal was nothing less than the cause of humanity itself."<ref>[[#refSinclair1968/06|Sinclair 1968/2006]], p. 127.</ref> In the [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] community philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] professed Guevara to be "the world symbol of the possibilities of one man",<ref>[[#refMcLaren2000|McLaren 2000]], p. 3.</ref> while [[Black Power]] leader [[Stokely Carmichael]] eulogized that "Che Guevara is not dead, his ideas are with us."<ref>[[#refSinclair1968/06|Sinclair 1968/2006]], p. 67.</ref> Praise has been reflected throughout the political spectrum, with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] theorist [[Murray Rothbard]] extolling Guevara as a "heroic figure" who "more than any man of our epoch or even of our century, was the living embodiment of the principle of revolution",<ref>"[https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_3/3_3_1.pdf Ernesto Che Guevara R.I.P.]" by [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]], ''Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought'', Volume 3, Number 3 (Spring-Autumn 1967).</ref> while journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] reminisced that "[Che's] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time, he was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us [[bourgeois]] [[Romanticism|romantics]] insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs."<ref name="myth"/>

Conversely, Jacobo Machover, an exiled opposition author, dismisses all praise of Guevara and portrays him as a callous executioner.<ref name="Machover">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2461399.ece Behind Che Guevara's mask, the cold executioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121181216/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2461399.ece |date=21 November 2008 }} ''Times Online'', 16 September 2007.</ref> Exiled former Cuban prisoners have expressed similar opinions, among them [[Armando Valladares]], who declared Guevara "a man full of hatred" who executed dozens without trial,<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/27/del-toro-walks-away-from-questions-on-che/print/ "'Che' Spurs Debate, Del Toro Walkout"], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', 27 January 2009.</ref> and [[Carlos Alberto Montaner]], who asserted that Guevara possessed "a [[Maximilien de Robespierre|Robespierre]] mentality", wherein cruelty against the revolution's enemies was a virtue.<ref>[http://www.freedomcollection.org/interviews/carlos_alberto_montaner/?vidid=343 Short interview on Che Guevara] with [[Carlos Alberto Montaner]] for the ''[[Freedom Collection]]''</ref> [[Álvaro Vargas Llosa]] of [[The Independent Institute]] has hypothesized that Guevara's contemporary followers "delude themselves by clinging to a myth", describing Guevara as a "Marxist [[Puritan]]" who employed his rigid power to suppress dissent, while also operating as a "cold-blooded killing machine".<ref name="ReferenceB" /> Llosa also accuses Guevara's "fanatical disposition" as being the linchpin of the "Sovietization" of the Cuban revolution, speculating that he possessed a "total subordination of reality to blind ideological orthodoxy".<ref name="ReferenceB" /> On a macro-level, [[Hoover Institution]] research fellow [[William Ratliff]] regards Guevara more as a creation of his historical environment, referring to him as a "fearless" and "head-strong Messiah-like figure", who was the product of a [[martyr]]-enamored [[Latin American culture]] which "inclined people to seek out and follow [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] miracle workers".<ref name="Ratliff07">[http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=2040 Che is the "Patron Saint" of Warfare] by [[William Ratliff]], ''[[The Independent Institute]]'', 9 October 2007.</ref> Ratliff further speculates that the economic conditions in the region suited Guevara's commitment to "bring justice to the downtrodden by crushing centuries-old tyrannies"; describing Latin America as being plagued by what [[Moisés Naím]] referred to as the "legendary malignancies" of inequality, poverty, dysfunctional politics and malfunctioning institutions.<ref name="Ratliff07" />

In a mixed assessment, British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] opined that Guevara was a "brave, sincere and determined man who was also obstinate, narrow, and dogmatic".<ref name="Kellner106">[[#refKellner1989|Kellner 1989]], p. 106.</ref> At the end of his life, according to Thomas, "he seems to have become convinced of the virtues of violence for its own sake", while "his influence over [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] for good or evil" grew after his death, as Fidel took up many of his views.<ref name="Kellner106" /> Similarly, the Cuban-American sociologist [[Samuel Farber]] lauds Che Guevara as "an honest and committed revolutionary", but also criticizes the fact that "he never embraced socialism in its most democratic essence".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Farber|first=Samuel|author-link=Samuel Farber|title=Assessing Che|journal=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=23 May 2016|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/cuba-che-guevara-fidel-raul-castro-communism/}}</ref> Nevertheless, Guevara remains a national hero in Cuba, where his image adorns the 3 [[Cuban peso|peso]] banknote and school children begin each morning by pledging "We will be like Che."<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-guevara-cuba-idUSN0432868420071004 Che Guevara's Ideals Lose Ground in Cuba] by Anthony Boadle, ''[[Reuters]]'', 4 October 2007: "he is the poster boy of communist Cuba, held up as a selfless leader who set an example of voluntary work with his own sweat, pushing a wheelbarrow at a building site or cutting sugar cane in the fields with a machete."</ref><ref>[[#refPeoplesWeekly2004|People's Weekly 2004]].</ref> In his homeland of Argentina, where high schools bear his name,<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN1446436420080614?sp=true Argentina pays belated homage to "Che" Guevara] by Helen Popper, Reuters, 14 June 2008</ref> numerous Che museums dot the country and in 2008 a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} bronze statue of him was unveiled in the city of his birth, Rosario.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7455196.stm Statue for Che's '80th birthday'] by Daniel Schweimler, BBC News, 15 June 2008.</ref> Guevara has been [[Sanctification|sanctified]] by some Bolivian campesinos<ref name="Tobar2004">[https://www.boston.com/travel/articles/2004/10/17/on_a_tourist_trail_in_bolivias_hills_ches_fame_lives_on/ On a tourist trail in Bolivia's hills, Che's fame lives on] By Hector Tobar, ''Los Angeles Times'', 17 October 2004.</ref> as "[[Che Guevara in popular culture#In religion|Saint Ernesto]]", who pray to him for assistance.<ref>[[#refSchipani2007|Schipani 2007]].</ref> In contrast, Guevara remains a hated figure amongst many in the [[Cuban exile]] and [[Cuban-American]] community of the United States, who view him as "the butcher of [[La Cabaña]]".<ref>[[#refCasey2009|Casey 2009]], pp. 235, 325.</ref> Despite this polarized status, a high-contrast [[monochrome]] graphic of [[Guerrillero Heroico|Che's face]], created in 1968 by Irish artist [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick]], became a universally [[Merchandising|merchandized]] and objectified image,<ref>[[#CITEREFBBCNews2001b|BBC News 26 May 2001]].</ref><ref>see also [[Che Guevara (photo)]].</ref> found on an endless array of items, including T-shirts, hats, posters, tattoos, and bikinis,<ref>[[#refLacey2007b|Lacey 2007b]].</ref> contributing to the [[Consumer capitalism|consumer culture]] Guevara despised.
