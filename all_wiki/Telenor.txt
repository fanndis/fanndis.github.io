===Telegraph===
Telenor started off in 1855 as a state-operated [[monopoly]] provider of [[telegraph]] services named '''Telegrafverket'''. The first Norwegian planning  for a telegraph were launched within the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] in 1848,  but by 1852, the plans were public and the [[Storting|Parliament of Norway]] decided on a plan for constructing a telegraph system throughout the country. Televerket began by connecting [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo) to [[Sweden]] (Norway was at that time in a [[Sweden-Norway|union with Sweden]]) as well as Christiania and [[Drammen]]. By 1857 the telegraph had reached [[Bergen]] on the west coast via [[Sørlandet]] on the south coast, and by 1871 it had reached [[Kirkenes]] on the far north coast. Cable connections were opened to [[Denmark]] in 1867 and to [[Great Britain]] in 1869. The telegraph was most important for the merchant marine who now could use the electric telegraph to instantly communicate between different locations, and get a whole new advantage from better [[logistics]].<ref>[[Tore Pryser|Pryser, Tore]] (1999) ''Norsk Historie 1814-1860'', volume four of ''[[Norsk historie (Samlaget)|Norsk historie]]''.

===Telephone===
The first telephone service in Norway was offered in 1878 between [[Arendal]] and [[Tvedestrand]], while the first international telephone service between Christiania and [[Stockholm]] was offered in 1893. Automation of the telephone system was started in 1920 and completed in 1985. In 1946 the first [[Telex|Telex service]] was offered, and in 1976 [[satellite]] telephone connections to the Norwegian merchant navy, at the time the largest in the world and to [[oil platform]]s in the [[North Sea]] were made operational. This is the start of [[Inmarsat]] Satellite Communication, and formed the first steps to [[Digital data|digital]]ise the telephone network in 1980-1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telenor.no/om/virksomhet/historie/kronologi/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823193738/http://www.telenor.no/om/virksomhet/historie/kronologi/ |archive-date=2006-08-23 }}</ref>

Televerket opened its first [[Mobile radio telephone|manual mobile telephone system]] in 1966, being replaced with the automatic [[Nordic Mobile Telephone|NMT system]] in 1981 and the enhanced NMT-900 in 1986. Norway was the first country in to get an automatic mobile telephone system. The [[Digital data|digital]] [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM system]] came into use in 1993. The [[3G|third generation of mobile technology]] with [[Global System for Mobile Communications|UMTS system]] began full operation 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telenor.no/om/virksomhet/historie/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819042941/http://www.telenor.no/om/virksomhet/historie/ |archive-date=2006-08-19 }}</ref> The [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] [[web browser]] was created in 1994 by [[Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner]] and [[Geir Ivarsøy]] during their tenure at Telenor, and  [[Opera Software]] was established in 1995 when they  went on to continue development of their browser.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}.Telenor and Huawei conducted a  successful test of 5G with 70 Gbit/s Speeds in Lab environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paktechinfo.com/telenor-and-huawei-conduct-successful-test-of-5g-demo-in-norway/|title=Telenor and Huawei Conduct Successful Test of 5G with 70 Gbps Speeds|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403194936/https://www.paktechinfo.com/telenor-and-huawei-conduct-successful-test-of-5g-demo-in-norway/|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Deregulation and internationalisation===
The corporation changed its name to '''Televerket''' in 1969. In 1994, then the Norwegian Telecom was established as a [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]].  The telecom sector in Norway,  was deregulated in stages between 1994 and 1998. An attempt to merge Telenor with its counterpart in [[Sweden]], [[TeliaSonera|Telia]], failed in 1999, while both still were owned by their respective governments. On December 4, 2000 the company was partially [[privatised]] and listed on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]]. The privatisation gave the company [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 15,6 billion in new [[Capital (economics)|capital]], with the [[Government of Norway]] owning 77.7% of the company. As of 2014, the Norwegian government holds 53.97% of the Telenor shares directly and another 4.66% through the [[Government Pension Fund of Norway|Pension Fund]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.telenor.com/investors/major-shareholdings/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912190233/http://www.telenor.com/investors/major-shareholdings/ |archive-date=2015-09-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the second half of the 1990s, Telenor began  mobile operations in other countries: [[Russia]] (1994), [[Bangladesh]], [[Greece]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] (1997), [[Ukraine]] (1998), [[Malaysia]] (1999), [[Denmark]] and [[Thailand]] (2000), [[Hungary]] (2002), [[Montenegro]] (2004), [[Pakistan]] (2004), [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Serbia]] (2006), [[Myanmar]] (2014). Operations in Greece, Ireland and Germany were sold in 1999/2000 and profits were re-invested in  emerging markets. In October 2005 Telenor acquired [[Vodafone]] Sweden, changing the name to Telenor in April 2006.

[[Grameenphone]] was the first Telenor venture in the Asian telecom market  and is now the largest mobile operator in [[Bangladesh]] Telenor holds 55.8 per cent of Grameenphone. Grameenphone started trading its shares on the stock exchanges in [[Dhaka Stock Exchange|Dhaka]] and Chittagong on November 16, 2009. The success of Grammeenphone lead to an increased focus on Asia, with successful entries into [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] [[Pakistan]], and [[Myanmar]]. Telenor also entered [[India]], but had to withdraw from that market in 2017 with substantial losses.

In March 2018, Telenor sold its business in Southeast Europe ([[Telenor (Bulgaria)|Bulgaria]], [[Telenor Hungary|Hungary]], [[Telenor Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Telenor Serbia|Serbia]]) to the [[PPF (company)|PPF Group]], for a sum of 2.8 billion euros in order to focus more on Asia and the Nordic market.<ref name="TelenorSale">{{cite news|last1=Dagenborg|first1=Joachim|last2=Knudsen|first2=Camilla|title=Norway's Telenor exits central Europe with $3.4 billion asset sale to Czech investor PPF|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telenor-m-a/norways-telenor-exits-central-europe-with-3-4-billion-asset-sale-to-czech-investor-ppf-idUSKBN1GX0NQ|access-date=21 March 2018|work=reuters.com|date=21 March 2018}}</ref> 
 
In 2019 Telenor bought [[DNA Oyj|DNA]], the third largest mobile operator in [[Finland]].<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telenor-m-a-dna/telenor-buys-majority-stake-in-finlands-dna-for-17-billion-idUSKCN1RL0IV</ref>

===Research===
Telenor Research is Telenor's corporate unit for research. The unit conducts research and delivers research based advice on topics such as market, technology, data analytics, innovation and organization. Telenor Research provides research based analysis and strategic recommendations to the Telenor Group, as well as to the individual Business Units across Telenor markets. Telenor Research's mission is to create business value for Telenor through applied research.

===Machine-to-machine===
Telenor started exploring the [[Machine-to-Machine|M2M]] potentials in 2000, when Telenor R&D established a project both aimed at technology, services and business models. This was further spurred when Telenor acquired the Swedish mobile company Europolitan, which contained parts of [[Vodafone]]'s research capabilities in the area. As a result, two separate companies have been established: Telenor Connexion in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] (aiming higher up in the M2M value chain), and [[Telenor Objects]] (aiming further down in the value chain). The initiative has resulted in a substantial market share of Europe's fast-growing M2M market and is being used by [[Nissan]] in [[Europe]] to connect its customers [[Electric Cars]].<ref>https://www.engadget.com/2010/12/20/european-nissan-leaf-gets-always-on-connection-lets-you-turn-up/</ref>

==Former Operations==
Telenor has sold a number of divisions after its privatisation, including Bravida,<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/14/bravida-idUSWEA156020120514 Triton says sells Sweden's Bravida to Bain Capital] [[Reuters]], 12 May 2012.
