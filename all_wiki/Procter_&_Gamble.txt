'''The Procter & Gamble Company''' ('''P&G''') is an American multinational [[Fast moving consumer goods|consumer goods]] [[corporation]] headquartered in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], founded in 1837 by [[William Procter (industrialist)|William Procter]] and [[James Gamble (industrialist)|James Gamble]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of innovation |url=http://us.pg.com/who_we_are/heritage/history_of_innovation |website=Procter & Gamble |access-date=February 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215142259/http://us.pg.com/who_we_are/heritage/history_of_innovation |archive-date=February 15, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It specializes in a wide range of personal health/consumer health, and [[personal care]] and hygiene products; these products are organized into several segments including  Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine, & Family Care.

In 2014, P&G recorded $83.1&nbsp;billion in sales.

[[David S. Taylor]] is the current chairman and CEO of P&G.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Candlemaker William Procter, born in [[England]], and soapmaker James Gamble, born in [[Ireland]], both emigrated from the [[United Kingdom]]. They settled in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] initially and met when they married sisters Olivia and Elizabeth Norris.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dyer |first1=Davis |first2=Frederick |last2=Dalzell |first3=Rowena |last3=Olegario |title=Rising Tide: Lessons from 165 Years of Brand Building at Procter & Gamble |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |year=2004 |isbn=1-59139-147-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/risingtide00davi }}</ref> Alexander Norris, their father-in-law, persuaded them to become business partners, and in 1837 Procter & Gamble was created.

In 1858–1859, sales reached $1&nbsp;million. By that point, about 80 employees worked for Procter & Gamble. During the [[American Civil War]], the company won contracts to supply the [[Union Army]] with soap and candles. In addition to the increased profits experienced during the war, the military contracts introduced soldiers from all over the country to Procter & Gamble's products.

In the 1880s, Procter & Gamble began to market a new product, an inexpensive soap that floated in water.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/protor-gamble-makes-everything-2011-2|title=How Procter & Gamble Became The Maker Of EVERYTHING You Buy For Your House|last=Horowitz|first=Alana|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010185635/https://www.businessinsider.com/protor-gamble-makes-everything-2011-2|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The company called the soap [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory]].<ref name=":0" /> William Arnett Procter, William Procter's grandson, began a [[profit-sharing]] program for the company's [[workforce]] in 1887. By giving the workers a stake in the company, he correctly assumed that they would be less likely to go on strike.

The company began to build factories in other locations in the United States because the demand for products had outgrown the capacity of the Cincinnati facilities. The company's leaders began to diversify its products, as well, and in 1911, began producing [[Crisco]], a [[shortening]] made of [[vegetable oils]] rather than [[animal fat]]s.<ref name=":0" /> As radio became more popular in the 1920s and 1930s, the company sponsored a number of radio programs.

=== International expansion ===
The company moved into other countries, both in terms of manufacturing and product sales, becoming an international corporation with its 1930 acquisition of the [[Thomas Hedley Co.]],<ref name=":0" /> based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England. After this acquisition, Procter & Gamble had their UK Headquarters at 'Hedley House' in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], until quite recently, when they moved to The Heights, [[Brooklands]]. Numerous new products and brand names were introduced over time, and Procter & Gamble began branching out into new areas. The company introduced [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] laundry [[detergent]] in 1946<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124946926161107433|title=Tide Turns 'Basic' for P&G in Slump|last=Byron|first=Ellen|date=2009-08-07|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-10-10|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010185636/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124946926161107433|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Prell]] shampoo in 1947.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/06/business/company-news-procter-gamble-considers-selling-its-prell-brand.html|title=Company News; Procter & Gamble Considers Selling Its Prell Brand|last=Reuters|date=1999-05-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010185638/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/06/business/company-news-procter-gamble-considers-selling-its-prell-brand.html|archive-date=October 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1955, Procter & Gamble began selling the first toothpaste to contain [[fluoride]], known as [[Crest (toothpaste)|Crest]].<ref name=":0" /> Branching out once again in 1957, the company purchased [[Charmin]] [[paper mill]]s and began manufacturing [[toilet paper]] and other [[tissue paper]] products. Once again focusing on laundry, Procter & Gamble began making [[Downy]] [[fabric softener]] in 1960 and Bounce fabric softener sheets in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pg.com/productsafety/ingredients/household_care/laundary_fabric_care/Bounce/Bounce_Dryer_Sheets_-_All_Varieties.pdf |title=Bounce Dryer Sheets |website=Procter & Gamble |accessdate=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204044432/http://www.pg.com/productsafety/ingredients/household_care/laundary_fabric_care/Bounce/Bounce_Dryer_Sheets_-_All_Varieties.pdf |archive-date=December 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> From 1957 to 1968, Procter & Gamble owned [[Clorox]], the leading American manufacturer of liquid bleach; however, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] challenged the acquisition, and the U.S. Supreme Court decided against P&G in April 1967.<ref>''FTC v. Procter & Gamble Co.,'' {{ussc|386|568}}.</ref>

One of the most revolutionary products to come out on the market was the company's disposable [[Pampers]] diaper, first test-marketed in 1961, the same year Procter & Gamble came out with [[Head & Shoulders]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/risingtide00davi |url-access=registration |quote=william a procter president. | title=Rising Tide: Lessons from 165 Years of Brand Building at Procter and Gamble |publisher=Harvard Business Press |date=May 1, 2004 | accessdate=March 4, 2016 |last=Dyer|first=Davis |page=[https://archive.org/details/risingtide00davi/page/423 423] |display-authors=etal| isbn=9781591391470 }}</ref> Prior to this point, [[disposable diapers]] were not popular, although [[Johnson & Johnson]] had developed a product called Chux. Babies always wore cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring [[landfill]]ing. Amid the recent concerns parents have voiced on the ingredients in diapers, Pampers launched Pampers Pure collection in 2018, which is a "natural" diaper alternative.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222006020/en/Goodbye-Compromise-Pampers-Pure-Protection-Works|title=Say Goodbye to Compromise, Say Hello to Pampers Pure Protection That Works|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001182406/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222006020/en/Goodbye-Compromise-Pampers-Pure-Protection-Works|archive-date=October 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Further developments ===
Procter & Gamble acquired a number of other companies that diversified its product line and significantly increased profits. These acquisitions included [[Folgers Coffee]], Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals (the makers of [[Pepto-Bismol]]), Richardson-Vicks, Noxell ([[Noxzema]]), Shulton's [[Old Spice]], [[Max Factor]], the [[Iams]] Company, and [[Pantene]], among others. In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from levered positions in [[interest rate derivative]]s, and subsequently sued [[Bankers Trust]] for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P&G again made headlines when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved a new product developed by the company, [[Olestra]]. Also known by its brand name 'Olean', Olestra is a lower-calorie substitute for fat in cooking [[potato chip]]s and other snacks.

In January 2005, P&G announced the acquisition of [[Gillette]], forming the largest consumer goods company and placing [[Unilever]] into second place.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/01/28/news/fortune500/pg_gillette/ |title=P&G to buy Gillette in $57B stock deal |date=January 28, 2005 |first=Chris |last=Isidore |website=CNN Money |accessdate=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015155936/http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/28/news/fortune500/pg_gillette/ |archive-date=October 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> This added brands such as Gillette razors, [[Duracell]], [[Braun (company)|Braun]], and [[Oral-B]] to their stable. The acquisition was approved by the [[European Union]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]], with conditions to a spinoff of certain overlapping brands. P&G agreed to sell its SpinBrush battery-operated [[electric toothbrush]] business to [[Church & Dwight]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Dennis K.|last2=Ellison|first2=Sarah|title=P&G Plans to Sell SpinBrush Unit To Advance Merger|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112666741099640161|accessdate=March 4, 2016|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 14, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307051448/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112666741099640161|archive-date=March 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and Gillette's [[Rembrandt toothpaste]] line to [[Johnson & Johnson]].<ref>{{cite news|title=P&G sells Rembrandt to Johnson & Johnson|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2005/10/24/daily6.html|accessdate=March 4, 2016|newspaper=Cincinnati Business Journals|date=October 24, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043622/http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2005/10/24/daily6.html|archive-date=November 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[deodorant]] brands [[Right Guard]], Soft and Dri, and Dry Idea were sold to [[Dial Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Dial Agrees to Buy P&G Deodorant Brands |date=February 21, 2006 |first=Constance |last=Wherrity |website=Pierce Mattie Public Relations New York blog |url=http://www.piercemattie.com/blogs/2006/02/dial_agrees_to_buy_pg_deodoran.html |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501084954/http://www.piercemattie.com/blogs/2006/02/dial_agrees_to_buy_pg_deodoran.html |archive-date=May 1, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2001, [[Liquid Paper]] and Gillette's stationery division, [[Paper Mate]], were sold to [[Newell Rubbermaid]]. The companies officially merged on October 1, 2005. In 2008, P&G branched into the record business with its sponsorship of Tag Records, as an endorsement for [[TAG Body Spray]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/07/10/brand-advisory.aspx |title=P&G Must Proceed With Caution |website=Marketing Doctor Blog |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410104012/http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/07/10/brand-advisory.aspx |archive-date=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

P&G's dominance in many categories of consumer products makes its [[brand management]] decisions worthy of study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/06/06/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx |title=How To Learn From GE and P&G When The World Is About To Change |website=Marketing Doctor Blog |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622005938/http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/06/06/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx |archive-date=June 22, 2012}}</ref> For example, P&G's corporate strategists must account for the likelihood of one of their products [[cannibalization (marketing)|cannibalizing the sales of another]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Horstman |first=Barry M |title=John G.

On August 25, 2009, the Ireland-based pharmaceutical company [[Warner Chilcott]] announced they had bought P&G's prescription-drug business for $3.1&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125111032092353427 |title=Warner Chilcott to pay $3.1 for P&G's drug business |first1=Anjali |last1=Cordieiro |first2=Peter |last2=Loftus |date=August 25, 2009 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125134712/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125111032092353427 |archive-date=January 25, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

P&G exited the food business in 2012 when it sold its [[Pringles]] snack food business to [[Kellogg's]] for $2.75&nbsp;billion after the $2.35&nbsp;billion deal with former suitor [[Diamond Foods]] fell short.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Suppliers2/P-G-sells-Pringles-to-Kellogg-after-Diamond-deal-loses-its-luster |title=P&G sells Pringles to Kellog after Diamond deal loses its luster |first=Elaine |last=Watson |date=February 15, 2012 |website=The Food Navigator |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722092308/http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Suppliers2/P-G-sells-Pringles-to-Kellogg-after-Diamond-deal-loses-its-luster |archive-date=July 22, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The company had previously sold [[Jif (peanut butter)|Jif peanut butter]], Crisco shortening and oils, and [[Folgers]] coffee in separate transactions to [[The J.M.

=== Restructuring ===
In August 2014, P&G announced it was streamlining the company, dropping around 100 brands and concentrating on the remaining 65, which were producing 95% of the company's profits.<ref name=Coolidge />

In March 2015, the company divested its [[Vicks]] VapoSteam U.S. liquid inhalant business to [[Helen of Troy Limited|Helen of Troy]], part of a brand-restructuring operation. This deal was the first health-related divestiture under the brand-restructuring operation. The deal included a fully paid-up license to the Vicks VapoSteam trademarks and the U.S. license of P&G's Vicks VapoPad trademarks for scent pads. Most Vicks VapoSteam and VapoPads are used in Vicks humidifiers, vaporizers and other health care devices already marketed by Helen of Troy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coolidge|first1=Alexander|title=P&G sells health brand|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2015/03/31/pg-sells-health-brand/70751156/|website=Cincinnati.com|accessdate=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125134712/http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2015/03/31/pg-sells-health-brand/70751156/|archive-date=January 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

With the rise of television in the 1950s and 1960s, most of the new serials were sponsored,  produced and owned (20 series) by the company (including ''[[The Guiding Light]]'', which had begun as a radio serial, and made the transition to television lasting 72 years).<ref name=nyt-so>{{cite news|title=CBS Cancels ''As the World Turns'', Procter & Gamble's Last Soap Opera|first1=Bill|last1=Carter|first2=Brian|last2=Stelter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/arts/television/09soap.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619170342/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/arts/television/09soap.html|archive-date=June 19, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Though the last P&G-produced show, ''[[As the World Turns]],'' left the air in 2010,<ref name=nyt-so/> ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and broadcast on CBS, is still partially sponsored by Procter & Gamble; as of 2017, it is the only remaining daytime drama that is partially sponsored by Procter & Gamble.

Procter & Gamble also was the first company to produce and sponsor a prime-time serial, a 1965 spin-off of ''As the World Turns'' called ''Our Private World''. In 1979, PGP produced ''Shirley'', a prime-time [[NBC]] series starring [[Shirley Jones]], which lasted 13 episodes. They also produced [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]' first original comedy series, ''[[Down to Earth (US TV series)|Down to Earth]]'', which ran from 1984 to 1987 (110 episodes were produced). They also distributed the syndicated comedy series ''[[Throb]]''. In 1985, they produced a game-show pilot called ''The Buck Stops Here'' with [[Taft Broadcasting|Taft Entertainment Television]] in 1985, hosted by [[Jim Peck]]; it was not picked up. Procter & Gamble Productions originally co-produced ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' with [[Sony Pictures Television]] but withdrew before the series premiere due to early press reviews. They also produced the 1991 TV movie ''A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story'', which was co-produced by [[Alan Landsburg Productions|The Landsburg Company]],{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} and continue to produce the [[People's Choice Awards]]<ref name=nyt-so/> until the show was sold to E! channel in April 2017.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Horgan |first1=Richard |title=Procter & Gamble Says Goodbye to the People's Choice Awards |url=https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/procter-gamble-peoples-choice-awards/ |accessdate=July 15, 2020 |work=www.adweek.com |date=April 8, 2017}}</ref> In 2007, PGP teamed up with the now-defunct [[Cookie Jar Group]] to produce the Flash-animated children's series ''[[Will and Dewitt]]'', which features the character Dewitt, the mascot for the Pampers baby product line's former sub-brand, Kandoo.

In 2013, PGP rebranded itself as Procter & Gamble Entertainment (PGE) with a new logo and an emphasis on multiple-platform entertainment production.

P&G funded a six-episode series, ''Activate'', on National Geographic in 2019 focusing on extreme poverty, inequality and sustainability in conjunction with not-for-profit Global Citizen and production company Radical Media.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Handley |first1=Lucy |title=P&G moves away from ads and toward TV shows that go way beyond product placement |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/05/pg-moves-away-from-ads-and-toward-creative-content-partnerships.html |accessdate=July 15, 2020 |work=CNBC |date=September 5, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The company agreed to a longform series deal with Stone Village Television in January 2020.

=== Sponsorships ===
In addition to its self-produced items through PGE, Procter & Gamble also supports many Spanish-language novellas through advertising on all networks: [[Azteca América]], [[Estrella TV]], [[Galavisión]], [[Telemundo]], [[UniMás]] & [[Univisión]]. P&G was one of the first mainstream advertisers on Spanish-language TV during the mid-1980s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 2008, P&G expanded into music sponsorship when it joined Island Def Jam to create Tag Records, named after a body spray that P&G acquired from Gillette. In April 2010, after the cancellation of ''As the World Turns'', PGP announced they were phasing out soap opera production and expanding into more family-appropriate programming.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07music.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=media&adxnnlx=1215442912-P1oe44maZMAEL5WOZFKoBw/ |first=Robert |last=Levine |title=It's American Brandstand: Marketers Underwrite Performers |newspaper=New York Times |date=July 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524072632/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07music.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=media&adxnnlx=1215442912-P1oe44maZMAEL5WOZFKoBw%2F |archive-date=May 24, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/07/10/brand-advisory.aspx |title=P&G Must Proceed With Caution |website=Marketing Blog |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410104012/http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/07/10/brand-advisory.aspx |archive-date=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

Procter & Gamble also gave a $100,000 contract to the winners of Cycles 1 through 3 of ''[[Canada's Next Top Model]]'', wherein [[Andrea Muizelaar]], Rebecca Hardy, and [[Meaghan Waller]] won the prize.

Procter & Gamble has been a major sponsor of the [[Summer Olympics]] since 2012. It sponsored 150 athletes at the London games that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.pg.com/press-release/pg-corporate-announcements/pg-sponsors-more-150-world-class-athletes-london-2012-olymp |title=P&G Sponsors More Than 150 World-Class Athletes at the London 2012 Olympic Games |date=July 29, 2012 |website=Procter & Gamble |accessdate=October 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203220908/http://news.pg.com/press-release/pg-corporate-announcements/pg-sponsors-more-150-world-class-athletes-london-2012-olymp |archive-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> They have also sponsored the [[Winter Olympics]] since [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]. It'll do so at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo besides the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in Beijing. The company's sponsorship includes television ads in which Olympic athletes are portrayed as children to convey the sense that the mothers of these athletes still remember them as infants; other ads stress how Olympic mothers stood by their children through years of training all the way through to Olympic success. 2016's ad for the Rio Games notes upheavals as youths by an American gymnast, Chinese swimmer, Brazilian volleyballer, and German distance runner.  The ads all make prominent use of the [[Ludovico Einaudi]] orchestral track "[[Divenire]]" and related such instrumentals.

== Controversies ==

=== Price fixing ===
In April 2011, P&G was fined €211.2&nbsp;million by the [[European Commission]] for establishing a price-fixing [[cartel]] for washing powder in Europe along with [[Unilever]], who was fined €104&nbsp;million, and [[Henkel]]. Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after P&G and Unilever admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13064928 |website=BBC News |title=Unilever and Procter & Gamble in price fixing fine |date=April 13, 2011 |access-date=June 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509100638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13064928 |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Toxic shock syndrome and tampons ===
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2020}}
[[Toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS) is a disease caused by strains of the bacteria ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. Most people have these bacteria living in their bodies as harmless [[commensal]]s in places such as the nose, skin, and vagina. The disease can strike anyone, not only women, but the disease is often associated with [[tampon]]s.
In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS cases were reported; 38 deaths resulted from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the [[Rely (tampon)|Rely]] tampon created by Procter & Gamble.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mikkelson |first1=Barbara |last2=Mikkelson |first2=David |url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/tampax.asp |title=Tampax Pearl |website=Snopes.com | date=December 31, 2005 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}</ref> Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of [[polyester]] for absorption.

In the summer of 1980, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] released a report explaining how these bacterial mechanisms were leading to TSS. They also stated that the Rely tampon was associated with TSS more than any other brand of tampon. In September 1980, Procter & Gamble voluntarily recalled its Rely brand of tampons from the market and agreed to provide for a program to notify consumers. Since the 1980s, reported cases of TSS have dramatically decreased.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mcpherson |first=Marianne |url=http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book/companion.asp?id=13&compID=38 |title=Sexual Anatomy, Reproduction, and the Menstrual Cycle |date=March 2005 |website=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204102210/http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book/companion.asp?id=13&compID=38 |archive-date=February 4, 2012}}</ref>

=== Child labor and forced labor ===

Some workers were extorted, threatened, or not paid for work. Some workers also suffered severe injuries from toxic banned chemicals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/5184/2016/en/ |title=The Great Palm Oil Scandal: Labour Abuses Behind Big Brand Names |date=November 30, 2016 |website=[[Amnesty International]] |access-date=December 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423210624/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/5184/2016/en/ |archive-date=April 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Animal testing ===

=== Logo myth ===
[[File:P&G logo.jpg|right|thumb|Former P&G logo. In 1989, it was simplified in detail to avoid satanic links.]]
P&G's former logo originated in 1851 as a crude cross that barge workers on the [[Ohio River]] painted on cases of P&G star candles to identify them. P&G later changed this symbol into a trademark that showed a man in the moon overlooking 13 stars, said to commemorate the original [[13 colonies]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Procter and Gamble v. Amway 242 F.3d 539 |url=http://openjurist.org/242/f3d/539/the-procter-and-gamble-company-v-amway-corporation |website=U.S. Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit |date=February 14, 2001 |accessdate=August 28, 2014}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The company received unwanted media publicity in the 1980s due to rumors, spread largely by [[Amway]] distributors, that the moon-and-stars logo was a [[Satanism|satanic]] symbol. The accusation was based on a particular passage in [[the Bible]], specifically [[book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12:1, which states: "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; [[Woman of the Apocalypse|a woman]] clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars." P&G's logo consisted of a man's face on the moon surrounded by 13 stars. Some claimed that the logo was a mockery of the heavenly symbol alluded to in the aforementioned verse, thus construing the logo to be satanic. Where the flowing beard meets the surrounding circle, three curls were said to be a mirror image of the number ''[[666 (number)|666]]'', or the reflected [[number of the beast]]. At the top and bottom, the hair curls in on itself and was said to be the two horns like those of a ram. Though the moon-and-stars logo was claimed to be discontinued in 1985 in a failed attempt to quash the rumors, the logo was simplified in 1989 and continued to be used in some countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/762134992.html?dids=762134992:762134992&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+25%2C+1985&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Corporate+news&pqatl=google |title=Corporate news: Procter symbol succumbs to devilish rumor |last=Witt |first=Howard |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 25, 1985 |access-date=July 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725063848/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/762134992.html?dids=762134992:762134992&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+25%2C+1985&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Corporate+news&pqatl=google |archive-date=July 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The logo was finally abandoned in 1998.

These interpretations have been denied by company officials and no evidence linking the company to the [[Church of Satan]] or any other occult organization has ever been presented. The company unsuccessfully sued Amway from 1995 to 2003 over rumors forwarded through a company voice-mail system in 1995. In 2007, the company successfully sued individual Amway distributors for reviving and propagating the false rumors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500395_162-2587161.html |website=CBS Money Watch |title=Procter & Gamble Wins Satanic Civil Suit |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509065447/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-500395_162-2587161.html |archive-date=May 9, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Church of Satan denies being supported by Procter & Gamble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/_FAQ16.html|title=F.A.Q.
