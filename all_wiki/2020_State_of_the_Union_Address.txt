After the SOTU, the White House [[Twitter]] account posted "Speaker Pelosi just ripped up: One of our last surviving Tuskegee Airmen. The survival of a child born at 21 weeks.

Reaction to Pelosi tearing up the speech followed party lines in the days following the SOTU. White House counselor [[Kellyanne Conway]] described it as a "temper tantrum" which she believed was typical for Pelosi. "America saw an incorrigible child ripping up the State of the Union," Conway told reporters the day after the speech. "I think it shows you how petty and peevish and partisan the Democratic Party has become." Representative [[Hakeem Jeffries]] of New York, the chairman of the [[House Democratic Caucus]], praised Pelosi's actions saying, "As far as Iâ€™m concerned, a shredder wasnâ€™t available, and so she did what she needed to do." Representative [[Lois Frankel]], Democrat of Florida, said "I think she did the only thing she could do within the realm of respectability. She basically said she had had it."<ref name=NYT/>
