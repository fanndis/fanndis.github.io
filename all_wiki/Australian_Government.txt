{{Politics of Australia sidebar}}

The '''Australian Government''' is the federal government of [[Australia]], a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]], and is the first level of government division. It is also referred to as the '''Commonwealth Government'''. Like many other [[Westminster system|Westminster-style systems of government]], the Australian Government is made up of three branches: the executive (the [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], the [[Ministers of the Crown|ministers]], and government departments), the legislative (the [[Parliament of Australia]]), and the [[Judiciary of Australia|judicial]].

The legislative branch, the federal Parliament, is made up of two chambers: the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] (lower house) and the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] (upper house). The House of Representatives has 151 [[Member of parliament|members]], each representing an individual electoral district of about 165,000 people. The Senate has 76 members: twelve from each of the six states and two each from Australia's internal territories, the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Northern Territory]]. The [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian monarch]], currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]], is represented by the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]]. The Australian Government in its executive capacity is formed by the party or coalition with a majority in the House of Representatives, with the prime minister being the [[parliamentary leader]] who has the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives. The prime minister is formally appointed to the role by the governor-general.

The government is based in the nation's capital, [[Canberra]], in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The head offices of all [[Australian Government#Departments|fourteen federal departments]] lie in Canberra, along with [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] and the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Australian Capital Territory|url=https://www.studyinaustralia.gov.au/Destinations/australian-capital-territory|website=Study in Australia|url-status=live|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Contact us|url=https://www.hcourt.gov.au/contact/contact-us|website=High Court of Australia|url-status=live|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref> The judicial branch of government, headed by the High Court of Australia, is independent of the legislative and executive branch,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Courts|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/LegalSystem/Courts/Pages/default.aspx|website=Attorney-General's Department|url-status=live|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref> and ensures that government acts according to the constitution and law.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Operation of the High Court|url=https://www.hcourt.gov.au/about/operation|website=High Court of Australia|url-status=live|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref> As a founding member of [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] and a [[History of Australia#Colonialisation|former British colony]] before [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, [[Constitution of Australia|Australia's Constitution]] is influenced heavily by the British [[Westminster system|Westminster system of government]], as well as the [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]].

==Structure==
{{Split section|Politics of Australia|discuss=Talk:Australian Government#Splitting of some content from #Structure to Politics of Australia|date=October 2020}}{{Images of branches of Australian Government}}

Section 1 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] creates a democratic legislature, the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Australia]] which consists of the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]] and two chambers of parliament, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]]. [[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51]] of the Constitution provides for the Australian Government's legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities (known as "heads of power") to the Federal Government. All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|states]] (previously separate colonies). Further, each state has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven devolved Parliaments, none of which can encroach on the functions of any other. The [[High Court of Australia]] arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the Federal Government and the states and territories, or among the states and territories themselves.

The Parliament of Australia can propose changes to the Constitution. To become effective, the proposals must be put to a [[referendum]] of all Australians of voting age and must receive a 'double majority': a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.

The Australian Constitution also provides that the states can agree to refer any of their powers to the Federal Government. This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum (a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the states to the federation, or vice versa, should be implemented). More commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved. This "transfer" legislation may have a "sunset clause", a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period, at which point the original division of power is restored.

In addition, Australia has several territories, two of which are self-governing: the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]].  While these territories' legislatures exercise powers devolved to them by the Australian Government, the Parliament of Australia has the authority to override their legislation and to alter their powers.  Australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the Parliament of Australia, abiet with less representation in the Senate. [[Norfolk Island]] was self-governing from 1979 until 2015, although it was never represented as such in the Parliament of Australia. The other inhabited territories: [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]], [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], have never been self-governing.

The federal nature and the structure of the [[Parliament of Australia]] were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution. The [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the states. Thus [[New South Wales]] has 48 members while [[Tasmania]] has only five.  But the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] is elected on a basis of equality among the states: all states elect 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller states to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the House of Representatives. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, the only territories represented in Senate, each elect only two.

The third level of governance is [[Local government in Australia|local government]], in the form of [[shire]]s, towns or cities. The councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives (known as either [[councillor]] or [[alderman]], depending on the state). Their powers are devolved to them by the state or territory in which they are located.

[[Separation of powers]] is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities separately from each other. The legislature proposes and debates laws that the executive then administers, and the judicial arbitrates cases arising from the administration of laws and [[common law]]. Only the federal High Court can seem if a law is constitutional or not.
==Legislature==
{{main|Parliament of Australia}}
[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Australian Senate]] chamber]]
The Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate. The [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of the [[Queen of Australia]], a 76-member [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a 151-member [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

Twelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using [[proportional representation]] and the [[single transferable vote]] (known in Australia as "quota-preferential voting": see [[Australian electoral system]]), with half elected every three years. In addition to the state Senators, two senators are elected by voters from the [[Northern Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories, [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while another two senators are elected by the voters of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (which for this purpose includes the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, but their term of office is not fixed;  it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends on the day before the next such election.

The members of the House of Representatives are elected by majority-preferential<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchers.anu.edu.au/publications/4497 |title=Australia: Replacing Plurality Rule with Majority-Preferential Voting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.}}</ref> voting using the non-proportional [[Instant-runoff voting]] system<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |title=The first Parliament: Developments in the Parliament of Australia |publisher=Parliamentary Education Office of the Government of Australia |access-date=25 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228174617/https://www.peo.gov.au/learning/closer-look/short-history/the-first-parliament.html |archive-date=28 February 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories.  In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have co-ordinate powers, but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives. Under the prevailing [[Westminster system]], the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]].
[[File:Australian House of Representatives - Parliament of Australia.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Australian House of Representatives]] chamber]]
The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must, in most circumstances, be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on [[2019 Australian federal election|18 May 2019]].

The Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the [[Westminster system]], with a recognised [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|Leader of the Opposition]], usually the leader of the largest party outside the government, and a [[Shadow Cabinet]] of Opposition members who "shadow" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters within the Minister's portfolio. Although the Government, by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house, the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses.

The day-to-day business of the [[House of Representatives of Australia|House of Representatives]] is usually negotiated between the [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]], appointed by the Prime Minister, and the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business in the House]], appointed by the [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the Commonwealth parliament, currently [[Anthony Albanese]].

==Executive==

===Head of state===
{{main|Monarchy of Australia | Governor-General of Australia}}

The [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] dates from 1901, when the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] of the [[British Empire]] were not sovereign states, and does not use the term "head of state". As Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], government and academic sources describe the Queen as head of state.<ref>The Constitution (2012) Overview by the Attorney-General's Department and Australian Government Solicitor [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2005Q00193]</ref> In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the [[Queen of Australia]] and the [[Governor-General of Australia]], who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they independently exercise many important powers in their own right. The governor-general represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Governor-General's Role | publisher = Office of the Governor-General | date = 20 July 2015 | url = http://www.gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | accessdate = 1 March 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190411022216/http://gg.gov.au/governor-generals-role | archive-date = 11 April 2019 | url-status = dead }}</ref>
[[File:Government House Canberra.JPG|thumb|left|[[Government House, Canberra]]]]
The [[monarch of Australia]], currently [[Elizabeth II]], is also the monarch of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, and the sovereign of the United Kingdom. Like the other [[British Dominions|Dominions]], Australia gained legislative independence from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] by virtue of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]],{{efn|Prior to 1931, the junior status of dominions was shown in the fact that it was British ministers who advised the King, with dominion ministers, if they met the King at all, escorted by the constitutionally superior British minister. After 1931 all dominion ministers met the King as ''His'' ministers as of right, equal in Commonwealth status to Britain's ministers, meaning that there was no longer either a requirement for, or an acceptance of, the presence of British ministers. The first state to exercise this both symbolic and real independence was the [[Irish Free State]]. Australia and other dominions soon followed.}} which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 September 1939. By the [[Royal Style and Titles Act 1953]], the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title [[Queen of Australia]], and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] as well were removed, making her Queen of Australia.

Section 61 of the Constitution provides that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor‑General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provides that a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen.

Under the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] the Governor-General's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains [[reserve powers]] similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.

Australia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 referendum]], the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed references to the [[Queen of Australia|Queen]] from the Constitution and replaced the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The [[Australian Republican Movement]] continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Australian Monarchist League]].

===Executive Council===
{{main|Federal Executive Council (Australia)}}
The Federal Executive Council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. All Ministers are members of the Executive Council and are entitled to be styled "[[The Honourable]]", a title which they retain for life. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] usually presides at Council meetings, but in his or her absence another Minister nominated as the [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]] presides at the meeting of the Council. Since 20 December 2017, the Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council has been Senator [[Mathias Cormann]].

There are times when the government acts in a [[Caretaker government of Australia|"caretaker" capacity]], principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.

===Cabinet===
{{main|Cabinet of Australia}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2020}}
The Cabinet of Australia is the council of senior Ministers of the Crown, responsible to the Federal Parliament. The ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who serve at the former's pleasure. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. Outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers, called Parliamentary secretaries, responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister.

The Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General.

Until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 [[Robert Menzies]] created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the [[front bench]]. This practice has been continued by all governments except the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Government.

When the non-Labor parties are in power, the Prime Minister makes all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion, although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] and its predecessors (the [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist Party]] and the [[United Australia Party]]) have been in coalition with the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] or its predecessor the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios.

When [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] first held office under [[Chris Watson]], Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the [[Caucus]], and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. Prior to the [[2007 Australian general election|2007 general election]], the then Leader of the Opposition, [[Kevin Rudd]], said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/29/2046939.htm |title=Rudd seizes power from factions |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 September 2007 |first=Ben |last=Worsley}}</ref>

The cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne. Kevin Rudd was in favour of the Cabinet meeting in other places, such as major regional cities.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Cutting bureaucracy won't hurt services: Rudd |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/21/2097424.htm |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work=News Online |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> There are [[Commonwealth Parliament Offices, Sydney|Commonwealth Parliament Offices]] in each State Capital, with those in Sydney located in [[Phillip Street, Sydney|Phillip Street]].

==Judiciary==
{{main|Australian court hierarchy}}
[[File:Court 1 at the High Court of Australia.jpg|thumb|250px|Courtroom 1 in the High Court in [[Canberra]].]]
As a federation, in Australia judicial power is exercised by both federal and state courts.

Federal judicial power is vested in the [[High Court of Australia]] and such other federal courts created by the Federal Parliament, including the [[Federal Court of Australia]], the [[Family Court of Australia]], and the [[Federal Circuit Court of Australia]]. Additionally, the federal legislature has the power to enact laws which vest federal authority in State courts.<ref>Robert French, '[http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/speeches/current-justices/frenchcj/frenchcj15oct12.pdf Two Chapters about Judicial Power]', speech given at the Peter Nygh Memorial Lecture, 15 October 2012, Hobart, p 3.</ref> Since the Australian Constitution requires a separation of powers at the federal level, only courts may exercise federal judicial power; and conversely, non-judicial functions cannot be vested in courts.<ref>''[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]]'' (1956) 94 CLR 254.</ref>

State judicial power is exercised by each State's Supreme Court, and such other courts and tribunals created by the State Parliaments of Australia.

The High Court is the final court of appeal in Australia and has the jurisdiction to hear appeals on matters of both federal and state law. It has both original and appellate jurisdiction, the power of judicial review over laws passed by federal and State parliaments, and has jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution of Australia. Unlike in the United States, there is only one common law of Australia, rather than separate common laws for each State.<ref>''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (1997) 189 CLR 520 at 563.</ref>

Until the passage of the [[Australia Act 1986]], and associated legislation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, some Australian cases could be referred to the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] for final appeal. With this act, Australian law was made unequivocally sovereign, and the [[High Court of Australia]] was confirmed as the highest court of appeal. The theoretical possibility of the British Parliament enacting laws to override the Australian Constitution was also removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aa1986114/index.html#s1 |title=Australia Act 1986 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |work=Office of Legislative Drafting, Attorney-General's Department}}</ref>
