'''Angra dos Reis''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈɐ̃ɡɾɐ duʒ ˈʁejʃ}}; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''cove or bay of the Kings'') is a [[Brazil]]ian [[municipality]] located in the southern part of [[Rio de Janeiro state]]. ''Angra'' is located at an altitude of 6 meters and includes in its territory many offshore islands, the largest being the [[Ilha Grande]].

The area was first documented by Europeans on January 6, 1502, and has been under continual settlement since 1556. Its [[population]] was estimated, on July 1, 2018, to be 200,407 [[inhabitants]].<ref name="IBGE2"></ref>

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The municipality fell into decline after 1872 with the advent of railways. It came back into prominence in the 1920s when a railway extension connected it to the states of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Goias]], as a terminus for the transportation of [[agriculture]] production from these same two states. The railway extension, in meter gauge, still exists and is currently operated by the ''Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica'' company.

In the mid-twentieth century, the municipality was an essential part of the implementation of [[Companhia Siderurgica Nacional]] – CSN, [[Volta Redonda]], and the endpoint for coking coal supplied from [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. Today, the same company also uses the port, in part, for its steel exports.

Its current importance is due, in part, to having a ferry terminal facility in the Bay of [[Ilha Grande]] and its harbour, used by TEBIG Petrobras, which transports large quantities of oil and thus positions the port of Angra dos Reis as one of the busiest in the country.

Today, because of its beautiful beaches and nearby regions, the place has become a focal point for tourism – not only statewide but on a national scale also. Within the municipality are over three hundred islands, many of them owned by national and international celebrities, with the largest one called Ilha Grande (Big Island). The pioneering Brazilian plastic surgeon and philanthropist [[Ivo Pitanguy]] was a noted resident.

Most of the place is covered by hills, and its hilly terrain helped generate the landslides that occurred at the beginning of 2010, when numerous homes and hotels were severely damaged or destroyed, mainly on Ilha Grande.

== Economy ==
The most important economic activities are commerce, fishing, industry, services, and [[tourism]]. The port has an oil terminal as well as shipbuilding (Keppel Fels, former Verolme) facilities. Brazil's nuclear power stations, [[Angra Nuclear Power Plant|Angra I and Angra II]]  are located nearby. They employ 3,000 people, and generate another 10,000 indirect jobs in Rio de Janeiro State. Tourism is highly developed with countless beaches, islands and pristine waters perfect for swimming or scuba diving. The nuclear power stations also warm the area's waters with their thermal discharges, a form of [[thermal pollution]].

There is a small amount of cattle raising, with approximately 4,200 head. The main agricultural products cultivated are:
*bananas: 1,460&nbsp;hectares / 3,600&nbsp;tons
*coconut: 10&nbsp;hectares / 130,000 fruits
*oranges: 4&nbsp;hectares / 25&nbsp;tons
*hearts of palm (palmito): 50&nbsp;hectares / 75&nbsp;tons
*sugarcane: 20&nbsp;hectares / 390&nbsp;tons

== Meaning of the name ==

Accordingly, the place was named “''Angra dos Reis''”, which means “''Creek of the Kings''” or loosely – “''Anchorage of the Kings''”.

== Transportation ==
