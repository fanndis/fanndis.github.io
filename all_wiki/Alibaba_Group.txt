==History==
On 4 April 1999, [[Jack Ma]] and his team of 17 friends and students founded Alibaba.com, a China-based [[Business-to-business|B2B]] marketplace site, in his [[Hangzhou]] apartment. In October 1999, Alibaba received a US$25 million investment from [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[SoftBank Group|SoftBank]]. Alibaba.com was expected to improve the domestic e-commerce market and perfect an [[Ecommerce platform|E-Commerce platform]] for Chinese enterprises, especially [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs), to help export Chinese products to the global market as well as address [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) challenges. In 2002, Alibaba.com became profitable three years after launch. Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system, so from 2003 onward, Alibaba launched [[Taobao|Taobao Marketplace]], [[Alipay]], Alimama.com, and Lynx.<ref name=":2">{{cite news|url=http://www.hottopics.ht/stories/consumer/jack-ma-the-man-leading-the-chinese-e-commerce-market/|title=Jack Ma: The man leading the Chinese e-commerce market|last=Popovic|first=Stevan|date=4 May 2014|work=Hot Topics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/about/history|title=Alibaba Group |website=www.alibabagroup.com|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>

When [[eBay]] announced its expansion into China in 2003, Ma viewed the American company as a foreign competitor and rejected eBay's buyout of Alibaba's subsidiary Taobao. Through applying existing technologies and gaining trust in the Chinese e-commerce market, as well as expanding through dominating the market at a loss before making a return on additional services, Alibaba's subsidiaries outperformed eBay in the Chinese e-commerce market, claiming a growing percentage of consumers from eBay. Alibaba subsidiary Taobao would later force eBay out of the Chinese market, with eBay closing its unprofitable China Web unit, though the two companies would break even six years later.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/business-insider/alibaba-jack-ma-life-story.html|title=The Rags-to-Riches Life Story of Alibaba Founder Jack Ma|date=2017-03-02|website=Inc.com|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/alibaba|title=Quicktake - Alibaba|last=Chen|first=Lilu Yilun|date=19 November 2017|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Gold Supplier membership===
Alibaba.com offers a paid Gold Supplier membership to try to ensure that each seller is genuine; sellers' Gold Supplier status and the number of years it has been held are displayed.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.alibaba.com/help/gold_supplier.html |title=Gold Supplier | publisher=Alibaba Group}}</ref> The supplier verification types and checks are listed on Alibaba.com's website, with more stringent checks for sellers outside China.<ref name=goldchecks>{{cite web | url=https://service.alibaba.com/buyer/ab/safety_security/products/verification_services.php | title=Alibaba.com's Supplier Verification Services | publisher=Alibaba Group}}</ref> While the majority of suppliers are reported to be genuine,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} there have been many cases of sellers, some with Gold Supplier status, seeking to defraud unsuspecting buyers.<ref name=minalto>{{cite web |url=http://andrewminalto.com/top-10-alibaba-scams/ |title=Top 10 Scams on Alibaba.com! |newspaper=Andrewminalto.com |date= January 2014 |author =Andrew Minalto |access-date= 22 January 2016}}</ref> In February 2011, controversy ensued when Alibaba's corporate office admitted that it had granted the mark of integrity of its "China Gold Supplier" program to more than 2,000 dealers that had subsequently defrauded buyers; the firm's share price dropped "abruptly" after the announcement.<ref name=thieves>{{cite news | title=Alibaba and the 2,236 thieves | url=https://www.economist.com/business/2011/02/24/alibaba-and-the-2236-thieves | work=[[The Economist]] |date=24 February 2011}}</ref> A statement from the firm reported that Yan Limin, the general manager of Alibaba.com at the time, had been dismissed in March for "misconduct"; Phil Muncaster of UK's ''The Register'' additionally reported that "a further 28 employees had been involved in dodgy dealings".<ref>{{cite news | title=Ex-Alibaba GM cuffed as bribery scandal resurfaces | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/06/alibaba_general_manager_arrested_bribery | last=Muncaster | first=Phil | work=[[The Register]] |date=6 July 2012}}</ref>

As the ''Economist'' noted, the company's response has conflicting components: Alibaba's promulgated view that its corrective actions indicate its commitment to quality and integrity (where it contrasts itself with other scandal-associated Chinese business sectors), ''versus'' a damage control view suggesting that the subscription-driven, third-party verified "China Gold Supplier" program was endangered by diminished trust in its endorsement system, removing the incentive for global buyers to choose Alibaba as their business-to-business service, thus more broadly endangering Alibaba through impact on its brand and capabilities (the latter via the "defenestration of senior people").<ref name=thieves/> The scandal was said to have placed the head of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma—who was described as having been furious over the scandal—in a position to personally fight to win back trust.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0411/features-jack-ma-alibaba-e-commerce-scandal-face-of-china.html |title=Alibaba's Jack Ma Fights To Win Back Trust |last=Epstein |first=Gady |journal=Forbes |date=11 April 2011 |access-date=23 September 2012}}</ref>
