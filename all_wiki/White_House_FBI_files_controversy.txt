The '''White House FBI files controversy''' of the [[Clinton Administration]], often referred to as '''Filegate''',<ref name="cnn040198">[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/01/filegate/index.html "'Filegate' Depositions Sought From White House Aides"], [[CNN]], April 1, 1998. Accessed June 5, 2007.</ref> arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the [[White House]]'s Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission.  The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administrations, including top presidential advisors.  Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position.  Allegations were made that senior White House figures, including First Lady [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], may have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First Lady had authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.

The matter was investigated by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Government Reform and Oversight Committee]], the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], and the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater]] [[Independent Counsel]].  In 1998, Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] exonerated President [[Bill Clinton]] as well as the First Lady of any involvement in the matter.  In 2000, Independent Counsel [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]] issued his final report on Filegate, stating that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter and no credible evidence that senior White House figures or the First Lady had requested the files or had acted improperly or testified improperly regarding Livingstone's hiring.  A separate lawsuit on the matter brought by [[Judicial Watch]], a [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[watchdog group]], lingered on for years and was dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.

==Improper use of files issue==

W. Bush administrative staff left the White House in January 1993, they had taken all the files of the Office of Personnel Security with them for use in the Bush Library, as they were permitted to do under law.  The OPS staff were trying to rebuild these records to include those of permanent White House employees who remained to work in the Clinton administration; Marceca, a civilian investigator for the [[United States Army|Army]], had been hired for this task.<ref name="time062496"/> In doing so, they received an outdated list from the Secret Service of White House employees, which included many names who were no longer employees.

==Who hired Livingstone issue==
[[File:Hrcgarden.jpg|thumb|First Lady [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] came under examination regarding whether she had had any role in hiring for the White House's Office of Personnel Security (photo taken at the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]]).]]

A secondary question of the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job.  The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the [[United States Secret Service]],<ref name="time062496"/> nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI,<ref name="pbs062696">[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Online News Hour]], [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/june96/files_hearings_6-26.html "FBI files hearing heats up"], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], June 26, 1996. Accessed June 7, 2007.</ref> nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House.<ref name="gro-interim"/> Rather, its role was to keep track of who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires.<ref name="lh">[[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]'', [[Simon & Schuster]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-7432-2224-5}}, pp. 371–372.</ref>  Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] campaigns and transitions,<ref name="pbs062696"/> including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign,<ref name="time062496"/> and his only prior job in the "security" field was that of a local [[bar (establishment)|bar]] [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]<ref name="wapo091905"/> at a [[Washington, D.C.]], [[night club]]. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to "false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live."<ref name="pbs062696"/> White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him.<ref name="wapo062796"/>

An FBI document suggested that Livingstone had been given his position because First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was a friend of Livingstone's mother and recommended him.  Hillary Clinton stated that while she was once photographed with the mother in a large group, she did not know her.<ref name="lh"/> Hillary Clinton was briefly deposed at the White House by the Independent Counsel regarding this matter on January 14, 1998.<ref name="nyt011598"/><ref name="gormley">[[Ken Gormley (academic)|Ken Gormley]], ''The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr'', [[Crown Publishers]] (New York), 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-307-40944-7}}. pp. 324–325, 658.</ref>  (That same day, the same [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Office of the Independent Counsel]] staff were listening to taped conversations of [[Linda Tripp]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]]; the [[Lewinsky scandal]] was soon to break.<ref name="gormley"/>)  In 1999, Clinton gave a sworn statement that she had nothing to do with Livingstone's hiring.<ref name="cnn072800"/> Livingstone also stated under oath there was no truth to the supposed hiring relationship.<ref name="cnn072800"/> Hillary Clinton would later refer to the whole files matter as a "pseudoscandal".<ref name="lh"/>

==Official findings==
[[File:Kenneth W. Starr.jpg|thumb|upright|Independent Counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] exonerated both the President and the First Lady with respect to the FBI files matter in 1998.]]

On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr testified before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] in connection with the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]] over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal.  Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying "while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [we] found no evidence that anyone higher [than Livingstone or Marceca] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose."<ref name="wapo111998">Ruth Marcus, Peter Baker, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/impeach111998.htm "Clinton 'Thwarted' Probe, Starr to Say"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 19, 1998. Accessed June 12, 2007.</ref>  (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, and to say that he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the [[United States House elections, 1998|1998 Congressional elections]].<ref name="nyt112098">[[Don Van Natta, Jr.]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE7DB1230F933A15752C1A96E958260 "Democrats Challenge Starr on Delayed Exoneration"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 20, 1998. Accessed June 12, 2007.</ref>)

In March 2000, Independent Counsel [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]], Starr's successor, issued the office's final report on the matter, as part of a concerted effort to wrap up all Whitewater-related cases before the end of Bill Clinton's term.<ref name="gormley"/>    Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter.<ref name="nyt031700">Neil A. Lewis, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED8173AF934A25750C0A9669C8B63 "Report Clears White House In Inquiry Over F.B.I. Files"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 17, 2000. Accessed June 9, 2007.</ref>  It attributed the improper collection of the files by Marceca due to his having an outdated Secret Service list of White House passes, as Marceca had originally claimed.<ref name="nyt031700"/> It stated that even though Marceca's statements were sometimes "contradictory and misleading",<ref name="ray-marceca"/> they were "sufficiently transparent"<ref name="ray-marceca"/> and there was insufficient evidence to prove that Anthony Marceca had made false statements to Congress during his testimony.<ref name="cnn072800"/>  The report ascribed the FBI files matter to "a failure of process at many levels," saying that the Secret Service had provided critically erroneous data,<ref name="ray-marceca"/> and that this was compounded by the White House's informal process of requesting sensitive information by "inexperienced, untrained, and unsupervised personnel with backgrounds as political operatives."<ref name="ray-marceca"/>

Based on an investigation that included the prior fingerprint analysis,<ref name="nyt031700"/> the report further stated that:

{{Quote|text=there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official, or First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was involved in seeking confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation background reports of former White House staff from prior administrations of President Bush and President Reagan.|sign=Independent Counsel Robert Ray|source=<ref name="cnn072800"/>}}

Ray's report also concluded that there was no credible evidence that Bernard Nussbaum testified falsely about not having discussed Livingstone's hiring with the First Lady, and found as well that there was no personal relationship between the First Lady and Livingstone that had formed the basis for his hiring.<ref name="cnn072800"/>
