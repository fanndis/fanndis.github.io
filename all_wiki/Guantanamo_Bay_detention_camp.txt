The camp was established by US President [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush's administration]] in 2002 during the [[War on Terror]].

At the time of its establishment in January 2002, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] said the detention camp was established to detain extraordinarily dangerous people, to interrogate detainees in an optimal setting, and to prosecute detainees for [[war crime]]s.<ref name=RumsfeldBriefing>{{cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2254|title=Defense.gov Transcript: DoD News Briefing – Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen.

The Department of Defense at first kept secret the identity of the individuals held in Guantanamo but, after losing attempts to defy a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request from the [[Associated Press]], the U.S. military officially acknowledged holding 779 prisoners in the camp.<ref name="NYTimes2006-01-26"/> The facility is operated by the [[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] (JTF-GTMO) of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Steve|title=Afghan Prisoners Going to Gray Area; Military Unsure What Follows Transfer to U.S. Base in Cuba|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-320927.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115050658/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-320927.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 January 2016|accessdate=23 December 2015|work=The Washington Post|via=Highbeam Research|date=9 January 2002}}</ref>

After Bush political appointees at the U.S. [[Office of Legal Counsel]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] advised the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp could be considered outside U.S. legal jurisdiction, military guards took the first twenty detainees to Camp X-Ray on 11 January 2002.

Current and former detainees have reported abuse and torture, which the Bush administration denied.

[[Camp Delta (Guantanamo Bay)|Camp Delta]] is a 612-unit detention center finished in April 2002. It includes detention camps 1 through 6, as well as [[Camp Echo (Guantanamo Bay)|Camp Echo]], where pre-commissions are held.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stafford Smith|first=Clive|year=2008|title=Bad Men|publisher=Phoenix|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-7538-2352-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/badmenguantanamo0000smit}}</ref>

[[Camp X-Ray (Guantanamo)|Camp X-Ray]] was a temporary detention facility, which was closed in April 2002. Its prisoners were transferred to Camp Delta.

In 2008, the [[Associated Press]] reported [[Camp seven (Guantanamo)|Camp 7]], a separate facility on the naval base that is considered the highest security jail on the base, and its location is classified.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/02/06/ap-confirms-secret-camp-i_n_85382.html |title=AP Confirms Secret Camp Inside Gitmo |last=Selsky |first=Andrew O. |date=6 February 2008 |work=HuffPost |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=26 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209061449/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/02/06/ap-confirms-secret-camp-i_n_85382.html |archivedate=9 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is used to house high-security detainees formerly held by the [[CIA]].

In January 2010, [[Scott Horton (attorney)|Scott Horton]] published an article in ''[[Harper's Weekly|Harper's Magazine]]'' describing "[[Camp No]]", a [[black site]] about a mile outside the main camp perimeter, which included an interrogation center. His description was based on accounts by four guards who had served at Guantanamo. They said prisoners were taken one at a time to the camp, where they were believed to be interrogated. He believes that the three detainees that DoD announced as having committed suicide were questioned under [[torture]] the night of their deaths.

From 2003 to 2006, the CIA operated a small site, known informally as "Penny Lane," to house prisoners whom the agency attempted to recruit as spies against [[Al-Qaeda]]. The housing at Penny Lane was less sparse by the standards of Guantanamo Bay, with private kitchens, showers, televisions, and beds with mattresses. The camp was divided into eight units. Its existence was revealed to the Associated Press in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Goldman, Adam|author2=Apuzzo, Matt|title=Penny Lane: Gitmo's other secret CIA facility|url=https://news.yahoo.com/penny-lane-gitmos-other-secret-cia-facility-050929062--politics.html|accessdate=23 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|work=Yahoo News|date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

An estimated 17 to 22 [[Minors detained in the global war on terror|minors under the age of 18]] were detained at [[Guantánamo Bay]], and it has been claimed that this is in violation of international law. According to Chaplain Kent Svendsen who served as chaplain for the detention centers from 2004 to 2005 there were no minor detainees at the site upon starting his assignment in early 2004. He said: "I was given a tour of the camp and it was explained to me that minors were segregated from the general public and processed to be returned to their families.

In September 2006, President Bush announced that 14 "[[Extrajudicial prisoners of the United States#High-value detainees|high-value detainees]]" were to be transferred to military custody of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp from civilian custody by the [[CIA]]. He admitted that these suspects had been held in CIA secret prisons overseas, known as [[black site]]s. These people include [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], believed to be the No. 3 [[Al-Qaeda]] leader before he was captured in Pakistan in 2003; [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], an alleged would-be [[11 September 2001]] hijacker; and [[Abu Zubaydah]], who was believed to be a link between [[Osama bin Laden]] and many Al-Qaeda cells, who were captured in Pakistan in March 2002.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5321606.stm| title=Bush admits to CIA secret prisons| date= 7 September 2006| website=BBC News| accessdate = 17 August 2007}}</ref> Zubaydah has since been found to be a low-level participant of little value.{{fact|date=March 2020}}

The prisoners supposedly feel that they may be able to get better treatment or release with suicide attempts. [[Daryl Matthews]], a professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at the [[University of Hawaii]] who examined the prisoners, stated that given the cultural differences between interrogators and prisoners, "intent" was difficult if not impossible to make.

Highly disturbed about the deaths of its citizens under U.S. custody, the Saudi government pressed the United States to release its citizens into its custody. From June 2006 through 2007, the U.S. released 93 detainees (of an original 133 Saudis detained) to the Saudi Arabian government.

===Torture===
{{See also|Enhanced interrogation}}
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) inspected the camp in June 2004. In a confidential report issued in July 2004 and leaked to ''The New York Times'' in November 2004, Red Cross inspectors accused the U.S. military of using "humiliating acts, [[solitary confinement]], temperature extremes, and use of [[Stress positions|forced positions]]" against prisoners. The inspectors concluded that "the construction of such a system, whose stated purpose is the production of intelligence, cannot be considered other than an intentional system of cruel, unusual and degrading treatment and a form of torture." The United States government reportedly rejected the Red Cross findings at the time.<ref name="NYT 2004-11-30">{{Cite news| url=https://nytimes.com/2004/11/30/politics/30gitmo.html?ei=5094&en=8d107165e454d8b6&hp=&ex=1101877200&adxnnl=1&partner=homepage&adxnnlx=1101843681-+nTyVVJpq8yXt1yEg4X28g| title=Red Cross Finds Detainee Abuse in Guantánamo| work=The New York Times| accessdate = 15 March 2006 | first=Neil A. | last=Lewis | date=30 November 2004 | url-access=limited}}</ref><ref name="Reuters storyID=6951969">{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=6951969| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208194345/https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=6951969| archivedate=8 December 2004| title=Guantanamo Tactics 'Tantamount to Torture' -NY Times| accessdate = 5 July 2007| work=Reuters}}</ref><ref name="ICRC 2004">{{cite web| url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList4/C5667B446C9A4DF7C1256F5C00403967| date=30 November 2004| title= Press Release 04/70: The ICRC's work at Guantanamo Bay| accessdate = 15 March 2006| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross}}</ref>

On 30 November 2004, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published excerpts from an internal memo leaked from the U.S. administration,<ref name="NYT 2004-11-30" /> referring to a report from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC). The ICRC reports of several activities that, it said, were "tantamount to torture": exposure to loud noise or music, prolonged extreme temperatures, or beatings. It also reported that a [[Behavioral Science Consultation Team]] (BSCT), also called 'Biscuit,' and military physicians communicated confidential medical information to the interrogation teams (weaknesses, phobias, etc.), resulting in the prisoners losing confidence in their medical care.

The ICRC's access to the base was conditioned, as is normal for ICRC humanitarian operations, on the confidentiality of their report. Following leaking of the U.S. memo, some in the ICRC wanted to make their report public or confront the U.S. administration. The newspaper said the administration and the Pentagon had seen the ICRC report in July 2004 but rejected its findings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-4645430,00.html |title=404 error |accessdate=16 March 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226095701/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0%2C1280%2C-4645430%2C00.html |archivedate=26 December 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Reuters storyID=6951969" /> The story was originally reported in several newspapers, including ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1213640,00.html| title=Red Cross report details alleged Iraq abuses| date=10 May 2004| work=The Guardian| accessdate = 16 March 2006 | location=London}}</ref> and the ICRC reacted to the article when the report was leaked in May.<ref name="ICRC 2004" />

During his Guantánamo interrogations, he was given {{frac|3|1|2}} bags of intravenous fluid, then he was forbidden to use the toilet, forcing him to soil himself. Accounts of the type of treatment he received include having water poured over him, interrogations starting at midnight and lasting 12 hours, and [[psychological torture]] methods such as sleep deprivation via repeatedly being woken up by loud, raucous music whenever he would fall asleep, and [[Dogs in warfare|military dogs]] being used to intimidate him. Soldiers would play the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|American national anthem]] and force him to salute, he had images of victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] affixed to his body, he was forced to bark like a dog, and his beard and hair were shaved, an insult to [[Muslim]] men. He would be humiliated and upset by female personnel, was forced to wear a bra, and was stripped nude and had fake menstrual blood smeared on him, while being made to believe it was real. Some of the abuses were documented in 2005, when the Interrogation Log of al-Qathani "Detainee 063" was partially published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kuwaitifreedom.org/media/pdf/Knight%20Ridder%20October%2012,%202005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506103339/http://www.kuwaitifreedom.org/media/pdf/Knight%20Ridder%20October%2012%2C%202005.pdf |archivedate=6 May 2013 |df=dmy }}, Kuwaiti Freedom</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1071284-2,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718041458/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1071284-2%2C00.html |archivedate=18 July 2013 |df=dmy }}, ''Time''</ref><ref name="David L.

In "Whose God Rules?" David McColgin, a defense attorney for Guantanamo detainees, recounts how a female government interrogator told Muslim detainees she was menstruating, "slipped her hand into her pants and pulled it out with a red liquid smeared on it meant to look like menstrual blood. The detainee screamed at the top of his lungs, began shaking, sobbing, and yanked his arms against his handcuffs. The interrogator explained to [the detainee] that he would now feel too dirty to pray and that she would have the guards turn off the water in his cell so he would not be able to wash the red substance off. 'What do you think your brothers will think of you in the morning when they see an American woman's menstrual blood on your face?' she said as she left the cell."

{{Main|Periodic Report of the United States of America to the United Nations Committee Against Torture}}

The United States government, through the State Department, makes periodic reports to the United Nations Committee Against Torture. In October 2005, the report covered pretrial detention of suspects in the "[[War on Terrorism]]", including those held in Guantánamo Bay. This Periodic Report is significant as the first official response of the U.S. government to allegations that prisoners are mistreated in Guantánamo Bay. The report denies the allegations but describes in detail several instances of misconduct, which did not rise to the level of "substantial abuse," as well as the training and punishments given to the perpetrators.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 24 June 2012, former President [[Jimmy Carter]] criticized the methods used to obtain confessions: "...some of the few being tried (only in military courts) have been tortured by [[waterboarding]] more than 100 times or intimidated with semiautomatic weapons, power drills or threats to sexually assault their mothers. These facts cannot be used as a defense by the accused, because the government claims they occurred under the cover of 'national security'".<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 030228-N-7676W-160.jpg|thumb|Detainees are shown to their new living quarters (image taken and released by the U.S. military).]]
A manual called "[[Camp Delta Standard Operating Procedure]]" (SOP), dated 28 February 2003, and designated "Unclassified//For Official Use Only", was published on [[WikiLeaks]]. This is the main document for the operation of Guantánamo Bay, including the securing and treatment of detainees. The 238-page document includes procedures for [[identity card]]s and [[Islamic funeral|'Muslim burial']]. It is signed by Major General [[Geoffrey D. Miller]]. The document is the subject of an ongoing legal action by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), which has been trying to obtain it from the Department of Defense.<ref>[http://88.80.13.160/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure Wikileaks – Camp Delta Standard Operating Procedure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730103100/http://88.80.13.160/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure |date=30 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://88.80.13.160/leak/gitmo-sop.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 March 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730104843/http://88.80.13.160/leak/gitmo-sop.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>

On 2 July 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed that the U.S. military trainers who came to Guantánamo Bay in December 2002 had based an entire interrogation class on a chart copied directly from a 1957 Air Force study of "[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]]" interrogation methodology (commonly referred to as 'brainwashing') that the United States alleged were used during the [[Korean War]] to obtain confessions. The chart showed the effects of "coercive management techniques" for possible use on prisoners, including "[[Sleep deprivation#Interrogation|sleep deprivation]]", "prolonged constraint" (also known as "[[stress positions]]"), and "exposure". The chart was copied from a 1957 article (entitled "Communist Attempts to Elicit False Confessions From Air Force Prisoners of War") written by Albert D. Biderman, working as a sociologist for the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]. Biderman had interviewed American prisoners of war returning from Korea who had confessed of having taken part in biological warfare or to involvement in other atrocities. His article sets out that the most common interrogation method used by the Chinese was to indirectly subject a prisoner to extended periods of what would initially be minor discomfort. As an example, prisoners would be required to stand for extended periods, sometimes in a cold environment. Prolonged standing and exposure to cold are an accepted technique used by the American military and the CIA to interrogate prisoners whom the United States classifies as "[[unlawful combatant]]s" (spies and saboteurs in wartime, "terrorists" in unconventional conflicts) although it is classified as [[torture]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]]. The chart reflects an "extreme model" created by Biderman to help in "understanding what occurred apart from the extent to which it was realized in actuality" (Biderman did not have a PhD in Sociology [usually the minimum qualification required to carry out such work] and the underlying research was not subjected to peer-review). His chart sets out in summary bullet points the techniques allegedly used by the Chinese in Korea, the most extreme of which include "Semi-Starvation", "Exploitation of Wounds", and use of "Filthy, Infested Surroundings" to make the prisoner "Dependent on Interrogator", to weaken "Mental and Physical Ability to Resist", and to reduce the "Prisoner to 'Animal Level'". Biderman himself admits that he was working from a very small sample of American prisoners who claimed to have been mistreated, and of the handful who had reported prolonged mistreatment none had become the "ideal confessor" (the ultimate aim of the model).<ref name="nyt_gitmo">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/02detain.html |title=China inspired interrogations at Guantánamo |date=2 July 2008 |work=The New York Times |first=Scott |last=Shane |accessdate=6 August 2013 |url-access=limited}}</ref>

<blockquote>It should be understood that only a few of the Air Force personnel who encountered efforts to elicit false confessions in Korea were subjected to really full dress, all-out attempts to make them behave in the manner I have sketched. The time between capture and repatriation for many was too short, and, presumably, the trained interrogators available to the Communists too few, to permit this. Of the few Air Force prisoners who did get the full treatment, none could be made to behave in complete accordance with the Chinese Communists' ideal of the "repentant criminal".<ref name=biderman>{{cite journal|last=Biderman|first=Albert D.|title=Communist Attempts to Elicit False Confessions from Air Force Prisoners of War|journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine|date=September 1957|volume=33|issue=9|pages=616–625|pmc=1806204|pmid=13460564}}</ref></blockquote>

It is unclear from the article whether the "sketch" of techniques set out in the chart are supported by evidence from prisoner interviews or whether it simply presents "communist" methodology in idealized form in accordance with the conventions of the time. While the chart ostensibly presents the methodology of the "enemy", it has come to have actual application at home. In the military, the techniques outlined by the chart are commonly referred to as "Biderman's Principles" and within the intelligence community it has come to be known as "Biderman's Chart of Coercion". The chart is also often used by anti-cult web sites to describe how religious cults control their members.<ref name="nyt_gitmo" />

The article was motivated by the need for the United States to deal with prominent confessions of war crimes obtained by Chinese interrogators during the [[Korean War]]. It was alleged at the time that American prisoners of war who had confessed had been "brainwashed". The allegation was taken seriously by the American military and it led them to develop a training program to counter the use of harsh methods used by an enemy interrogator. Almost all U.S. military personnel now receive [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) training to resist interrogation. Central to this training program is the theoretical model of the "communist" interrogation methodology as presented by Mr. Biderman. In 2002, this training program was adopted as a source of interrogation techniques to be used in the newly declared "[[War on Terror]]".<ref name="nyt_gitmo" /> When it was adopted for use at the Guantánamo detention and interrogation facility the only change that was made to Biderman's Chart of Coercion was to change the title (originally called "Communist Coercive Methods for Eliciting Individual Compliance"). The training document instructing on the use of these "coercive" methods was made public at a [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|United States Senate Armed Services Committee]] hearing (17 June 2008) investigating how such tactics came to be employed. Col. Steven Kleinman, who was head of a team of SERE trainers, testified before the Senate committee that his team had been put under pressure to demonstrate the techniques on Iraqi prisoners and that they had been sent home after Kleinman had observed that the techniques were intended to be used as a "form of punishment for those who wouldn't cooperate", and put a stop to it.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/25/terror/main4476962.shtml| title=Officer: Military Demanded Torture Lessons| date=11 February 2009| publisher=CBS News| agency=Associated Press| accessdate = 7 November 2011}}</ref> Sen.

Senior law enforcement agents with the [[Criminal Investigation Task Force]] told msnbc.com in 2006 that they began to complain inside the Defense Department in 2002 that the interrogation tactics used by a separate team of intelligence investigators were unproductive, not likely to produce reliable information and probably illegal. Unable to get satisfaction from the Army commanders running the detainee camp, they took their concerns to [[David Brant]], director of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS), who alerted Navy General Counsel [[Alberto J. Mora]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/15361458 |title=Gitmo interrogations spark battle over tactics |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2006}}</ref>

General Counsel Mora and Navy Judge Advocate General [[Michael Lohr]] believed the detainee treatment to be unlawful and campaigned among other top lawyers and officials in the Defense Department to investigate, and to provide clear standards prohibiting coercive interrogation tactics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/images/pdfs/moramemo.pdf |title=Memorandum for Inspector General, Department of the Navy.

In response, on 15 January 2003, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] suspended the approved interrogation tactics at Guantánamo until a new set of guidelines could be produced by a working group headed by General Counsel of the Air Force [[Mary L.

General Counsel Mora led a faction of the Working Group in arguing against these standards, and argued the issues with Yoo in person. The working group's final report, was signed and delivered to Guantánamo without the knowledge of Mora and the others who had opposed its content. Nonetheless, Mora has maintained that detainee treatment has been consistent with the law since 15 January 2003 suspension of previously approved interrogation tactics.<ref name="Torture">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60149-2004Dec12.html |title=Tribunals Didn't Rely on Torture |date=13 December 2004 |page=A20 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

<blockquote>The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of "a few bad apples" acting on their own.

After being ordered to do so by U.S. District Judge [[Jed S.

French judge Jean-Claude Kross, on 27 September 2006, postponed a verdict in the trial of six former Guantánamo Bay detainees accused of attending combat training at an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan, saying the court needs more information on French intelligence missions to Guantánamo. Defense lawyers for the six men, all French nationals, accuse the French government of colluding with U.S. authorities over their detentions; they say the government seeks to use inadmissible evidence, as it was obtained through [[secret service]] interviews with the detainees without their lawyers present. Kross scheduled new hearings for 2 May 2007, calling the former head of counterterrorism at the French [[Direction de la surveillance du territoire]] intelligence agency to testify.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/09/france-judge-postpones-terrorism.php |publisher=Jurist |title=France judge postpones terrorism verdict for former Guantanamo detainees |date=28 September 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017152056/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/09/france-judge-postpones-terrorism.php |archivedate=17 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 21 October 2008, [[United States district court]] Judge [[Richard J.

===Access to counsel===
In the summer of 2012, the government instituted a new protocol for civilian attorneys representing Guantanamo prisoners. It required lawyers to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, in which they agreed to certain restrictions, in order to continue to see their clients.<ref name="CSM20120906">{{cite news|last=Richey|first=Warren|title=Guantánamo: Judge rejects US bid to limit lawyers' access to detainees|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2012/0906/Guantanamo-Judge-rejects-US-bid-to-limit-lawyers-access-to-detainees|accessdate=30 September 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=6 September 2012}}</ref> A federal court order had governed lawyers' access to their detainee clients and classified information related to their capture and confinement. Government lawyers sought court approval to replace the court's protective order with the MOU, to enable military officials to establish and enforce their own rules about when and how detainees could have access to legal counsel.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Under the rules of the MOU, lawyers' access was restricted for those detainees who no longer have legal challenges pending. The new government rules tightened access to classified information and gave the commander of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo complete discretion over lawyers' access to the detainees, including visits to the base and letters. The Justice Department took the position that Guantanamo Bay detainees whose legal challenges have been dismissed do not need the same level of access to counsel as detainees who are still fighting in court.<ref name="CSM20120906" />

On 6 September 2012, U.S. District Chief Judge [[Royce C. Lamberth]] rejected the government's arguments. Writing that the government was confusing "the roles of the jailer and the judiciary," Judge Lamberth rejected the military's assertion that it could veto meetings between lawyers and detainees.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=In+re+Guantanamo+Bay+Detainee+Continued+Access+to+Counsel&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&case=17758880111574341373&scilh=0 ''In re Guantanamo Bay Detainees Continued Access to Counsel''], 892 F.

===International law===
In April 2004, Cuban diplomats tabled a United Nations resolution calling for a UN investigation of Guantánamo Bay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200404/s1091279.htm |title=Castro blasts Guantanamo 'concentration camp' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618042353/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200404/s1091279.htm |archivedate=18 June 2008}}</ref>

In May 2007, Martin Scheinin, a United Nations rapporteur on rights in countering terrorism, released a preliminary report for the United Nations Human Rights Council. The report stated the United States violated international law, particularly the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], that the Bush Administration could not try such prisoners as enemy combatants in a military tribunal and could not deny them access to the evidence used against them.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34519-2004Nov8.html| title=Judge Says Detainees' Trials Are Unlawful| first=Carol D.| last=Leonnig |authorlink=Carol D.

Prisoners have been labeled "illegal" or "[[unlawful enemy combatant]]s," but several observers such as the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] maintain that the United States has not held the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal|Article 5 tribunals]] required by the Geneva Conventions.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://hrw.org/press/2002/01/us012802-ltr.htm| title=U.S. Officials Misstate Geneva Convention Requirements| date=28 January 2002| publisher=Human Rights News| accessdate = 17 March 2006}}</ref> The International Committee of the Red Cross has stated that, "Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, [or] a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. There is no intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can fall outside the law." Thus, if the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war, this would still grant them the rights of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as opposed to the more common Third Geneva Convention, which deals exclusively with prisoners of war. A U.S. court has rejected this argument, as it applies to detainees from al Qaeda.<ref name="Guantanamo1"/> [[Henry T. King]], Jr., a prosecutor for the [[Nuremberg Trials]], has argued that the type of tribunals at Guantánamo Bay "violates the [[Nuremberg principles]]" and that they are against "the spirit of the Geneva Conventions of 1949."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN6B38479920070611 | title=Nuremberg prosecutor says Guantanamo trials unfair | date=11 June 2007 | work=Reuters}}</ref>

Some have argued in favor of a [[summary execution]] of all unlawful combatants, using ''[[Ex parte Quirin]]'' as the precedent, a case during [[World War II]] that upheld the use of military tribunals for eight German [[saboteurs]] caught on U.S. soil while wearing civilian clothes. The Germans were deemed to be unlawful combatants and thus not entitled to POW status. Six of the eight were executed as spies in the [[electric chair]] on the request of the U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The validity of this case, as basis for denying prisoners in the War on Terrorism protection by the Geneva Conventions, has been disputed.<ref>{{Cite journal| journal=The American Prospect| url=http://prospect.org/article/war-and-constitution| title=War and the Constitution| first=George P.| last=Fletcher| date=1 January 2002| volume=13| issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/18471leg20040623.html |title=Revised ACLU Interested Person's Memo Urging Congress to Reject Power to Detain Suspected Terrorists Indefinitely Without Charge, Trial or a Right to Counsel |date=23 June 2004 |first=Timothy H. |last=Edgar |publisher=ACLU |accessdate=17 March 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316130943/http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/18471leg20040623.html |archivedate=16 March 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|journal=International Association of Prosecutors, 8th Annual Conference |date=10–14 August 2003 |title=TERRORISM AND THE RULE OF LAW |first=Nicholas |last=Cowdery |url=http://www.odpp.nsw.gov.au/speeches/IAP%202003%20-%20Terrorism%20and%20the%20Rule%20of%20Law.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410151737/http://www.odpp.nsw.gov.au/speeches/IAP%202003%20-%20Terrorism%20and%20the%20Rule%20of%20Law.htm |archivedate=10 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A report by the [[American Bar Association]] commenting on this case, states that the Quirin case "... does not stand for the proposition that detainees may be held incommunicado and denied access to counsel." The report notes that the Quirin defendants could seek review and were represented by counsel.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/aba/abatskforce103rpt.pdf| publisher=Findlaw.com| title=American Bar Association Task Force on Treatment of Enemy Combatants Criminal Justice Section, Section of Individual Rights And Responsibilities – Report to the House of Delegates| accessdate = 17 March 2006}}</ref>

A report published in April 2011 in the [[PLoS Medicine]] journal looked at the cases of nine individuals for evidence of torture and ill treatment and documentation by medical personnel at the base by reviewing medical records and relevant legal case files (client affidavits, attorney–client notes and summaries, and legal affidavits of medical experts). The findings in these nine cases from the base indicate that medical doctors and mental health personnel assigned to the DoD neglected and/or concealed medical evidence of intentional harm, and the detainees complained of "abusive interrogation methods that are consistent with torture as defined by the [[UN Convention Against Torture]] as well as the more restrictive US definition of torture that was operational at the time".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Neglect of Medical Evidence of Torture in Guantánamo Bay: A Case Series |journal=PLOS Medicine |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=e1001027 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001027 |pmid=21559073 |pmc=3084605 |year=2011 |last1=Iacopino |first1=Vincent |last2=Xenakis |first2=Stephen N. }}</ref>

The group [[Physicians for Human Rights]] has claimed that health professionals were active participants in the development and implementation of the interrogation sessions, and monitored prisoners to determine the effectiveness of the methods used, a possible violation of the Nuremberg Code, which bans human experimentation on prisoners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/02/cia-usa| author=Ed Pilkington| title=CIA doctors face human experimentation claims| work=The Guardian| date=2 September 2009| location=London}}</ref>

===Lease agreement for Guantanamo===
The base, which is considered legally to be leased by the Cuban government to the American navy, is on territory that is recognized by both governments to be sovereign Cuban territory. Guantanamo Bay was leased by Cuba to the American government through the "Agreement Between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval stations", signed by the President of Cuba and the President of the United States on 23 February 1903.  The post-1959 Cuban government has repudiated the agreement on the grounds that it was forced upon them by the United States and therefore was a not valid legal agreement.

The lease agreement from 1903 says in article 2:

{{Block quote|The grant of the foregoing Article shall include the right to use and occupy the waters adjacent to said areas of land and water, and to improve and deepen the entrances thereto and the anchorages therein, and generally to do any and all things necessary to fit the premises for use as coaling or naval stations only, and for no other purpose.|Agreement Between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval stations<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/dip_cuba002.asp Agreement Between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval stations; 23 February 1903].

==Guantanamo military commission==

The [[American Bar Association]] announced that: "In response to the unprecedented [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11]], on 13 November 2001, the President announced that certain [[Alien (law)|non-citizens]] [of the US] would be subject to detention and trial by military authorities. The order provides that non-citizens whom the government deems to be, or to have been, members of the al Qaida organization or to have engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit acts of international terrorism that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States or its citizens, or to have knowingly harbored such individuals, are subject to detention by military authorities and trial before a military commission."<ref name=AmericanBarMilComm>

On 28 and 29 September 2006, the U.S. [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], respectively, passed the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], a controversial bill that allows the President to designate certain people with the status of "[[unlawful enemy combatant]]s" thus making them subject to military commissions, where they have fewer [[civil rights]] than in regular trials.

==Release of prisoners==
{{See also|Timeline of the release and transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees}}
Two hundred detainees were released in 2004 before any [[Combatant Status Review Tribunals]] were held, including the [[Tipton Three]], all British citizens.

On 27 July 2004, four French detainees were repatriated and remanded in custody by the French intelligence agency [[Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3928767.stm|title=Guantanamo inmates back in France|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427120709/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3928767.stm|archive-date=27 April 2016|website=BBC News|date=27 July 2004}}</ref> The remaining three French detainees were released in March 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4327841.stm|title=Last Guantanamo Frenchmen go home|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427135445/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4327841.stm|archive-date=27 April 2016|date=8 March 2005|website=BBC News}}</ref>

On 4 August 2004, the Tipton Three, ex-detainees who had been returned to the UK in March of that year (and freed by the British authorities within 24 hours of their return) filed a report in the US claiming persistent severe abuse at the camp, of themselves and others.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Afghanistan to Guantánamo Bay – the story of three British detainees|first1=Tania|last1=Branigan|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|date=4 August 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1275478,00.html|location=London|accessdate=4 May 2010|work=The Guardian}}</ref> They claimed that false confessions were extracted from them under duress, in conditions that amounted to torture. They alleged that conditions deteriorated after Major General [[Geoffrey D. Miller]] took charge of the camp, including increased periods of [[solitary confinement]] for the detainees. They claimed that the abuse took place with the knowledge of the intelligence forces. Their claims are currently being investigated by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]. At the time, five British residents remained as detainees: [[Bisher Amin Khalil Al-Rawi]], [[Jamil al Banna]], [[Shaker Aamer|Shaker Abdur-Raheem Aamer]], [[Jamal Abdullah]] and [[Omar Deghayes]].<ref>{{cite web| title= Moazzam Begg Speaks about his experience at Guantanamo| publisher=Indymedia UK | date= 4 April 2005| url=https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/04/308380.html| accessdate = 15 March 2006}}</ref>

===Administrative Review Board===
{{Main|Administrative Review Board}}
The detainees at Guantanamo Bay prison underwent a series of Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) with the purpose of confirming or vacating their statuses as enemy combatants. In these reviews, the prisoners were interviewed thoroughly on the details of their crimes and roles in Taliban and al Qaeda activities, including the extent of their relationship and correspondence with Osama Bin Laden. In these interviews, the detainees also extensively detailed the alleged abuse and neglect that they faced while in detention at Guantanamo Bay Prison.<ref>[https://www.aclu.org/files/csrt_foia/CSRTTranscriptAbuZubaydah_Released6.13.16.pdf]</ref> The events described by these prisoners violated the Geneva Conventions standards of conduct with prisoners of war, yet the conventions were previously claimed to not protect members of the Taliban or al Qaeda militias in correspondence between the department of defense and the assistant attorney general and U.S department of justice in 2002.<ref>[https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB127/02.01.22.pdf]</ref> The full versions of these Combatant Status Reviews were released in 2016 in response to an ACLU lawsuit.<ref>[https://www.aclu.org/csrt-foia]</ref> 

Besides convening [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, the Department of Defense initiated a similar, annual review. Like the CSRTs, the Board did not have a mandate to review whether detainees qualified for POW status under the Geneva Conventions. The Board's mandate was to consider the factors for and against the continued detention of detainees, and make a recommendation either for their retention, release, or transfer to the custody of their country of origin. The first set of annual reviews considered the dossiers of 463 detainees. The first board met between 14 December 2004, and 23 December 2005. The Board recommended the release of 14 detainees, and repatriation of 120 detainees to the custody of their country of origin.

By November 2005, 358 of the then-505 detainees held at Guantanamo Bay had [[Administrative Review Board]] hearings.<ref>Report, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 November 2005</ref> Of these, 3% were granted and were awaiting release, 20% were to be transferred, 37% were to be further detained at Guantanamo, and no decision had been made in 40% of the cases.

Also that week, four Uyghur detainees were resettled in [[Bermuda]], where they were released.<ref name="Reuters06-15" /> On 11 June 2009, the US Government negotiated a deal in secret with the Bermudian Premier, Doctor [[Ewart Brown]], to release four Uyghur detainees to Bermuda, an overseas territory of the UK. The detainees were flown into Bermuda under the cover of darkness. The US purposely kept the information of this transfer secret from the UK, which handles all foreign affairs and security issues for Bermuda, as it was feared that the deal would collapse. After the story was leaked by the US media, Premier Brown gave a national address to inform the people of Bermuda. Many Bermuda residents objected, as did the UK Government. It undertook an informal review of the actions; the Bermuda opposition, UBP, made a tabled vote of no confidence in Premier Brown.

In November 2005, a group of experts from the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] called off their visit to Camp Delta, originally scheduled for 6 December, saying that the United States was not allowing them to conduct private interviews with the prisoners. "Since the Americans have not accepted the minimum requirements for such a visit, we must cancel [it]," [[Manfred Nowak]], the UN envoy in charge of investigating torture allegations around the world, told AFP. The group, nevertheless, stated its intention to write a report on conditions at the prison based on eyewitness accounts from released detainees, meetings with lawyers and information from human rights groups.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/179382/1/.html| date=18 November 2005| title=UN experts cancel Guantanamo visit, citing U.S. block| accessdate = 15 March 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/02/16/un.guantanamo/index.html| title= Annan: Shut Guantanamo prison camp|date=17 February 2006| website=CNN| accessdate = 15 March 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308125209/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/02/16/un.guantanamo/index.html| archivedate = 8 March 2008| url-status=dead}}</ref>

In February 2006, the UN group released its report, which called on the U.S. either to try or release all suspected terrorists. The report, issued by the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]], has the subtitle ''Situation of detainees at Guantánamo Bay.''

European leaders have also voiced their opposition to the [[internment]] center. On 13 January 2006, [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] criticized the U.S. detention of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay: "An institution like Guantánamo, in its present form, cannot and must not exist in the long term.

There has also been significant criticism from Arab leaders: on 6 May 2005, prominent Kuwaiti parliamentarian [[Waleed Al Tabtabaie]] demanded that U.S. President Bush "uncover what is going on inside Guantánamo," allow family visits to the hundreds of Muslim detainees there, and allow an independent investigation of detention conditions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arabs say condemnation by Bush too little, too late|url=https://www.chron.com/news/article/Arabs-say-condemnation-by-Bush-too-little-too-1519869.php|website=Houston Chronicle|agency=Reuters|date=6 May 2004}}</ref>

In May 2006, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] said the camp's existence was "unacceptable" and tarnished the U.S. traditions of liberty and justice.

On 12 December 2013, retired U.S. Marine Major General [[Michael R.

We thought that the detainees would provide a treasure trove of information and intelligence.

I was ordered to construct the first 100 cells at Guantánamo within 96 hours. The first group of 20 prisoners arrived seven days after the order was given. We were told that the prisoners were the "worst of the worst," a common refrain for every set of detainees sent to Guantánamo. The U.S. has held 779 men at the detention facility over the past 12 years. There are currently 162 men there, most of them cleared for transfer, but stuck by politics.

Even in the earliest days of Guantánamo, I became more and more convinced that many of the detainees should never have been sent in the first place. They had little intelligence value, and there was insufficient evidence linking them to war crimes. That remains the case today for many, if not most, of the detainees.<ref>Lehnert, Michael.

The delay of Guantánamo Bay's closing resulted in some controversy among the public. On 12 December 2011, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an op-ed written by retired United States Marine Corps Generals [[Charles C. Krulak]] and [[Joseph P. Hoar]]. The two criticized how a provision of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] would extend a ban on transfers from Guantánamo, "ensuring that this morally and financially expensive symbol of detainee abuse [would] remain open well into the future." Both argued the move would bolster Al Qaeda's recruiting efforts and make it "nearly impossible" to transfer 88 men (of the 171 held there) who had been cleared for release.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/opinion/guantanamo-forever.html|title=Guantánamo Forever?|date=12 December 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 December 2011|first1=Charles C.|last1=Krulak |first2=Joseph P.|last2=Hoar|department=Opinion|url-access=limited}}</ref>

On 31 December, after signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 into law, President Obama voiced his concerns regarding certain provisions of the act including Section 1027, which "renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year 2012 to transfer Guantánamo detainees into the United States for any purpose." He continued to state opposition to the provision, which he argued "intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantánamo detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests. [...] Moreover, this intrusion would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional [[separation of powers]] principles."<ref name="Woolley 20111231" /> Obama closed his concerns by stating his administration would "aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as chief executive and Commander in Chief, will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future, and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office."<ref name="Woolley 20111231">{{cite news|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=98513&st=&st1=|title=Barack Obama: Statement on Signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012|publisher=John T.

In early July 2012, reports surfaced saying Guantánamo Bay was getting an estimated $40&nbsp;million communications upgrade because the outdated satellite communications system was overburdened with the military court hearing the cases of war-on-terrorism suspects, as well as by the ongoing detention operations.  These reports therefore indicated the US military was preparing for long-term operations at Guantánamo,<ref>{{cite news|last=Mount|first=Mike|title=U.S. base housing terror suspects to get $40&nbsp;million upgrade|url=http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/05/u-s-base-housing-terror-suspects-to-get-40-million-upgrade/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=5 July 2012}}</ref> but they were denied by Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a spokesman for the Guantánamo military commissions.  He said the communications upgrade project is meant to serve the Guantanamo naval station rather than the detention camp, which Washington still "has plans" to close.{{cn|date=November 2020}} On 3 July 2012, ABC News reported setbacks in Congress, as well as a need to focus on a stagnant economy in the United States, had made the issue of closing the detention camp a lesser priority.  The channel also asked Obama if he planned on ever closing Guantanamo Bay, to which he replied he did.

Some blamed Congress for the delay in closing the detention camp, while others blamed the president. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a statement, "Obviously Congress has taken a number of steps to prevent the closure of the prison at Guantánamo Bay, but the President still believes it's in our national security interest and will keep trying". In the same interview, however, senior ACLU attorney [[Zachary Katznelson]] argued Obama had "enough control and power that he [could have gotten those] men out today if he [had] the political will to do so."<ref>{{cite web|last=Negrin|first=Mike|title=Guantanamo Bay: Still Open, Despite Promises|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/guantanamo-bay-open-promises/story?id=16698768|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=3 July 2012}}</ref>

On 21 September 2012, the US government disclosed the names of 55 of the 86 prisoners cleared for transfer from Guantánamo Bay prison. All of the names publicized were those of prisoners that Obama's inter-agency Guantanamo Bay Review Task Force had approved for release from the prison.  Previously, the government had maintained the names of prisoners cleared could not be made public because it would interfere with diplomatic efforts to repatriate or resettle prisoners in their home country or other countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gosztola|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Gosztola|title=Veil of Secrecy Partially Lifted as US Discloses Names of Guantanamo Prisoners Cleared for Transfer|url=http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2012/09/21/veil-of-secrecy-partially-lifted-as-us-reveals-names-of-guantanamo-prisoners-cleared-for-release/|publisher=dissenter.firedoglake.com|accessdate=22 September 2012|date=21 September 2012}}</ref>

On 20 January 2015, during the [[2015 State of the Union]] address, Obama stated Guantánamo Bay "is not who we are" and that it was "time to close Gitmo".  A little less than a week later, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' published an article by [[Tom Hayden]] arguing Guantánamo Bay would be best closed by returning the base to Cuban sovereignty, arguing it is "where [Guantánamo Bay] belongs historically."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-hayden/how-to-close-guantanamo_b_6549514.html |title=How to Close Guantanamo |last=Hayden |first=Tom |work=HuffPost |date=26 January 2015 |accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>

On 4 November 2015, [[Barack Obama]] stated that he was preparing to unveil a plan to shutter the facility and move some of the terrorism suspects held there to US soil.
