{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Reverse discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] against members of a dominant or majority group, in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Groups may be defined in terms of [[disability]], [[ethnicity]], [[family|family status]], [[gender identity]], [[nationality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[sexual orientation]], or other factors.{{Original research inline|date=October 2020}}

This discrimination may seek to redress [[social inequalities]] under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group. In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face. Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies, as in college admissions or employment, intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reverse Discrimination|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reverse+discrimination |website=dictionary.com}}</ref>

Conceptualizing [[affirmative action]] as reverse discrimination became popular in the early- to mid-1970s, a time period that focused on under-representation and action policies intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world.<ref name="Embrick">{{cite book |last1=Embrick |first1=David G. |editor1-last=Schaefer |editor1-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1 |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-41-292694-2 |pages=12–19 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&q=%22reverse+discrimination%22&pg=PT64 |chapter=Affirmative Action in Education}}</ref>

{{Further|Affirmative action}}

When members of a particular group have been barred from a particular employment, it is said{{By whom|date=August 2020}} that this group has received less than its fair share of employment, in question, and deserves to receive more by way of compensation. Thus, this group is being compensated for past lack of employment or opportunity.{{Clarify|date=August 2020|reason=Does this mean that reverse discrimination is a form of compensation for past discrimination? Should be made more explicit}} Therefore, a group already existing in the workplace will be discriminated against, even if they have never been denied employment previously. An example of this would be an organization's efforts to hire more women in order to meet federal guidelines. However in thus doing, the organization may deny opportunities of equal measures to men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schultz|title=psychology and work today|year=2010|isbn=978-0-205-68358-1|pages=57}}</ref> If the point of reverse discrimination is to compensate a wronged group, it will hardly matter{{According to whom|date=August 2020}} if those who are preferentially hired were not among the original victims of discrimination.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cher|first=George|title=Philosophy & Public Affairs, Vol 4, No.2 Winter: Justifying Reverse Discrimination in Employment|year=1975|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=159–170|jstor=2265161}}</ref>

Philosopher [[James Rachels]] posited that reverse discrimination as a factor in [[affirmative action in the United States]] may disadvantage some Whites, but without it, African Americans would likewise be disadvantaged by pervasive racial discrimination in society.<ref name="Fullinwider">{{cite SEP |last=Fullinwider |first=Robert |title=Affirmative Action |edition=Summer 2018 |url-id=affirmative-action}}</ref> Critics of racial preferences in affirmative action such as [[William Bennett]] and [[Carl Cohen (professor)|Carl Cohen]] have argued that explicitly using race for the purpose of ending racial discrimination is illogical and contrary to the principle of non-discrimination. Conversely, [[Alan H. Goldman]] argued that short-term violations of such a principle could be justified for the sake of equalizing social opportunities in the longer term.{{r|Fullinwider}} Philosopher [[Richard Arneson]] argues that while a program of reverse discrimination favoring non-White candidates over White ones may violate [[equality of opportunity]] in a formal sense, it may more effectively promote {{em|substantive}} equality of opportunity, meaning that those with equal talent and ambition will have the same chances of success regardless of their previous (unequal) opportunities to achieve  the relevant qualifications.<ref name="Arneson">{{cite SEP |last=Arneson |first=Richard  |title=Equality of Opportunity |edition=Summer 2015 |section=2.4 Affirmative Action |url-id=equal-opportunity}}</ref>

It is often argued by majority groups that they are being discriminated against for hiring and advancement because of affirmative-action policies. However, critics{{Who|date=August 2020}} of this argument often cite the "symbolic" significance of a job has to be taken into consideration as well as qualifications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baer|first=Judith|author-link=Judith A.

=== European Union ===
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

In [[European Union law]], reverse discrimination occurs where a Member State's national law provides for worse treatment of its own citizens or domestic products than other EU citizens/goods under EU law. This can happen because of the legal principle of [[subsidiarity]] that EU law is not applicable in situations purely internal to one Member State.<ref name="Ritter">{{cite journal |ssrn=954242 |last1=Ritter |first1=Cyril |title=Purely Internal Situations, Reverse Discrimination, Guimont, Dzodzi and Article 234 |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2006 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.954242}}</ref>

The [[affirmative action]] of the Chinese government has been called into question, especially from the ethnic group of [[Han Chinese]]. Unfair policies on Chinese College entrance exams as well as human rights considered to be favoring the national minority have both been believed to be causing reverse discrimination in the mainland. [[Han chauvinism]] has been becoming more popular in mainland China since the 2000s, the cause of which has been attributed to the discontent towards Chinese affirmative action.<ref name="凭栏观史">《凭栏观史》第34期：中国到底有没有大汉族主义</ref><ref name="皇汉史观：今天我们如何定义中国？">http://news.dwnews.com/china/news/2017-04-26/59812518.html</ref>

=== India ===
In India, among the limited positions for higher education in Government institutions, 50 percent seats are reserved for members of economically disadvantaged castes and classes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/India-s-Education-Minister/47891|title=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=July 16, 2009|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> Reserved category candidates can select a position from the Open 50 percent if he or she has good merit. This results in further reverse discrimination of Open/General/Non Reserved candidates. Further, since there was economic criteria in classifying Reservation, poorer sections of reserved class often remain poor whereas the affluent section (the "creamy layer") reap benefits for successive generations. Also, the poorer sections of Open/General Category become devoid of access to higher education for even slightly low merit on competitive exams. The difference in merit on entrance exams is often very wide between the reserved and unreserved classes.  In [[India]], the term is often used by citizens protesting against [[Reservation in India|reservation and quotas]].<ref>Devanesan Nesiah. ''Discrimination With Reason?

{{Off topic|date=October 2020}}

UK law draws a distinction between Equality of Provision and Equality of Outcome, particularly in respect to disability rights. The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and the [[Equality Act 2010]] make it clear that treating two people identically may not be sufficient to guarantee that they have been treated equally in law if the task, physical environment or service does not offer them equality of outcome. The law provides for disabled people to request the provision of 'reasonable adjustments' to ensure that they are able to access employment, services and the built environment with the same potential as non-disabled people.

=== United States ===

Opponents of [[Affirmative action in the United States]] use the term ''reverse discrimination'' to say that such programs discriminate against [[White Americans]] in favor of [[African Americans]].<ref name="Carlisle">{{cite book |editor1-last=Carlisle |editor1-first= Rodney P. |title= Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and The Right |date=2005 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn=978-1-41-290409-4 |page=1009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6I5DQAAQBAJ&q=%22reverse+discrimination%22}}</ref>

The number of reverse discrimination cases filed with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] doubled in the 1990s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=W.D|title=Reverse Discrimination claims: Growing like kudzu|journal=Maryland Bar Journal|year=2004|pages=48–51}}</ref> and continue to reflect a growing percentage of all discrimination cases {{As of|2003|lc=yes}}.<ref name="Pincus 2003">{{cite book |last=Pincus |first=Fred L. |title=Reverse discrimination: Dismantling the myth |url=https://archive.org/details/reversediscrimin0000pinc |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-1-58-826203-5}}{{page needed |date=August 2017}}</ref>

A study by S. K. Camara & M. P. Orbe collected narratives of individuals describing situations where they were discriminated against based on their majority-group status (cases of reverse discrimination). Many White respondents described discrimination based on their race, a smaller portion reported gender discrimination. A small number of heterosexuals reported experiencing discrimination based on their sexual orientation.<ref name="Sakile 111–134">{{cite journal|last=Sakile K. Camara|first=Mark P.

==== Colleges ====

White college applicants who have felt passed over in favor of less-qualified Black students as a result of affirmative action in college admissions have described such programs as "reverse discrimination". [[Elizabeth Purdy]] argues that this conception of reverse discrimination came close to overturning affirmative action during the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] resurgence of the 1980s and '90s after being granted legitimacy by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'', which ruled that Alan Bakke had been discriminated against by the school's admissions program.<ref name="Purdy">{{cite book |last=Purdy |first=Elizabeth |editor1-last=Carlisle |editor1-first= Rodney P. |title= Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and The Right, Volume 1: The Left |date=2005 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn=978-1-41-290409-4 |page=133 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6I5DQAAQBAJ&q=%22reverse+discrimination%22 |chapter=Desegregation}}</ref>

In 1996, the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] had to defer the use of racial preferences in their college admissions after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] barred the school from considering race in admitting students. The ruling determined that diversity in education could not justify making race-based distinctions. [[Hopwood v. Texas]] was a lawsuit brought by four white applicants to the Texas Law School who were denied admission even though their [[grade point average]]s were greater than minority applications that were accepted. The four white students also had greater Law School Admission Test scores.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robert, Menache|first=Brian H Kleiner|title=New Developments in Reverse Discrimination|journal=Equal Opportunities International|year=1999|volume=18|issue=2/3/4|page=41|doi=10.1108/02610159910785790}}</ref>

However, in [[Grutter v. Bollinger]] (2003), the Supreme Court allowed the University of Michigan Law School to continue to consider race among other relevant diversity factors. The decision was the only legally challenged affirmative-action policy to survive the courts. However, this ruling has led to confusion among universities and lower courts alike regarding the status of affirmative action across the nation.

In 2012, [[Fisher v. University of Texas (2013)|Fisher v. University of Texas]] reached the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6161900559426345780&q=Abigail+Fisher&hl=en&as_sdt=2,7&as_ylo=2012|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com|accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>  The University of Texas allegedly used race as a factor in denying Abigail Fisher's application, denying her a fair review. The lower courts upheld the program, but the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the lower courts and sent the case back to the Fifth Circuit for review.

==== Complaints ====
According to a draft report prepared in 1995 for the [[United States Department of Labor]] by [[Alfred W. Blumrosen]], affirmative-action policies had caused  few claims of reverse discrimination by whites.  The report stated there were "at most" 100 reverse-discrimination cases among "at least" 3,000 discrimination opinions by Federal district and appeals courts from 1990 to 1994.  The report indicated{{Clarify|date=July 2020}} that a high proportion of the claims lacked merit.  In Blumrosen's report, national surveys showed only a few{{vague|date=July 2020}} whites had experienced reverse discrimination, and 5 to 12 percent of whites believed that they had been denied a job or promotion because of it.  Blumrosen also said that the reports filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission offer additional evidence that reverse discrimination was rare: 2% of cases were of white men charging, sexual, racial or national origin discrimination and 1.8% were of white women charging racial discrimination.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blumrosen|first=Alfred|title=Draft Report on Reverse Discrimination Commissioned by Labor Department|year=1995|publisher=Daily Labor Report}}</ref>

Newer reports by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have found that less than{{vague|date=July 2020}} 10% of race-related complaints were filed by whites, 18% of gender-related complaints and 4% of the court cases were filed by men.  When national samples of whites were asked if they personally have experienced the loss of job, promotion, or college admission because of their race, 2%-13% say yes.<ref name="Pincus 2008">{{cite book |last=Pincus |first=Fred L. |chapter=Reverse discrimination |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=Thousands Oaks, California |isbn=978-1-41-292694-2 |editor=Schaefer, Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of race, ethnicity, and society, Volume 1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&q=%22reverse%20discrimination%22 |pages=1159–1161}}</ref>
