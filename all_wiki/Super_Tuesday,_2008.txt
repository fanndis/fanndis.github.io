The name "Super Duper Tuesday" is a reference to earlier [[Super Tuesday]]s, the dates on which the largest number of presidential primaries took place.

In 2004, the equivalent cohort of primaries, on February 3, 2004, was called "[[Mini-Tuesday]]"—only seven states held their primaries on that date.

On June 3, 2007, the name "[[Tsunami]] Tuesday"—conveying the potential of the large number of simultaneous primaries to completely change the political landscape—was mentioned{{by whom|date=March 2016}} on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' during a round-table discussion with presidential campaign strategists [[James Carville]], [[Bob Shrum]], [[Mary Matalin]], and [[Mike Murphy (political consultant)|Mike Murphy]].

Super Tuesday in 2008 occurred during [[Mardi Gras]] and on the day of the [[New York Giants]] Super Bowl victory parade. Voting was hampered in several states by a [[2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak|major tornado outbreak]] that killed 57 people, and competed with the primaries for the news. (Due to such influence, the outbreak was named{{by whom|date=March 2016}} after the primaries.)<ref>{{cite news|author= Saeed Ahmed|author2= Mark Bixler; Ed Payne; Mark Preston |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/02/05/tornado.bad.weather/index.html |title= Severe weather kills 23 in Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee |publisher= CNN |date= February 6, 2008 |access-date= 2008-11-23}}</ref>

In an attempt to keep states from moving their primary or caucus elections even earlier, the [[Democratic National Committee]] and [[Republican National Committee]] established penalties for states holding elections earlier than February 5, 2008.<ref name="MSSSPIRbg" /> As a result, the Democratic National Committee controversially stripped the states of [[Michigan Democratic primary, 2008|Michigan]] and [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Florida]] of all pledged convention delegates.<ref>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Martelle |title=Rancor runs deep among Michigan Democrats |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-midems15jan15,0,1291256.story?coll=la-politics-campaign |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-01-15 |access-date=2008-01-15 }}</ref> The Republican National Committee has reduced by half the number of convention delegates from five states: Wyoming, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida, and Michigan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mead |last=Gruver |title= Republicans stripped of delegates want them back |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2008/01/13/republicans_stripped_of_delegates_want_them_back/ |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2008-01-13 |access-date=2008-01-15 }}</ref>

===Response===
Advocates for earlier elections point out that voters could have fewer candidates to select from with a later contest, because candidates who do not fare well in the early primaries and caucuses often drop out. Additionally, presidential campaigns spend large sums of money on [[Campaign advertising|advertising]], hotel rooms, and [[Political campaign staff|campaign staff]], which can be an [[Windfall gain|economic boon]] to states holding earlier elections.<ref name="EPBASWads" />

Critics of the earlier polling date claim it will compress the primary campaign cycle down to a three-week national campaign where only financially well-off candidates can compete. CNN political pundit [[Bill Schneider (journalist)|Bill Schneider]] states:

<blockquote>Those states may move up on the calendar because they want a cut of the action. They want less attention paid to small states like Iowa and New Hampshire and more attention paid to big, diverse states like Florida and California. To run in those big states, you need big money and national name recognition. Obscure contenders need not apply.<ref name="ICABOAcnn" /></blockquote>

Others indicate it will ultimately leave voters out of the process. In a [[BBC News]] interview, [[William F. Galvin]], the [[Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth]] said:

<blockquote>The people who are being left out of this are the voters, especially those who aren't active in party affairs&nbsp;... There won't be enough time for voters to focus on these candidates.<ref name="SJFPPbbc" /></blockquote>

Regardless of the number of states moving their election dates earlier and earlier, New Hampshire vigorously maintained its 'first in the nation' primary status. By New Hampshire state law, the secretary of state has sole discretion to set the date of the primary. [[Bill Gardner (politician)|Bill Gardner]], the [[Secretary of State of New Hampshire]] for the past 31 years, did not rule out any dates for the primary election, and even intimated that "it could be this year 2007."<ref name="SJFPPbbc" /> Ultimately, however, the New Hampshire primary was held on January 8, 2008.

==Delegate allocation==

===Democratic===
{{main|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008}}
Under Democratic Party rules, all delegates were awarded via [[proportional representation]], with a minimum 15% threshold required to receive delegates. A total of 1,664 delegates were pledged by the results of the February 5 votes.

===Republican===
{{main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008}}
The Republican Party did not mandate a proportional representation system for delegate selection, but instead allowed each state to determine its selection process. A total of 1,069 delegates were pledged by the results of the February 5 votes.
