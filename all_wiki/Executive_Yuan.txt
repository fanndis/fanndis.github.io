The '''Executive Yuan''' is the [[executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[government of the Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]).  Its leader is the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], who is appointed by the [[President of the Republic of China]], and no longer requires confirmation by the [[Legislative Yuan]].<ref name="whogov">{{cite web |author1=葉耀元 |title=總統制、半總統制、內閣制？台灣到底需要什麼樣的憲政框架？ |url=https://whogovernstw.org/2015/02/21/yaoyuanyeh2/ |website=菜市場政治學 |access-date=11 June 2020 |date=21 February 2015}}</ref>   The Premier may be removed by a vote of no-confidence by a majority of the [[Legislative Yuan]], after which the President may either remove the Premier or dissolve the Legislative Yuan and initiate a new election for legislators.<ref>{{cite constitution

== Organization and structure ==
[[File:Executive Yuan 20050703.jpg|thumb|Executive Yuan]]

The Executive Yuan is headed by the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] (or President of the Executive Yuan) and includes its Vice Premier, twelve cabinet ministers, various chairpersons of commissions, and five to nine ministers without portfolio. The Vice Premier, ministers and chairpersons are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of China]] on the recommendation of the Premier.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url = https://www.ey.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=95097CAF31185CC1 |title = Executive Yuan, R.O.C.)-Structure & Functions |website = Ey.gov.tw |access-date=2014-05-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429115151/https://www.ey.gov.tw/EN/cp.aspx?n=95097CAF31185CC1 |archive-date=2014-04-29 }}</ref>

Its formation, as one of five branches ("Yuans") of the government, stemmed from the [[Three Principles of the People]], the constitutional theory of [[Sun Yat-sen]], but was adjusted constitutionally over the years to adapt to the situation in the ROC by changes in the laws and the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]].

== Executive Yuan Council ==
The Executive Yuan Council, commonly referred to as "The Cabinet" ({{lang|zh-hant|內閣}}), is the chief policymaking organ of the ROC government.  It consists of the premier, who presides over its meetings, the vice premier, ministers without portfolio, the heads of the ministries, and the heads of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.  The secretary-general and the deputy secretary-general of the Executive Yuan also attend, as well as heads of other Executive Yuan organizations by invitation, but they have no vote. Article 58 of the Constitution empowers the Executive Yuan Council to evaluate statutory and budgetary bills concerning [[martial law]], [[amnesty]], [[declaration of war|declarations of war]], conclusion of peace or treaties, and other important affairs before submission to the [[Legislative Yuan]].

== Relationship with the Legislative Yuan ==
The Executive Yuan Council must present the Legislators with an annual policy statement and an administrative report. The Legislative Committee may also summon members of the Executive Yuan Council for questioning.

Whenever there is disagreement between the Legislative Council and Executive Yuan Council, the Legislative Committee may pass a resolution asking the Executive Yuan Council to alter the policy proposal in question. The Executive Yuan may, in turn, ask the Legislators to reconsider. Afterwards, if the Legislative Council upholds the original resolution, the premier must abide by the resolution or resign. The Executive Yuan Council may also present an alternative budgetary bill if the one passed by the Legislative Committee is deemed difficult to execute.

== Access ==
The Executive Yuan building is accessible within walking distance east of [[Taipei Railway Station]] or west of [[Shandao Temple Station]] of the [[Taipei Metro|MRT]].
