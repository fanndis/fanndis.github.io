<!-- 1. Definition and epidemiology -->
'''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19''') is a contagious [[disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in [[Wuhan]], China in December 2019.

<!-- 2. Symptoms -->Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, [[breathing difficulties]], and [[anosmia|loss of smell]] and [[Ageusia|taste]]. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days [[incubation period|after exposure]] to the [[virus]]. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS). ARDS can be precipitated by [[cytokine storm|cytokine storms]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ye Q, Wang B, Mao J |title=The pathogenesis and treatment of the 'Cytokine Storm' in COVID-19 |journal=The Journal of Infection |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=607–613 |date=June 2020 |pmid=32283152 |pmc=7194613 |doi=10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.037}}</ref> [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multi-organ failure]], [[septic shock]], and [[Thrombus|blood clots]]. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed. There is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as [[Long Covid|long COVID]]—for months afterwards. These effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low-grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.<ref name="yelin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yelin D, Wirtheim E, Vetter P, Kalil AC, Bruchfeld J, Runold M, Guaraldi G, Mussini C, Gudiol C, Pujol M, Bandera A, Scudeller L, Paul M, Kaiser L, Leibovici L | display-authors = 6 | title = Long-term consequences of COVID-19: research needs | journal = The Lancet.

<!-- 3. Spread and diagnosis --><!-- DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE SECTION BEGIN/END TAGS, AS IT WILL BREAK THE PANDEMIC ARTICLE --><section begin="Spread" />COVID-19 spreads via a number of means, primarily involving saliva and other bodily fluids and excretions. These fluids can form [[Respiratory droplet|small droplets]] and [[aerosol]]s, which can spread as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. The virus may also spread by direct contact and it is unknown how often it spreads via [[fomite|fomites]] (contaminated surfaces).<ref>{{cite journal | title=COVID-19 transmission—up in the air |journal=[[The Lancet Respiratory Medicine]] |date=October 2020 |doi=10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30514-2 |doi-access=free|last1=The Lancet Respiratory Medicine |volume=8 |issue=12 |page=1159 |pmid=33129420 |pmc=7598535 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Karia|first1=R.|last2=Gupta|first2=I.|last3=Khandait|first3=H.|last4=Yandav|first4=A.|last5=Yandav|first5=A.|date=2020|title=COVID-19 and its Modes of Transmission|journal=SN Compr Clin Med.|volume=2|issue=10|pages=1798–1801|doi=10.1007/s42399-020-00498-4|pmc=7461745|pmid=32904860|doi-access=free | name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> The exact route of transmission is rarely proven conclusively,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions|title=Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions|website=www.who.int}}</ref> but infection mainly happens when people are near each other for long enough, which is known as "close contact".{{efn|Known as "close contact" which is variously defined, including within ~1.8 metres (six feet) by the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and being face to face for a cumulative total of 15 minutes,<ref>{{cite web | author=CDC | title=Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) | website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact | access-date=22 October 2020}}</ref> or either 15 minutes of face to face proximity or sharing an enclosed space for a prolonged period such as two hours by the Australian Health Department.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quarantine for coronavirus (COVID-19) |url=https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/how-to-protect-yourself-and-others-from-coronavirus-covid-19/quarantine-for-coronavirus-covid-19#what-is-a-close-contact |website=Australian Government Department of Health |access-date=25 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="CDCTrans">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html |title=How COVID-19 Spreads |date=18 September 2020 |website=U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919224920/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ftransmission.html |archive-date=19 September 2020 |access-date=20 September 2020}}</ref>|name=|group=}}  It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from [[asymptomatic]] individuals.

<!-- 4. Prevention -->[[Pandemic prevention|Preventive measures]] include [[social distancing]], [[quarantine|quarantining]], ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, [[hand washing]], and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The [[Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic|use of face masks or coverings]] has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.

<!-- 5. Management and history -->There are currently no proven [[COVID-19 vaccine|vaccines]] or [[COVID-19 drug development|specific treatments]] for COVID-19, though several are in development. Management involves the [[Palliative care|treatment of symptoms]], [[Symptomatic treatment|supportive care]], [[isolation (health care)|isolation]], and [[Medical research|experimental measures]].

===Immunopathology===
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]], [[Interleukin 7|IL-7]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], [[granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF), [[CXCL10|interferon-γ inducible protein 10]] (IP-10), [[Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1|monocyte chemoattractant protein{{nbsp}}1]] (MCP-1), [[Macrophage inflammatory protein]] 1-α (MIP-1α), and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|tumour necrosis factor-α]] (TNF-α) indicative of [[cytokine release syndrome]] (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.<ref name="Huang24Jan2020" />

Additionally, people with COVID-19 and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) have classical [[Serum (blood)|serum]] [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]]s of CRS, including elevated [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP), [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), [[D-dimer]], and [[ferritin]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang C, Wu Z, Li JW, Zhao H, Wang GQ |title=The cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of severe COVID-19 and Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist Tocilizumab may be the key to reduce the mortality |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |pages=105954 |date=March 2020 |volume=55 |issue=5 |pmid=32234467 |pmc=7118634 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954}}</ref>

Systemic inflammation results in [[vasodilation]], allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting [[T cell|T-cells]] were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting [[monocyte]]s and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Gómez-Rial | first1=Jose | last2=Rivero-Calle | first2=Irene | last3=Salas | first3=Antonio | last4=Martinón-Torres | first4=Federico | title=Role of Monocytes/Macrophages in Covid-19 Pathogenesis: Implications for Therapy | journal=Infection and Drug Resistance | year=2020 | volume=13 | pages=2485–2493 | pmid=32801787 | doi=10.2147/IDR.S258639 | pmc=7383015 | doi-access=free }}</ref> Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.<ref name="Cureus" />

{{Main|Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic}}
[[Social distancing]] (also known as physical distancing) includes [[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.

The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10. A [[Cochrane (organisation)#World Health Organization|Cochrane]] review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.<ref name="Nussbaumer-Streit 2020" />

Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.

In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[Telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.<ref name="2BQWV">{{cite web|title=Sex and coronavirus (COVID-19)|url=https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/sex-and-coronavirus/|access-date=31 March 2020|website=sexualwellbeing.ie}}</ref><ref name="KQFsZ">{{cite web|title=Sex and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-sex-guidance.pdf|access-date=6 April 2020|website=The Official Website of the City of New York|publisher=NYC Health Department}}</ref>

===Self-isolation===
<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD INSTRUCTIONS HERE, SEE WIKIPEDIA:NOTHOWTO.-->

[[Self-isolation]] at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.

Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.<ref name="lZR3i">{{Cite web|title=COVID-19 Informational Resources for High-Risk Groups {{!}} Keeping Education ACTIVE {{!}} Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease|url=https://www.fightchronicdisease.org/resources/covid-19-informational-resources-high-risk-groups|access-date=31 May 2020|website=fightchronicdisease.org}}</ref> Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.

The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the [[common cold]]. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.<ref name="WHOReport24Feb2020" /> The Italian [[Istituto Superiore di Sanità]] reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being spent hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.<ref name="ISSCharacteristics" /> Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baranovskii|first1=D.

On 30 October 2020 WHO chief [[Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus|Tedros]] has warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects". He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning."  They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and other symptoms. Tedros has underlined that therefore [[herd immunity]] is “morally unconscionable and unfeasible”.<ref>{{cite web|title=Long-term symptoms of COVID-19 'really concerning', says WHO chief |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/10/1076562 |website=news.UN.org |publisher=United Nations |date=30 October 2020 |access-date=15 November 2020}}</ref>

The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is {{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|ratio|editlink=|ref=no}} ({{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|deaths|editlink=|ref=no}}/{{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|confirmed|editlink=|ref=no}}) as of {{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|date|editlink=|ref=no}}.{{Cases in the COVID-19 pandemic|ref=yes}} The number varies by region.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lazzerini M, Putoto G |title=COVID-19 in Italy: momentous decisions and many uncertainties |journal=The Lancet.

Other measures include the [[case fatality rate]] (CFR), which reflects the percentage of ''diagnosed'' individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of ''infected'' individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ourworldindata.org/covid-mortality-risk |title=What do we know about the risk of dying from COVID-19? |website=Our World in Data |access-date=28 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328192730/https://ourworldindata.org/covid-mortality-risk |archive-date=28 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Infection fatality rate===
[[Infection fatality rate]] or infection fatality ratio (IFR) is distinguished from [[case fatality rate]] (CFR). The CFR for a disease is the proportion of deaths from the disease compared to the total number of people ''diagnosed'' with the disease (within a certain period of time). The IFR, in contrast, is the proportion of deaths among all the ''infected'' individuals. IFR, unlike CFR, attempts to account for all asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections.

In February, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report&nbsp;– 30 |url=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200219-sitrep-30-covid-19.pdf |access-date=3 June 2020 |date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report&nbsp;– 31 |url=https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200220-sitrep-31-covid-19.pdf |access-date=23 April 2020 |date=20 February 2020}}</ref> On 2{{nbsp}}July, The WHO's Chief Scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.<ref name="NYT-20200704dm">{{cite news |last=McNeil Jr. |first=Donald G. |title=The Pandemic's Big Mystery: How Deadly Is the Coronavirus? – Even with more than 500,000 dead worldwide, scientists are struggling to learn how often the virus kills.

Transferring purified and concentrated [[Immunoglobulin therapy|antibodies]] produced by the [[immune system]]s of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of [[Passive immunity|passive immunisation]].<ref name="pmid-32167489">{{cite journal |vauthors=Casadevall A, Pirofski LA |title=The convalescent sera option for containing COVID-19 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=130 |issue=4 |pages=1545–1548 |date=April 2020 |pmid=32167489 |pmc=7108922 |doi=10.1172/JCI138003}}</ref><ref name="pmid-33044747">{{Cite journal|last1=Chai|first1=Khai Li|last2=Valk|first2=Sarah J.|last3=Piechotta|first3=Vanessa|last4=Kimber|first4=Catherine|last5=Monsef|first5=Ina|last6=Doree|first6=Carolyn|last7=Wood|first7=Erica M.|last8=Lamikanra|first8=Abigail A.|last9=Roberts|first9=David J.|last10=McQuilten|first10=Zoe|last11=So-Osman|first11=Cynthia|date=October 2020|title=Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: a living systematic review|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD013600|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD013600.pub3|pmid=33044747 | name-list-style=vanc}}</ref> [[Neutralisation (immunology)|Viral neutralization]] is the anticipated [[mechanism of action]] by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.

The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID-19 is also being studied. This involves the production of [[convalescent serum]], which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to current patients.<ref name="pmid-32167489" /> This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.<ref name="pmid-32167489" /> A Cochrane review in October 2020 found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this treatment in COVID-19, due in large part to the methodology of the clinical trials conducted so far.<ref name="pmid-33044747" /> Specifically, there are no trials yet conducted for which the safety of convalescent serum administration to people with COVID-19 can be determined, and the differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.<ref name="pmid-33044747" />

===Laminoid antibodies===
[[Peru]] announced in April 2020, that it would begin working toward creating a vaccine, with the pharmaceutical company Farvet and [[Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia]] (UPCH) announcing plans to jointly develop a vaccine in [[Chincha Alta|Chincha]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=CORREO|first=NOTICIAS|date=8 April 2020|title=Perú: Coronavirus Perú {{!}} Peruanos desarrollan vacuna contra el coronavirus e {{!}} NOTICIAS CORREO PERÚ|url=https://diariocorreo.pe/peru/coronavirus-peru-peruanos-desarrollan-vacuna-contra-el-coronavirus-en-chincha-ica-covid-19-video-noticia/|access-date=14 August 2020|website=Correo|language=es}}</ref> Peru's Experimental Station for Scientific Research and Genetic Improvement of [[Alpaca]]s belonging to the Inca Group, selected on 5 June 2020 four alpacas for the development of a new vaccine that it had been developing in conjunction with Farvet and UPCH. They also indicated that alpacas have the ability to generate some types of antibodies known as "nanobodies", which are very small and have a greater potential to treat pathogens.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barja|first=Lucia|date=5 June 2020|title=Coronavirus: Científicos comienzan a probar en alpacas una vacuna contra la COVID-19 diseñada en Perú|url=https://rpp.pe/vital/salud/coronavirus-cientificos-comienzan-a-probar-en-alpacas-una-vacuna-contra-la-covid-19-disenada-en-peru-noticia-1271109|access-date=14 August 2020|website=RPP|language=es}}</ref> According to [[Andina (news agency)|Andina]], research from the United States, Belgium, and Chile showed that antibodies from [[Lamini|laminoid]] animals could possibly be formulated into inhaler or injection treatments for those infected with coronaviruses, with Teodosio Huanca of Peru's National Institute of Agricultural Innovation (INIA) National Camelid Program stating that Peruvian [[camelidae]] share the same genetic roots and antibodies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Peruvian alpaca, vicuña and guanaco antibodies could also help defeat COVID-19|url=https://andina.pe/ingles/noticia-peruvian-alpaca-vicuna-and-guanaco-antibodies-could-also-help-defeat-covid19-796352.aspx|access-date=14 August 2020|website=[[Andina (news agency)|Andina]]|language=es}}</ref>

On 7 August, the Peruvian National Institute of Health (INS) announced that it would begin the development of a possible treatment for COVID-19 using "recombinant nanoantibodies" from a [[llama]] named "Tito".<ref name=":52">{{Cite web|last=Zuta Dávila|first=Luis|title=Coronavirus: anticuerpos de alpaca, vicuña y guanaco peruanos también evitarían enfermedad|url=https://andina.pe/ingles/noticia-coronavirus-anticuerpos-alpaca-vicuna-y-guanaco-peruanos-tambien-evitarian-enfermedad-809016.aspx|access-date=14 August 2020|website=[[Andina (news agency)|Andina]]|language=es}}</ref> According to the INIA, Peru holds "the only [[germplasm]] bank of South American camelids in the world, with 1,700 samples of alpacas and 1,200 of llamas".<ref name=":52" />

===BCG vaccine===

Researchers have studied the [[BCG vaccine]] for potential [[Non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific]] protection against COVID-19 after observing that mortality and severity of disease has been lower in developing countries. The WHO cautions that there are many factors that could impact these observations such as testing rate and [[disease burden]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=BCG vaccination induced protection from COVID-19|first1=Prasanta Raghab|last1=Mohapatra|first2=Baijayantimala|last2=Mishra|first3=Bijayini|last3=Behera|date=7 August 2020|journal=The Indian Journal of Tuberculosis|doi=10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.08.004|pmc=7413058}}</ref> In randomised controlled trials BCG has shown non-specific protection against other respiratory infections.<ref name=bcglancet>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31025-4/abstract|title=Considering BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19|first1=Nigel|last1=Curtis|first2=Annie|last2=Sparrow|first3=Tedros A.|last3=Ghebreyesus|first4=Mihai G.|last4=Netea|date=16 May 2020|journal=The Lancet|volume=395|issue=10236|pages=1545–1546|via=www.thelancet.com|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31025-4|pmid=32359402|pmc=7252177}}</ref>

There is currently not enough evidence to support a conclusion that BCG vaccine is effective to protect against COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Role of latent tuberculosis infections in reduced COVID-19 mortality: Evidence from an instrumental variable method analysis|first=Harutaka|last=Takahashi|date=4 November 2020|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=144|pages=110214|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110214|pmid=33254521|pmc=7448767}}</ref> The University of Exeter announced the BRACE trial, a large international trial to study whether BCG vaccination reduces the impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54465733|title=BCG: Can a vaccine from 1921 save lives from Covid-19?|date=11 October 2020|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/research/healthresearch/primarycare/brace/|title=BRACE &#124; College of Medicine and Health &#124; University of Exeter|website=medicine.exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> A similar study was announced in the Netherlands.<ref name=bcglancet/>
