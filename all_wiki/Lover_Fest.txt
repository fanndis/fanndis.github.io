'''Lover Fest''' is the planned sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-lover-festival-tour-marks-a-major-change-for-the-artist-18759836|title=Taylor Swift's 'Lover' Festival Tour Marks A Major Change For The Artist|accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref> by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], in support of her seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019).

==Background and development==
In an interview with [[Ryan Seacrest]] on August 27, 2019, four days after the release of ''Lover'', Swift explained that she was not yet sure of her plans for a tour in support of the album, and stated that she did not want her life to become a constant cycle of releasing an album and immediately touring after release.<ref name="ryan seacrest interview">{{cite web |last1=Marquina |first1=Sierra |title=Taylor Swift Talks Newfound 'Freedom,' 'Lover' Tour Plans and So Much More |url=https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2019-08-27-taylor-swift-talks-newfound-freedom-lover-tour-plans-and-so-much-more/ |website=On Air With Ryan Seacrest |accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref> Swift later hinted in an interview with [[Zane Lowe]] in October that family health obligations prevented her from organizing and embarking on a larger-scale tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/mother-cancer-andrea-lover-tour-2020-glastonbury/|title=Taylor Swift hints mum's health is why she's not doing huge world tour|website=Capital|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> The tour was announced through Swift's social media and website on September 17, 2019. Swift explained on social media that:
