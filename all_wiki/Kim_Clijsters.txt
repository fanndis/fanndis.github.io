'''Kim Antonie Lode Clijsters'''<ref name=uk/> ({{IPA-nl|kɪm ˈklɛistərs|fl|Nl-be kim clijsters.ogg}}; born 8 June 1983) is a Belgian professional [[tennis]] player. Clijsters has been a [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]] in both singles and doubles, having held both rankings simultaneously in 2003. She has won a total of six [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament titles, four in singles and two in doubles.

Clijsters has competed professionally from 1997 in an era in which her primary rivals were compatriot [[Justine Henin]] and 23-time Grand Slam singles champion [[Serena Williams]]. Coming from a country with limited success in men's or women's tennis, Clijsters became the first Belgian player to attain the No. 1 ranking. Together with Henin, she established Belgium as a leading force in women's tennis as the two of them led their country to their first [[Fed Cup]] crown in [[2001 Fed Cup|2001]] and were the top two players in the world in late 2003. Individually, Clijsters has won 41 singles titles and 11 doubles titles on the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) Tour. She was a three-time winner of the [[WTA Tour Championships]]. Between singles and doubles, she has been a champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments, winning the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and the [[Australian Open]] in singles and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[French Open]] in doubles with [[Ai Sugiyama]]. Her success at majors has been highlighted by winning three consecutive appearances at the US Open.

Plagued by injuries and having lost some of her desire to compete, Clijsters initially retired from tennis in 2007 at the age of 23 to get married and have a daughter. She returned to the sport two years later and won her second [[2009 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] title as an unranked player in just her third tournament back. She defended her title [[2010 US Open (tennis)|the following year]] and then won the [[2011 Australian Open|Australian Open]] in 2011 en route to becoming the first mother to be ranked No. 1 by the WTA. Along with [[Margaret Court]], she also holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a mother, with three such titles, and was the first to win one since [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]] in 1980. Clijsters retired again following the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|2012 US Open]]. In 2020, after seven years of retirement from professional tennis, Clijsters began her second comeback at the [[2020 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Tennis Championships]].

Clijsters was born to athletic parents with backgrounds in professional football and gymnastics. She was renowned for her athleticism, which was highlighted by her ability to perform splits on court in the middle of points. She built the offensive side of her game around controlled aggression while also using her exceptional movement to become an elite defensive player. Clijsters was very popular and well-liked as a player, having won the [[WTA Awards#Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award|Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award]] eight times. She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 2017.

==Early life and background==
Clijsters was born on 8 June 1983 in [[Bilzen]], a small town in northeastern Belgium. She grew up with her younger sister [[Elke Clijsters|Elke]] in the nearby town of [[Bree, Belgium|Bree]] in the [[Flemish Region|Flemish]] province of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]].<ref name="us-open-hof">{{cite web | last1=Clijsters|first1=Kim| date = 2 September 2017 | url-status=live |title=Clijsters: Tennis made all my dreams come true |url=https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2017-09-02/2017-08-28_clijsters_tennis_made_all_my_dreams_come_true.html |publisher=US Open |accessdate=23 September 2018 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170916084054/https://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2017-09-02/2017-08-28_clijsters_tennis_made_all_my_dreams_come_true.html | archivedate= 16 September 2017}}</ref> Kim is the daughter of [[Lei Clijsters]] and Els Vandecaetsbeek, both of whom were accomplished athletes. Her mother Els was a Belgian national [[artistic gymnastics]] champion. Her father Lei was a professional [[association football|football]] [[Defender (association football)|defender]] who played for a variety of clubs in the top-flight [[Belgian First Division]], including [[KV Mechelen]] with whom he won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1988. He was also a member of the [[Belgium national football team]], tallying 40 caps and competing in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]].<ref name=father-tribute>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/sports/06iht-robweb.19123858.html|title=Farewell to the tranquil captain|last=Hughes|first=Rob|date=6 January 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115184622/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/sports/06iht-robweb.19123858.html| archivedate= 15 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="si-father-tribute">{{cite web |last1=Associated Press | date=4 January 2009| title=Father of Kim Clijsters dies at 52 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/01/04/clijsters.father.dies.ap/index.html |website=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=23 September 2018 |archivedate = 24 January 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124154113/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/01/04/clijsters.father.dies.ap/index.html}}</ref> Clijsters credits her parents for giving her a footballer's legs and a gymnast's flexibility.<ref name=uk>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/festivefundown/sport/player/1317.html |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=13 January 2019 |archivedate=13 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113231922/http://en.espn.co.uk/festivefundown/sport/player/1317.html |url-status=live}}</ref> She also attributes her success to the freedom they gave her when she was a young player, saying, "Without the support I've had from my family, I wouldn't be where I am.

When Clijsters was five years old, her father built a clay tennis court at their home as a gift to his daughter to celebrate him winning the [[Belgian Golden Shoe|1988 ''Gouden Schoen'']], an award given to the player of the year in the Belgian First Division. He had previously announced the idea of the gift as a celebration of the award during a television interview.<ref name=father-tribute/>{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=15}}<ref name=cute-video/> Clijsters began playing tennis earlier that year after attending a lesson with her cousins and her uncle while her parents were away.<ref name=us-open-hof/> From then on, she became fixated on the sport. She began playing with her sister at the Tennisdel club in [[Genk]] by the time she was seven. Her first coach Bart Van Kerckhoven recalled that she was extremely energetic and never wanted to leave the tennis court, adding that, "If the group before her did some sprints to finish off the session, Kim would join in. Then she put her heart and soul into her own training session, after which she joined the next group for their warm-up exercises."{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=15}}

At the age of nine, Clijsters began working with Benny Vanhoudt in the more distant town of [[Diest]]. Along with her sister, she trained for fifteen hours a week, including five hours of individual instruction, which Vanhoudt said was "an insane amount [of total hours]."{{sfn|van de Winkel|2012|loc=chpt. 1}} She continued to train in Diest until she was twelve. During this time, she also first worked with Carl Maes and [[Wim Fissette]], both of whom would coach Clijsters later in her professional career. When she was thirteen, Maes took over as her primary coach at the Flemish Tennis Association in [[Antwerp]].{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=17}}

==Junior career==
Clijsters had success at both the national and international levels at a very young age. In 1993, she won the 12-and-under division of the Belgian Junior Championships (the Coupe de Borman) in doubles with her future longtime rival [[Justine Henin]]. At the time, Clijsters was ten years old and Henin was eleven.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=15}} A year later, she won the 12-and-under singles event at the same tournament.<ref name="coupe-de-borman">{{cite web |title=Coupe de Borman |url=http://www.tennis-belge.be/Tournois/coupedeborman.php |website=Le site du Tennis Belge |language = fr|accessdate=23 September 2018 |archivedate = 12 August 2018| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180812074224/http://www.tennis-belge.be/Tournois/coupedeborman.php| url-status=live}}</ref> Clijsters continued to play alongside Henin, winning the doubles event at the 14-and-under European Junior Championships as well as the 14-and-under European Junior Team Championships for Belgium, both in 1996 and the latter of which also with [[Leslie Butkiewicz]].{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=15}}<ref>{{cite web |title=European Junior Championships 14 & Under |url=http://www.tenniseurope.org/page/16401/ |publisher=Tennis Europe |accessdate=23 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140336/http://www.tenniseurope.org/page/16401/| archivedate = 12 June 2018 | url-status=live}}</ref> Her first big international junior title came at [[Les Petits As]], a high-level 14-and-under tournament. She defeated future top 25 players [[Iveta Benešová]] and [[Elena Bovina]] in the semifinals and final respectively.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=15}}

Clijsters played two full seasons on the [[ITF Junior Circuit]], the premier junior tour that is run by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF). At the very end of 1997, she partnered with [[Zsófia Gubacsi]] to win her first ITF title in the doubles event at the Grade A [[Orange Bowl (tennis)|Orange Bowl]], one of the highest level junior tournaments.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massu Wins Orange Bowl Tennis |url=https://www.apnews.com/02e2f99e2fd0c077c8a82395a7f41c0b |website=AP News |accessdate=23 September 2018 | archivedate = 23 September 2018 | date = 28 December 1997 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180923075521/https://www.apnews.com/02e2f99e2fd0c077c8a82395a7f41c0b}}</ref> In 1998, Clijsters had her best year on the junior tour, finishing the season at career-high rankings of world No. 11 in singles and world No. 4 in doubles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Final 1998 ITF Junior World Rankings |url=http://www.collegeandjuniortennis.com/itfrnk98.htm |website=College and Junior Tennis |accessdate=23 September 2018 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160813054438/http://www.collegeandjuniortennis.com/itfrnk98.htm | archivedate = 13 August 2016| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="itf-junior-profile">{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters |url=http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?PlayerID=20011723 |publisher=ITF Tennis |accessdate=23 September 2018| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065355/http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?PlayerID=20011723| archivedate = 4 March 2016| url-status=live}}</ref> She won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles, the [[1998 French Open|French Open]] with [[Jelena Dokic]] and the [[1998 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] with [[Eva Dyrberg]].<ref>{{cite web |title=International Junior Championships of France |url=https://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1030000346 |publisher=ITF Tennis |accessdate=23 September 2018 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171115234050/https://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1030000346| archivedate = 15 November 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=1998-us-open-juniors/> She defeated her French Open partner Dokic in the US Open doubles final.<ref name=1998-us-open-juniors>{{cite web |title=1998 US Open Junior Championships |url=https://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1030000941 |publisher=ITF Tennis |accessdate=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108100754/https://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1030000941 |archive-date=8 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> In singles, she made it to the [[1998 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] final, but finished runner-up to [[Katarina Srebotnik]].{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=17}}

==Professional career==
===1997–99: Maiden WTA title, Newcomer of the Year===
[[File:Steffi Graf and Kim Clijsters (cropped).jpg|thumb|Clijsters (right) with her idol [[Steffi Graf]] in 2009. Graf won their only meeting on the WTA Tour in 1999.|alt=Clijsters walking onto Wimbledon Centre Court with Steffi Graf.]]
As a fourteen year old, Clijsters could only enter professional tournaments through qualifying since the WTA Tour's policy did not allow players her age to receive main draw [[wild card (sports)|wild cards]]. In August 1997, Clijsters qualified for her first main draw at her second career tournament on the lower-level [[ITF Women's Circuit]], which was held in the Belgian coastal town of [[Koksijde]]. She won seven matches in total, including five in qualifying, to reach the quarterfinals. Clijsters did not enter another professional tournament until after her runner-up finish at the Wimbledon girls' singles event the following summer. Playing in Brussels in July 1998, she won both the singles and doubles events for her first career professional titles. Clijsters continued to excel at the ITF level, winning four more titles within the next year, two in both singles and doubles.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=17}}<ref name="itf-profile">{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters |url=https://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=20011723 |publisher=ITF Tennis |accessdate=27 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108200707/https://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=20011723 |archive-date=8 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Clijsters began 1999 with a WTA singles ranking of No. 420 in the world.<ref name="wta-rankings">{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters Rankings History |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/30458/title/Kim-CLIJSTERS#ranking |publisher=WTA Tennis |accessdate=27 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817045743/http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/30458/title/Kim-CLIJSTERS#ranking |archive-date=17 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Around this time, Belgian women's tennis was beginning to flourish. Both [[Dominique Van Roost]] and [[Sabine Appelmans]] had been ranked in the top 20 within the previous two years, complementing the rise of Clijsters and Henin on the junior tour. This success helped lead to the revival of the only WTA tournament in Belgium, which was relaunched as the [[1999 Flanders Women's Open|Flanders Women's Open]] in Antwerp after not being held in six years. Clijsters made her WTA debut at the tournament in May, entering the main draw as a [[lucky loser]] after losing in the final round of qualifying. She won her first career tour-level match against [[Miho Saeki]] and advanced to the quarterfinals, where she was defeated by top seed [[Sarah Pitkowski]] despite holding match points.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=20}}

One week after Clijsters turned sixteen, she entered [[1999 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] as the youngest player in the top 200. After barely having a high enough ranking to get into the qualifying draw, she ultimately made it to the round of sixteen in her Grand Slam tournament debut. She defeated world No. 10 [[Amanda Coetzer]] in the third round and did not drop a set until losing to [[Steffi Graf]] one round later, her only career match against her childhood idol.<ref name=us-open-hof/><ref name="wimbledon1999">{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/celebration/players/clijsters01.html |title=A Centre Court Celebration  |publisher=Wimbledon |accessdate=24 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518093212/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/celebration/players/clijsters01.html |archivedate=18 May 2009 }}</ref>{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=21}} Clijsters also had a good showing at the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing to the eventual champion [[Serena Williams]] in the third round after squandering a chance to [[serve (tennis)|serve]] for the match.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=21}} Clijsters next played at the [[1999 SEAT Open|Luxembourg Open]] held in the town of [[Kockelscheuer]] just outside the capital. She won the title with relative ease in just her fourth career WTA event, taking affinity for the friendly atmosphere of the smaller tournament and the faster carpet courts. Most notably, she faced off against Van Roost in the final and only conceded four games to the top-ranked Belgian.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=22}} Clijsters also made the singles final in [[WTA Bratislava|Bratislava]] at her next tournament, finishing runner-up to No. 11 [[Amélie Mauresmo]]. Nonetheless, she was able to win the doubles event with compatriot [[Laurence Courtois]] as her partner.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=25}} At the end of the season, Clijsters was named [[WTA Newcomer of the Year]], having risen to No. 47 in the world.<ref name="tennis-hof">{{cite web |last=Drucker |first=Joel |title=Kim Clijsters |url=https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/kim-clijsters |publisher=International Tennis Hall of Fame |accessdate=28 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928075336/https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/kim-clijsters |archive-date=28 September 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===2004–05: Extended injury absence, first Grand Slam singles title===
Although Clijsters maintained her form into 2004, her season was ultimately marred by injuries.

With Henin up a break at 4–3 in the third set, the [[Official (tennis)#Chair umpire|chair umpire]] incorrectly overruled a line call on break point that would have leveled the match. Henin ended up winning the game and the match.

===Two-year hiatus===
A few months after Clijsters retired, she married basketball player [[Brian Lynch (basketball)|Brian Lynch]]. She gave birth to a daughter in early 2008, less than two months after her father [[Leo Clijsters]] was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died twelve months later in January 2009. Clijsters said, "The birth of Jada was the best moment of my life, but it also taught me a lesson because we knew that my Dad was terminally ill. I realised that new life had been born, but a few months later another life would disappear. It was a very intense period in our lives."{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=109}}

She added that she was taking a different approach to tennis, saying, "I am looking at this as a second career, not as a comeback as I am now in a situation where not everything revolves around tennis 24 hours a day."<ref name=request>{{cite web |title=Clijsters confirms comeback was inspired by Wimbledon gala day |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/26/tim-henman-kim-clijsters-wimbledon |website=The Guardian |accessdate=16 January 2019| date= 26 March 2009 |archivedate = 7 March 2016 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160307085001/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/26/tim-henman-kim-clijsters-wimbledon}}</ref> Clijsters and Henman won the exhibition doubles, and Clijsters also defeated her idol Graf in singles.

Clijsters was unable to stay healthy in her last year on the WTA Tour. In the first week of the season, she returned to the tour for the [[2012 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]]. After winning her first three matches back, she needed to retire in the semifinals due to hip spasms, a precautionary measure to prepare for the Australian Open.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McRae |first1=Donald |title=Kim Clijsters: 'Me and Dad had this thing about the number one' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/09/kim-clijsters-australian-open |website=The Guardian |accessdate=26 January 2019 | date = 9 January 2012 | archivedate = 17 October 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171017150307/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/09/kim-clijsters-australian-open}}</ref> As the defending champion at the year's first Grand Slam event, Clijsters made it to the semifinals.

===2020: Second comeback===
After more than seven years of retirement, Clijsters returned to professional tennis at the [[2020 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai Tennis Championships]] in February as a wildcard, losing to Australian Open runner-up [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] in the opening round. Clijsters reflected positively on her performance and was widely praised for her level of play.

She next entered the [[2020 Monterrey Open - Singles|Monterrey Open]] as a wildcard, played top-15 player [[Johanna Konta]], and lost in two close sets.

No tournaments were played due to the COVID-19 pandemic from March to July. Clijsters received wildcards at inaugural [[2020 Top Seed Open|Top Seed Open]] both in singles and doubles. In the latter draw, she was set to play alongside [[Sabine Lisicki]], whom she partnered during [[2020 World TeamTennis season|World TeamTennis]] matches, but withdrew from both disciplines.

Clijsters' next scheduled tournaments are the [[2020 Western & Southern Open – Women's Singles|Cincinnati Open]] and [[2020 US Open - Women's Singles|US Open]], which she will play as a wildcard. At the US Open, she also received a wildcard into the doubles draw with American [[Hailey Baptiste]].

==National representation==
===Fed Cup===
Clijsters made her [[Fed Cup]] debut for [[Belgium Fed Cup team|Belgium]] in [[2000 Fed Cup|2000]] at the age of 16. The top-tier [[2000 Fed Cup World Group|World Group]] that year consisted of 13 teams, 12 of which were divided into three round robin groups. The winners of the round robin groups in April would compete with the defending champion [[United States Fed Cup team|United States team]] in a knockout format for the title in November. Belgium was placed in a group with [[Australia Fed Cup team|Australia]], [[France Fed Cup team|France]], and [[Russia Fed Cup team|Russia]]. Each tie was contested over one day as a best-of-three rubbers, two in singles and the last in doubles. Clijsters only played singles, while Els Callens and Laurence Courtois played all three doubles matches. Although Clijsters narrowly lost her debut to Jelena Dokic of Australia by a score of 9–7 in the third set, her teammates were able to secure the tie. She won her other two matches against [[Nathalie Tauziat]] of France and [[Anna Kournikova]] of Russia, both of which were crucial as Belgium won each of those ties 2–1 as well to win the group. In the semifinals, Henin returned to the team as they faced the United States, the hosts for the final rounds. After Henin lost to [[Monica Seles]], Clijsters needed to defeat Lindsay Davenport to keep Belgium in the tournament. She won the second set, but ultimately lost the match.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fed Cup J-18: 2000 : la première de Kim Clijsters |url=http://www.aftnet.be/Info/Divers/Fed-Cup-J-18-2000-la-premiere-de-Kim-Clijsters |publisher=Association Francophone de Tenis |accessdate=26 January 2019 | language = fr | archivedate = 26 January 2019 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190126222925/http://www.aftnet.be/Info/Divers/Fed-Cup-J-18-2000-la-premiere-de-Kim-Clijsters}}</ref>

The following year, the format for the Fed Cup changed again. The entire competition was played out in November. The three round robin pools were reduced to two and the winners of each pool would contest a final tie for the title. Belgium's team of Clijsters, Henin, Callens, and Courtois from the 2000 final all returned for [[2001 Fed Cup|2001]]. The United States withdrew before the start of the event, citing security concerns a few months after the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]]. With Henin and Clijsters exclusively playing singles, and Callens and Courtois playing doubles, Belgium won all nine of their rubbers against [[Spain Fed Cup team|Spain]], [[Germany Fed Cup team|Germany]], and Australia to advance to the final. Facing Russia, Henin defeated Nadia Petrova and Clijsters defeated Elena Dementieva to secure Belgium's first Fed Cup crown. Courtois commented, "We were never under any pressure, mainly because Kim and Justine were so strong."{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=33}}

While Clijsters and Henin were on the team, Belgium came closest to another Fed Cup triumph in 2006. In this year, the World Group consisted of eight teams in a knockout tournament. The three rounds were spread out over April, July, and September. Each tie was played as a best-of-five rubbers, with four singles followed by one doubles. In the first round against Russia, both Clijsters and Henin made themselves available and won three out of four singles matches to advance.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=95}} Although Henin missed the semifinal, Clijsters and [[Kirsten Flipkens]] were able to lead Belgium to a victory over the United States, who were also short-handed without Lindsay Davenport or the Williams sisters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Italy reaches first Fed Cup final against Belgium |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/sports/16iht-tennis.2213112.html |website=The New York Times|accessdate=26 January 2019 |archivedate=26 January 2019 |date=16 July 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190126231450/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/sports/16iht-tennis.2213112.html}}</ref> However, Clijsters was forced to miss the Fed Cup final due to a wrist injury.<ref name=2006-wrist/> Henin and Flipkens returned for the final, which Belgium hosted against [[Italy Fed Cup team|Italy]]. The tie was decided by the doubles rubber, which Belgium lost after Henin aggravated a knee injury she suffered in one of her singles rubbers and needed to retire down 2–0 in the third set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Italy win Fed Cup for first time |url=https://www.eurosport.com/tennis/fed-cup/2006/italy-win-fed-cup_sto966333/story.shtml |publisher=Eurosport |accessdate=26 January 2019 | archivedate = 26 January 2019 | date = 17 September 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190126232720/https://www.eurosport.com/tennis/fed-cup/2006/italy-win-fed-cup_sto966333/story.shtml}}</ref>

Clijsters also played on the Belgium Fed Cup team from 2002 to 2005, and 2010–11 after she returned from retirement. The team's best results in those years were two semifinal appearances in [[2003 Fed Cup|2003]] and [[2011 Fed Cup|2011]]. Clijsters missed the ties in which Belgium was eliminated in both instances.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Group Semifinal USA 4 : Belgium 1 |url=https://www.fedcup.com/en/draws-results/tie.aspx?id=W-FC-2003-WG-M-USA-BEL-01 |publisher=Fed Cup |accessdate=26 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190126233159/https://www.fedcup.com/en/draws-results/tie.aspx?id=W-FC-2003-WG-M-USA-BEL-01 |archive-date=26 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=World Group Semifinal Belgium 2: Czech Republic 3 |url=https://www.fedcup.com/en/draws-results/tie.aspx?id=W-FC-2011-WG-M-CZE-BEL-01 |publisher=Fed Cup |accessdate=26 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127094444/https://www.fedcup.com/en/draws-results/tie.aspx?id=W-FC-2011-WG-M-CZE-BEL-01 |archive-date=27 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Overall, Clijsters compiled a 24–4 record in Fed Cup, split across 21–3 in singles and 3–1 in doubles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters |url=https://www.fedcup.com/en/players/player.aspx?id=800201740 |publisher=Fed Cup |accessdate=26 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127152537/https://www.fedcup.com/en/players/player.aspx?id=800201740 |archive-date=27 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Hopman Cup===
Clijsters participated in the [[Hopman Cup]] from 2001 to 2004, partnering with [[Olivier Rochus]] in the first instance and [[Xavier Malisse]] thereafter. The tournament consists of eight teams, each with one female and one male player from the same country. The teams are divided into two round robin groups, the winners of which compete for the title. Each tie consists of a women's singles match, a men's singles match, and a mixed doubles match. The Belgian team did not advance to final in any of the years Clijsters participated. Their best performances came in [[2002 Hopman Cup|2002]] and [[2003 Hopman Cup|2003]] when they won two out of three round robin ties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hopman Cup 2001 |url=https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2001-xiii/ |publisher=Hopman Cup |accessdate=27 January 2019 | archivedate = 27 January 2019 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190127000436/https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2001-xiii/}}</ref><ref name=hopman-2002/><ref name=hopman-2003/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hopman Cup 2004 |url=https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2004-xvi/ |publisher=Hopman Cup |accessdate=27 January 2019 | archivedate = 7 December 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171207141431/https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2004-xvi/}}</ref>

In 2002, they finished tied for first with the United States and Italy in a group that also featured France. Belgium's only loss came against the United States, with Clijsters and Malisse losing both singles matches to Monica Seles and [[Jan-Michael Gambill]] respectively. Although the United States lost to Italy, they advanced out of the group on the tiebreak criteria, having won six rubbers compared to the five won by each of Belgium and Italy. Both of the ties Belgium had won were by a score of 2–1, with Clijsters losing to Francesca Schiavone against Italy and the pair losing the mixed doubles against the French team of [[Virginie Razzano]] and [[Arnaud Clément]].<ref name=hopman-2002>{{cite web |title=Hopman Cup 2002 |url=https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2002-xiv/ |publisher=Hopman Cup |accessdate=26 January 2019 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233556/https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2002-xiv/ | archivedate = 5 January 2018}}</ref> The following year, Clijsters and Malisse again lost to the United States, who fielded a different team of Serena Williams and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]].<ref name=hopman-2003>{{cite web |title=Hopman Cup 2003 |url=https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2003-xv/ |publisher=Hopman Cup |accessdate=27 January 2019 | url-status=live | archivedate = 31 December 2018 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181231092837/https://hopmancup.com/the_history/hopman-cup-2003-xv/}}</ref>

===Olympics===
Clijsters did not compete at the Olympics until 2012 near the end of her career. She had been ranked inside the top 40 in the months leading up to the [[Tennis at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] in September, high enough to qualify. However, she did not make herself available for selection for a variety of reasons including issues with her shoulder and the event's timing a week after the US Open.{{sfn|van de Winkel|2012|loc=chpt. 3}} During the [[Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]], she was in the middle of a long absence from competition after undergoing wrist surgery.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=68}} However, she had announced before the year began that she did not intend to compete at the Games because [[Adidas]] was the Belgian team's uniform sponsor and her contract with [[Fila (company)|Fila]] forbade her from wearing clothing from another company.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clijsters out of Olympics in sponsor dispute |url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=1675164 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=26 January 2019 | date = 1 December 2003 | archivedate = 26 October 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171026002040/http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=1675164}}</ref> The [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] took place during her first retirement.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=168}}

Having missed these three previous events, Clijsters's desire to represent [[Belgium at the Olympics]] was one of the underlying reasons why she prolonged her second career until the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Games]] in late July.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=168}} At the time, she did not have good results at her most recent tournaments, withdrawing from the [[2012 UNICEF Open|Rosmalen Grass Court Championships]] in the semifinals in June due to injury and suffering a lopsided loss in the fourth round at Wimbledon.

== Rivalries ==
=== Clijsters vs. Henin ===
{{Main|Clijsters–Henin rivalry}}
Clijsters's biggest rival was Justine Henin, who grew up in the French-speaking part of Belgium. They have been regarded as having little in common except their nationality and their relationship has varied over time.<ref name=belgium-dominating/> Their rivalry began during their junior years when they were both considered promising young talents.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=15}} They started out as friends and won the Belgian Junior Championships as doubles partners at ages ten and eleven respectively, despite only being able to communicate with hand signals due to Clijsters not knowing French and Henin not knowing Flemish.<ref name=guardian-rivalry-with-henin/>{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=15}}{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=95}} However, their friendship began to fade by their mid-teens, leading to disputes that their coaches would try to keep out of the media.<ref name=spat/> Clijsters attributed this deterioration in part to one of Henin's coaches telling Henin, "she had to hate all of her opponents, and only then could she win." She also acknowledged they had very different personalities.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=188}}

Clijsters and Henin typically downplayed any disagreements between them, saying they were overdramatized by the media.<ref name=guardian-rivalry-with-henin/><ref name=belgium-dominating/> When they were professionals, Clijsters accused Henin of routinely faking injuries in their matches to receive medical timeouts. Additionally, Clijsters's father seemed to allege that Henin was taking [[Performance-enhancing substance|performance-enhancing drugs]].<ref name=guardian-rivalry-with-henin/><ref name=belgium-dominating/> Although they had won the Fed Cup together in 2001, they were not interested in playing on the same team in 2004 or 2005. The following year, Clijsters's former coach Carl Maes, who was then the Belgium Fed Cup captain, helped convince Clijsters to reunite with Henin, and together they ultimately reached another final.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=95}}

On the court, they played each other in 25 WTA matches, making each of them the other's most frequent opponent. Although Clijsters won the series 13–12, Henin won seven out of their eleven meetings in finals including all three at Grand Slam tournaments. The latest stage win Clijsters had at a major was in the semifinals of the 2001 French Open. She also defeated Henin en route to her first WTA Tour Championship in 2002. Clijsters dominated their hard court meetings 8–4, while Henin dominated on clay 5–1. Henin also won three of their five grass court encounters. Before both of their first retirements, Henin was leading the series 12–10. However, Clijsters won all three of their meetings during their comebacks to win the series.<ref name="henin-h2h">{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters v.

===Clijsters vs. Williams sisters===
The Williams sisters are frequently recognized for having a transformative impact on tennis through the power in their style of play, their longevity, their marketability, and their success at the Grand Slam tournaments and Olympics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Araton |first1=Harvey |title=Williams Sisters Leave an Impact That's Unmatched |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/sports/tennis/venus-and-serena-williams-have-a-lasting-impact.html |website=The New York Times|accessdate=3 March 2019 |date=27 August 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901161233/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/sports/tennis/venus-and-serena-williams-have-a-lasting-impact.html |archivedate=1 September 2015}}</ref> They were both No. 1 in the world and combined for 15 Grand Slam singles titles while Clijsters was on tour,<ref>{{cite web |title=Serena Williams |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/230234/title/serena-Williams |publisher=WTA Tennis |accessdate=3 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306114435/https://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/230234/title/serena-Williams |archive-date=6 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Venus Williams |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/230220/title/venus-williams-0 |publisher=WTA Tennis |accessdate=3 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306045617/https://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/230220/title/venus-williams-0 |archive-date=6 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> and Serena in particular has been ranked as the greatest women's tennis player of the Open Era.<ref name=one>{{cite web |last1=Tignor |first1=Steve |title=The Greatest Players of the Open Era (W): No. 1, Serena Williams |url=https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/03/50-greatest-players-open-era-w-no-1-serena-williams/72477/ |website=Tennis.com |accessdate=5 June 2020 | date = 2 March 2018 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180703105110/https://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2018/03/50-greatest-players-open-era-w-no-1-serena-williams/72477/ | archivedate = 3 July 2018}}</ref> Clijsters had a record of just 2–7 against Serena, who she called her toughest opponent.<ref name=cute-video>{{cite web |title=Clijsters reflects on career, family |url=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/sports/2012/12/20/open-court-kim-clijsters-grand-slam-champion.cnn |publisher=CNN |accessdate=3 February 2019 |date=20 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065929/https://edition.cnn.com/videos/sports/2012/12/20/open-court-kim-clijsters-grand-slam-champion.cnn |archive-date=4 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=serena-h2h>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters v.

Clijsters's rivalry with Serena included two of the biggest controversies in Serena's career: the 2001 Indian Wells final which led to both Williams sisters' long boycott of the tournament, and the 2009 US Open semifinal which Serena lost on a point penalty.<ref name=boycott/><ref name=match-point-penalty/> Serena defeated Clijsters in their first five meetings. She also won all four of their three-set encounters, including their 1999 US Open third round match and their 2003 Australian Open semifinal where Clijsters had the opportunity to serve for both matches.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=21}}<ref name=serena-comeback-loss/><ref name=serena-h2h/> Although Clijsters only had two wins against Serena, both were considered big upsets and among the most important wins of her career. Her victory in the 2002 WTA Tour Championship final gave Clijsters her biggest title at the time, and her win at the 2009 US Open set up her first Grand Slam singles title as a mother one match later.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=25}}<ref name=popular>{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=Bryan Armen |title=Mental fortitude helped Clijsters stand tall against toughest of era |url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2012/08/30/kim-clijsters-ends-career-us-open |website=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=3 February 2019 |url-status=live |archivedate=3 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203092245/https://www.si.com/tennis/2012/08/30/kim-clijsters-ends-career-us-open |date=30 August 2012}}</ref> Clijsters also defeated Venus in both of those tournaments, making her the only player to record wins over both Williams sisters at the same event twice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macpherson |first1=Alex |title=Taking on Serena and Venus: A history of the Williams double as Halep prepares for showdown |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/taking-serena-and-venus-history-williams-double-halep-prepares-showdown |publisher=WTA Tennis |accessdate=3 February 2019 |date=20 January 2019 |url-status=live |archivedate=3 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203062315/https://www.wtatennis.com/news/taking-serena-and-venus-history-williams-double-halep-prepares-showdown}}</ref>

Venus also initially dominated her rivalry with Clijsters. She won six of their first eight meetings, including two in the late stages of Grand Slam tournaments in the quarterfinals of the 2001 US Open and the semifinals of 2003 Wimbledon. Venus also eliminated Clijsters from the Diamond Games in Belgium twice in 2003 and 2005. Additionally, one of Clijsters's first two wins against Venus was a retirement due to injury at the 2002 WTA Tour Championships. Nonetheless, Clijsters rebounded to win their last five meetings and end her career leading in their head-to-head record. Three of those five victories came at the US Open en route to her three titles at the event in 2005, 2009, and 2010.<ref name=venus-h2h/>

===Other rivals===
In addition to Henin and the Williams sisters, Clijsters also developed rivalries with several other players who had been ranked No. 1 in the world. Two of her most frequent opponents were Lindsay Davenport and Amélie Mauresmo. Clijsters narrowly had winning records against both of them, going 9–8 versus Davenport and 8–7 versus Mauresmo. Davenport had won six of their first seven meetings before Clijsters won eight of their next nine encounters, including all five in 2003. Clijsters defeated Davenport in all four of their meetings in finals, including two at the Indian Wells Open. While Davenport had a 5–1 lead in Grand Slam tournaments, Clijsters won their latest-stage such meeting in the semifinals of the 2003 US Open.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters v.

They met in two WTA Tour Championship finals, which they split. Mauresmo also denied Clijsters chances to win more titles in her home country when she won their finals at both the 2006 and 2007 Diamond Games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters v.

During Clijsters's first retirement, the invitation to participate in the roof test exhibition series at Wimbledon in May 2009 inspired her to return to the WTA Tour.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=109}} In the summer, she joined the [[St. Louis Aces]] of the [[World Team Tennis]] league to help prepare for her comeback.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters concludes WTT Comeback en Route to U.S. Open |url=http://www.tennisgrandstand.com/archives/4488 |website=Tennis Grandstand |accessdate=27 January 2019 | date = 23 July 2009 | archivedate = 26 July 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090726120500/http://www.tennisgrandstand.com/archives/4488}}</ref> She also participated in World Team Tennis the following year as a member of the [[New York Sportimes]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters verslaat Martina Hingis in Amerika |url=https://www.demorgen.be/sport/kim-clijsters-verslaat-martina-hingis-in-amerika-b3c049e2/ |website=De Morgen |accessdate=27 January 2019 |trans-title=Kim Clijsters defeats Martina Hingis in America |date=20 July 2010 |language=Dutch |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128083320/https://www.demorgen.be/sport/kim-clijsters-verslaat-martina-hingis-in-amerika-b3c049e2/ |archive-date=28 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Ten years after the roof test on Centre Court that inspired her comeback, Clijsters returned to Wimbledon to participate in an exhibition series to test the new roof on Court No. 1 in which she played a set of singles against Venus Williams as well as a set of mixed doubles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Social buzz: Venus joins Wimbledon roof party |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/social-buzz-venus-joins-wimbledon-roof-party |publisher=WTA Tennis |accessdate=9 June 2019 |date=20 May 2019 |archivedate=9 June 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609044141/https://www.wtatennis.com/news/social-buzz-venus-joins-wimbledon-roof-party |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 8 July 2010, an exhibition match between Clijsters and Henin was scheduled as an attempt to set a new world record for largest attendance at a tennis match. The contest took place at the [[King Baudouin Stadium]] and was a part of the Best of Belgium national festival. After Henin needed to withdraw from the match due to an elbow injury, Serena Williams was chosen as a replacement. Although Williams injured her foot several days before the match, she chose to play. Clijsters defeated Williams in straight sets. A total of 35,681 people attended the match, breaking the world record of 30,472 set in 1973 by the [[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]] between [[Billie Jean King]] and [[Bobby Riggs]].{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=130}}

Beginning in 2009, the [[Diamond Games]] in Antwerp was reorganized from a WTA tournament into an exhibition series.

==Playing style==
[[File:Kim Clijsters 2011 FO (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|Clijsters serving|alt=Clijsters at the 2011 French Open]]
Clijsters is an all-court player who employed a mixture of offensive and defensive styles of play.<ref name=tennis-hof/> On the defensive side, her movement is regarded as exceptional, enabling her to endure long rallies.<ref name=tennis-hof/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Pells |first1=Eddie |title=Clijsters wins US Open in return from retirement |url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-ten-us-open-women-091309-2009sep13-story.html |website=San Diego Tribune |accessdate=6 February 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206072828/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-ten-us-open-women-091309-2009sep13-story.html |archivedate=6 February 2019}}</ref> Maria Sharapova has commented that, "You just have to expect that she's going to get every ball back."<ref>{{cite web |title=Comeback queen Clijsters triumphs |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4402013.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=6 February 2019 |url-status=live |date=2 April 2005 |archivedate=24 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124110132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4402013.stm}}</ref>
In addition to her movement, Clijsters often extends points with her signature shot, a stretched-out wide [[forehand]], also known as a squash shot. This type of forehand involves hitting the ball with slice to make up for being out of position.{{sfn|Rive|Williams|2018|loc=chpt. 1}} When hitting a squash shot on the run, Clijsters is known for her trademark play of sliding towards the ball and finishing in a split to extend her reach.<ref name="trademark-splits">{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Margie |title=Everyone feels the pain but Kim when she does the splits |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/everyone-feels-the-pain-but-kim-when-she-does-the-splits/news-story/ea45e264b140194f914201533994f1ea |website=The Australian |accessdate=6 February 2019 | url-status=live | date = 7 January 2012}}</ref> While most players can only slide on clay, Clijsters can slide on any surface. Tennis journalist [[Peter Bodo]] has noted, "Grass and hard courts do not 'permit' sliding unless your name is Kim Clijsters."{{sfn|Bodo|2010|loc=chpt. 5}}

While the squash shot is generally regarded as a defensive shot, Clijsters can turn it into an offensive weapon by placing it well enough to have time to recover into a good court position.{{sfn|Rive|Williams|2018|loc=chpt. 1}} Additionally, she possesses the ability to quickly move in from the baseline to the net, setting herself up to hit winners and finish points. She is adept at hitting swinging [[volley (tennis)|volleys]] on both the forehand and backhand sides because of her solid [[groundstroke]] technique.{{sfn|Rive|Williams|2018|loc=chpt. 7}} Clijsters credits her experience in doubles for improving her net game in singles, saying "it made [her] focus on going to the net more" and helped her "know when to come to the net".<ref name=wta-career-reflection/> Her coach Wim Fissette attributed her success at Grand Slam events after her comeback to being more aggressive than she was before her first retirement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ubha |first1=Ravi |title=Clijsters solidifies Slam stranglehold |url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus11/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&id=6070958 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=7 February 2019 |date=29 January 2011 |url-status=live |archivedate=7 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207013658/http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus11/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&id=6070958}}</ref>

== Coaches ==
Clijsters worked with Belgian coaches throughout her career. Her first coach was Bart Van Kerckhoven, who she later invited to her championship match at the 2010 US Open.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=130}} She began her professional career with Carl Maes as her coach. Maes was a student of Benny Vanhoudt who led the Saturday training sessions while Clijsters was also working with Vanhoudt in Diest.{{sfn|van de Winkel|2012|loc=chpt. 1}} He moved to the Flemish Tennis Association Centre in [[Wilrijk]] when Clijsters was 13 years old and invited her to join him. In her first year in Wilrijk, she also worked with Marc De Hous.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=17}} Maes coached Clijsters from 1996 to May 2002, during which she won the Fed Cup and finished as the runner-up at the 2001 French Open.<ref name=spat>{{cite web |last1=Hodgkinson |first1=Mark |title=Clijsters on top of world on the back of long spat |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wtatour/2409401/Clijsters-on-top-of-world-on-the-back-of-long-spat.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=2 February 2019 |date=12 August 2003 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229071137/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wtatour/2409401/Clijsters-on-top-of-world-on-the-back-of-long-spat.html |archivedate=29 February 2016}}</ref>

Shortly before the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|2002 US Open]], she hired De Hous as her new coach and continued to work with him through 2005. Under De Hous, Clijsters won two WTA Tour Championships and two Grand Slam doubles titles. They split a week after she won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 2005 US Open. It was reported that De Hous left because he was unhappy with only receiving a $7,500 bonus from her $2.2 million in US Open prize money; however, he denied this was his only financial compensation and attributed his departure to wanting to "take on new challenges" after all of their success in 2005.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=84}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bodo |first1=Peter |title=Kin goes old school |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2005/09/kin-goes-old-school/45124/ |website=Tennis.com |accessdate=2 February 2019 |url-status=live |date=30 September 2005 |archivedate=2 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202221859/http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2005/09/kin-goes-old-school/45124/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kim Clijsters et son entraîneur se séparent |url=https://www.lalibre.be/sports/tennis/kim-clijsters-et-son-entraineur-se-separent-51b88b8fe4b0de6db9acadbb |website=La Libre |accessdate=2 February 2019 |archivedate=2 February 2019 |url-status=live |language=fr |date=15 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202220209/https://www.lalibre.be/sports/tennis/kim-clijsters-et-son-entraineur-se-separent-51b88b8fe4b0de6db9acadbb |agency=Agence France-Presse}}</ref> Clijsters opted to play without a coach from then until her first retirement.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clijsters says Hewitt can win Open without coach |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-clijsters/clijsters-says-hewitt-can-win-open-without-coach-idUSSP13701120070107 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2 February 2019 |archivedate=2 February 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202225434/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-clijsters/clijsters-says-hewitt-can-win-open-without-coach-idUSSP13701120070107 |date=21 January 2007}}</ref>

When Clijsters began her comeback in 2009, she hired Wim Fissette to be her coach. Fissette, who is three years older, had trained with Clijsters under Vanhoudt when they were both juniors.{{sfn|van de Winkel|2012|loc=chpt. 1}} He had also served as her hitting partner from 2005 until her first retirement.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wim Fissette |url=http://www.wtag.be/en/wim-fissette/ |publisher=Tennis Academy Genk |accessdate=2 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125112116/http://www.wtag.be/en/wim-fissette/ |archivedate=25 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> With Fissette as her coach, Clijsters won three more Grand Slam singles titles and regained the world No. 1 ranking.

Clijsters is conscious about selecting which products to endorse, saying, "If it's not healthy for kids, for example, I'm not going to endorse a product. I don't want to give the wrong impression.

In Clijsters's early career, she was in a long-term relationship with Australian tennis player Lleyton Hewitt. They met at the 2000 Australian Open and were engaged before mutually ending their relationship in late 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hewitt and Clijsters reveal split |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/3345341.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=27 January 2019 | date = 22 October 2004 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110628035621/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/3345341.stm | archivedate = 28 June 2011}}</ref> The pair entered the mixed doubles event at Wimbledon in 2000, losing in the final.{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=25}} Their relationship earned Clijsters the nickname "Aussie Kim" and made her popular among Australian tennis fans even after they separated. When Clijsters won the 2011 Australian Open, she believed she earned her nickname, saying, "Now you can finally call me Aussie Kim".{{sfn|Dewulf|de Jong|2013|p=147}}

Clijsters's childhood tennis idol was Steffi Graf.<ref name=us-open-hof/> She cites her lone WTA Tour match against Graf at Wimbledon in 1999 as being very influential, saying, "It was unbelievable. All I wanted to do was watch her. I wanted to see how she tied her shoelaces, what her ponytail looked like, how she carried her bag. Even though I lost, the impact of that and the motivation it gave me was huge. It was definitely the biggest moment of my career".<ref name="nyt-hof-reflection"/> She also looked up to Monica Seles and viewed both Graf and Seles as role models, drawing inspiration from their level of focus.<ref name=us-open-hof/><ref name="wta-career-reflection">{{cite web |last1=Nguyen |first1=Courtney |title=Kim Clijsters reflects on Hall of Fame career |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/kim-clijsters-reflects-international-tennis-hall-of-fame-career-wta-insider-interview |publisher=WTA Tennis |accessdate=29 January 2019 | date = 22 July 2017 | url-status=live | archivedate = 6 October 2017 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171006025725/http://www.wtatennis.com/news/kim-clijsters-reflects-international-tennis-hall-of-fame-career-wta-insider-interview}}</ref>
