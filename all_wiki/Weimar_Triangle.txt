The '''"Weimar Triangle"''' is, loosely, a grouping of [[Poland]], [[Germany]], and [[France]]. The group is intended to promote co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones.<ref name="eubusiness"/> It exists mostly in the form of [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] between the leaders of these three countries, and of their foreign ministers. The most recent summit of leaders occurred on 7 February 2011.<ref>[http://www.thenews.pl/business/?id=148874 "Leaders in Warsaw can’t cover up EU budget rift"] Thenews.pl, News from Poland. Retrieved 7 February 2011.</ref> Previous meetings took place in [[Poznań]], Poland (1998), [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France (1999), [[Hambach, Germany|Hambach]], Germany (2001) and Nancy, France (2005). The summits of [[Foreign minister|Foreign Ministers]] have been more regular, running at least through 2016.

The most recent leaders' summit was hosted by President [[Bronisław Komorowski]] of Poland and attended by President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (France) and Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] (Germany). Issues of renewing regular Weimar Triangle meetings, the Egyptian situation and improving relations with Russia were discussed (Among other topics). Both Germany and France urged Poland to join the pact for competitiveness.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[File:Weimar Battlegroup.jpg|thumb|200px|Emblem of the [[Weimar Battlegroup]].]]
The Weimar Triangle was established in the German city of [[Weimar]] in 1991, aimed at assisting Poland's emergence from [[Communism|Communist]] rule. Attending the meeting were the Foreign Ministers of each state: [[Roland Dumas]] of France, [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] of Germany, and [[Krzysztof Skubiszewski]] of Poland.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Genscher chose Weimar for the inaugural meeting because it was situated in former East Germany.<ref name="independent.co.uk">Sarah Helm (23 May 1996), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/weimar-triangle-takes-shape-for-power-1348723.html 'Weimar Triangle' takes shape for power] ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref>

At the 1992 meeting of the Weimar Triangle in France, Poland won agreement from Germany and France that it should have special association status at the [[Western European Union]], the European arm of [[NATO]].<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

On 5 July 2011, Poland, France, and Germany signed an agreement in Brussels to put together a unit of 1,700 soldiers, called the [[Weimar Battlegroup]], that will be ready to deploy in crisis zones starting in 2013. The EU business newsletter reports that Poland will command the group, providing the core combat troops and a mechanised battalion, Germany will provide logistical support, and France will contribute medical support. The operational command centre will be based in Mont Valerien, located in a Paris suburb.<ref name="eubusiness">AFP, [http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/military-france.b52  Germany, France and Poland form EU battlegroup] EUbusiness.

Shortly after the [[2014 Crimean status referendum|referendum]] on the status of [[Crimea]] held on 16 March 2014, the chairpersons of the Weimar Triangle parliament's committees on foreign affairs – [[Elisabeth Guigou]] of [[France]], [[Norbert Röttgen]] of [[Germany]] and [[Grzegorz Schetyna]] of [[Poland]] – visited Kyiv to express their countries’ firm support of the territorial integrity and the European integration of [[Ukraine]].<ref>[http://mfa.gov.ua/en/press-center/news/21506-krajini-vejmarsykogo-trikutnika-pidtrimujuty-teritorialynu-cilisnisty-ta-jevrointegracijnij-postup-ukrajini Weimar Triangle countries support the territorial integrity and European integration of Ukraine] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine]], press release of 11 April 2014.</ref> This was the first time that parliamentarians of the Weimar Triangle had ever made a joint trip to a third country.<ref>[https://www.bundestag.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/pm_1404081/263198 Parlamentarier des Weimarer Dreiecks: Röttgen, Guigou und Schetyna in Kiew] [[Bundestag]], press release of 8 April 2014.</ref>

In April 2016, Poland's foreign minister [[Witold Waszczykowski]] told daily newspaper ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' that the Weimar Triangle had lost its relevance for his country.<ref>Matthias Szczerbaniewicz (6 April 2016), [http://www.heute.de/polen-haelt-weimarer-dreieck-mit-deutschland-und-frankreich-fuer-erschoepft-42988830.html "Weimarer Dreieck" beendet: Polens Abkehr vom alten Europa] ''[[ZDF]]''.</ref>

On 28 August 2016, representatives of the three countries vowed to "reinvigorate" the Weimar Triangle. German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] said the group would meet before the end of 2016, and French foreign minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] said France would host a summit in November 2016. The stated reasoning for this reinvigoration were the [[Brexit|decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union]], as well as the ongoing [[European migrant crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shalal|first1=Andrea|title=Germany, Poland and France revive Weimar group to bolster EU confidence|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-britain-germany-weimar-idUSKCN1130S7|website=Reuters|accessdate=28 August 2016|location=Weimar, Germany|language=English|date=28 August 2016}}</ref>
