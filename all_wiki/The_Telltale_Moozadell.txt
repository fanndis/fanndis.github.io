==Synopsis==
[[Anthony Soprano, Jr.|A.J.]] and some friends break into their high school one night and go swimming. Some of them break into a teacher's office, throw supplies into the pool, and smash the trophy case. The police trace a custom pizza left at the scene to them. There is a conference between the school principal and the football coach, and [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] and [[Carmela Soprano|Carmela]] with A.J. The Sopranos are surprised, and Carmela is angry, that A.J.'s punishment is going to be suspended because of his improved academic performance, and because it is in "his best interest – and the team's" for him to continue playing football. The principal says that any punishment should be parental; A.J. is grounded for a month.

Carmela is delighted with the large sapphire ring [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] gives her for her birthday. She later asks, "Is there anything you need to tell me?"

Tony is teased, provoked, thrilled, and fascinated by [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Gloria Trillo|Gloria]]. At her request he takes her to the zoo, and they have sex in the deserted reptile house. In a hotel room, undressing him, she is thrilled to find his gun. She says ironically, "Mr. Waste Management!" At her next session with [[Jennifer Melfi|Dr. Melfi]] she speaks of her happiness. Melfi asks about the man's voice she heard when Gloria last phoned her; Gloria seems offended and answers evasively. Melfi reminds Gloria that she attempted suicide when her last relationship failed. At Tony's next session he says that he had a very successful week and gives Melfi a bonus on top of his regular payment. She tries to refuse it, but he insists. She knows she is being lied to.

The [[Soprano crime family]] takes over a night club. [[Christopher Moltisanti|Christopher]] shows it to [[Adriana La Cerva|Adriana]] saying, "You're going to be the owner/manager." She renames it "Crazy Horse."

Carmela has begun to approve of [[Jackie Aprile, Jr.|Jackie Jr.]] who is helpful around the house and bonds with A.J., mentoring him in football. In a heart-to-heart with Tony, Jackie promises that he will work hard. Later Tony runs into him at an illegal casino and angrily rebukes him, saying emphatically, "If you're spending time with my daughter, I want the best from you." 

On the opening night of the Crazy Horse, [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Matush Giamona|Matush Giamona]] is caught dealing [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] in the bathroom and thrown out. Jackie tells Matush, "Chris and me are associates." He asks Chris to let his friend Matush continue dealing inside the club; Chris dismisses him. Jackie tells Matush that Chris permits him to deal outside the club. He does so, and is badly beaten up by [[Furio Giunta|Furio]] and his men. At home, Jackie asks [[Ralph Cifaretto|Ralphie]] for a "[[Firearm|piece]]" and, without much questioning, Ralphie gives him a [[.38 S&W|.38 revolver]].
