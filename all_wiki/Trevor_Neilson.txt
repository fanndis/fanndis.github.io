==Career==

Upon leaving Washington State University, Neilson moved to Washington, D.C. where he became an intern for [[Jolene Unsoeld|United States Representative Jolene Unsoeld]] in the Lyndon Baines Johnson Congressional Scholar program.  Following that internship and [[Bill Clinton]]’s election as president, Neilson moved to the White House where he became an intern in the White House Office of Scheduling and Advance. After serving

in that role, Neilson became a member of the White House Advance Team, travelling ahead of President Clinton to manage meetings and events around the world.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Parnes|first1=Amie|title=The Celebs' Do Good Friend|url=http://www.politico.com/click/stories/1005/the_celebs_dogood_friend.html|website=Politico}}</ref>

After leaving the White House, Neilson returned to Seattle and began working for EvansGroup<ref>{{cite web|title=Trevor Neilson Selected as One of 237 Exceptional Leaders Selected to Participate in New Major Global Undertaking to Shape the Future|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/20129-Trevor-Neilson-Selected-as-One-of-237-Exceptional-Leaders-Selected-to-Participate-in-New-Major-Global-Undertaking-to-Shape-the-Future|website=CSR Wire}}</ref> where he helped launch the public affairs practice.  After a short time, Neilson left EvansGroup to pursue his passion for public education with a position at the Washington Education Association.<ref>{{cite web|title=Education Funding -- Governor Keeps Promise To State's Public Schools|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970317&slug=2529162#_ga=1.39188067.1172150211.1419037713|website=Seattle Times}}</ref>

After two years in that position, Neilson was hired by General John Stanford to become Director of Communications for the Seattle Public Schools.  Stanford, a former leader of the Gulf War, had been hired by the Seattle School Board to implement an aggressive reform agenda.  Stanford became a beloved figure in Seattle, rallying parents, students and the business community to turn around a failing school system.

After a few months on the job, Neilson had the responsibility of announcing to the public and media that Stanford had leukemia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jolayne Houtz, Dick Lilly|title=Stanford May Get Out Of Hospital Next Week -- He'll Speak By Phone At Tomorrow's Rally|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980903&slug=2769954#_ga=1.80605527.1172150211.1419037713|website=Seattle Times}}</ref> Stanford waged an aggressive, and very public, fight against the disease, but died on November 28, 1998.  Neilson held a news conference with media in Seattle to announce his death.

Following Stanford's death, Neilson was recruited for a new position with an emerging foundation which would become the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, Bill Gates Sr. and Patty Stonesifer hired Neilson to serve as Director of Communications for the Gates Learning Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations Name Trevor Neilson as Communications Manager|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundations-name-trevor-neilson-as-communications-manager-74013352.html|website=PR NewsWire}}</ref>  Following that, the Gates Learning Foundation merged with the William H. Gates Foundation and Neilson became Director of Communications for the newly combined entity named the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  During his time as Director of Communications for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Neilson also served as personal spokesperson for Bill and Melinda Gates on issues unrelated to their philanthropic work.<ref>{{cite web|title=BILL AND MELINDA GATES TO HAVE BABY|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2002/Bill-and-Melinda-Gates-to-Have-Baby/id-9d302f04078c92473ea98bc3e016040c|website=AP News Archive}}</ref>

Following his work as Director of Communications, Neilson became Director of Special Projects at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, where he was responsible for important partnerships including the United Nations and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.

In this role, Neilson was asked by [[Bobby Shriver]], son of Sargent and [[Eunice Shriver]] and nephew of President [[John F. Kennedy]] if Bill Gates would support an idea that he and Bono, the Irish musician and activist had.  Shriver and Bono wanted to create a version of the [[National Rifle Association]] for the poorest people in the world, specifically Africans who lived under a dollar a day and grappled with AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria, famine and other problems.  Shriver and Bono's idea was to create a powerful political voice for these people, one which could not be ignored by elected officials and those who appropriate funding.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|last1=Colapinto|first1=John|author-link= John Colapinto|title=When celebrities become philanthropists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/29/when-celebrities-become-philanthropists|journal=The Guardian|date=2012-07-28}}</ref>  This organization was called [[the ONE Campaign]] and was later credited with having helped secure the largest funding commitment to the fight against AIDS ever made by any government.

Following his time at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Neilson moved to New York and became Executive Director of the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trevor Neilson, Executive Director of The Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS (GBC), Joins SAFLINK Board of Directors|url=http://lexdon.com/article/Trevor_Neilson_Executive_Director_of/1762.html|website=Lexdon.com}}</ref>  During his time as Executive Director Neilson recruited over one hundred companies to join the coalition and led a variety of advocacy efforts aimed at stopping the AIDS pandemic.

The New York Times profiled Neilson in December 2010 and said “few philanthropic advisers have a celebrity Rolodex as full as Mr. Neilson’s.”<ref>{{Cite newspaper|last1=Holson|first1=Laura M.|title=Charity Fixer to the Stars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/fashion/05TREVORNEILSON.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|journal=The New York Times|date=2010-12-03}}</ref>

==Leadership of G2 Investment Group==
Following the founding of Global Philanthropy Group, Neilson became President of G2 Investment Group, a New York-based investment management company.
