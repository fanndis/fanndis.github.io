A '''migrant worker''' is a person who either [[Human migration|migrates]] within their home country or outside it to pursue work. Migrant workers usually do not have the intention to stay permanently in the country or region in which they work.
[[File:Migrant worker.jpg|thumb|Young male migrant hawker carries colorful African print on his head for sale]]
Migrant workers who work outside their home country are also called [[foreign worker]]s. They may also be called [[expatriate]]s or [[guest worker]]s, especially when they have been sent for or invited to work in the host country before leaving the home country.

The [[International Labour Organization]] estimated in 2014 there were 232 million international migrants worldwide who were outside their home country for at least 12 months and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}</ref> Some countries have millions of migrant workers. Some migrant workers are [[illegal immigrant]]s. Some are [[slaves]].

==Worldwide perspectives==

An estimated 14 million foreign workers live in the [[United States]], which draws most of its immigrants from [[Mexico]], including 4 or 5 million [[illegal aliens|undocumented workers]]. It is estimated that around 5 million foreign workers live in Northwestern Europe, half a million in Japan, and around 5 million in Saudi Arabia. A comparable number of dependents are accompanying international workers.<ref>http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=westfall</ref>

===Americas===
About 1/3 of all migrant workers in North America are illegal immigrants from Mexico (5/15 million).

====Canada====

Foreign nationals are accepted into Canada on a temporary basis if they have a [[student visa]], are [[seeking asylum]], or under special permits. The largest category however is called the [[Temporary foreign worker program in Canada|Temporary Foreign Worker Program]] (TFWP), under which workers are brought to Canada by their employers for specific jobs.<ref name=Canada1>Sharma, Nandita. Home Economics: Nationalism and the Making of 'Migrant Workers' in Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2006</ref> In 2006, there were a total of 265,000 foreign workers in Canada.  Amongst those of working age, there was a 118% increase from 1996.  By 2008, the intake of non-permanent immigrants (399,523, the majority of whom are TFWs), had overtaken the intake of permanent immigrants (247,243).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2010002/article/11166-eng.htm |title=Foreign nationals working temporarily in Canada |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref> In order to hire foreign workers, Canadian employers must acquire a Labour Market Impact Assessment administered by Employment and Social Development Canada.

Since the 1960s, farmers in Ontario and other provinces have been meeting some of their seasonal labour needs by hiring temporary workers from Caribbean countries and, since 1974, from Mexico under the Canadian [[Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program]] (CSAWP). This federal initiative allows for the organized entry into Canada of low- to mid-level skilled farm workers for up to eight months a year to fill labour shortages on Canadian farms during peak periods of planting, cultivating and harvesting of specified farm commodities. The program is run jointly with the governments of Mexico and the participating Caribbean states, which recruit the workers and appoint representatives in Canada to assist in the program's operations.<ref>Lois Ross, [http://www.nsi-ins.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2006-Migrant-Workers-in-Canada-A-review-of-the-Canadian-Seasonal-Agricultural-Workers-Program.pdf ''Migrant Workers in Canada: a review of the Canadian seasonal agricultural workers program''], ([[The North-South Institute]], 2006)</ref>

Non-agricultural companies in Canada have begun to recruit under the temporary foreign worker program since [[Service Canada]]'s 2002 expansion of an immigration program for migrant workers.

As of 2002, the federal government introduced the Low Skill Pilot Project.  This project allows companies to apply to bring in temporary foreign workers to fill low skill jobs. The classification of "low skill" means that workers require no more than high school or two years of job-specific training to qualify.

In 2006, the federal Conservatives expanded the list of occupations that qualified for the Low Skill Pilot Project and increased the speed of processing applications.{{citation needed| date=November 2016 }}

Immigrants often take any available job, and often they find employment in the fields. The work often consists of hard manual labour, often with unfair pay. The article "Migrant Farmworkers: Is government doing enough to protect them?”, by William Triplett, states that the median annual income was $7,500, and 61% had income below the poverty level. After losing their cultural identity immigrants try to find a way to feed their families, and end up being exploited. Triplett also says that since 1989, "their average real hourly wages (in 1998 dollars) had dropped from $6.89 to $6.18", and that immigrants suffer physical as well as economic exploitation in the work place.<ref>Triplett, William.

===Asia===

In Asia, some countries in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] offer workers. Their destinations include Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia.

====China====

[[File:Carrier.jpg|thumb|A Mingong is working in China]]
Overall, the [[Chinese government]] has tacitly supported migration as means of providing labour for factories and construction sites and for the long-term goals of [[Urbanization in the People's Republic of China|transforming China]] from a rural-based economy to an urban-based one.<ref name=":0">''China Blue.'' Dir. Micha X. Peled. Teddy Bear Films. 2005. DVD</ref> Some inland cities have started providing migrants with [[Social welfare in China|social security]], including pensions and other insurance.
In 2012, there were a reported 167 million migrant workers in China, with trends of working closer to home within their own or a neighbouring province but with a wage drop of 21%.
Because so many migrant workers are moving to the city from rural areas, employers can hire them to work in poor working conditions for low wages.<ref name=":0" /> Migrant workers in China are notoriously marginalized, especially due to the [[hukou system]] of residency permits, which tie one stated residence to all social welfare benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wong|title=Rural migrant workers in urban China: living a marginalised life|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|volume=16|pages=32–40|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2007.00475.x|year=2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/16/asia/china-migrant-children/index.html|title=China to migrant workers: Take your kids with you|author=David McKenzie and Serena Dong|website=CNN|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>

There has been a substantial flow of people from Bangladesh and Nepal to India over recent decades in search of better work. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found that these migrant workers are often subject to [[harassment]], violence, and discrimination during their journeys at their destinations and when they return home.<ref>Samuels, F. et al.

These findings highlight the need to promote migrants' rights with, among others, health staff, police and employers  at destination.

====Indonesia====
{{further|Indonesian migrant worker}}
The population of Indonesia, as the world's fourth largest, has contributed to the surplus of work forces.{{clarify|date=December 2018}} Combined with a scarcity of jobs at home, this has led numbers of [[Native Indonesians|Indonesians]] to seek work abroad. It is estimated that around 4.5&nbsp;million Indonesians work abroad; 70% of them are women: most are employed in the domestic sector as maids and in the manufacturing sector. Most of them are between 18 and 35 years old. Around 30% are men, mostly working in plantations, construction, transportation and the service sector.<ref>

During the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1995–2000), Malaysia's total population increased by 2.3% per year, while foreign residents (non-citizens) make up 7.6% of the total working-age population in Malaysia, not including illegal foreign residents. In 2008 the majority of migrant workers (1,085,658: 52.6%) originally came from Indonesia. This was followed by Bangladesh (316,401), Philippines (26,713), Thailand (21,065) and Pakistan (21,278). The total number of migrant workers from other countries was 591,481. Their arrival, if not controlled, will decrease the local population's employment opportunities. However, the arrival of migrant workers increased the country's output and reduced the wage rates in the local labor market. Despite the benefits achieved by both the sending and receiving countries, many problems arise in the receiving country, Malaysia. The number of migrant workers currently in Malaysia is very difficult to determine, although the numbers working legally, with a passport and a work permit, are known.

Since the late 1970s, Singapore has become one of the major receiving countries of migrant workers in Southeast Asia with 1,340,300 foreign workers constituting 37% of the total workforce in December 2014.<ref name="mom.gov.sg">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications|title=Documents and Publications|website=Ministry of Manpower Singapore|language=en|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>

In 2020, it was reported that of the 1.4 million foreign workers in Singapore, nearly 1 million were in low paid, low skilled work. Such jobs are  often perceived by local Singaporeans as less attractive due to being dirty, physically demanding and potentially dangerous. Observers such as [[OCBC Bank]] economist Selena Ling say migrant workers are necessary given the ageing labour force and a low fertility rate.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Can Singapore rely less on foreign workers?

The number of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore increased from about 201,000 in 2010 to 255,800 in 2019, or by 27 per cent. As of 2019, one of every five Singaporean household hires a maid. In 1990, the ratio was about one in 13, with about 50,000 maids in Singapore at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/maids-foreign-domestic-workers-singapore-necessity-families-12059068|title=The Big Read: As maids become a necessity for many families, festering societal issues could come to the fore|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref> Within Singapore there is evidence of a double-sided problem: the country needs foreign workers, but doesn't want to interact with them. In 2008, when the government sought to convert a school into a worker dormitory in [[Serangoon Gardens Single Member Constituency|Serangoon Gardens]], close to 1,500 households petitioned against it as they were concerned about the effects it would have on their property values.

In 1993, the Industrial Trainee Program was established to meets the needs of migrant workers. It provided work for foreigners as trainees in small and medium-sized businesses. However, these workers were considered trainees and not official employees, so they could not receive protection under Korean labour laws. On 14 February 1995 Guidelines for the Protection and Management of Foreign Industrial Trainees provided legal and social welfare for migrant workers. The Act on the Employment of Foreign Workers which states that "a foreign worker shall not be given discriminatory treatment on the ground that he/she is a foreigner", was put into force on 16 August 2003. Later that year the numbers of migrant workers multiplied dramatically.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Even though there has been a drastic rise of migrant workers in Korea and policies are in place for their protection, the lack of cheap labour in Korea has forced the Korean community to condone the maltreatment of illegal migrant workers, and other unsavoury practices. In response, the Korean government has increased the quota for migrant workers by 5,000, to 62,000 individuals in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrantok.org/english/viewtopic.php?t=629&sid=69cfbdaa991e8f3f6f5f0df94484addd|title=MigrantWorkers Center :: View topic – 62,000 foreign workers will come to Korea in 2013 (an increase of 5,000 laborers over 2012)|work=migrantok.org}}</ref> In addition, on 31 January 2013, the minimum wage for migrant workers increased to 38,880 KRW for eight hours per day or a monthly rate of 1,015,740 KRW.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrantok.org/english/viewtopic.php?t=648|title=MigrantWorkers Center :: View topic&nbsp;– South Korea increases minimum wage for workers|work=migrantok.org}}</ref>
Programs were put into place to protect migrant workers and ease their integration to Korean society. Programs sponsored by the government such as Sejonghakdang (세종학당), Multicultural Center of Gender Equality and Family Program, Foreign Ministry Personnel Center Program, and Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program provide free Korean language lessons for migrant workers. In addition, by fulfilling all the requirements of the Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program, migrant workers can apply for Korean citizenship without taking the Naturalization exams.

The E-9 Non-professional Employment visa was launched in order to hire foreigners to work in the manual labour field. The visa is only limited to people that come from 15 Asian countries including, the Philippines, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Cambodia, China, Bangladesh, Nepal, Kazakhstan, Myanmar and East Timor.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.englishspectrum.com/non-professional-employment-e-9/ | title=Non-professional Employment, E-9| date=17 August 2015}}</ref> A new visa, known as the C-3 visa, was launched on 3 December 2018  which allows one to stay in South Korea for up to 90 days within the visa's validity period of up to 10 years with no restrictions on the number of visits to the country.

====Taiwan====
As of June 2016, there are more than 600,000 migrant workers in Taiwan which are spread across different sectors of industry, ranging from construction workers, domestic helpers, factory workers and other manual jobs. Most of them come from Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201608290029.aspx|title=Number of migrant workers in Taiwan tops 600,000 – Society – FOCUS TAIWAN – CNA ENGLISH NEWS}}</ref>

====Thailand====
In Thailand, migrants come from bordering countries such as Burma, Laos and Cambodia. Many face hardships such as lack of food, abuse, and low wages with deportation being their biggest fear. In Bangkok, Thailand many migrant workers attend [[Dear Burma]] school where they study subjects such as [[Thai language]], [[Burmese language]], English language, computer skills and photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/328396/a-rare-chance-to-learn|title=A rare chance to learn|author=Post Publishing PCL.|work=bangkokpost.com}}</ref>

===Europe===

====European Union====
In 2016, around 7.14% (15,88,300 people) of total EU employment were not citizens, 3.61% (8,143,800) were from another EU Member State, 3.53% (7.741.500) were from a non-EU country. Switzerland 0.53%, France 0.65%, Spain 0.88%, Italy 1.08%, United Kingdom 1.46%, Germany 1.81% were countries where more than 0.5% of employees were not citizens. 
United Kingdom 0.91%, Germany 0.94% are countries where more than 0.9% of employees were from non-EU countries.

The recent [[Enlargement of the European Union|expansions]] of the [[European Union]] have provided opportunities for many people to migrate to other EU countries for work. For both the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]] and [[Accession of Romania to the European Union|2007]] enlargements, existing [[Member State of the European Union|states]] were given the rights to impose various transitional arrangements to limit access to their labour markets. After the Second World War, Germany did not have enough workers so  laborers from other European states were invited to work in Germany. This invitation ended in 1973 and these workers were known as [[Gastarbeiter]].

1 March has become a symbolic day for transnational migrants' strike. This day unites all migrants to give them a common voice to speak up against racism, discrimination and exclusion on all levels of social life. The transnational protests on 1 March were originally initiated in the US in 2006 and have encouraged migrants in other countries to organise and take action on that day. In Austria the first transnational migrants' strike (''{{lang|de|Transnationaler Migrant innenstreik}}'') took place in March 2011, in the form of common actions, e.g. a manifestation, but also in form of numerous decentralised actions.

====Finland====
According to the Finnish trade union organizations SAK ([[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]]) and PAM [[Finnish Service Union United PAM]] foreign workers were increasingly abused in the [[Construction worker|construction]] and [[Portal:Transport|transportation]] sectors in Finland in 2012, in some cases reporting hourly wages as low as two euros. [[Bulgarians]], [[List of Kosovars|Kosovars]] and [[Estonians]] were the most likely victimised in the building trade.<ref>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/unions_foreign_workers_often_underpaid_overworked/6479057 Unions: Foreign workers often underpaid, overworked] [[yle]] 4 February 2013</ref>

====Germany====
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
{{Main|Gastarbeiter}}
In Nazi Germany, from 1940–42, [[Organization Todt]] began its reliance on guest workers, [[Internment|military internees]], [[Zivilarbeiter]] (civilian workers), [[Ostarbeiter]] (Eastern workers) and [[Hilfswillige]] ("volunteer") POW workers.

The great migration phase of labor migrants in the 20th century began in Germany during the 1950s, as the sovereign Germany since 1955 due to repeated pressure from NATO partners yielded to the request for closure of the so-called 'Anwerbe' Agreement ([[German language|German]]: Anwerbeabkommen).
The initial plan was a rotation principle: a temporary stay (usually two to three years), followed by a return to their homeland. The rotation principle proved inefficient for the industry, because the experienced workers were constantly replaced by inexperienced ones. The companies asked for legislation to extend the residence permits.
Many of these foreign workers were followed by their families in the following period and stayed forever. Until the 1970s, more than four million migrant workers and their families came to Germany like this, mainly from the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Spain, the former Yugoslavia, [[Greece]] and Turkey.
Since about 1990, came for the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and the enlargement of the European Union and guest workers from Eastern Europe to Western Europe
Sometimes, a host country sets up a program in order to invite guest workers, as did the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] from 1955 until 1973, when over one million guest workers (German: [[Gastarbeiter]]) arrived, mostly from [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Turkey]].

====Armenia====
The main destination for Armenian seasonal workers is Russia. Until the end of the 1990s, there was an act of a third huge wave of Armenian emigrants, which accounted for about one million people. The main destination was the Russian Federation (620,000) ․ When Armenia became Independent (1991), the number of people who leave the country permanently slowed down, whereas, the number of seasonal labor migrants mainly to Russia increased.<ref>https://www.univie.ac.at/alumni.ksa/wp-content/uploads/ASSA-SN-2017-01_Migration-and-its-impact-on-Armenia.pdf</ref> According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Territorial Development and Administration, 95% of seasonal migrants and 75% of long-term migrants work in Russia as of the end of the year 2018, and the reason is supposed to be the membership with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The First Deputy Minister of Territorial Administration and Development of Armenia, Vache Terteryan, once said:<ref name = russia>{{Cite web | url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/russia-remains-preferred-destination-for-armenian-migrants/ | title=Russia remains preferred destination for Armenian migrants| date=25 September 2018|first = Tamara |last = Karelidze|work = [[Emerging Europe]]}}</ref>
{{Quote|“We must ensure that our labor force feels comfortable both at home and in EAEU countries,” said Mr. Terteryan, speaking at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Migration Policy under the UNECE (UN Economic Commission for Europe). “They must also feel comfortable in third countries. The principles of reciprocity in terms of length of service, pay, pensions, medical care and so on should be respected.”}}

====Sweden====
Since December 2008, Sweden has more liberal rules for labor immigration from 'third countries' – countries outside the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) – than any other country in OECD. The introduction of employer-driven labor immigration, motivated by the need to address labor shortages, resulted in large inflows of migrants also in low-skilled occupations in labor surplus sectors, for example the restaurant and cleaning sectors.<ref>Olle Frödin & Anders Kjellberg (2018) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/40268826/Labor_Migration_from_Third_Countries_to_Swedish_Low_wage_Jobs_Fr_din_Kjellberg.pdf  Labor Migration from Third Countries to Swedish Low-wage Jobs], ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'', vol. 8 no 1 (March 2018), pp. 65-85</ref>

====Switzerland====
The underestimation of the required [[Social integration|integration]] services by the state and the society of the host countries, but also by the migrants themselves. Switzerland's transformation into a country of immigration was not until after the accelerated industrialization in the second half of the 19th century. Switzerland was no longer a purely rural Alpine area but became a European vanguard in various industries at that time, first of [[textile]], later also the mechanical and chemical industries. Since the middle of the 19th century especially German academics, self-employed and craftsmen, but also Italians, who found a job in science, industry, construction and infrastructure construction migrated to Switzerland.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=D'amato|first1=Gianni|title=Schweizerisches Jahrbuch für Entwicklungspolitik|issue=27–2|pages=177–195|url=http://sjep.revues.org/340|journal=Schweizerisches Jahrbuch für Entwicklungspolitik|access-date=4 April 2015|date=December 2008}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]] migrant workers are denied [[National Health Service]] treatment unless they can afford to pay.  Untreated illnesses can worsen and migrant workers can die from treatable illnesses that remain untreated.<ref>{{cite web|first = Chaminda |last = Jayanetti|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/13/nhs-denied-treatment-for-migrants-who-cant-afford-upfront-charges |title = NHS denied treatment for migrants who can't afford upfront charges|work =[[The Guardian]]|date = 13 November 2018}}</ref>

===Middle East===
In 1973, an oil boom in the [[Persian Gulf]] region (UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, which comprise the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]), created an unprecedented demand for labor in the oil, construction and industrial sectors.<ref name=Abella>{{cite book|last=Abella|first=Manolo|title=Asian migrant and contract workers in the Middle East|year=1995|pages=418–423}}</ref>  Development demanded a labor force. This demand was met by foreign workers, primarily those from the Arab states, with a later shift to those from Asian countries.<ref name=Kapiszewski>{{cite news|last=Kapiszewski|first=Andrzej|title=Arab versus Asian migrant workers in the GCC countries|journal=Ited Nations Expert Group Meeting on International Migration and Development in the Arab Region|year=2006}}</ref>  A rise in the standards of living for citizens of Middle Eastern countries also created a demand for domestic workers in the home.

Since the 1970s, foreign workers have become a large percentage of the population in most nations in the Persian Gulf region. Growing competition with nationals in the job sector, along with complaints regarding treatment of foreign workers, have led to rising tensions between the national and foreign populations in these nations.

[[Remittance]]s are becoming a prominent source of external funding for countries that contribute foreign workers to the countries of the GCC. On average, the top recipients globally are India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh.  In 2001, $72.3 billion was returned as remittances to the countries of origin of foreign workers, equivalent to 1.3% of the world GDP.  The source of income remains beneficial as remittances are often more stable that private capital flows. Despite fluctuations in the economy of GCC countries, the amount of dollars in remittances is usually stable.<ref name=Ratha>{{cite news|last=Ratha|first=Dilip|title=Workers' remittances: an important and stable source of external development finance|year=2005}}</ref>

The spending of remittances is seen in two ways. Principally, remittances are sent to the families of guest workers. Though often put towards consumption, remittances are also directed to investment. Investment is seen to lead to the strengthening of infrastructure and facilitating international travel.<ref name=Ratha />

With this jump in earnings, one benefit that has been seen is the nutritional improvement in households of migrant workers. Other benefits are the lessening of underemployment and unemployment.<ref name=Shah>{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Nasra M.|title=Pakistani Workers in the Middle East: Volume, Trends and Consequences|journal=International Migration Review|year=1983|volume=17|issue=3|pages=410–424|jstor=2545795|doi=10.2307/2545795|pmid=12279724}}</ref>

In detailed studies of Pakistani migrants to the Middle East in the early 1980s, the average foreign worker was of age 25–40 years. 70 percent were married, while only 4 percent were accompanied by families. Two thirds hailed from rural areas, and 83 percent were production workers. At the time, 40 percent of Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings came from its migrant workers.<ref name=Shah />

Domestic work is the single most important category of employment among women migrants to the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], as well as to Lebanon and Jordan.  The increase of Arab women in the labour force, and changing conceptions of women's responsibilities, have resulted in a shift in household responsibilities to hired domestic workers. Domestic workers perform an array of work in the home: cleaning, cooking, child care, and elder care. Common traits of the work include an average 100-hour work week and virtually non-existent overtime pay.  Remuneration differs greatly according to nationality, oftentimes depending on language skills and education level. This is seen with Filipina domestic workers receiving a higher remuneration than Sri Lankan and Ethiopian nationals.<ref name=Manseau>{{cite journal|last=Manseau|first=Gwennan|title=Contractual solutions for migrant labourers: The case of domestic workers in the Middle East|journal=Human Rights Law Commentary|year=2007|pages=25–47}}</ref>

Saudi Arabia is the largest source of remittance payments in the world.  Remittance payments from Saudi Arabia, similar to other GCC countries, rose during the oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s, but declined in the mid-1980s.  As oil prices fell, budget deficits mounted, and most governments of GCC countries put limits on hiring foreign workers. Weaknesses in the financial sector and in government administration impose substantial transaction costs on migrant workers who send them. Costs, although difficult to estimate, consist of salaries and the increased spending required to expand educational and health services, housing, roads, communications, and other infrastructure to accommodate the basic needs of the newcomers. The foreign labor force is a substantial drain of the GCC states' hard currency earnings, with remittances to migrants' home countries in the early 2000s amounting to $27 billion per year, including $16 billion from Saudi Arabia alone. It has been shown that the percentage of the GDP that foreign labor generates is roughly equal to what the state has to spend on them.<ref name=Ratha />

The main concerns of developed countries regarding immigration centers are: (1) the local job seekers' fear of competition from migrant workers, (2) the fiscal burden that may result on native taxpayers for providing health and social services to migrants, (3) fears of erosion of cultural identity and problems of assimilation of immigrants, and (4) national security.<ref name=Ratha />

In immigrant-producing countries, individuals with less than a high school education continue to be a fiscal burden into the next generation. Skilled workers, however, pay more in taxes than what they receive in social spending from the state. Emigration of highly skilled workers has been linked to skill shortages, reductions in output, and tax shortfalls in many developing countries. These burdens are even more apparent in countries where educated workers emigrated in large numbers after receiving a highly subsidized technical education.<ref name=Ratha /> 

As of 2007, 10 million workers from Southeast Asia, South Asia, or Africa live and work in the countries of the Persian Gulf region.<ref name=Manseau /> Xenophobia in receiving nations is often rampant, as menial work is often allocated only to foreign workers. Expatriate labor is treated with prejudice in host countries despite government attempts to eradicate malpractice and [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]]. Emigrants are offered substandard wages and living conditions and are compelled to work overtime without extra payment.  With regards to injuries and death, workers or their dependents are not paid due compensation. Citizenship is rarely offered and labor can oftentimes be acquired below the legal minimum wage. Foreign workers often lack access to local labor markets. Oftentimes these workers are legally attached to a sponsor/employer until completion of their employment contract, after which a worker must either renew a permit or leave the country.<ref name=Abella />

Racism is prevalent towards migrant workers. With an increasing number of unskilled workers from Asia and Africa, the market for foreign workers became increasingly racialized, and dangerous or "dirty" jobs became associated with Asian and African workers noted by the term "Abed", meaning dark skin.<ref name=Shah />

Foreign workers migrate to the Middle East as contract workers by means of the ''kafala'', or "sponsorship" system.<ref name=Ruhs>{{cite book|last=Ruhs|first=Martin|title=Temporary Foreign Worker Programmes: Policies, adverse consequences, and the need to make them work|year=2002}}</ref>  Migrant work is typically for a period of two years.<ref name=Kapiszewski />  Recruitment agencies in sending countries are the main contributors of labor to GCC countries. Through these agencies, sponsors must pay a fee to the recruiter and pay for the worker's round-trip airfare, visas, permits, and wages. Recruiters charge high fees to prospective employees to obtain employment visas, averaging between $2,000 and $2,500 in such countries as Bangladesh and India. Contract disputes are also common. In Saudi Arabia, foreign workers must have employment contracts written in Arabic and have them signed by both the sponsor and themselves in order to be issued a work permit. With other GCC countries, such as Kuwait, contracts may be written or oral.<ref name=Ruhs />

Dependence on the sponsor (''kafeel'') naturally creates room for violations of the rights of foreign workers.<ref name=Ruhs />  Debt causes workers to work for a certain period of time without a salary to cover these fees. This bondage encourages the practice of international labour migration as women in situations of poverty are able to find jobs overseas and pay off their debts through work.<ref name=Manseau />  It is common for the employer or the sponsor to retain the employee's passport and other identity papers as a form of insurance for the amount an employer has paid for the worker's work permit and airfare. Kafeels sell visas to the foreign worker with the unwritten understanding that the foreigner can work for an employer other than the sponsor.<ref name=Ruhs />

When a two-year work period is over, or with a job loss, workers must find another employer willing to sponsor them, or return to their nation of origin within a short time. Failing to do this entails imprisonment for violation of immigration laws. Protections are nearly non-existent for migrant workers.<ref name=Manseau />

The population in the current GCC states has grown more than eight times during 50 years.  Foreign workers have become the primary, dominant labor force in most sectors of the economy and the government bureaucracy. With rising unemployment, GCC governments embarked on the formulation of labor market strategies to improve this situation, to create sufficient employment opportunities for nationals, and to limit the dependence on expatriate labor.  Restrictions have been imposed: the sponsorship system, the rotational system of expatriate labor to limit the duration of foreigners' stay, curbs on naturalization and the rights of those who have been naturalized, etc. This has also led to efforts to improve the education and training of nationals. Localization remains low among the private sector, however. This is due to the traditionally low income the sector offers. Also included are long working hours, a competitive work environment, and a need to recognize an expatriate supervisor, often difficult to accept.<ref name=Kapiszewski />

In 2005, low-paid Asian workers staged protests, some of them violent, in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar for not receiving salaries on time. In March 2006, hundreds of mostly south Asian construction workers stopped work and went on a rampage in Dubai, UAE, to protest their harsh working conditions, low or delayed pay, and general lack of rights.  Sexual harassment of Filipina housemaids by local employers, especially in Saudi Arabia, has become a serious matter.  In recent years, this has resulted in a ban on migration of females under 21. Such nations as Indonesia have noted the maltreatment of women in the GCC states, with the government calling for an end to the sending of housemaids altogether.<ref name=Abella />  In GCC countries, a chief concern with foreign domestic workers is childcare without the desired emphasis on Islamic and Arabic values.<ref name=Manseau />

Possible developments in the future include a slowdown in the growth of foreign labor. One contributor to this is a dramatic change in demographic trends. The growing birth rate of nationals in the GCC states will lead to a more competitive workforce in the future.<ref name=Kapiszewski />  This could also lead to a rise in the numbers of national women in the workforce.

[[File:Migrant agricultural worker's family, Nipomo, California ppmsca03054u.jpg|thumb|Migrant agricultural worker's family, California, 1936]]
Women migrate in search of work for a number of reasons and the most common reasons are economic: the husband's wage is no longer enough to support the family. In some places, like China, for instance, rapid economic growth has led to an imbalance in the modernization of rural and urban environments, leading women to migrate from rural areas into the city to be a part of the push for modernization.<ref name=":1" /> Other reasons include familial pressure, on a daughter, for instance, who is seen as a reliable source of income for the family only through [[remittance]]s. Young girls and women are singled out in families to be migrant workers because they don't have a viable alternative role to fulfil in the local village.<ref name=":2">''The Mosuo Sisters.'' Dir. by Marlo Poras. Perf. La Tsuo, Jua Ma. 2012. DVD.</ref> If they go to work in the urban centres as domestic workers they can send home money to help provide for their younger siblings.<ref name=":2" /> Many of these women come from developing countries, and are low skilled.<ref>[[Women Migrant Workers from Developing Countries]]</ref> Additionally women who are widowed or divorced and have limited economic opportunities in their native country may be forced to leave out of economic necessity. Migration can also substitute for divorce in societies that don't allow or do not condone divorce.<ref name="Morokvasic"/>

===Impact on roles within the family===
In terms of migrant labour, many women move from a more oppressive home country to a less oppressive environment where they have actual access to waged work. As such, leaving the home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom challenges traditional [[gender roles]]. This can be seen to strengthen women's position in the family by improving their relative bargaining position. They have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets. However, this can lead to hostility between wives and husbands who feel inadequate or ashamed at their inability to fulfil their traditional role as [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]]. The hostility and resentment from the husband can also be a source of [[domestic violence]].<ref>[[#Menjívar|Menjívar (1999)]]</ref> Studies have also been done which point to changes in family structures as a result of migrant labour. These changes include increased divorce rates and decrease in household stability. Additionally, female migrant labour has been indicated as a source for more egalitarian relationships within the family, decline of extended family patterns, and more nuclear families.<ref name="Morokvasic"/> There is also a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.<ref name="Parle">[[#Parle|de Parle (2007)]]</ref>

Researchers identified three groups of women to represent the dimensions of gender roles in Singapore. The first group is made up of expatriate wives who are often reduced to dependent spouse status by immigration laws. The second group are housewives who left work in order to take care of the children at home. Although they are from the Singaporean middle class, they are stuck at almost the same level and share status with the third group, foreign domestic workers. Because of global economic restructuring and global city formation, the mobility of female labours is increasing. However, they are controlled through strict enforcement and they are statistically invisible in migration data. The female foreign domestic workers are always gender-stereotyped as maids and generalized as low wages workers in society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yeoh|first=Brenda S.A.|title=Global Cities, Transnational Flows and Gender Dimensions, The View From Singapore|year=2000|publisher=Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG|location=Department of Geography, University of Singapore}}</ref>

=== Women Migrant Workers: The Informal Sector ===
The spread of global [[neoliberalism]] has contributed to physically displaced people, which translates to displaced workers, worldwide. Due to the national and transnational economic push and pull of migration, growing numbers of women migrant workers find themselves employed in the underground and informal sector. To be clear, these women tended not to be previously employed in the formal sector, if at all. Frequently, the cheap and flexible labor is sought in more developed areas. Also, these women migrant workers are often considered an asset to employers who think of these individuals as docile, compliant, and disposable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Disposable Women and Other Myths of Global Capitalism|last=Wright|first=Melissa|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|location=London and New York}}</ref>

Work found in the informal economy is defined as being outside the legal regulation of the state. This underground sector includes nontraditional types of employment: intimate care,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Globalizing Care Economies and Migrant Workers: Explorations in Global Care Chains|last=Yeates|first=Nicola|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2009|location=Basingstoke}}</ref> [[street vending]], [[community gardening]], food selling, sewing and tailoring, [[laundry]] service, water selling, car cleaning, home cleaning, and various kinds of [[artisan]] production.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development, and Globalization: Economics As if all People Mattered.|last1=Beneía|first1=Lourdes|last2=Berik|first2=Günseli|last3=Floro|first3=Maira S.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|location=New York}}</ref>  These positions are frequently precarious and lack the social contracts often found between employee and employer in the formal sector. This unofficial economy is often found in locations that are between home and work and combine personal and private spaces. Because migrant women workers often occupy the lowest economic positions, this leaves them especially vulnerable to exploitation and dangerous working conditions. Incidentally, [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]] has termed this kind of vulnerable worker, the [[Precariat]].

Women are frequently at the bottom of the economic hierarchy due to various factors, mainly a lack of opportunity to support themselves and their families and in addition, a lack of adequate education. Despite the [[United Nations Girls' Education Initiative|United Nations' Girls Education Initiative]], there remains high rates of [[Literacy|illiteracy]] among women in the Global South. Commonly, the informal sector is the only place where geographically displaced workers are able to insert themselves into the economy. Thus, women migrant workers perform a high percentage of work found in this sector.

Due in part to complex migration issues which include the restructuring of gendered and familiar relations, women migrant workers frequently care for children without a local family network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|date=2010|title=Lideres Campesinas: Nepantla Strategies and Grassroots Organizing at the Intersection of Gender and Globalization|journal=Aztlan: A Journal of Chicano Studies|volume=35|pages=13–47}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Intimate Migrations: Gender, Family, and Illegality Among Transnational Mexicans|last=Boehm|first=Deborah A.|publisher=New York University Press|year=2013|location=New York}}</ref> The informal sector allows for public and private space to be merged and accommodate their care-taking responsibilities. New immigrants are often concerned with leaving children unattended and the informal sector allows for care-taking alongside of economic activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Immigrant Women Workers in the Neoliberal Age|last=Flores-Gonzales|first=Nilda|display-authors=etal|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2013|location=133-163}}</ref>

It is important to note, through case studies, it has been determined that men and women migrate for similar reasons. Mainly, they leave places in search of better opportunities, most often financial. In addition to the financial push, women also migrate to escape oppressive environments and/or abusive spouses.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Servants of Globalization: Migration and Domestic Work|last=Parreñas|first=Rachel|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2015|pages=61–79}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Good Gingrich|first=Luann|date=2010|title=The Symbolic Economy of Trans-Border Governance: A Case Study of Subjective Exclusion and Migrant Women from Mexico.|journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly|volume=29|pages=161–184|doi=10.1093/rsq/hdq008}}</ref>

===Children of female migrant workers===
[[File:Migrant Workers July 1940 from Florida to New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Group of Florida migrants near [[Shawboro, North Carolina]] on their way to [[Cranbury, New Jersey]], to pick potatoes]]
Migrant labour of women also raises special concerns about children. Female migrant workers may not have enough possibilities to care for their own children whilst being abroad. Their children may learn to regard their relatives at home as their parents and may rarely see their mothers. Frequently, children of migrant workers become migrant workers themselves. There is concern that this may have negative psychological effects on the children who are left behind. Although this has not been proven to be entirely true or false, studies have been done which show that many children of migrant workers manage reasonably well. One theory states that remittances to some degree make up for the lack of care by providing more resources for food and clothing. Additionally, some migrant mothers take great care in attempting to maintain familial relationships while abroad.<ref name="Parle"/>

==Migrant education==
''See [[Migrant education]].''

Children of [[migrant workers]] struggle to achieve the same level of educational success as their peers. Relocation, whether it is a singular or regular occurrence, causes discontinuity in education, which causes migrant students to progress slowly through school and drop out at high rates. Additionally, relocation has negative social consequences on students: isolation from peers due to cultural differences and [[language barrier]]s. Migrant children are also at a disadvantage because the majority live in [[extreme poverty]] and must work with their parents to support their families.<ref name=Kindler>{{cite journal |last=Kindler |first=Anneka L.|year=1995 |title=Education of Migrant Children in the United States|journal=[[Directions in Language and Education]] |volume=1 |issue=8 }}</ref> These barriers to equal educational attainment for children of migrant workers are present in countries all over the world. Although the inequality in education remains pronounced, government policies, [[non-governmental organizations]], [[non-profits]], and [[social movements]] are working to reverse its effects.

==Migrant labour force in economies==
The migrant workforce has historically played a vital role nationally and across local communities in recent times. [[Economic globalization]] has created more migrant workers than ever before. While developed countries have increased their demand for labour, especially unskilled labour, workers from developing countries are used. As a result, millions of workers and their families travel to other countries to find work. This influx of migrant workers contributes to growth of [[slum]]s and urban poverty, according to Mike Davis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Mike|title=Planet of Slums|year=2006|publisher=Verso|location=London}}</ref> Some of these workers, usually from rural areas, cannot afford housing in cities and thus live in slums.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Todaro|first=Michael P.|title=A Model of Labor Migration and Urban Unemployment in Less Developed Countries|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1969|volume=59|issue=1}}</ref> Some of these unskilled workers living in slums suffer from unemployment and make a living in the [[informal sector]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Indrani|author2=Arup Mitra|title=Rural Migrants and Labour Segmentation: Micro-Level Evidence from Delhi Slums|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2002|volume=37|issue=2}}</ref> According to International Labor Organization, as of 2013 there were approximately 175 million migrants around the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Labour Organization (ILO)|first=International|title=Migrant Workers|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/migrant-workers/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Standards|access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref>

== Exploitation and enslavement of migrant workers==
{{see also|Human trafficking}}

Recruitment of international workers through employment agencies is a common phenomenon in developed countries, such as the United States or the [[UAE]]. Especially members of underprivileged communities are attracted by the opportunities of living and working in the US. Some of these agencies make fraudulent promises. But even worse than false promises, some migrants are abused and mistreated by the agencies and their middlemen.<ref name="ReferenceA">Twohey, Megan.

Migrant workers may also be denied adequate food and living conditions, as well as medical treatment.<ref name="I Already Bought You"/>

It is common in some cases for a woman to fall victim to sexual violence and harassment, because the employers and their stories will always be trusted more.<ref name="I Already Bought You"/>

Some migrant workers flee from their abusive employers and seek help at the embassy or consulate of their home country. This however, is difficult to achieve in remote locations.<ref name="I Already Bought You"/>

=== Indian migrant workers in the USA===
A United States company, [[Signal International]], led by an immigration lawyer, Malvern C. Burnett, and an Indian labor recruiter, Sachin Dewan, "lured hundreds of Indian workers to a Mississippi shipyard with false promises of permanent US residency."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/exploited-indian-workers-in-us-awarded-14-million/16005172|title=Exploited Indian workers in US awarded $14&nbsp;million|work=mid-day|access-date=15 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> This was under the [[H-2B visa]] guest worker program, to work as welders, pipefitters, and in other positions to repair damaged oil rigs and related facilities.

=== Philippines migrant workers in the USA===
There have been many cases of corruption among brokers who often act as if they have companies, often encouraging migrants to come to the United States. This was the case with broker, Kizzy Kalu was, "a naturalized United States citizen from Nigeria".<ref name="denverpost.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/11/highlands-ranch-man-sentenced-to-11-years-in-human-trafficking-case/|title=Highlands Ranch man sentenced to 11 years in human trafficking case – The Denver Post|access-date=15 May 2017|date=11 February 2014}}</ref> "He secured government approval to bring in Filipino nurses under a government visa program, claiming they would be paid up to $72,000 as instructors at an Adam University in Colorado, according to a 2012 criminal indictment of the labor broker."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> [[Adams State University]] did exist in Colorado, however Adam University was nonexistent just as much as the jobs that were supposed to be there for migrants. "Kalu promised the nurses, most from the Philippines, jobs as nurse instructors/supervisors."<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2013/07/01/jury-finds-kalu-guilty-of-human-trafficking/|title=Jury finds Kalu guilty of human trafficking – The Denver Post|access-date=15 May 2017|date=July 2013}}</ref> "He arranged with the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security to provide H-1B visas for the workers, saying that Adam University faced a labor shortage and needed foreign labor to serve as nursing instructors/supervisors," as a way to lure workers in.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Kizzy Kalu&nbsp;and "other foreign nationals" received compensation for these visas after they secured and received them for the soon to be workers. "Kalu $6,500 for assistance in obtaining them. Upon arrival in Denver, Colorado, the nurses were told that there was no such place as Adam University. Instead, they were sent to "work in nursing homes. The facilities paid Kalu's company, Foreign Health Care Professionals Group, $35 per hour for one of the nurses. Kalu then pocketed almost half the wage and paid the nurse $20 an hour."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He continued to exploit these workers by allowing them to work while he was the one gaining their profit. He had to report to the government about these women and that they were in fact working in the country so that he could continue to receive funds, while they too continued working. And that is what he did. "Documents he submitted to the government didn't indicate that he and his partner, Philip Langerman, were taking a large portion of the visa-holders' wages."<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Eventually, this scheme that Kalu and his partner Phillip Langerman created began to become known to the public. Instead of the facilities paying the company they had created together from the work the women were doing, "the nurses were paid directly by the facilities but were required to pay Kalu $1,200 a month or Kalu would send a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and they would lose their visas, prosecutors said."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Soon, the nurses realized this kind of unfair treatment and mode of oppression and stopped paying him. Therefore, their visas got revoked because he reported this matter to officials.

====Conviction====

Kizzy Kalu was guilty of "trafficking in forced labor for luring foreign nurses to the United States with promises of high-paying jobs but then demanding they kick back a portion of their wages or face deportation."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He was sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison and ordered to pay $3.8&nbsp;million in restitution.&nbsp;He was convicted of 89 counts of mail fraud, visa fraud, human trafficking and money laundering. Kalu's partner, Philip Langerman, 78, of McDonough, Ga., was sentenced to three years of probation for his role in the criminal scheme. He, too, must pay restitution of $3.8&nbsp;million." U.S. District Chief Judge [[Marcia S. Krieger|Marcia Krueger]] said in this case unlike many others, "Kalu did not sexually assault, isolate or strike his victims. She describe these cases as "fraud and economic coercion."<ref name="denverpost.com"/>

====Other cases in the USA====

There are other fraudulent cases by United States companies that recruit and employ Filipino workers. On 19 March 2013, in an article titled, "Filipino Workers Urge Overhaul of U.S. Guest Worker Policies", information is provided about the corruption in labor. "The shipyard, Grand Isle Shipyard (GIS) in L.A., put the Filipinos to work on an oil production platform owned by Black Elk Energy, a U.S. company that, according to federal regulators, had racked up 315 documented "incidents of safety non-compliance" offshore since 2010.The problems at Black Elk Energy were amplified following an explosion in November on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico that claimed the lives of three Filipino workers, while three others were seriously injured."<ref name="ipsnews.net">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/03/filipino-workers-urge-overhaul-of-u-s-guest-worker-policies/|title=Filipino Workers Urge Overhaul of U.S. Guest Worker Policies {{!}} Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> This problem became known because the work at this company against workers were very dangerous even before they were hired which is why work here was put to a stop. However this did not stop GIS. They needed to make their money and unfortunately the migrant workers were the ones who suffered.

"The main [hazardous condition] is the sleep deprivation that they experience – just long hours of work that the [U.S.] workers don't face. They're forced to work sometimes for two weeks straight, 70 hours a week."<ref name="ipsnews.net"/> They hired and recruited many skillful men from the Philippines who were "welders, pipefitters and scaffolders were trafficked under "fraudulent" contracts that promised high pay and safe working conditions. But many were placed for work on dangerous oil rig platforms."<ref name="ipsnews.net"/>

=== Mexican migrant workers in the USA ===
Since the early 1980s, increasing numbers of Mexican women have migrated to the United States in search of jobs. These women usually leave their families, including young children, behind in order to help maintain the family by sending [[remittance]]s. After arriving in the U.S., many are put to work and live in places that are neither clean nor safe. Companies and traffickers promise legitimate jobs in America because they make money doing so.

An article "Girl Next Door", by Peter Landsman, examines this system, which is said to be brutal and inhumane oppression of migrant workers. "On a tip, the Plainfield police raided the house in February 2002, expecting to find illegal aliens working an underground brothel. What the police found were four girls between the ages of 14 and 17. They were all Mexican nationals without documentation. But they weren't prostitutes; they were sex slaves. The distinction is important: these girls weren't working for profit or a paycheck. They were captives to the traffickers and keepers who controlled their every move."<ref name="Landesman, Peter 2004">Landesman, Peter. 2004. The Girls Next Door. New York Times Magazine</ref> These girls, a large percentage are underaged, are forcefully lured from their homeland in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. This section mainly focused on the exploitation of men and women however, it was very disturbing to even learn that children were also trafficked and stolen from their homelands.

"They had been promised jobs as models and baby sitters in the glamorous United States, and they probably had no idea why they were sitting in a van in a backwater like Tijuana in the early evening."<ref name="Landesman, Peter 2004"/>

"The police found a squalid, land-based equivalent of a 19th-century slave ship." There were doorless bathrooms, decaying sinks and mattresses, morning after pills (medications that can induce abortion) and girls were pale, exhausted and malnourished.<ref name="Landesman, Peter 2004"/> However, this is just an example of one of the apartments and houses that were affected by this type of abuses. Many other houses or neighborhoods in the U.S that seem to be upscale and upper class are infested with these types of illegal actions.

=== Migrant workers in Europe ===
In the agricultural sector (strawberry industry, ...) in some countries in Europe ([[Human_rights_in_Spain#Migrant_agricultural_workers_in_Southern_Spain|Spain]], Italy), sexual harassment, rape and even sexual exploitation occurs.<ref>[https://correctiv.org/en/top-stories-en/2018/04/30/rape-in-the-fields/ Rape in the fields]</ref>

===Philippines migrant workers' rights===
"The Philippine government has long lauded the fact that, every day, some 4,500 Filipinos are sent abroad to work. The remittances they send back keeps the Philippine economy afloat.The government doesn't seem to provide any protection when these overseas Filipino workers run into distress. This labour export policy is still one of their pillars of development – pushing people to other countries instead of addressing poverty or lack of jobs at home."<ref name="ipsnews.net"/> Instead of sending workers out just because the process helps the economy at their countries of origin, the country needs to examine ways in which they can work with the people to obtain jobs or at least create more jobs. When their skilled workers come to the United States and are often exploited, sexually, physically and mentally it not only affects the worker, but also the country upon their return-or if they are able to return at all due to the conditions they face. These are risky jobs and journeys taken by migrants to ensure themselves better lives and also their families. The governments need to do more. "The exploitative immigration system of the U.S. works hand-in-hand with the corrupt labour export policy of the Philippines to maintain a steadily increasing flow of cheap, temporary migrant labour."<ref name="ipsnews.net"/>

===Bangladeshi migrant workers' rights===
Between the months of July and September in 2020, Bangladeshi authorities [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrarily detained]] about 370 Bangladeshi migrant workers after their return to the country from abroad. They had been detained on the allegation of committing criminal activities in foreign nations without any credible evidence of any kind in support.

A survey by Lien Centre for Social Innovation in Singapore also found that over 60 per cent of lower-skilled South Asian migrant workers who are waiting for salary or injury compensation from employers were predicted to have serious [[mental illness]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Seow|first1=Joanna|title=Most migrant South Asian workers face mental health issues as they await claims settlement|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/most-migrant-south-asian-workers-face-mental-health-issues-as-they-await-claims|access-date=1 December 2015|newspaper=Straits Times}}</ref>

On May 23, 2020, global experts and representatives of NGO's on human rights protection attended the virtual conference to urge policymakers to grant favorable measures for vulnerable groups who have had a more difficult time fighting [[COVID-19]], including the elderly, disabled, and migrant workers.

==National vs. transnational migrations==
Like transnational migration, national (internal) migration plays an important role in poverty reduction and economic development. For some countries, internal migrants outnumber those who migrate internationally. For example, 120 million people were estimated to migrate internally in China compared to 458,000 people who migrated internationally for work.<ref name="prb">[[#Deshingkar|Deshingkar & Grimm (2005)]]</ref> Situations of surplus labour in rural areas because of scarcity of arable land is a common "push factor" in the move of individuals to urban-based industries and service jobs. Environmental factors including drought, [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], and river-bank erosion also contribute to internal migration.<ref name="prb"/>

There are four spatial patterns of internal migration:<ref name="prb"/>
# Rural-rural migration: in many poor countries like Senegal, rural-rural migration occurs when labourers from poorer regions travel to agriculturally-rich and irrigated areas which have more work.
# Rural-urban migration: seen in the urbanizing economies of Asia, migration of poor agricultural workers move to larger cities and manufacturing centers.
# Urban-rural migration: migration that occurs when individuals retire back to their villages. Often, migrants who return bring back skill sets that benefit their home areas tremendously.
# Urban-urban migration: as the predominant form of internal migration, this movement takes place from the centre of towns to the outer areas of the town.

[[Circular migration]], the temporary and repetitive movement of a migrant worker between home and host areas, can occur both internally and transnationally.

In 2015, scholar Gabriela Raquel Ríos published "Cultivating Land-Based Literacies and Rhetorics,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rìos|first=Gabriela|date=2015-03-16|title=Cultivating Land-Based Literacies and Rhetorics|journal=Literacy in Composition Studies|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=60–70–70|doi=10.21623/1.3.1.5|issn=2326-5620|doi-access=free}}</ref>" in which she theorizes the phrase "land-based literacies and rhetorics." Her definition is as follows: <blockquote>These literacies (acts of interpretation and communication) and rhetorics (organizational and community-building practices) ultimately build a theory that 1) recognizes the ways in which land can produce relations and 2) recognizes the value of embodied ways of knowing (60).</blockquote>Ríos argues that migrant workers' rhetorical practices incorporate their relationship to land and labor in addition to language.
