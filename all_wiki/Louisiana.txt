It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|19th-smallest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|25th most populous]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 U.S. states]]. Louisiana is bordered by the state of [[Texas]] to the west, [[Arkansas]] to the north, [[Mississippi]] to the east, and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south. A large part of its eastern boundary is demarcated by the [[Mississippi River]]. Louisiana is the only U.S. state with political subdivisions termed [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]], which are equivalent to [[County (United States)|counties]]. The state's [[Capital city|capital]] is [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and its largest city is [[New Orleans]].

Much of the state's lands were formed from [[sediment]] washed down the [[Mississippi River]], leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of [[Tidal marsh|coastal marsh]] and [[swamp]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} These contain a rich southern [[biota (ecology)|biota]]; typical examples include birds such as [[ibis]]es and [[egret]]s. There are also many species of [[tree frog]]s, and fish such as [[sturgeon]] and [[paddlefish]]. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of [[longleaf pine]] forest and wet [[savanna]]s. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of terrestrial [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]s and [[carnivorous plant]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four that have not received recognition.<ref>[http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/nativeams.html Dayna Bowker Lee, "Louisiana Indians in the 21st Century"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223071934/http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/nativeams.html |date=December 23, 2017 }}, Louisiana Folklife Program, 2013</ref>

Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural, [[multilingualism|multilingual]] heritage, being so strongly influenced by a mixture of 18th-century [[Culture of France|French]], [[Culture of Italy|Italian]], [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian]], [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]], [[Culture of Quebec|French Canadian]], [[State recognized tribes#Louisiana|Native American]], and [[Culture of Africa|African]] cultures that they are considered to be exceptional in the U.S. Before the American [[Louisiana Purchase|purchase]] of the territory in 1803, the present-day State of Louisiana had been both a [[Louisiana (New France)|French]] colony and for a brief period a [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spanish]] one. In addition, colonists imported numerous [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] people as slaves in the 18th century. Many came from peoples of the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture. In the [[Reconstruction era|post-Civil War environment]], Anglo-Americans increased the pressure for [[Anglicization]], and in 1921, English was for a time made the sole language of instruction in Louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was revived in 1974.<ref name="LouisianaOfficialSiteLanguage">[http://www.crt.state.la.us/cultural-development/codofil/about/french-in-louisiana/legal-status/index Louisiana Official Site on Languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621185821/http://www.crt.state.la.us/cultural-development/codofil/about/french-in-louisiana/legal-status/index |date=June 21, 2015 }}, accessed August 22, 2016</ref><ref name="murphy">{{Cite journal |url=http://geography.uoregon.edu/murphy/articles/Murphy%20-%20Placing%20Louisiana%20in%20the%20Francophone%20World%20with%20figures.pdf |first=Alexander B. |last=Murphy |title=Placing Louisiana in the Francophone World: Opportunities and Challenges |journal=Atlantic Studies |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=2008<!--

==Etymology==

Louisiana was named after [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], King of France from 1643 to 1715. When [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] claimed the territory drained by the [[Mississippi River]] for France, he named it {{lang|fr|La Louisiane}}.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas]]|title=Louisiana Purchase|first=Lea Flowers|last=Baker|access-date=September 18, 2010|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2383|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122041849/http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2383|archive-date=November 22, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The suffix {{nbh}}ana (or {{nbh}}ane) is a Latin suffix that can refer to "information relating to a particular individual, subject, or place". Thus, roughly, Louis + ana carries the idea of "related to Louis". Once part of the French Colonial Empire, the [[Louisiana Territory]] stretched from present-day Mobile Bay to just north of the present-day [[Canada–United States border]], including a small part of what is now the Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]].

{{Main|History of Louisiana}}

===Pre-colonial history===

[[File:Watson Brake Aerial Illustration HRoe 2014.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Watson Brake]], the oldest mound complex in North America]]

Louisiana was inhabited by Native Americans for many millennia before the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century. During the Middle [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], Louisiana was the site of the earliest mound complex in North America and one of the earliest dated, complex constructions in the Americas, the [[Watson Brake]] site near present-day [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]]. An 11-mound complex, it was built about 5400 BP (3500 BC).<ref>[http://www.archaeology.org/9801/newsbriefs/mounds.html Amélie A. Walker, "Earliest Mound Site"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227043152/http://www.archaeology.org/9801/newsbriefs/mounds.html |date=February 27, 2010 }}, ''Archaeology Magazine'', Volume 51 Number 1, January/February 1998</ref> The Middle Archaic sites of Caney and Frenchman's Bend have also been securely dated to 5600–5000 [[Before Present|BP]] (3700–3100 BC), demonstrating that seasonal hunter-gatherers organized to build complex earthwork constructions in present-day northern Louisiana. These discoveries overturned previous assumptions in archaeology that such complex mounds were built only by cultures of more settled peoples who were dependent on maize cultivation. The Hedgepeth Site in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]] is more recent, dated to 5200–4500 BP (3300–2600 BC).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ccsmpug-xaoC&q=Hedgepeth+Middle+Archaic+site&pg=PA177 |title=Robert W.

[[File:Poverty Point Aerial HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Poverty Point]] [[UNESCO]] site]]

Nearly 2,000 years later, [[Poverty Point]] was built; it is the largest and best-known Late Archaic site in the state. The city of modern-day [[Epps, Louisiana|Epps]] developed near it. The [[Poverty Point culture]] may have reached its peak around 1500 BC, making it the first complex culture, and possibly the first tribal culture in North America.<ref>[http://www.deltablues.net/jon.html Jon L.

The Poverty Point culture was followed by the [[Tchefuncte site#Tchefuncte culture|Tchefuncte]] and Lake Cormorant cultures of the [[Tchula period]], local manifestations of Early [[Woodland period]].

Plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the Middle Mississippian culture that is represented by its largest settlement, the [[Cahokia]] site in Illinois east of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. At its peak Cahokia is estimated to have had a population of more than 20,000. The Plaquemine culture is considered ancestral to the historic [[Natchez people|Natchez]] and [[Taensa]] peoples, whose descendants encountered Europeans in the colonial era.<ref name="The Plaquemine Culture, A.D 1000">{{cite web | url = http://bcn.boulder.co.us/environment/cacv/cacvbrvl.htm | title = The Plaquemine Culture, A.D 1000 | access-date = September 8, 2008 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/66dhOuSqr?url=http://bcn.boulder.co.us/environment/cacv/cacvbrvl.htm | archive-date = April 3, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

By 1000 in the northwestern part of the state, the Fourche Maline culture had evolved into the Caddoan Mississippian culture. The Caddoan Mississippians occupied a large territory, including what is now eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, northeast [[East Texas|Texas]], and northwest Louisiana. Archaeological evidence has demonstrated that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present. The [[Caddo]] and related [[Caddoan languages|Caddo-language]] speakers in prehistoric times and at first European contact were the direct ancestors of the modern [[Caddo Nation of Oklahoma]] of today.<ref name="TejasLinguistics">{{cite web | url= http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/languages.html | title= Tejas-Caddo Fundamentals-Caddoan Languages and Peoples | access-date= February 4, 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100310203249/http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/languages.html | archive-date= March 10, 2010 | url-status= dead }}</ref> Significant Caddoan Mississippian archaeological sites in Louisiana include [[Belcher Mound Site]] in [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]]<ref name="HISTORICAL">{{Cite web|url=http://www.caddohistory.com/belcher.html=|title=Historical-Belcher|access-date=February 22, 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Gahagan Mounds Site]] in Red River Parish.<ref name="NAGRRA">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nagpra/fed_notices/nagpradir/nic0419.html|title=Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects in the Possession of the Louisiana State University Museum|access-date=February 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106035503/http://www.nps.gov/history/nagpra/fed_notices/nagpradir/nic0419.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Exploration and colonization by Europeans===

The first European explorers to visit Louisiana came in 1528 when a Spanish expedition led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] located the mouth of the Mississippi River. In 1542, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition skirted to the north and west of the state (encountering Caddo and Tunica groups) and then followed the Mississippi River down to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1543. Spanish interest in Louisiana faded away for a century and a half.

In the late 17th century, French and French Canadian expeditions, which included sovereign, religious and commercial aims, established a foothold on the Mississippi River and Gulf Coast. With its first settlements, France laid claim to a vast region of North America and set out to establish a commercial empire and French nation stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada.

In 1682, the French explorer [[Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] named the region Louisiana to honor [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] of France. The first permanent settlement, Fort Maurepas (at what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], near [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]]), was founded in 1699 by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], a French military officer from Canada. By then the French had also built a small fort at the mouth of the Mississippi at a settlement they named [[La Balize, Louisiana|La Balise (or La Balize)]], "seamark" in French. By 1721 they built a {{convert|62|ft|m|adj=on}} wooden lighthouse-type structure here to guide ships on the river.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/la18hu.php#18 David Roth, "Louisiana Hurricane History: 18th century (1722–1800)", Tropical Weather—National Weather Service—Lake Charles, LA, 2003], accessed May 7, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805171217/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/research/la18hu.php#18 |date=August 5, 2009 }}</ref>

A royal ordinance of 1722—following the Crown's transfer of the [[Illinois Country]]'s governance from Canada to Louisiana—may have featured the broadest definition of Louisiana: all land claimed by France south of the [[Great Lakes]] between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenies]].<ref name="Ekberg-French Roots">{{cite book|last=Ekberg|first=Carl|title=French Roots in the Illinois Country: The Mississippi Frontier in Colonial Times|date=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago, Ill.|isbn=9780252069246|pages=32–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOdf3FRXms0C&pg=PA216|access-date=November 29, 2014}}</ref> A generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a more defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general [[Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Vaudreuil]] set the northern and eastern bounds of his domain as the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] valley up to the mouth of the [[Vermilion River (Wabash River tributary)|Vermilion River]] (near present-day [[Danville, Illinois]]); from there, northwest to [[Starved Rock State Park|''le Rocher'']] on the [[Illinois River]], and from there west to the mouth of the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] (at present day [[Rock Island, Illinois]]).<ref name="Ekberg-French Roots" /> Thus, [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]] were the limit of Louisiana's reach; the outposts at [[Ouiatenon]] (on the upper Wabash near present-day [[Lafayette, Indiana]]), Chicago, [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]]s (near present-day [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]), and [[Prairie du Chien]], Wisconsin, operated as dependencies of Canada.<ref name="Ekberg-French Roots" />

The settlement of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] (along the Red River in present-day northwest Louisiana) was established in 1714 by [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]], making it the oldest permanent European settlement in the modern state of Louisiana. The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.
[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled the swamps of southern Louisiana, especially in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]].]]

Louisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.

Initially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.

In the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].

France ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)]]. The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.

In 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The governor [[Luis de Unzaga y Amézaga]],<ref>|

Spanish Canary Islanders, called [[Isleños]], emigrated from the [[Canary Islands]] of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783. In 1800, France's [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for two years.

===Expansion of slavery===

{{Main|History of slavery in Louisiana}}
[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|250px|left|Map of [[New France]] (blue color) in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]]]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. "That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year," the British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] wrote.<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440–1870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref> Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves.

Starting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.

In 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] ("Black Code" in English) which "regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana—Know Louisiana|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed "interracial" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted [[manumission]], outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves. The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there. In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar. Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally.

Article II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.

Article VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves. On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern [[Thirteen Colonies]].

The Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery—Master–slave legal relationships |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archive-date=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>

Fugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word "maroon" comes from the Spanish "cimarron", meaning "fugitive cattle".

In the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:
{{blockquote|Truly, it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.<ref name="The Slave Trade p. 548" />}}

When the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name="The Slave Trade p. 548">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440–1870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name="The Slave Trade p. 548" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.

At the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers "cannot be had in this unhealthy climate".<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade—the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.

By 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state. New Orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities, and the third largest city, in the nation.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, p.2</ref> The ban on the African slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market. During the decades after the American Revolutionary War, more than one million enslaved African Americans underwent forced migration from the Upper South to the Deep South, two thirds of them in the slave trade. Others were transported by their owners as slaveholders moved west for new lands.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=3 In Motion: The African-American Migration Experience—The Domestic Slave Trade, New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Study of Black Culture, 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104201729/http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=3 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, accessed April 27, 2008</ref><ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, pp. 96–98</ref>

With changing agriculture in the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers. Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.

===Haitian migration and influence===

Spanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from [[Saint-Domingue]], following a [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] that started in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, [[free people of color]], and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city. The process of gaining independence in Saint-Domingue was complex, but uprisings continued. In 1803, France pulled out its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two-thirds sent to the island two years before, mostly to [[yellow fever]]. In 1804, [[Haiti]], the second republic in the western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, achieved by slave leaders.<ref>"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ht0017) The Slave Rebellion of 1791] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205164427/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+ht0017%29 |date=February 5, 2016 }}".

===Purchase by the United States===

{{Main|Louisiana Purchase|Territory of Orleans|Republic of West Florida|Neutral Ground (Louisiana)}}

When the United States won its independence from Great Britain in 1783, one of its major concerns was having a European power on its western boundary, and the need for unrestricted access to the Mississippi River. As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].

Napoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the [[Treaty of Amiens]] of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.
When the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.
[[File:Louisiane 1800.png|thumb|Map of Louisiana in 1800]]

[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746–1813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2{{nbs}}million.

An official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10{{nbs}}million.

However, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the entirety of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for sixty million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15{{nbs}}million).

Part of this sum, $3.5{{nbs}}million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of {{frac|87|1|2}} per each $100 unit.<!--recte "percent"?--> As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money—which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]

When news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10{{nbs}}million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15{{nbs}}million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic—Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.

By statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Amos Stoddard]] of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by [[Meriwether Lewis]].

The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.

Shortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|website=rs6.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Louisiana's secession was announced on January 26, 1861, and it became part of the [[Confederate States of America]].

The state was quickly defeated in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a result of Union strategy to cut the Confederacy in two by seizing the Mississippi. Federal troops captured New Orleans on April 25, 1862. Because a large part of the population had Union sympathies (or compatible commercial interests), the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of Louisiana under federal control as a state within the Union, with its own elected representatives to the [[U.S. Congress]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Post-Civil War to mid-20th century===

Following the Civil War and emancipation of slaves, violence rose in the South as the war was carried on by insurgent private and paramilitary groups. Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate [[freedmen]] and generally refused to give the vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.) Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].

African Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and [[free people of color|people of color]] who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.

By 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting. In 1896, there were 130,334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters, in proportion to the state population, which was evenly divided.<ref>{{Cite journal|ssrn=224731 |title=Richard H.

The state population in 1900 was 47% African-American: a total of 652,013 citizens. Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of [[free people of color]] before the Civil War.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia], accessed March 15, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}</ref> By 1900, two years after the new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state. Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H.

White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after congressional passage of the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote.

In the early decades of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left Louisiana in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and [[lynchings]]. The [[boll weevil]] infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers. Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went West to [[California]] for jobs in its expanding defense industries.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 "African American Migration Experience: The Great Migration", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104202248/http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, accessed April 24, 2008</ref>

During some of the [[Great Depression]], Louisiana was led by Governor [[Huey Long]]. He was elected to office on populist appeal. His public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased suffrage for poor whites, but Long was criticized for his allegedly demogogic and autocratic style. He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana's state government. Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state. Long's rule ended abruptly when he was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.<ref>{{cite news |last=Glass|first=Andrew|date=September 8, 2017|title=Huey Long assassinated, Sept. 8, 1935|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/08/huey-long-assassinated-sept-8-1935-242325|work=Politico|access-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513093913/https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/08/huey-long-assassinated-sept-8-1935-242325|archive-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref>

===Post-World War II===

Mobilization for [[World War II]] created jobs in the state. But thousands of other workers, black and white alike, migrated to California for better jobs in its burgeoning defense industry. Many African Americans left the state in the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]], from the 1940s through the 1960s to escape social oppression and seek better jobs. The mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers. They sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in California, better education for their children, and living in communities where they could vote.<ref>[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 "African American Migration Experience: The Second Great Migration", ''In Motion'', New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104202248/http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/landing.cfm?migration=9 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, accessed April 24, 2008</ref>

In the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration. Despite opposition by the [[Dixiecrats|States Rights Party]], downstate black voters had begun to increase their rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes. In 1960 the state established the [[Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission]], to investigate civil rights activists and maintain segregation.<ref>Adam Fairclough, ''Race & Democracy: The Civil Rights Struggle in Louisiana, 1915–1972'', University of Georgia Press, 1999</ref>

Despite this, gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20% and more, and it was 32% by 1964, when the first national civil rights legislation of the era was passed.<ref>[http://www.naacpldf.org/content/pdf/reauthorization/Louisiana_VRA_Report.pdf Debo P.

Violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill towns were catalysts to the founding of the first two chapters of the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]] in late 1964 and early 1965, in [[Jonesboro, Louisiana|Jonesboro]] and [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]], respectively. Made up of veterans of World War II and the [[Korean War]], they were armed self-defense groups established to protect activists and their families. Continued violent white resistance in Bogalusa to blacks trying to use public facilities in 1965, following passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], caused the federal government to order local police to protect the activists.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |title=Robert Hicks, Leader in Armed Rights Group, Dies at 81 |author=Douglas Martin |date=April 24, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/25hicks.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018103407/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/25hicks.html |archive-date=October 18, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Other chapters were formed in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

Based on official census figures, the African American population in 1970 stood at 1,085,109, a net gain of more than 46,000 people compared to 1960.

Louisiana is bordered to the west by [[Texas]]; to the north by [[Arkansas]]; to the east by [[Mississippi]]; and to the south by the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The state may properly be divided into two parts, the uplands of the north, and the [[alluvial deposit|alluvial]] along the coast. The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).

The breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is 10–60 miles (15–100 km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15 km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3{{nbs}}m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.

The higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above [[sea level]] range from 10 feet (3{{nbs}}m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50–60 feet (15–18{{nbs}}m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163{{nbs}}m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]]. The [[Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority]] (CPRA) spends around $1{{nbs}}billion per year to help shore up and protect Louisiana [[shore]]line and land in both federal and state funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|title=Louisiana fights the sea, and loses|website=The Economist|access-date=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828163535/https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21727099-has-lessons-americas-climate-change-policy-louisiana-fights-sea-and-loses|archive-date=August 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Besides the waterways already named, there are the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine]], forming the western boundary; and the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl]], the eastern boundary; the [[Calcasieu River|Calcasieu]], the [[Mermentau River|Mermentau]], the [[Vermilion River (Louisiana)|Vermilion]], [[Bayou Teche]], the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]], the [[Boeuf River|Boeuf]], [[Bayou Lafourche]], the Courtableau River, Bayou D'Arbonne, the Macon River, the [[Tensas River|Tensas]], [[Amite River]], the [[Tchefuncte River|Tchefuncte]], the [[Tickfaw River|Tickfaw]], the [[Natalbany River]], and a number of other smaller streams, constituting a natural system of navigable waterways, aggregating over {{convert|4000|mi|km}} long.

The state also has political jurisdiction over the approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide portion of [[subsea]] land of the [[Outer continental shelf|inner continental shelf]] in the Gulf of Mexico. Through a peculiarity of the [[political geography]] of the United States, this is substantially less than the {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}}-wide jurisdiction of nearby states [[Texas]] and Florida, which, like Louisiana, have extensive Gulf coastlines.<ref name="Tulanian2008">{{Cite journal

The southern coast of Louisiana in the United States is among the fastest-disappearing areas in the world. This has largely resulted from human mismanagement of the coast (see [[Wetlands of Louisiana]]). At one time, the land was added to when spring floods from the Mississippi River added sediment and stimulated marsh growth; the land is now shrinking. There are multiple causes.<ref name="Keddy 2010">{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul|title=Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-51940-3|page=497}}</ref><ref>Ricardo A.

Artificial levees block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J. (1994).

===Geology===

{{Main|Mississippi River Delta}}

The Gulf of Mexico did not exist 250 million years ago when there was but one supercontinent, [[Pangea]]. As Pangea split apart, the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico opened. Louisiana slowly developed, over millions of years, from water into land, and from north to south.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} The oldest rocks are exposed in the north, in areas such as the [[Kisatchie National Forest]]. The oldest rocks date back to the early [[Cenozoic Era]], some 60 million years ago. The history of the formation of these rocks can be found in D. Spearing's ''Roadside Geology of Louisiana''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spearing |first=D. |year=1995 |title=Roadside Geology of Louisiana |publisher=Mountain Press Publishing Company |location=[[Missoula, Montana]] |pages=5–19 }}</ref>

The youngest parts of the state were formed during the last 12,000 years as successive deltas of the Mississippi River: the [[Maringouin, Louisiana|Maringouin]], [[Bayou Teche|Teche]], [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]], [[Bayou Lafourche|Lafourche]], the modern Mississippi, and now the [[Atchafalaya River|Atchafalaya]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=J.

Stone |date=1998 |title=Mississippi River Delta: an overview |journal=Journal of Coastal Research |volume=14 |pages=698–716 }}</ref> The sediments were carried from north to south by the Mississippi River.

In between the Tertiary rocks of the north, and the relatively new sediments along the coast, is a vast belt known as the [[Pleistocene]] Terraces. Their age and distribution can be largely related to the rise and fall of sea levels during past ice ages. In general, the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels, while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holland |first=W.C. |date=1944 |title=Physiographic divisions of the Quaternary lowlands of Louisiana |journal=Proceedings of the Louisiana Academy of Sciences |volume=8 |pages=10–24 }}</ref>

[[Salt dome]]s are also found in Louisiana. Their origin can be traced back to the early Gulf of Mexico when the shallow ocean had high rates of evaporation. There are several hundred salt domes in the state; one of the most familiar is [[Avery Island, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kniffen |first1=F. B. |author2=S. B.

Louisiana has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), with long, hot, humid summers and short, mild winters. The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.

Rain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.

Summers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging {{cvt|90|F}} or more, and overnight lows averaging above {{cvt|70|F}}. At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.

Temperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging {{convert|66|°F}}. The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging {{convert|59|°F}}. The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with {{convert|46|°F}} the average near the Gulf and an average low of {{convert|37|°F}} in the winter in the northern part of the state.

On occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near {{convert|20|°F}} occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.

Louisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the [[Upland and lowland|lowlands]] around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |access-date=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 [[tornado]]es annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state. Tornadoes are more common from January to March in the southern part of the state, and from February through March in the northern part of the state.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes"/>

It is estimated that more than two million people in the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf region]] were displaced by the hurricane and that more than 1,500 fatalities resulted in Louisiana alone. A public outcry criticized governments at the local, state, and federal levels, for lack of preparation and slowness of response. Louisiana residents relocated across the country for temporary housing, and many have not returned.

* October 3, 2002, [[Hurricane Lili|Lili]] (Category{{nbs}}1 at landfall)
* August 25, 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] (Category{{nbs}}3 at landfall) struck south-central Louisiana. It killed four people; knocked out power to nearly 150,000 citizens; and destroyed crops worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
* August 17, 1969, [[Hurricane Camille|Camille]] (Category{{nbs}}5) caused a {{convert|23.4|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} storm surge and killed 250 people. Although Camille officially made landfall in [[Mississippi]] and the worst damage occurred there, it also had effects in Louisiana, destroying thousands of residences in [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]]. New Orleans remained dry, with the exception of mild rain-generated flooding in the most low-lying areas.
* September 9, 1965, [[Hurricane Betsy|Betsy]] (Category{{nbs}}4 at landfall) came ashore near [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]], causing massive destruction as the first hurricane in history to cause a billion dollars in damage. The storm hit New Orleans and flooded nearly 35% of the city (including the [[Lower 9th Ward]], [[Gentilly, New Orleans|Gentilly]], and parts of [[Mid-City New Orleans|Mid-City]]), as well as most of [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]] and [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines]] parishes. The death toll in the state was 76.
* June 25, 1957, [[Hurricane Audrey|Audrey]] (Category{{nbs}}3) devastated southwest Louisiana, destroying or severely damaging 60–80 percent of the homes and businesses from [[Cameron, Louisiana|Cameron]] to Grand Chenier. 40,000 people were left homeless and more than 300 people in the state died.
* August 15–17, 1915: A hurricane made landfall just west of Galveston. Gales howled throughout Cameron and Vermilion Parishes and as far east as Mobile. It produced storm surge of 11 feet at Cameron (called Leesburg at the time), 10 feet at Grand Cheniere, and 9.5 feet at Marsh Island; Grand Isle reported water six feet deep across the city. The [[Lighthouse keeper|lightkeeper]] at the [[Sabine Pass Lighthouse|Sabine Pass lighthouse]] had to turn the lens by hand, as vibrations caused by the wave action put the clockwork out of order. At Sabine Bank, 17 miles offshore the Mouth of the Sabine, damage was noted. Damage estimates for Louisiana and Texas totaled around $50{{nbs}}million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecajuns.com/lahurricanes.htm#August_15-17th,_1915|title=Cajun and Cajuns: Genealogy site for Cajun, Acadian and Louisiana genealogy, history and culture|website=www.thecajuns.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209003420/http://thecajuns.com/lahurricanes.htm#August_15-17th,_1915|archive-date=December 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
** More than 300 people drowned about ten miles below [[Montegut, Louisiana|Montegut]]—four can be identified as white, none of the others have been identified and are assumed to be Indians. The settlement, called by the Indians Taire-bonne, is now in swamp and can be reached only by boat.

Owing to its location and geology, the state has high biological diversity. Some vital areas, such as southwestern prairie, have experienced a loss in excess of 98 percent. The pine flatwoods are also at great risk, mostly from [[Wildfire suppression|fire suppression]] and [[urban sprawl]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} There is not yet a properly organized system of natural areas to represent and protect Louisiana's biological diversity. Such a system would consist of a protected system of core areas linked by biological corridors, such as Florida is planning.<ref>Florida Greenways Commission. 1994. Report to the Governor.

One of Louisiana's largest government-owned areas is Kisatchie National Forest.

The system of government-owned [[Cypress dome|cypress swamps]] around [[Lake Pontchartrain]] is another large area, with southern [[wetland]] species including egrets, [[alligator]]s, and sturgeon. At least 12 core areas would be needed to build a "protected areas system" for the state; these would range from southwestern prairies, to the Pearl River Floodplain in the east, to the Mississippi River alluvial swamps in the north.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

====National Park Service====

Historic or scenic areas managed, protected, or otherwise recognized by the National Park Service include:
* [[Atchafalaya National Heritage Area]] in Ascension Parish;
* [[Cane River National Heritage Area]] near Natchitoches;
* [[Cane River Creole National Historical Park]] near Natchitoches;
* [[Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve]], headquartered in New Orleans, with units in St. Bernard Parish, Barataria (Crown Point), and Acadiana (Lafayette);
* [[Poverty Point National Monument]] at Delhi, Louisiana; and
* [[Saline Bayou]], a designated [[National Wild and Scenic River]] near [[Winn Parish]] in northern Louisiana.

====U.S. Forest Service====

* [[Kisatchie National Forest]] is Louisiana's only national forest. It includes 600,000 acres in central and north Louisiana with large areas of flatwoods and longleaf pine forest.

====State parks and recreational areas====

{{See also|List of Louisiana state parks|List of Louisiana state historic sites}}

Louisiana operates a system of 22 state parks, 17 state historic sites and one state [[Louisiana State Arboretum|preservation area]].

====Wildlife management areas====

Louisiana has 955,973 acres, in four [[ecoregion]]s under the [[List of Louisiana Wildlife Management Areas|wildlife management]] of the [[Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries]]. The Nature Conservancy also owns and manages a set of natural areas.

====Natural and scenic rivers====

The Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System provides a degree of protection for 51 rivers, streams and bayous in the state.

Protestants are concentrated in the northern and central parts of the state and in the northern tier of the [[Florida Parishes]]. According to the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2014, Louisiana's largest Protestant Christian denominations were the Southern Baptist Convention, non-denominational Evangelicals, the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention USA]], [[National Baptist Convention of America International, Inc.|National Baptist Convention of America]], [[Progressive National Baptist Convention]], [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]], the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopal]] and [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church|Christian Methodist Episcopal]] churches, the [[American Baptist Churches USA]] and [[United Methodist Church]].<ref name=":3" />

Because of French and Spanish heritage, and their descendants the Creoles, and later Irish, Italian, Portuguese and German immigrants, southern Louisiana and the Greater New Orleans area are predominantly Catholic.<ref>For Louisiana's position in a larger religious context, see [[Bible Belt]].</ref> Since Creoles were the first settlers, planters and leaders of the territory, they have traditionally been well represented in politics. For instance, most of the early governors were Creole Catholics.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Louisiana}}</ref> Because Catholics still constitute a significant fraction of Louisiana's population, they have continued to be influential in state politics. The high proportion and influence of the Catholic population makes Louisiana distinct among Southern states.<ref>Other Southern states have longstanding indigenous Catholic populations, and Florida's largely Catholic population of Cuban emigres has been influential since the 1960s. Yet, Louisiana is still unusual or exceptional in its extent of aboriginal Catholic settlement and influence. Among states in the [[Deep South]] (discounting [[Florida Panhandle|Florida's Panhandle]] and much of Texas) the historic role of Catholicism in Louisiana is unparalleled and unique. Among the states of the Union, Louisiana's unique use of the term ''parish'' (French ''la parouche'' or "la paroisse") for ''county'' is rooted in the pre-statehood role of Catholic church parishes in the administration of government.</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Baton Rouge|Diocese of Baton Rouge]] are the largest Catholic jurisdictions in the state, located within the Greater New Orleans and Greater Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical areas.

[[Jewish]] communities are established in the state's larger cities, notably New Orleans and Baton Rouge.<ref>Isaacs, Ronald H.

In 2000, before the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, its population was about 12,000. Louisiana was among the southern states with a significant Jewish population before the 20th century; Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia also had influential Jewish populations in some of their major cities from the 18th and 19th centuries. The earliest Jewish colonists were [[Sephardic Jews]] who immigrated with English colonists from London. Later in the 19th century, German Jews began to immigrate, followed by those from eastern Europe and the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Prominent Jews in Louisiana's political leadership have included Whig (later Democrat) [[Judah P.

Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02). Federal spending in 2005 and subsequent years since has been exceptionally high due to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina.

===Energy===


Louisiana is rich in petroleum and natural gas. Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in state-owned waters. In addition, vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. petroleum-producing region. Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS, Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about two percent of the total U.S. petroleum reserves.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Louisiana—State Energy Profile Analysis—U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url=https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=LA|access-date=2020-10-28|website=www.eia.gov}}</ref>

Louisiana's natural gas reserves account for about five percent of the U.S. total. The [[Haynesville Shale]] formation in parts of or all of Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River, and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world's fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Louisiana |date=June 12, 2008 |access-date=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206050811/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |archive-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Louisiana was the first site of [[Oil well|petroleum drilling]] over water in the world, on [[Caddo Lake]] in the northwest corner of the state. The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and [[Oil refinery|refining]], have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, Louisiana was sued several times by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Interior Department]], in efforts by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights. These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.

When petroleum and gas [[1973 oil crisis|boomed]] in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries. For example, in the 1970s over 40 percent of Louisiana's state revenues came directly from severance taxes and mineral royalties.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 2020|title=Mineral Revenues in Louisiana|url=https://www.lsu.edu/ces/publications/2020/mineral-revenues-in-louisiana-online-df.pdf|website=LSU Center for Energy Studies}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=October 2016|title=Oil Prices and the Louisiana Budget Crisis: Culprit or Scapegoat?

While the energy industry is still an important component of Louisiana's economy, the composition of this industry has changed dramatically over time. As of 2019 the refining and chemical manufacturing sector employs more people in Louisiana than the up-stream oil and gas extraction sector.<ref>{{Cite web|date=Fall 2019|title=Gulf Coast Energy Outlook|url=https://www.lsu.edu/ces/publications/2019/gceo2020.pdf|website=LSU Center for Energy Studies}}</ref>

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of Louisiana}}
[[File:CreoleFood.jpg|thumb|Typical dishes of [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]]]

Louisiana is home to many, especially notable are the distinct culture of the [[Louisiana Creoles]], typically people of color, descendants of free mixed-race families of the colonial and early statehood periods.

===African culture===

The French colony of ''La Louisiane'' struggled for decades to survive. Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AAME|url=http://www.inmotionaame.org/texts/viewer.cfm;jsessionid=f8301863741603865579076?id=5_000T&bhcp=1|access-date=2020-10-28|website=www.inmotionaame.org}}</ref> This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.

===Louisiana Creole culture===

[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |access-date=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archive-date=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word "Creole", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.

Over time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term "Creole" became associated with this class of [[Creoles of Color]], many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.

Wealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.

===Acadian culture===

The ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime. The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France. Some, who escaped the British, remained in [[French Canada]].

Others scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands. Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture. Until the 1970s, the term "Cajun" was considered somewhat derogatory.

===Isleño culture===

{{Main|Isleño (Louisiana)}}
[[File:El_Museo_de_los_Isleños.jpg|alt=|thumb|El Museo de los Isleños (Isleño Museum) in [[Saint Bernard, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]]]

A third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isleños. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchman]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.

In Louisiana, the Isleños originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=":02">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isleños: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|pages=i, 4}}</ref>

Through the centuries, the various Isleño communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isleños Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana. The [[Isleños Fiesta|Fiesta de los Isleños]] is celebrated annually in St. Bernard Parish which features heritage performances from local groups and the Canary Islands.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fink|first=Shawn|title=Photos: The Los Isleños Fiesta celebrates Canary Island immigrants, cultural heritage of St. Bernard|url=https://www.nola.com/multimedia/photos/collection_97e45d44-622f-11ea-b007-ef634a18db88.html|access-date=2020-10-28|website=NOLA.com|language=en}}</ref>

===Languages===

[[File:Native Languages of Louisiana.svg|thumbnail|The languages of historic Native American tribes that occupied what is now Louisiana include: Tunica, Caddo, Natchez, Choctaw, Atakapa, Chitimacha and Houma.]]

According to a 2010 study by the Modern Language Association, among persons five years old and older,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data|title=United States|publisher=[[Modern Language Association]]|access-date=September 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201170638/http://www.mla.org/map_data|archive-date=December 1, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> 91.26% of Louisiana residents speak only English at home, 3.45% speak French (standard French, French Creole, or Cajun French), 3.30% speak Spanish, and 0.59% speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

Historically, Native American peoples in the area at the time of European encounter were seven tribes distinguished by their languages: [[Caddo language|Caddo]], [[Tunica language|Tunica]], [[Natchez language|Natchez]], [[Houma language|Houma]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], and [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]]. Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages. Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east. Among these were [[Alabama language|Alabama]], Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples.

Starting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans. They established French culture and language institutions. They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages. In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery. In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French.

During the 19th century after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers. Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private. Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French. The [[Constitution of Louisiana#Louisiana Constitution of 1812|State Constitution of 1812]] gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread. Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French. The 1868 constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era]] before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prominence.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |title=The French Language in Louisiana Law and Legal Education: A Requiem |first=Roger K |last=Ward |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1997 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621233419/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |archive-date=June 21, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Several unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana. Dialects of the French language are: [[Colonial French]] and Houma French. [[Louisiana Creole French]] is the term for one of the Creole languages. Two unique dialects developed of the English language: [[Cajun English|Louisiana English]], a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as [[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]], which resembles the [[New York City English|New York City dialect]] sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical [[Brooklyn]]. Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish.
[[File:Signalisation routière bilingue à l'entrée de la Louisiane.jpg|thumb|Louisiana's bilingual state welcome sign, recognizing its French heritage]]

[[Louisiana French|Colonial French]] was the dominant language of white settlers in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] during the French colonial period; it was spoken primarily by the French Creoles (native-born). In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]], with a base in West African languages. The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language. French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings. English and its associated dialects became predominant after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, after which the area became dominated by numerous English speakers. In some regions, English was influenced by French, as seen with Louisiana English. [[Colonial French]], although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English.

Renewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the establishment of Canadian-modeled [[French immersion]] schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic French neighborhoods of New Orleans and [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]]. In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations. 

In 2018, Louisiana became the first US state to join the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] as an observer.<ref name="NOLA2018">{{cite news |author1=Della Hasselle |title=Louisiana joins international organization of French-speaking governments |url=https://www.nola.com/news/article_302082ef-9b0e-59de-8583-4e320c5c792a.html |access-date=26 August 2020 |work=NOLA.com |date=13 October 2018 |location=New Orleans, Louisiana |language=en}}</ref>

In 2000, of all of the states, Louisiana had the highest percentage of students in [[private schools]]. Danielle Dreilinger of ''[[The Times Picayune]]'' wrote in 2014 that "Louisiana parents have a national reputation for favoring private schools."<ref name="Dreilingerenrollmentfalls">{{cite web|author=Dreilinger, Danielle|url=https://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2014/02/private_school_enrollment_fall.html|title=Private school enrollment falls 5% in Louisiana, even more in New Orleans, Baton Rouge areas|newspaper=[[The Times Picayune]]|date=2014-02-03|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> The number of students in enrolled in private schools in Louisiana declined by 9% from circa 2000-2005 until 2014, due to the proliferation of [[charter schools]], the [[2008 recession]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]].

The [[Intracoastal Waterway]] is an important means of transporting commercial goods such as [[petroleum]] and petroleum products, agricultural produce, building materials and manufactured goods.

In 2011, Louisiana ranked among the five deadliest states for debris/litter-caused vehicle accidents per total number of registered vehicles and population size. Figures derived from the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]]<ref>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ref> show at least 25 persons in Louisiana were killed per year in motor vehicle collisions with non-fixed objects, including debris, dumped litter, animals and their carcasses.

[[File:LAGovMansion.JPG|right|thumb|The Louisiana Governor's Mansion]]

In 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.

The current Louisiana governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Bel Edwards]]. The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat. Louisiana had eight votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] for the [[2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana|2012 election]]. It lost one House seat due to stagnant population growth in the 2010 Census.

===Administrative divisions===

Louisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name="nativeamericans">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>
*[[List of parishes in Louisiana]]
*[[Louisiana census statistical areas]]

Most parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.

A more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor–council, council–manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.

===Civil law===

The Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term "[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]" (from the French: ''paroisse'') in place of "[[County (United States)|county]]" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].

Louisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.

While the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment, it is still considered the controlling authority in the state. Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U.S. states. While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name="kinsellalaw">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |access-date=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archive-date=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law. Thus property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law, as well as some aspects of criminal law, are still based mostly on traditional Roman legal thinking.

===Marriage===

In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a [[covenant marriage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |title=Covenant Marriage—Pros and Cons |publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=January 1, 2012 |access-date=February 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307225008/http://marriage.about.com/cs/covenantmarriage/a/covenant.htm |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a covenant marriage, the couple waives their right to a "no-fault" divorce after six months of separation, which is available in a traditional marriage.

From 1898 to 1965, a period when Louisiana had effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Civil War|disfranchised]] most African Americans and many poor whites by provisions of a new constitution,<ref name="GWUweb">{{cite web|title=Reading the Fine Print: The Grandfather Clause in Louisiana|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5352/|website=History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web|publisher=George Washington University|access-date=October 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031073422/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5352|archive-date=October 31, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> this was essentially a one-party state dominated by white Democrats. Elites had control in the early 20th century, before populist [[Huey Long]] came to power as governor.<ref name="Cashman">{{cite book|last=Cashman|first=Sean Dennis|title=African-Americans and the Quest for Civil Rights, 1900–1990|year=1991|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=9780814714416|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans00cash/page/8 8]|url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans00cash|url-access=registration|access-date=July 1, 2015}}</ref> In multiple acts of resistance, blacks left behind the segregation, violence and oppression of the state and moved out to seek better opportunities in northern and western industrial cities during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migrations]] of 1910–1970, markedly reducing their proportion of population in Louisiana. The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Since the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.

Louisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or "jungle primary") on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.

Congressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system—limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.

Louisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. The state lost a House seat at the end of the [[112th Congress]] due to stagnant population growth as recorded by the [[2010 United States Census]]. Louisiana is not classified as a "[[swing state]]" for future presidential elections, as since the late 20th century, it has regularly supported Republican candidates. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).

===Law enforcement===

{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}

Louisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]]. It began in 1922 with the creation of the Highway Commission. In 1927, a second branch, the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, was formed. In 1932, the State Highway Patrol was authorized to carry weapons.

On July 28, 1936, the two branches were consolidated to form the Louisiana Department of State Police; its motto was "courtesy, loyalty, service". In 1942, this office was abolished and became a division of the Department of Public Safety, called the Louisiana State Police. In 1988, the Criminal Investigation Bureau was reorganized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |title=Louisiana State Police—About Us—LSP History |publisher=Lsp.org |access-date=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504001036/http://www.lsp.org/about_hist.html |archive-date=May 4, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Its troopers have statewide jurisdiction with power to enforce all laws of the state, including city and parish ordinances. Each year, they patrol over 12 million miles (20 million km) of roadway and arrest about 10,000 impaired drivers. The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.
[[File:Spanish Town Mardi Gras 2015 - 15922509443.jpg|thumb|Mardi Gras celebrations in the Spanish Town section of Baton Rouge]]

The elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes. Orleans Parish is an exception, as the general law enforcement duties fall to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices. Orleans Parish divided sheriffs' duties between criminal and civil, with a different elected sheriff overseeing each aspect. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year.
