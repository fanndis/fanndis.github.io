'''''Chromatica''''' is the sixth studio album by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It was released on May 29, 2020, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Originally scheduled for April 10, 2020, the album's release was delayed for seven weeks, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Gaga and [[BloodPop]] served as the album's executive producers. ''Chromatica'' is a [[dance-pop]], [[synth-pop]] and [[electropop]] project with elements of [[House music|house]], [[Disco (music)|disco]] and other electronic genres. The album is named after an imaginary, [[Dystopia|dystopian]] planet, which the singer described as a place where "equality rules". The album covers themes of [[mental health]], trauma, self-worth, finding love through hardship, which contrasts its positive and [[uptempo]] production. It features guest vocals from [[Blackpink]], [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Elton John]].

Three singles were released to support the album. The lead single, "[[Stupid Love (Lady Gaga song)|Stupid Love]]", was released on February 28, 2020, and peaked inside the top-ten in over fifteen territories, reaching number five in the United Kingdom and United States. Its follow-up, "[[Rain on Me (Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande song)|Rain on Me]]" with Ariana Grande, arrived on May 22, 2020, and debuted atop the charts in the UK and the US. "[[Sour Candy (Lady Gaga and Blackpink song)|Sour Candy]]" was released as a [[Promotional recording#Promotional single|promotional single]] a day ahead of the album's launch, followed by a remix version of "[[Free Woman]]" at a later date. "[[911 (Lady Gaga song)|911]]" was released as the third single on September 18, 2020.  

Upon release, ''Chromatica'' received generally positive reviews from [[music critics]]. It debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart with 274,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, marking Gaga's sixth consecutive number-one album in the US. The album also topped the charts in several other countries, including Australia, France, Mexico, Ireland, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Scotland and the UK. It became the fastest selling album of the year in the UK, as well as the year's fastest selling [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] record. At the upcoming [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]], the album is nominated for [[Best Pop Vocal Album]], whilst "[[Rain on Me (Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande song)|Rain on Me]]" is nominated for [[Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]].

==Background==
In press interviews after announcing one final performance of her 2016 [[Dive Bar Tour (Lady Gaga)|Dive Bar Tour]], [[Lady Gaga]] hinted new music would be performed and released during the new leg's stop.

Talking about previous record ''Joanne'', Gaga admitted that it was an album that she made for her father, trying to heal his and her family's trauma. She later realized she "can't fix [her] dad", and called the album a "futile effort" to heal him. Her disappointment drove her into depression and chain-smoking, and writing ''Chromatica'' was her way for healing.<ref name="Beats1May" /> The singer added that her failed relationships also served as inspiration for writing new songs.<ref name="Beats1May" /> In an interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', she talked about how she was in a "dark place" when she started to work on the album, often feeling depressed and sad, saying: "I felt threatened by the things my career brought into my life and the pace of my life. I spent a lot of time in a sort of catatonic state of just not wanting to do anything. And then I finally, slowly started to make music and tell my story through my record."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/lady-gaga-dark-place-depression-making-chromatica/|last1=Jordan|first1=Julie|last2=Nelson|first2=Jeff|date=September 16, 2020|title=Lady Gaga Fell into a 'Dark Place' Before Making Her Latest Album: 'I Didn't Want to Be Myself'|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=September 19, 2020|archive-url=http://archive.today/2020.09.19-143028/https://people.com/music/lady-gaga-dark-place-depression-making-chromatica/|archive-date=September 19, 2020}}</ref>

[[BloodPop]] once again returned as an executive producer on Gaga's album, after co-producing all 11 tracks on the standard edition of ''Joanne''. Though he hadn't committed to making Gaga's follow-up LP, it changed after playing the demo of "[[Stupid Love (Lady Gaga song)|Stupid Love]]" to the singer at the Kansas City stop on her [[Joanne World Tour]].<ref name="EWproduction">{{Cite web |title=Lady Gaga's 'Chromatica' team reveals the history and future of her new era |url=https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/ |access-date=June 12, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |language=EN |first=Joey |last=Nolfi |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200613100924/https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/ |archive-date=June 13, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Gaga referred to BloodPop as the "centre" and her "nucleus" of production while creating the album,<ref name="Paper1">{{cite web |url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200330225855/https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |archive-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and said that they recorded the majority of the album while staying in her studio house, which used to be [[Frank Zappa]]'s old [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen|studio]].<ref name="Beats1Feb"/> She noted that she found the recording process difficult due to suffering from [[fibromyalgia]]; the severe pain made her unable to "get off the couch" to compose and record the songs. She cited BloodPop as the main reason she was able to finish the work, as he motivated her to "push forward" to continue the process, and also helped her to get over feeling "miserable" and depressed.<ref name="Paper1"/><ref name="Beats1Feb"/>
They talked about how almost every song on the album started with Gaga or the both of them playing the piano, and they "would build the track up after a semblance of a song existed".<ref name="EWproduction"/> Gaga divulged how her intuition had evolved since the production of her last album, especially with the "real" and "honest" nature of this record's production virtually halting her inclination to second guess her creative output.<ref name="Beats1Feb"/>

After starting the work together, Gaga and BloodPop begin recording the album with the involvement of various producers, whom they invited "based on their strengths to re-imagine the song or production."<ref name="EWproduction"/> Scottish musician [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]] was the first producer BloodPop recruited to work with them, and although her early demos did not make the album, he said they "still plan to finish those songs and present something special within the ''Chromatica'' universe."<ref name="EWproduction"/> Other involved producers included [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Skrillex]], [[Madeon]] (who had previously worked with Gaga on her third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]''), [[Tchami]], [[Boys Noize]] and Benjamin Rice.<ref name="booklet"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, Gaga said, "It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way. When they're inspired, they embroider things."<ref name="Paper1"/> Talking with [[Apple Music]]'s [[Zane Lowe]], she added that she had "never seen so many producers be willing to pass around music [...] and have it be a conversation",<ref name="Beats1Feb"/> and that every song had many different iterations as they were developing them to "sound the best that it could be" and "interpret what [she is] saying the best that it can interpret."<ref name="Beats1May"/> In an interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'', Gaga stated they wrote between 50 to 100 songs, saying "[...] I wanted to 'rinse' the record. I wanted to make sure there was nothing left inside me for this one."<ref>{{cite web|last=Uitti|first=Jacob|date=September 29, 2020|url=https://americansongwriter.com/rain-on-me-lady-gaga-song-interview/|title=Behind the Album: Lady Gaga Breaks Down What Went Into 'Chromatica'|work=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=October 5, 2020}}</ref>

After ''Chromatica'' was mostly finished, Gaga felt that the album had distinct acts, and "something about it felt cinematic". BloodPop recruited musician [[Morgan Kibby]] to compose three orchestral interludes to tie the album together. Kibby and Gaga spent two weeks working on the interludes, and assembled a 26-person orchestra to record the pieces.<ref name="EWproduction"/> Kibby explained that she sat down with Gaga and at looked at pictures, paintings, and films for references, and committed to creating musical pieces that match the energy of the album and can seamlessly connect to the already existing songs. She added: "The soul of the album was already there,  and so the arrangements were written with the intent to further amplify the nooks and crannies of the emotional themes; they became almost the [[Greek chorus]] of ''Chromatica''." The main theme they explored was "light and darkness, the push and pull... [of] our shared and relatable human experience." The compositions were finished only days before the album was mastered.<ref name="Kibby">{{Cite web |title=Lady Gaga Collaborator Morgan Kibby Discusses 'Chromatica' Interludes |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lady-gaga-morgan-kibby-m83-chromatica-1013139/|access-date=June 16, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |language=EN |first=Brittany |last=Spanos|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200618133851/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lady-gaga-morgan-kibby-m83-chromatica-1013139/|archive-date=June 18, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

So it's all the colors, all the sounds.. We're talking about inclusivity and life, and also a lot of what we see around us and what we're experiencing is math, which is very much like music and sound is math as well. So we talked about that, and then I sort of went back and I said, 'OK, well, yeah, it's inclusivity but it's really a way of thinking', it's not just, 'Oh, Chromatica, we're being inclusive with all the colors, all the people', and when I say, 'All the colors, all the people', I mean way more than we could possibly fathom.<ref name="Pitchfork2020"/>}}
