'''Sandringham House''' is a [[English country house|country house]] in the parish of [[Sandringham, Norfolk]], England. It is the private home of [[Elizabeth II]], whose father, [[George VI]], and grandfather, [[George V]], both died there. The house stands in a {{convert|20000|acre|adj=on}} estate in the [[Norfolk Coast AONB|Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The house is listed as Grade II* and the landscaped gardens, park and woodlands are on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England]].

The site has been occupied since [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times, when a large [[manor]] was constructed. This was replaced in 1771 by a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion for the owners, the Hoste Henleys. In 1836 Sandringham was bought by John Motteux, a London merchant, who already owned property in Norfolk and [[Surrey]]. Motteux had no direct heir, and on his death in 1843, his entire estate was left to Charles Spencer Cowper, the son of Motteux's close friend [[Emily Temple, Viscountess Palmerston]]. Cowper sold the Norfolk and the Surrey estates and embarked on rebuilding at Sandringham. He led an extravagant life, and by the early 1860s, the estate was mortgaged and he and his wife spent most of their time on the Continent.

In 1862 Sandringham and just under 8,000 acres of land were purchased for [[Edward VII|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], later Edward VII, as a country home for him and his fiancée, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]]. Between 1870 and 1900, the house was almost completely rebuilt in a style described by [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Pevsner]] as "[[Jacobethan|frenetic Jacobean]]". Edward also developed the estate, creating one of the finest [[hunting#Shooting traditions|shoots]] in England. Following his death in 1910, the estate passed to Edward's son and heir, George V, who described the house as "dear old Sandringham, the place I love better than anywhere else in the world".{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=530}} It was the setting for the first [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas broadcast]] in 1932. George died at the house on 20 January 1936. The estate passed to his son [[Edward VIII]] and, at [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|his abdication]], as the private property of the monarch, it was purchased by Edward's brother, George VI. George was as devoted to the house as his father, writing to his mother [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], "I have always been so happy here and I love the place". He died at Sandringham on 6 February 1952.

On the King's death, Sandringham passed to his daughter Elizabeth II. The Queen spends about two months each winter on the Sandringham Estate, including the anniversary of her father's death and of her own accession in early February. In 1957 she broadcast her first televised Christmas message from Sandringham. In the 1960s, plans were drawn up to demolish the house and replace it with a modern building, but these were not carried out. In 1977, for her [[Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]], the Queen opened the house and grounds to the public for the first time. Unlike the royal palaces, such as [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]], Sandringham and [[Balmoral Castle]] are the Queen's private homes.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Sandringham House - East Front.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|The East frontage|alt=view of front of house from drive]]
Sandringham is recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as "sant-Dersingham" and the land was awarded to a [[House of Normandy|Norman]] knight, Robert Fitz-Corbun after the [[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]].{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=145}} The local antiquarian Claude Messent, in his study ''The Architecture on the Royal Estate of Sandringham'', records the discovery of evidence of the pavements of a Roman villa.{{sfn|Messent|1974|p=19}} In the 15th century it was held by [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers|Anthony Woodville, Lord Scales]], brother-in-law to Edward IV. In the [[Elizabethan era]] a manor was built on the site of the present house, which, by the 18th century, came into the possession of the Hoste Henley family, descendants of Dutch refugees.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=146}} In 1771 Cornish Henley cleared the site to build a Georgian mansion, Sandringham Hall.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web|title=The History of Sandringham|url=https://www.sandringhamestate.co.uk/house-museum-and-gardens/history/|publisher=The Sandringham Estate|access-date=29 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034202/https://www.sandringhamestate.co.uk/house-museum-and-gardens/history/|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1834, Henry Hoste Henley died without issue, and the estate was bought at auction by John Motteux, a London merchant.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=147}} Motteux was also without heirs and bequeathed Sandringham, together with another Norfolk estate and a property in Surrey, to the third son of his close friend, [[Emily Temple, Viscountess Palmerston|Emily Lamb]], the wife of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]].{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=192}} At the time of his inheritance in 1843, Charles Spencer Cowper was a bachelor diplomat, resident in Paris. On succeeding to Motteux's estates, he sold the other properties and based himself at Sandringham.{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=193}} He undertook extensions to the hall, employing [[Samuel Sanders Teulon]] to add an elaborate porch and conservatory.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=31}} Cowper's style of living was extravagant—he and his wife spent much of their time on the Continent—and within 10 years the estate was mortgaged for £89,000.{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=193}} The death of their only child, Mary Harriette, from cholera in 1854 led the couple to spend even more time abroad, mainly in Paris, and by the early 1860s Cowper was keen to sell the estate.{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=194}}

===Edward VII===
In 1861 Queen Victoria's eldest son and heir, [[Edward VII|Albert Edward]], was approaching his twenty-first birthday. Edward's dissipated lifestyle had been disappointing to his parents, and his father, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], thought that marriage and the purchase of a suitable establishment were necessary to ground the Prince in country life and pursuits and lessen the influence of the [[Royal baccarat scandal|"Marlborough House set"]]{{efn|The Marlborough House set consisted of a group of Edward's friends, many of whose backgrounds or Jewish religion made them socially unacceptable in mid-Victorian England. The [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick|Countess of Warwick]], a mistress of Edward, recalled her class's dislike of the Prince's many Jewish friends: "We resented the introduction of the Jews into the social circle of the Prince of Wales&nbsp;... because they had brains. As a class, we did not like brains."{{sfn|King|2007|p=240}}}} with which he was involved.{{sfn|Matson|2011|p=17}} Albert had his staff investigate 18 possible country estates that might be suitable, including [[Newstead Abbey]] in Nottinghamshire and [[Houghton Hall]] in Norfolk.{{sfn|Walch|2012|pp=13–14}} The need to act quickly was reinforced by the [[Nellie Clifden]] affair, when Edward's fellow officers smuggled the actress into his quarters. The possibility of a scandal was deeply concerning to his parents.{{sfn|Matson|2011|p=17}} Sandringham Hall was on the list of the estates considered, and a personal recommendation to the Prince Consort from the [[Prime Minister]] Lord Palmerston, stepfather to the owner, swayed Prince Albert. Negotiations were only slightly delayed by Albert's death in December 1861—his widow declared, "His wishes – his plans – about everything are to be my law".{{sfn|Matson|2011|p=18}} The Prince visited in February 1862, and a sale was agreed for the house and just under 8,000 acres of land,{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=17}} which was finalised that October.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=18}} Queen Victoria only twice visited the house she had paid for.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=32}}{{efn|The architectural historian [[John Cornforth (historian)|John Cornforth]] suggests that the purchase was funded by the Prince himself, "out of the capital skilfully built up for him during his minority by his father".{{sfn|Cornforth|1988|pp=103–105}} [[A. N. Wilson]], in his biography of Queen Victoria, is clear that the Queen paid the bill.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=340}}}} Over the course of the next forty years, and with considerable expenditure, Edward was to create a house and country estate that his friend [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Charles Carington]]{{sfn|Plumptre|1995|p=90}} called "the most comfortable in England".<ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Joshua |date=23 February 2012 |title=Queen's Diamond Jubilee: The Queen's houses |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9098312/Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-The-Queens-houses.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref>

The price paid for Sandringham, £220,000, has been described as "exorbitant".{{sfn|Matson|2011|p=24}}{{sfn|Rose|2000|p=38}}{{efn|While exact comparisons are difficult, the [[Bank of England]]'s inflation calculator suggests a 2017 equivalent value in the order of £25M.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator |title=Inflation Calculator |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Bank of England |access-date=5 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005211045/https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator |archive-date=5 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}} This is questioned by Helen Walch, author of the estate's recent (2012) history, who shows the detailed analysis undertaken by the Prince Consort's advisers and suggests that the cost was reasonable.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=18}} The house was soon found to be too small to accommodate the Prince of Wales's establishment following his marriage in March 1863 and the many guests he was required, and desired, to entertain. In 1865, two years after moving in, the Prince commissioned [[A. J. Humbert]]{{sfn|Dixon|Muthesius|1993|p=260}} to raze the original hall and create a much larger building.{{efn|Humbert's involvement may have begun somewhat earlier. A pencil study dated ''circa'' 1862, shows a design with a massive new extension, in a [[Jacobethan]] style, standing at a right angle to the 18th-century hall.{{sfn|Physick|Darby|1973|p=64}}}}{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=627}} Humbert was an architect favoured by the royal family—"for no good reason", according to the architectural historian [[Mark Girouard]]—and had previously undertaken work for Queen Victoria at [[Osborne House]]{{sfn|Girouard|1979|p=419}} and at [[Frogmore House]].{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=31}} The new red-brick house was complete by late 1870; the only element of the original house of the Henley Hostes and the Cowpers that was retained was the elaborate conservatory designed by Teulon in the 1830s.{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=196}} Edward had this room converted into a billiard room.{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=196}} A plaque in the entrance hall records that "This house was built by Albert Edward Prince of Wales and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]] his wife in the year of our Lord 1870".{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=30}} The building was entered through a large [[porte-cochère]] straight into the main living room (the saloon), an arrangement that was subsequently found to be inconvenient. The house provided living and sleeping accommodation over three storeys, with attics and a basement.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=29}} The Norfolk countryside surrounding the house appealed to Alexandra, as it reminded her of her native Denmark.{{sfn|Battiscombe|1969|p=56}}

Within a decade, the house was again found to be too small,{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=530}} and in 1883 a new extension, the Bachelors' Wing,{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=530}} was constructed to the designs of a Norfolk architect, [[Robert William Edis|Colonel R. W. Edis]].{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=627}} Edis also built a new billiard room and converted the old conservatory into a bowling alley.{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=627}} The Prince of Wales had been impressed by one he had seen at [[Trentham Estate|Trentham Hall]],{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=32}} and the alley at Sandringham was modelled on an example from [[Offenbach am Main|Rumpelheim]], Germany.{{sfn|Robinson|1982|p=187}} In 1891, during preparations for the Prince of Wales's fiftieth birthday,{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=628}} a serious fire broke out when maids lit all the fires in the second-floor bedrooms to warm them in advance of the Prince's arrival.{{sfn|Matson|2011|p=83}}{{efn|The damage, through the collapse of the roof and by smoke and water, was considerable, but Humbert's efforts during construction to make the house fire-proof, combined with the actions of the estate fire brigade, averted greater loss.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=53}}}} Edis was recalled to undertake rebuilding and further construction. As he had with the Bachelors' Wing, Edis tried to harmonise these additions with Humbert's house by following the original [[Jacobethan]] style, and by using matching brickwork and [[Ketton stone]].{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=627}}

The house was up to date in its facilities, the modern kitchens and lighting running on gas from the estate's own plant<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/humbert/2.html |title=Sandringham House by A.

The royal couple's developments at Sandringham were not confined to the house; over the course of their occupation, the wider estate was also transformed. Ornamental and kitchen gardens were established, employing over 100 gardeners at their peak.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=45}} Many estate buildings were constructed, including cottages for staff, kennels, a school, a rectory and a staff clubhouse, the Babingley.{{sfn|Messent|1974|p=68}} Edward also made Sandringham one of the best sporting estates in England to provide a setting for the elaborate weekend shooting parties that became Sandringham's defining rationale.{{sfn|Hall|1994|p=168}} To increase the amount of daylight available during the shooting season, which ran from October to February,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://basc.org.uk/game-and-gamekeeping/quarry-species-shooting-seasons/ |title=Quarry Species Shooting Seasons |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=The British Association for Shooting and Conservation |access-date=5 July 2018 }}</ref> the Prince introduced the tradition of [[Sandringham Time]], whereby all the clocks on the estate were set half an hour ahead of [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]].

The meticulously maintained game books recorded annual bags of between 6,000 and 8,000 birds in the 1870s, rising to bags of over 20,000 a year by 1900.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=64}} The game larder, constructed for the storage of the carcasses, was inspired by that at [[Holkham Hall]] and was the largest in Europe.{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=197}}

Guests for Sandringham house parties generally arrived at [[Wolferton railway station]], 2.5 miles from the house, travelling in royal trains that ran from [[St Pancras Station]] to [[King's Lynn]] and then on to Wolferton. The station served the house from 1862 until its closure in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfertonroyalstation.co.uk/ |title=Wolferton Station, Norfolk |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Wolferton Royal Station |access-date=5 July 2018 }}</ref> Thereafter, the Queen travelled by car from King's Lynn.<ref>

On 14 January 1892, Edward's eldest son and heir, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], died of pneumonia at the house.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=33}} He is commemorated in the clock tower, which bears an inscription in Latin that translates as "the hours perish and will be charged to our account".{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=79}} Edward fell ill at Sandringham in early 1910 and died at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 6 May.{{sfn|Hattersley|2006|p=169}}

===George V===
In his will Edward VII left his widow £200,000 and a lifetime interest in the Sandringham estate.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=57}} Queen Alexandra's continued occupancy of the "big house" compelled George V, his wife, Queen Mary, and their expanding family to remain at York Cottage in the grounds, in rather "cramped" conditions.{{sfn|Aslet|2005|pp=284–285}} Suggestions from courtiers that Queen Alexandra might move out were firmly rebuffed by the King; "It is my mother's house, my father built it for her".{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=251}} The King also lacked the sociability of his father, and the shortage of space at York Cottage enabled him to limit the entertaining he undertook, with the small rooms reportedly reminding him of the onboard cabins of his naval career.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=83}}

The new King's primary interests, aside from his constitutional duties, were shooting and stamp collecting.{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=211}}{{efn|[[James Lees-Milne]], biographer of [[Harold Nicolson]], who was in turn the biographer of George V, recorded Nicolson's despair at how he would cover the period in the King's life between his retirement from the Navy and his accession: "How was he to deal with the long blank of the King's life..? During this time the Prince, as he then was, merely shot partridges and stuck stamps into albums. For seventeen years&nbsp;...he did absolutely nothing worthwhile at all".{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1981|p=237}}}} He was considered one of the best shots in England, and his collections of shotguns and stamps were among the finest in the world.{{efn|[[John Betjeman]] referenced both, and Sandringham House, in the first stanza of his poem, ''The Death of King George V'':

Even greater upheaval was occasioned by the outbreak of the [[First World War]], a dynastic struggle that involved many of his relatives, including the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Kaiser]] and the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Russian Emperor]], both of whom had previously been guests at Sandringham.{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=107}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfertonroyalstation.co.uk/monarchs-line/|title=Monarchs' Line – Wolferton Station|author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Wolferton Royal Station |access-date=5 July 2018 }}</ref>{{efn|The Kaiser's visit, in November 1902, was neither a social nor a political success, King Edward commenting on his guest's departure, "Thank God he's gone".{{sfn|Feuchtwanger|2006|p=248}}}} The estate and village of Sandringham suffered a major loss when all but two members of the King's Own Sandringham Company, a [[Territorial Force|territorial]] unit of the Fifth Battalion of the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]], were killed at [[Landing at Suvla Bay|Suvla Bay]] during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].{{sfn|Matson|2011|pp=125–126}} The story of the battalion was the subject of a [[BBC]] drama, ''[[All the King's Men (1999 film)|All the King's Men]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_the_kings_men_2000/ |title=All the King's Men (2000) |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=25 July 2018 }}</ref> A memorial to the dead was raised on the estate; the names of those killed in the Second World War were added subsequently.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk/memorial/104321 |title=Sandringham Estate |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=War Memorials Online |access-date=8 July 2018 }}</ref>

===Edward VIII===
On the night of his father's death, Edward VIII summarily ordered that the clocks at Sandringham be returned to [[Greenwich Mean Time]], ending the tradition of [[Sandringham time]] begun by his grandfather over 50 years earlier.{{sfn|Windsor|1998|p=241}} Edward had rarely enjoyed his visits to Sandringham, either in his father's time or that of his grandfather. He described a typical dinner at the house in a letter to his then mistress [[Freda Dudley Ward]], dated 26 December 1919; "it's too dull and boring for words. Christ how any human beings can ever have got themselves into this pompous secluded and monotonous groove I just can't imagine". In another letter, evenings at the "big house"—Edward stayed at York Cottage with his father—were recorded as "sordidly dull and boring".{{sfn|Windsor|1998|p=231}} His antipathy to the house was unlikely to have been lessened by his late father's will, which was read to the family in the saloon at the house. His brothers were each left £750,000 while Edward was bequeathed no monetary assets beyond the revenues from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. A codicil also prevented him from selling the late King's personal possessions; Lascelles described the inheritance as "the Kingship without the cash".{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=216}}{{efn|Lascelles's final verdict on the man he had served as Prince of Wales and King was damning, "I wasted the best years of my life in (his) service".<ref>{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Kenneth |date=17 December 2006 |title=A most devoted subject and a most exacting critic |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3657397/A-most-devoted-subject-and-a-most-exacting-critic.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref>}}

Edward's concerns regarding his income led him immediately to focus on the expense associated with running his late father's private homes. Sandringham he described as a "voracious [[white elephant]]",{{sfn|Windsor|1951|p=292}} and he asked his brother, the [[George VI|Duke of York]] to undertake a review of the management of the estate,{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=94}} which had been costing his father £50,000 annually in subsidies at the time of his death.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=89}} The review recommended significant retrenchments, and its partial implementation caused considerable resentment among the dismissed staff. Edward spent a single night of his reign at the house, bringing [[Wallis Simpson]] for a shooting party in October 1936.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=91}} The party was interrupted by a request to meet with prime minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], and having arrived on a Sunday, the King returned to [[Fort Belvedere, Surrey|Fort Belvedere]] the next day.{{sfn|Windsor|1951|pp=315–316}} He never returned to Sandringham; and, his attention diverted by the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|impending crisis]] arising from his attachment to Simpson, within two months of his only visit to the house as King, he had abdicated.<ref>{{cite news |title=Edward VIII: Abdication timeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2701463.stm |work=BBC News |date=29 January 2003 }}</ref> On his abdication, as Sandringham and [[Balmoral Castle]] were the private property of the monarch, it was necessary for King George VI to purchase both properties.

===Elizabeth II===
Since King George VI's death, Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s custom has been to spend the anniversary of that and of her own [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II#United Kingdom|accession]] privately with her family at Sandringham House, and, more recently, to use it as her official base from [[Christmas]] until February.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/a13938267/sandringham-estate-castle-history-photos/|title=Meghan Markle to join the Queen for Christmas at Sandringham|first=Chanel|last=Vargas|date=13 December 2017|work=Town and Country}}</ref> In celebrating Christmas at Sandringham, the Queen follows the tradition of her last three predecessors, whereas her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, held her celebrations at [[Windsor Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/themes/trails/a-royal-christmas|title=Royal Christmas|publisher=The Royal Collection Trust|access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref> The taxation arrangements of the monarch meant that no [[Inheritance Tax in the United Kingdom|inheritance tax]] was paid on the Sandringham or Balmoral estates when they passed to the Queen, at a time when it was having a deleterious effect on other country estates.{{sfn|Cahill|2001|p=65}} On her accession, the Queen asked her husband, the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], to take on the responsibility for the management of the estate.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=105}} The Duke has worked to move towards self-sufficiency,{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=220}} generating additional income streams, taking more of the land in hand, and amalgamating many of the smaller tenant farms.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=113}}

In January 1957 the Queen received the resignation of the Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] at the house. Eden's wife, [[Clarissa Eden|Clarissa]], recorded the event in her diary, "8 January – Anthony has to go through a Cabinet and listening to [[Harold Macmillan|Harold]] prosing for half an hour. Then by train to Sandringham. Many photographers. We arrive into the hall where everyone is looking at the television."{{sfn|Eden|2007|p=262}} At the end of that year, the Queen made her first televised Christmas broadcast from Sandringham.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=1}} In the 1960s, plans were initiated to demolish the house and replace it with a modern residence by [[David Roberts (architect)|David Roberts]], an architect who worked mainly at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=628}} The plans were not taken forward, but modernisation of the interior of the house and the removal of a range of ancillary buildings were carried out by [[Hugh Casson]], who also decorated the [[HMY Britannia|Royal Yacht, ''Britannia'']].{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=628}} In 1977, for her silver jubilee, the Queen opened the house to the public.<ref name="auto3"/>

==Architecture and description==
[[File:Sandringham House 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|The [[porte-cochère]] to the saloon, with the entrance to Edis's ballroom on the left|alt=entrance front of house with porte-cochère]]
The house is mainly constructed of red brick with [[limestone]] [[Ashlar|dressings]]; [[Carrstone|Norfolk Carrstone]] is also prevalent, particularly in Edis's additions.{{sfn|Messent|1974|p=21}} The tiled roof contains nine separate clusters of chimneystacks.<ref name="auto1">{{NHLE|num=1001017|desc=Sandringham House, Sandringham |accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref> The style is [[Jacobethan]], with inspiration drawn principally from nearby [[Blickling Hall]].{{sfn|Robinson|1982|p=187}}{{efn|There are also similarities with [[Somerleyton Hall]], built some 30 years before in neighbouring [[Suffolk]]. That house was used as the stand-in for Sandringham House in the 2003 television drama ''[[The Lost Prince]]'', about the life of [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|Prince John]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Tyzack |first=Anna |date=4 April 2015 |title=Stately Homes open this Easter |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11514269/10-stately-homes-open-this-Easter.html |work=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref>}} Construction was undertaken by Goggs Brothers of [[Swaffham]].<ref name="auto"/> The principal rooms of the house are the saloon, the drawing room, the dining room and the ballroom, together with rooms devoted to sports, such as the gun room, or leisure, such as the bowling alley, now a library, and the billiard room.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|pp=3–9}} The walls of the corridors connecting the principal rooms display a collection of [[Orient]]al and Indian arms and armour,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sandringhamestate.co.uk/house-museum-and-gardens/sandringham-house/|title=Sandringham House History|publisher=The Sandringham Estate|access-date=5 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143401/https://www.sandringhamestate.co.uk/house-museum-and-gardens/sandringham-house/|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> gathered by Edward VII on his tour of the East in 1875–1876.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=3}} Decoration of the house and the provision of furniture and fittings was undertaken by [[Holland and Sons]] in the 1870 rebuilding.<ref name="auto"/>

===Saloon===
The largest room in the house, the saloon is used as the main reception room.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|pp=3–9}} The arrangement of entry under the [[porte-cochère]] direct into the saloon proved problematic, with no ante-room in which guests could remove their hats and coats.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=29}} Jenkins describes the decorative style, here and elsewhere in the house, as "[[Osbert Lancaster]]'s [[Curzon Street Baroque]]".{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=530}} The room contains portraits of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] by their favourite artist [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]].{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|pp=3–9}} The saloon functioned as a venue for dances, until the construction of the new ballroom by Edis,{{sfn|Girouard|1979b|p=36}} and has a [[minstrels' gallery]] to accommodate musicians.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=29}} The room contains a weighing machine; Edward VII was in the habit of requiring his guests to be weighed on their arrival, and again on their departure, to establish that his lavish hospitality had caused them to put on weight.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=29}}

===Drawing room===
The drawing room is described by Jenkins as "the nearest Sandringham gets to pomp".{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=530}} On one of her two visits to the house, Victoria recorded in her journal that, after dinner, the party adjourned to "the very long and handsome drawing room with painted ceiling and two fireplaces".{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=3}} The room contains portraits of Queen Alexandra and her daughters, [[Louise, Princess Royal|Princess Louise]], [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]], and [[Princess Maud of Wales]], by [[Edward Hughes (artist)|Edward Hughes]].{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=5}} White marble statues complete what has been described as a "tour de force of fashionable late-Victorian decoration".<ref name="auto"/>

===Ballroom===
The ballroom was added by Edis in 1884, to overcome the inconvenience of having only the saloon as the major room for entertaining. As this was also the main family living room, it had previously been necessary to remove the furniture when the saloon was required for dances and large entertainments. Alexandra recorded her delight at the result, "Our new ballroom is beautiful I think & a great success & avoids pulling the hall to pieces each time there is a ball or anything".{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=9}} At the time of Queen Victoria's visit in 1889, the room was used for a theatrical performance given by [[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]] and [[Ellen Terry]].{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=52}} The present Queen uses the room for entertainments and as a cinema.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=9}}

===Dining room===
[[File:Sandringham eetkamer.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The dining room|alt=green-painted, panelled dining room with table set for dinner]]
The walls of the dining room are decorated with Spanish tapestries including some by [[Goya]] which were a gift from [[Alfonso XII of Spain]].{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=7}} The walls are panelled in oak, painted light green for [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] who had been inspired by a visit to a Scottish castle.{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=89}}{{efn|A 2008 article in the magazine ''Country Life'' suggests that the decoration was undertaken for [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1938, following a visit to [[Braemar Castle]].<ref name="auto"/>}} Jill Franklin's study of the planning of Victorian country houses includes a photograph of the dining room at Sandringham with the table laid for dinner for twenty-four, a "very usual" number to seat for dinner in a major country house of the time.{{sfn|Franklin|1981|p=51}}

===Appreciation===
Sandringham House has not been admired by critics. Its chief fault is the lack of harmony between Humbert's original building and Edis's extensions, "a contrast between the northern and southern halves of the house (that) has been much criticised ever since".{{sfn|Walch|2012|p=53}} The architectural historian [[John Martin Robinson]] wrote in 1982, "Sandringham, the latest in date of the houses of the British monarchy, is the least distinguished architecturally".{{sfn|Robinson|1982|p=187}} In his biography of Queen Mary, [[James Pope-Hennessy]] compared the house unfavourably to "a golf-hotel at St Andrews or a station-hotel at Strathpeffer".{{sfn|Hall|1994|p=168}} [[Simon Jenkins]] considered Sandringham "unattractive", with a "grim, institutional appearance".{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=530}} Pevsner described the architectural style as "frenetic";{{sfn|Pevsner|Wilson|2002|p=627}} Girouard expressed himself perplexed as to the preference shown by the royal family for A. J. Humbert,{{sfn|Girouard|1979|p=419}} a patronage the writer Adrian Tinniswood described as "the Victorian Royal Family's knack for choosing second-rate architects".{{sfn|Tinniswood|2016|p=47}} An article on the house in the June 1902 edition of ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' opined, "of mere splendour there is not much, but of substantial comfort a good deal".{{sfn|Cornforth|1988|pp=103–105}} The writer [[Clive Aslet]] suggests that the sporting opportunities offered by the estate were the main attraction for its royal owners, rather than "the house itself, which even after rebuilding was never beguiling".{{efn|Queen Elizabeth II had a more ambivalent attitude to the house's merits than either her father or her grandfather. James Pope-Hennessy recorded a conversation with the Queen's aunt, [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], in May 1957. "[We] discussed Sandringham and how ugly it is. Princess Alice said that she had 'once asked [[Elizabeth II|Lilibet]] shall I burn the house down for you? I'm quite ready to. Would you mind?' To which the Queen had answered 'I am not sure whether I should mind'."{{sfn|Pope-Hennessy|2019|p=211}}}}{{sfn|Aslet|2005|pp=284–285}}

The fittings and furnishings were also criticised; the biographer of George V, [[Kenneth Rose]], wrote that, "except for some tapestries given by Alfonso XII,{{efn|These were the [[Goya]] tapestries hung in the dining room.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=7}}}} Sandringham had not a single good picture, piece of furniture or other work of art".{{sfn|Rose|2000|p=291}} Neither Edward VII nor his heir were noted for their artistic appreciation; writing of the redevelopments at Buckingham Palace undertaken by George V, and previously by Edward VII, the architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote that, "the King had no more aesthetic sensibility than his father and expressed impatience with his wife's keen interest in furniture and decoration".{{sfn|Robinson|1982|p=189}} In the series of articles on the house and estate published in 1902 by ''Country Life'' to celebrate Edward VII's accession, the author noted the royal family's "set policy of preferring those pictures that have ''associations'' to those which have merely artistic merit".{{sfn|Hall|1994|p=168}} Exceptions came to include works from the collection of mainly 20th-century English art assembled by the Queen Mother, including pieces by [[Edward Seago]] and [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], who produced a view of Sandringham.

Although not highly regarded as architecture, Sandringham is a rare extant example of a full-scale Victorian country house, described in the magazine ''Country Life'' as "lived in and beautifully maintained, complete with its original contents, gardens and dependent estate buildings".<ref name="auto"/> The house, the landscaped gardens, park and woodlands are listed [[listed building|Grade II*]] on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]], Grade II* being the second-highest listing, reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref name="auto1"/>

===Wood Farm===
{{Main|Wood Farm}}
[[Wood Farm]] has been part of the Sandringham Estate since the time of Edward VII. In the early 20th century, it was home to [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|Prince John]], the youngest of George V and Queen Mary's six children. Born in 1905, the Prince was epileptic, and spent much of his life in relative seclusion at Sandringham.{{sfn|Judd|2012|p=15}} He died at Wood Farm, his home for the last two years of his life, on 18 January 1919.<ref>

===York Cottage===
[[File:York Cottage.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|right|York Cottage|alt=view of large cottage across lake]]
{{Main|York Cottage}}
[[York Cottage]], originally known as Bachelors' Cottage, was built by Edward, Prince of Wales, soon after he acquired Sandringham to provide further accommodation for guests.<ref>{{cite journal|last =Windsor|first =the Duke of|title=A Royal Boyhood|journal=[[Life Magazine]]|date=8 December 1947|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118}}</ref> It was home to [[George V]] from 1893 until his mother's death enabled him to move into the main house in 1925.{{sfn|Mackworth-Young|Ransom|1993|p=13}} Edward VIII, by then Duke of Windsor, told his father's biographer Harold Nicolson, "Until you have seen York Cottage you will never understand my father".{{sfn|Nicolson|1968|p=176}} The cottage was no more highly regarded architecturally than the main house; [[James Pope-Hennessy]], the official biographer of Queen Mary, called it, "tremendously vulgar and emphatically, almost defiantly hideous".{{efn|Pope-Hennessy was often no more impressed by the courtiers and staff he encountered during his research visits to Sandringham. Of Lady Willans, widow of one of the royal doctors, he wrote: "She told me several totally pointless anecdotes&nbsp;...[she] is one of those numerous and obeisant throng of royal snobs which flourish like fungi in the shadow of royalty."{{sfn|Pope-Hennessy|2019|p=90}}}}{{sfn|Titchmarsh|2014|p=212}} Nicolson described it as a "glum little villa (with) rooms indistinguishable from those of any [[Surbiton]] or [[Upper Norwood]] home".{{sfn|Rose|2000|p=97}} He was particularly dismissive of the royal bathing arrangements: "Oh my God! what a place. The King's and Queen's baths had lids that shut down so that when not in use they could be used as tables".{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1981|p=237}} "It is almost incredible that the heir to so vast a heritage lived in this horrible little house."{{sfn|Nicolson|1968|p=176}} Nicolson's strictures did not appear in his official biography of the King. York Cottage is currently the estate office for the Sandringham Estate.{{sfn|Rose|2000|p=98}}
