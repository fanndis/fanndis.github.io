[[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] nominated Reno on February 11, 1993, and the Senate confirmed her the following month.

Reno was born and raised in [[Miami Florida|Miami, Florida]]. After leaving to attend [[Cornell University]] and [[Harvard Law School]], she returned to Miami where she started her career at private law firms.

In 1994, Reno tasked the Justice Department with compiling a report on DNA exoneration. The science was still new at that point in time. Reno commissioned the report after reading about the exoneration of a death row inmate. She wanted to know how many cases existed like the one she read about and what the Department of Justice could learn from it. The resulting report concluded there was a strong possibility that many more wrongful convictions that could be cleared with DNA evidence existed.
