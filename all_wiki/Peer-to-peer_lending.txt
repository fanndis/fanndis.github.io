'''Peer-to-peer lending''', also abbreviated as '''P2P lending''', is the practice of [[loan|lending]] money to individuals or businesses through online services that match lenders with borrowers. Peer-to-peer lending companies often offer their services online, and attempt to operate with lower [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] and provide their services more cheaply than traditional financial institutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} As a result, lenders can earn higher returns compared to [[saving]]s and [[investment]] products offered by banks, while borrowers can borrow money at lower interest rates,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lendingmemo.com/peer-to-peer-lending-return/|title=P2P Lending: What is an Expected Return?

Also known as ''crowdlending'', many peer-to-peer loans are [[unsecured loan|unsecured]] [[Loan#Personal or commercial|personal loans]], though some of the largest amounts are lent to businesses. Secured loans are sometimes offered by using luxury assets such as jewelry, watches, vintage cars, fine art, buildings, aircraft, and other business assets as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. They are made to an individual, company or charity. Other forms of peer-to-peer lending include student loans, commercial and real estate loans, payday loans, as well as secured business loans, [[lease|leasing]], and [[Factoring (finance)|factoring]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moenninghoff, S., Wieandt, A.|title=The Future of Peer-to-Peer Finance|ssrn=2439088|journal=Zeitschrift für Betriebswirtschaftliche Forschung|date=2014-05-20}}</ref>

The [[interest rate]]s can be set by lenders who compete for the lowest rate on the [[reverse auction]] model or fixed by the intermediary company on the basis of an analysis of the borrower's credit.<ref name="ab1"/> The lender's investment in the loan is not normally protected by any government guarantee. On some services, lenders mitigate the risk of [[bad debt]] by choosing which borrowers to lend to, and mitigate total risk by diversifying their investments among different borrowers.

The lending intermediaries are for-profit businesses; they generate revenue by collecting a one-time fee on funded loans from borrowers and by assessing a loan servicing fee to investors (tax-disadvantaged in the UK vs charging borrowers) or borrowers (either a fixed amount annually or a percentage of the loan amount). Compared to [[stock market]]s, peer-to-peer lending tends to have both less [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] and less [[liquidity]].<ref>J. D. Roth [http://business.time.com/2012/11/15/taking-a-peek-at-peer-to-peer-lending/ Taking a Peek at Peer-to-Peer Lending] [[Time (magazine)|Time]] November 15, 2012; Accessed March 22, 2013.</ref>

==Characteristics==
Peer-to-peer lending does not fit cleanly into any of the three traditional types of financial institutions—deposit takers, investors, insurers<ref name="mab"/>—and is sometimes categorized as an [[Alternative financial services|alternative financial service]].<ref name="Bradley"/>

Typical characteristics of peer-to-peer lending are:
* it is sometimes conducted for profit;
* no necessary common bond or prior relationship between lenders and borrowers;
* intermediation by a peer-to-peer lending company;
* transactions take place [[online]];
* lenders may often choose which borrowers to invest in, if the [[peer-to-peer|P2P]] platform offers that facility;
* the loans can be unsecured or secured and are not normally protected by government insurance;
* loans are securities that can be transferred to others, either for debt collection or profit, though not all P2P platforms provide transfer facilities or free pricing choices and costs can be very high, tens of percent of the amount sold, or nil.

Early peer-to-peer lending was also characterized by [[disintermediation]] and reliance on [[social network]]s but these features have started to disappear. While it is still true that the emergence of [[internet]] and [[e-commerce]] makes it possible to do away with traditional [[financial intermediary|financial intermediaries]] and that people may be less likely to default to the members of their own social communities, the emergence of new intermediaries has proven to be time and cost saving. Extending [[crowdsourcing]] to unfamiliar lenders and borrowers opens up new opportunities.

Most peer-to-peer intermediaries provide the following services:
* online [[investment platform]] to enable borrowers to attract lenders and investors to identify and purchase loans that meet their investment criteria
* development of credit models for loan approvals and pricing
* verifying borrower identity, bank account, employment and income
* performing borrower credit checks and filtering out the unqualified borrowers
* processing payments from borrowers and forwarding those payments to the lenders who invested in the loan
* [[Loan servicing|servicing loans]], providing customer service to borrowers and attempting to collect payments from borrowers who are delinquent or in default
* legal compliance and reporting
* finding new lenders and borrowers (marketing)

In 2012, the UK government invested £20 million into British businesses via peer to peer lenders. A second investment of £40 million was announced in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-40-million-investment-by-british-business-bank-to-support-450-million-of-lending-to-smaller-businesses | title=New £40 million investment by British Business Bank to support £450 million of lending to smaller businesses | publisher=[[gov.uk]] | date=February 25, 2015}}</ref> The intention was to bypass the high street banks, which were reluctant to lend to smaller companies.

Since April 2014, the peer-to-peer lending industry has been regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/1d7a4a16-4061-11e2-8e04-00144feabdc0 | title =Government boost for peer-to-peer lending | work=[[Financial Times]] | first=Jonathan | last=Moules | date=December 7, 2012 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> to increase accountability with standard reporting and facilitate the growth of the sector.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-11/funding-circle-said-to-tap-goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-for-ipo | title=Funding Circle Picks Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley for IPO | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=March 11, 2018}}</ref> Peer-to-peer investments do not qualify for protection from the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]] (FSCS), which provides security up to £75,000 per bank, for each saver,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fscs.org.uk/news/2015/july/new-deposit-protection-limit-coming-on-1-january/|title=New deposit protection limit coming on 1 January | publisher=[[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]]}}</ref> but regulations mandate the companies to implement arrangements to ensure the servicing of the loans even if the platform goes bust.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.moneysupermarket.com/money-made-easy/peer-to-peer-fca-confirms-new-rules/ |title=Peer-to-peer: FCA rules explained}}</ref>

In 2015, UK peer-to-peer lenders collectively lent over £3bn to consumers and businesses.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/pushing-boundaries-the-2015-uk-alternative-finance-industry-report/ | title=Pushing boundaries: the 2015 UK alternative finance industry report | first1=Jonathan | last1=Bone | first2=Peter | last2=Baeck | work=[[Nesta (charity)|Nesta]] | date=16 February 2016}}</ref>

According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (Entrenching Innovation Report), £3.55B was attributed to Peer to Peer alternative finance models, the largest growth area being property showing a rise of 88% from 2015 to 2016.<ref>https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-12-21-ccaf-entrenching-innov.pdf</ref>

===United States===
The peer-to-peer lending industry in the US started in February 2006 with the launch of [[Prosper Marketplace]], followed by [[Lending Club]].<ref name="techcrunch12"/> Both Prosper and Lending Club are headquartered in San Francisco, California.<ref name="forbes12"/> Early peer-to-peer platforms had few restrictions on borrower eligibility, which resulted in adverse selection problems and high borrower default rates. In addition, some investors viewed the lack of [[liquidity]] for these loans, most of which have a minimum three-year term, as undesirable.<ref name="Bradley"/>

In 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) required that peer-to-peer companies register their offerings as [[Security (finance)|securities]], pursuant to the [[Securities Act of 1933]].<ref name="techcrunch12"/><ref name="ft4-12"/> The registration process was an arduous one; Prosper and Lending Club had to temporarily suspend offering new loans,<ref name="wsj09"/><ref name="techcrunch8"/><ref name="peerlend"/><ref name="LC_quietperiod"/> while others, such as the U.K.-based Zopa Ltd., exited the U.S. market entirely.<ref name="wsj09"/> Both Lending Club and Prosper gained approval from the SEC to offer investors notes backed by payments received on the loans. Prosper amended its filing to allow banks to sell previously funded loans on the Prosper platform.<ref name="Bradley"/> Both Lending Club and Prosper formed partnerships with FOLIOfn to create a secondary market for their notes, providing liquidity to investors.<ref name="wsj10"/> Lending Club had a voluntary registration at this time, whereas Prosper had mandatory registration for all members.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-04-06/peer-to-peer-lending-problems-and-promise |title=Peer-to-Peer Lending: Problems and Promise | first=David | last=Bogoslaw | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=April 6, 2009}}</ref>

This addressed the liquidity problem and, in contrast to traditional securitization markets, resulted in making the loan requests of peer-to-peer companies more transparent for the lenders and secondary buyers who can access the detailed information concerning each individual loan (without knowing the actual identities of borrowers) before deciding which loans to fund.<ref name="wsj09"/> The peer-to-peer companies are also required to detail their offerings in a regularly updated [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]]. The SEC makes the reports available to the public via [[EDGAR]] (Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval).

More people turned to peer-to-peer companies for borrowing following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] because banks refused to increase their loan portfolios. The peer-to-peer market also faced increased investor scrutiny because borrowers' defaults became more frequent and investors were unwilling to take on unnecessary risk.<ref name="ft11"/>

Lending Club is the largest peer-to-peer lender in US based upon issued loan volume and revenue, followed by Prosper.<ref name="techcrunch12"/><ref name="forbes12"/> Lending Club is also the largest peer-to-peer lending platform worldwide.<ref>{{cite news | author=Schumpeter | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2013/01/lending-club | title=Peer review | work=[[The Economist]] | date=January 5, 2013}}</ref>  The interest rates range from 5.6%-35.8%, depending on the loan term and borrower rating.<ref name="consaction"/> The default rates vary from about 1.5% to 10% for the more risky borrowers.<ref name="forbes12"/> Executives from traditional financial institutions are joining the peer-to-peer companies as board members, lenders and investors,<ref name="ft6-12"/><ref name="tc12"/> indicating that the new financing model is establishing itself in the mainstream.<ref name="ft4-12"/>

===China===
Many micro loan companies have emerged to serve the 40 million SMEs, many of which receive inadequate financing from state-owned banks, creating an entire industry that runs alongside big banks.

As the Internet and [[e-commerce]] grew in the 2000s, many P2P lenders were founded with various target customers and business models.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2014/11/57456-china-different-categories-peer-peer-lending-platforms/ | title=China: The Different Categories of Peer to Peer Lending Platforms | first=Yangjie | last=She | publisher=Crowdfund Insider| date=November 28, 2014 }}</ref>

In June and July 2018, scores of Chinese online P2P lending platforms fell into financial or legal troubles because of tightened regulation and liquidity. According to WDZJ.com, a P2P industry information provider, 23 P2P platforms were reported to be in financial distress or under investigation in the first 10 days of July. That follows 63 such cases in June, a higher number than in any month in the previous year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-08-13/regulators-pledge-to-help-p2p-investors-comes-with-warning-101314552.html|title=Regulators' Pledge to Help P2P Investors Comes With Warning - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref>

In late June, Shanghai police detained four senior executives of Tangxiaoseng, an online lending platform controlled by Zibang Financial Service Internet Technology Co.

[[People's Bank of China]] announced in early July 2018 said that regulators will extend a two-year-old nationwide campaign to clean up fraud and violations in the online financial market, targeting P2P and other online lending and financial activities. More than 5,000 operations have been shut down since the campaign began in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-07-10/china-vows-continued-tight-grip-on-internet-finance-101297647.html|title=China Vows Continued Tight Grip on Internet Finance - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}</ref>

Latvian P2P lending market is developing very rapidly. In Q2 2018 Latvian P2P platforms lent Eur 271.8 million and Eur 1.7 Billion cumulatively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lafpa.lv/en/statistics|title=Alternative financial services association of Latvia|website=LAFPA|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Currently, the most active investors in Latvia's peer-to-peer lending platforms are residents of Germany, Great Britain, and Estonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lafpa.lv/en/association-486-million-euro-invested-using-latvian-peer-to-peer-lending-platforms-in-2017|title=ASSOCIATION: 486 MILLION EURO INVESTED USING LATVIAN PEER-TO-PEER LENDING PLATFORMS IN 2017|date=2018-02-06|website=LAFPA|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref>

The Irish P2P lending platform [[Linked Finance]] was launched in 2013. In 2016, Linked Finance was also authorised to operate in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2017/0522/876948-p2p-lender-linked-finance-receives-uk-authorisation/|title=P2P lender Linked Finance receives UK authorisation|date=May 22, 2017|accessdate=September 28, 2018}}</ref> In 2015, Initiative Ireland launched the first property-backed secured lending P2P platform in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2017/0719/891429-finance-platform-to-fund-60m-in-construction-loans/|title=Finace Platform to fund €60m in construction loans|date=July 19, 2017|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, P2P lending is growing fast in recent years and is regulated under [[Financial Services Authority (Indonesia)|OJK]] since 2016. As of April 2019, there are 106 P2P platforms registered in OJK.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnnindonesia.com/ekonomi/20190410190058-78-385103/ojk-rilis-daftar-106-fintech-berizin|title=OJK Releases 106 Licensed Fintech Lists|website=CNN Indonesia|date=2019-04-10|accessdate=2019-09-26}}</ref> P2P platforms provide loans in particular targeting into unbanked population, which is estimated around 100+ million in Indonesia.

Thousands of P2P platforms are illegal. Their applications are believed stealing customers data such as contacts and photos and these are used by the debt collectors to intimidate the customers. The debt collectors contact family members, friends, and even employers of the customers and telling them that the customers have debt that needs to be paid. Some of them suicide. Many cases are reported in the Indonesia's complaint handling system.<ref name="lapor">{{cite news | url = https://lapor.go.id/laporan/kategori/layanan-keuangan-digital-lkd | title = Laporan masyarakat tentang pinjaman online | work = LAPOR!| accessdate=August 2, 2019 }}</ref> Yet the police have not taken serious actions against these cases.

===Bulgaria===
There is no specific Peer-to-Peer lending regulation in Bulgaria. Currently, Klear Lending is the only Bulgarian platform. It was launched in 2016 and provides personal loans to prime customers. The Peer-to-Peer lending platform is operated by Klear Lending AD, a financial institution registered in the Register per art. 3a of the Credit Institutions Act maintained by the Bulgarian National Bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bnb.bg/RegistersAndServices/RSFIRegister/index.htm|title=Financial Institutions Register under Art.3a of LCI|website=Bulgarian National Bank}}</ref>

===Korea===
In Korea, Money Auction and Pop Funding are the very first peer to peer lending companies founded in 2006 and 2007 respectively.<ref>Namu Wiki P2P Finance 2018-04-02. <nowiki>https://namu.wiki/w/P2P%EA%B8%88%EC%9C%B5</nowiki></ref> Korean P2P lending industry did not attract much public attention until late 2014 and early 2015, during which period a number of new fintech companies were founded underpinned by the global fintech wave with the emergence of Lending Club as the mainstream P2P lending player in the US. New P2P lending companies launched in Korea during this period include 8 Percent, Terafunding, Lendit, Honest Fund and Funda.<ref>Korea P2P Finance Association Member Date of Establishment  <nowiki>http://p2plending.or.kr/about/</nowiki>  Retrieved 2018-04-23</ref> At the beginning, 8 Percent, Lendit and Honest Fund focused on personal loan origination and Terafunding was the only P2P platform dedicated to the real estate backed loan origination, founded by ex-real estate broker and investor, Tae Young Yang.

There was a brief period of regulatory uncertainty on the P2P business model as the P2P lending model was not officially legalized under the then regulatory regime. 8 percent was briefly shut down by the regulator in Feb 2015 and was reopened again.<ref><nowiki>http://www.bloter.net/archives/219837</nowiki></ref> Korean P2P industry saw an explosive growth in a year. According to the regulator, cumulative P2P lending platform loan origination increased to KRW 311,800,000,000 as of December in 2016 from KRW 72,400,000,000 in March and there was a debate as to whether the industry was getting overheated, with questions on whether the industry offered appropriate investor protection.<ref><nowiki>http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/784215.html</nowiki></ref> To respond to these concerns, as of February 2017, Korean regulator imposed an annual investment limit of KRW 10,000,000 for a retail investor on these lending platforms, and KRW 40,000,000 for certain qualified investors.<ref><nowiki>http://www.zdnet.co.kr/news/news_view.asp?artice_id=20170227174804</nowiki></ref>

As of April 2017, there are 148 P2P lending companies in Korea. However, only 40 companies are official members of the Korea P2P Finance Association. These members include Lendit, Roof Funding, Midrate, HF Honest Fund, Villy, 8 Percent, Terafunding, Together Funding and People Funding.<ref><nowiki>http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2017&no=339030</nowiki></ref> According to the Korea P2P Finance Association, cumulative loan lent by its member P2P companies stands at c.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, P2P lending is growing fast in recent years and is regulated under [[Federal Financial Supervisory Authority]]. The transaction volume will reach an estimated value of €252 million in 2020.<ref>https://de.statista.com/outlook/399/137/alternative-lending/deutschland</ref>

==Legal regulation==
In many countries, soliciting investments from the general public is considered illegal. [[Crowd sourcing]] arrangements in which people are asked to contribute money in exchange for potential profits based on the work of others are considered to be [[Security (finance)|securities]].

Dealing with financial securities is connected to the question of ownership: in the case of person-to-person loans, the problem is who owns the loans (notes) and how that ownership is transferred between the originator of the loan (the person-to-person lending company) and the individual lender(s).<ref name="techcrunch8"/><ref name="peerlend"/> This question arises especially when a peer-to-peer lending company does not merely connect lenders and borrowers but also borrows money from users and then lends it out again. Such activity is interpreted as a sale of securities, and a broker-dealer license and the registration of the person-to-person investment contract is required for the process to be legal. The license and registration can be obtained at a securities regulatory agency such as the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) in the U.S., the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] in Ontario, Canada, the Autorité des marchés financiers in [[Autorité des marchés financiers (France)|France]] and [[Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec)|Québec, Canada]], or the [[Financial Services Authority]] in the UK.

Securities offered by the U.S. peer-to-peer lenders are registered with and regulated by the SEC. A recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office explored the potential for additional regulatory oversight by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, though neither organization has proposed direct oversight of peer-to-peer lending at this time.<ref name="gao"/>  In 2016, New York state sent "warning letters" threatening to require 28 peer-to-peer lenders to obtain a license to operate unless they "immediately" complied with responses to demands to disclose their lending practices and products available in the state.<ref>New York Legal News - Ongoing Investigation Into The P2P Lending Industry http://www.thenewyorklawblog.com/2016/06/new-york-investigates-p2p-lending.html</ref>

In the UK, the emergence of multiple competing lending companies and problems with [[subprime loan]]s has resulted in calls for additional legislative measures that institute minimum capital standards and checks on risk controls to preclude lending to riskier borrowers, using unscrupulous lenders or misleading consumers about lending terms.<ref name="telegraph10"/>

==Advantages and criticism==

===Interest rates===
One of the main advantages of person-to-person lending for borrowers can sometimes be better rates than traditional bank rates can offer.<ref name="SocialLending">[http://www.sociallending.net Social Lending Network], accessed September 21, 2010</ref> The advantages for lenders can be higher returns than obtainable from a savings account or other investments, but subject to risk of loss, unlike a savings account.<ref name="Persontopersonlending">[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21993720 Person-to-person lending online gathers steam] Associated Press, November 27, 2007.</ref> Interest rates and the methodology for calculating those rates varies among peer-to-peer lending platforms.  The interest rates may also have a lower volatility than other investment types.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://business.time.com/2012/11/15/taking-a-peek-at-peer-to-peer-lending/ |author=JD Roth |title=Taking a Peek at Peer-to-Peer Lending |date=November 15, 2012 |accessdate=June 27, 2013 |publisher=[[Time Magazine]]}}</ref>

===Socially-conscious investment===
For investors interested in socially conscious investing, peer-to-peer lending offers the possibility of supporting the attempts of individuals to break free from high-rate debt, assist persons engaged in occupations or activities that are deemed moral and positive to the community, and avoid investment in persons employed in industries deemed immoral or detrimental to community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithsaves.net/christianpeertopeer/|title=Christian Peer-to-Peer Lending - Faith Saves|work=Faith Saves|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-fall/morality-of-moneylending/|title=The Morality of Moneylending: A Short History - The Objective Standard|work=The Objective Standard|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Credit risk===
Peer-to-peer lending also attracts borrowers who, because of their credit status or the lack thereof, are unqualified for traditional bank loans. Because past behavior is frequently indicative of future performance and low credit scores correlate with high likelihood of default, peer-to-peer intermediaries have started to decline a large number of applicants and charge higher interest rates to riskier borrowers that are approved.<ref name="ft11"/>

It seemed initially that one of the appealing characteristics of peer-to-peer lending for investors was low default rates, e.g. Prosper's default rate was quoted to be only at about 2.7 percent in 2007.<ref name="Persontopersonlending" />

The actual default rates for the loans originated by Prosper in 2007 were in fact higher than projected. Prosper's aggregate return (across all credit grades and as measured by LendStats.com, based upon actual Prosper marketplace data) for the 2007 vintage was (6.44)%, for the 2008 vintage (2.44)%, and for the 2009 vintage 8.10%. Independent projections for the 2010 vintage are of an aggregate return of 9.87.<ref>http://www.lendstats.com/ Prosper.com - Loan Performance Summary - Independent Loan Analytics courtesy of LendStats.com</ref> During the period from 2006 through October 2008 (referred to as 'Prosper 1.0'), Prosper issued 28,936 loans, all of which have since matured. 18,480 of the loans fully paid off and 10,456 loans defaulted, a default rate of 36.1%. $46,671,123 of the $178,560,222 loaned out during this period was written off by investors, a loss rate of 26.1%.<ref>[http://www.sociallending.net/investing-lending/a-look-back-at-prosper-1-0-how-relevant-are-the-numbers/ Social Lending Network], accessed August. 13, 2012</ref>

Since inception, Lending Club's default rate ranges from 1.4% for top-rated three-year loans to 9.8% for the riskiest loans.<ref name="forbes12"/>

The UK peer-to-peer lenders quote the ratio of bad loans at 0.84% for Zopa of the £200m during its first seven years of lending history. As of November 2013, Funding Circle's current bad debt level was 1.5%, with an average 5.8% return after all bad debt and fees. This is comparable to the 3-5% ratio of mainstream banks and the result of modern credit models and efficient risk management technologies used by P2P companies.<ref name="guardian12"/>

At the other end of the range are places such as Bondora that do lending to less credit-worthy customers, with default rates varying up to as high as 70+% for loans made to Slovak borrowers on that platform, well above those of its original Estonian market.

===Government protection===
Because, unlike depositors in banks, peer-to-peer lenders can choose themselves whether to lend their money to safer borrowers with lower interest rates or to riskier borrowers with higher returns, in the US peer-to-peer lending is treated legally as investment and the repayment in case of borrower defaulting is not guaranteed by the federal government (U.S. [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]) the way bank deposits are.<ref name="bbc12"/>

A class action lawsuit, Hellum v. Prosper Marketplace, Inc. was held in Superior Court of California on behalf of all investors who purchased a note on the Prosper platform between January 1, 2006 and October 14, 2008. The plaintiffs alleged that Prosper offered and sold unqualified and unregistered securities, in violation of California and federal securities laws during that period. Plaintiffs further allege that Prosper acted as an unlicensed broker/dealer in California. The Plaintiffs were seeking rescission of the loan notes, rescissory damages, damages, and attorneys' fees and expenses.<ref>Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, Docket: [Case Number: CGC-09-491736 http://webaccess.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&PRGNAME=ROA22&ARGUMENTS=-ACGC09491736](retrieved {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724042313/http://webaccess.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&PRGNAME=ROA22&ARGUMENTS=-ACGC09491736 |date=July 24, 2013 }} February 1, 2011)</ref> On July 19, 2013 the class action lawsuit was settled.

'''Peer-to-peer lending sponsors''' are organizations that handle loan administration on behalf of others including individual lenders and lending agencies, but do not loan their own money.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kota|first1=Ina|title=Microfinance: Banking for the Poor|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2007/06/basics.htm|accessdate=9 September 2017|agency=IMF|publisher=Finance and Development|date=June 2007}}</ref><ref name="nyt061210">{{cite news|last1=Narang|first1=Sonia|title=Web-Based Microfinancing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=New York Times|date=December 10, 2006}}</ref> Notable peer-to-peer lending sponsors include:
