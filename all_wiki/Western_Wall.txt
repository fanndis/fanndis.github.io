The '''Western Wall''', '''Wailing Wall''' ({{lang-he-n|הַכּוֹתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי}}, ''HaKotel HaMa'aravi'')<ref>[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew audio|הַכֹּתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי|He-Kotel.ogg}}, [[transliteration|translit.]]: {{lang|he-Latn|HaKotel HaMa'aravi}}; [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] pronunciation: ''HaKosel HaMa'arovi''</ref>, often shortened to The '''Kotel''' or '''Kosel''', known in [[Islam]] as the '''Buraq Wall''' ([[Arabic]]: ''Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq'' <big>حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق</big> {{IPA-ar|'ħaːʔɪtˤ albʊ'raːq}}),<ref>{{lang-ar|حائط البراق|Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq|Wall of [[Buraq]]}}</ref> is an ancient limestone wall in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]]. It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the "Western Wall".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Temple Mount in the Herodian Period (37 BC–70 A.D.) |url=https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/temple-at-jerusalem/the-temple-mount-in-the-herodian-period/ |publisher=Biblical Archaeology Society |date=21 July 2019 |accessdate=17 July 2020}}</ref> which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshipers and visitors.

In one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].

The Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalized by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, made to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure, Herod built a vast paved platform that surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognized by Judaism outside the previous Temple Mount platform.

Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.

The term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the "Wailing Wall", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324–638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term "Wailing Wall" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term "Wailing Wall" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name="Halkin01">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>

In a broader sense, "Western Wall" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of an {{convert|8|m|adj=on}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the "Western Wall" or "Wailing Wall", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the "Little Western Wall". In religious terms, the "Little Western Wall" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the "presence of God" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.

Whilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as "the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion." On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name="Reiter2017">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel–Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26–}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} "One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis".</ref>

==Etymology==
===Western Wall===
Early Jewish texts referred to a "western wall of the Temple",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2–8</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today "the Western Wall", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name="Halkin01"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term "ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi", "the Western Wall", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name="Halkin01"/>

===Wailing Wall===
The name "Wailing Wall", and descriptions such as "wailing place", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>"Wailing Wall" appears, for example, in J.J. Reynolds, ''Jewish Advocate for the Young'' (1859). H. Bonar, ''Days and Nights in the East'' (1866) and [[J.R. Macduff]], ''Memories of Olivet'' (1868), and many later works.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barclay|1858|p=493}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warner|1878|p=45}}</ref> The name ''Mur des Lamentations'' was used in French and ''Klagemauer'' in German. This term itself was a translation of the Arabic ''el-Mabka'', or "Place of Weeping", the traditional Arabic term for the wall.<ref>{{harvnb|Becher|2005|p=265}}</ref> This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and the loss of national freedom it symbolized.<ref name="Halkin01"/>
{{Quote box

===Al-Buraq Wall===
Late in the 19th century, the Arabs began referring to the wall as the al-Buraq Wall,<ref name="Shragai 2014"/> and after the intensification of Arab–Jewish tensions in the 1920s this became the standard Arabic name, replacing the traditional ''El-Mabka''.<ref name="Halkin01"/> The new name was based on the tradition that inside the wall was the place where [[Muhammad]] tethered his miraculous winged steed, al-[[Buraq]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The tradition on which this is based only states that the Prophet, or the angel [[Gabriel#Islam|Jibra'il]] (Gabriel), tethered the steed at the gate of the mosque, meaning: at the gate of the Temple Mount.<ref name="Shragai 2014">{{harvnb|Shragai|2014}}</ref> The location of the entry gate identified as the one used by Muhammad varied throughout the centuries, from the eastern and southern walls, to the south-west corner, and finally to the western wall, and specifically to [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Barclay's Gate|Barclay's Gate]] immediately adjacent to the "Wailing Place" of the Jews.<ref>{{harvnb|Shragai|2014}} "Dr. Shmuel Berkovitz, a scholar of the holy places in the Land of Israel, found that until the eleventh century, Muslim scholars disagreed as to the location of the tethering of Muhammad's steed and pointed to different places on Al-Haram al-Sharif."<!-- Some said the place of Muhammad's entry to Haram and the tethering of Al-Buraq was the Eastern Wall. Others said it was the Southern Wall, but no one at all looked to the Western Wall as the place where Al-Buraq was tethered. In the seventeenth century, it was common to identify a spot close to the southwestern corner of the mount as the site of the tethering. --></ref> Israeli archaeologist [[Meir Ben-Dov]] concluded that the Muslim association with Western Wall began in the late nineteenth century in response to renewed Jewish identification with the site.<ref name="Shragai 2014"/>

===Prayer section vs. entire wall===
The term Western Wall commonly refers to a {{convert|187|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=out}} exposed section of a much longer retaining wall, built by Herod on the western flank of the [[Temple Mount]]. Only when used in this sense is it synonymous with the term Wailing Wall. This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer.

In its entirety, the western retaining wall of the Herodian Temple Mount complex stretches for {{Convert|1600|ft|0}}, most of which is hidden behind medieval residential structures built along its length.

There are only two other revealed sections: the southern part of the Wall (see [[Western Wall#Robinson's Arch area|Robinson's Arch area]]), which measures approximately {{convert|80|m|0}}, and is separated from the prayer area by just a narrow stretch of archaeological remains; and another, much shorter section, known as the [[Little Western Wall]], which is located close to the [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Iron Gate|Iron Gate]].

The entire western wall functions as a [[retaining wall]], supporting and enclosing the ample substructures built by [[Herod the Great]] around 19 BCE. Herod's project was to create an artificial extension to the small quasi-natural plateau on which the [[Solomon's temple|First Temple]] stood, already widened in [[Hasmonean]] times during the [[Second Temple]] period, by finally transforming it into the almost rectangular, wide expanse of the Temple Mount platform visible today.

===Height, courses, building stones===
At the Western Wall Plaza, the total height of the Wall from its foundation is estimated at {{Convert|105|ft|m|0}}, with the above-ground section standing approximately {{Convert|62|ft|m|0}} high. The Wall consists of 45 stone courses, 28 of them above ground and 17 underground.<ref>{{cite web

==History==

===Construction and destruction (19 BCE–70 CE)===
[[File:Kotel engraving 1850.jpg|thumb|Engraving, 1850 by {{interlanguage link|Rabbi Joseph Schwarz|he|יהוסף שוורץ}}]]

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Solomon's Temple]] was built atop what is known as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and destroyed by the [[Babylonia]]ns in 586 BCE,<ref>Date is adjusted in some Jewish texts to read 422 BCE. See [[chronology of the Bible#Rabbinic traditions|Chronology of the Bible]].</ref> and the [[Second Temple]] completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE [[Herod the Great]] began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a [[mikveh|ritual bath]] that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45419597|title=Coin discovery sheds new light on sacred Jerusalem site (AP)|work=NBC News}}</ref> This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian [[Josephus Flavius]], which states that construction was finished only during the reign of [[Agrippa II|King Agrippa II]], Herod's great-grandson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/about_eng.asp?Modul_id=14 |title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn’t Finish it |publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority |access-date=November 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103024430/http://www.antiquities.org.il/about_eng.asp?Modul_id=14 |archive-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref> Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid [[Royal Stoa (Jerusalem)|Royal Stoa]] and the [[Robinson's Arch|monumental staircase]] leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.

[[Herod's Temple]] was destroyed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], along with the rest of Jerusalem, in 70 CE,<ref>Date is adjusted in some Jewish texts to read 68 CE. See [[chronology of the Bible#Rabbinic traditions|Chronology of the Bible]].</ref> during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]].

===Late Roman and Byzantine periods (135–638)===
During much of the 2nd–5th centuries of the [[Common Era]], after the Roman defeat of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem. There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the [[Mount of Olives]] and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself.<ref name=UJT>{{cite book |last= Neusner |first= Jacob |title= Understanding Jewish Theology |year= 2001 |location= Global Academic Publishing |isbn= 1-58684-090-8 |page= 79 |chapter= Judaism and the Land of Israel |quote= |url=https://archive.org/details/understandingjew0000unse/page/ }}</ref> When the empire started becoming Christian under [[Constantine I]], they were given permission to enter the city once a year, on the [[Tisha B'Av]], to lament the loss of the Temple at the wall.<ref>{{cite book |last= Harman |first= Graham |title= A History of Palestine |year= 2008 |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 0-691-11897-3 |page= 24 |chapter= The Holiness of the "Holy Land" |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofpalesti00krea/page/ }}</ref> The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Bordeaux Pilgrim]], who wrote in 333 CE, suggests that it was probably to the [[Foundation Stone|perforated stone]] or the Rock of Moriah, "to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart".This was because an imperial decree from Rome barred Jews from living in Jerusalem. Just once per year they were permitted to return and bitterly grieve about the fate of their people. Comparable accounts survive, including those by the Church Father, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (c. 329–390) and by [[Jerome]] in his commentary to [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] written in 392 CE. In the 4th century, Christian sources reveal that the Jews encountered great difficulty in buying the right to pray near the Western Wall, at least on the 9th of Av.<ref name=UJT/> In 425 CE, the Jews of the Galilee wrote to Byzantine empress [[Aelia Eudocia]] seeking permission to pray by the ruins of the Temple.

Discovery of underground rooms that could have been used as food storage carved out of the bedrock under the 1,400-year-old mosaic floor of Byzantine structure was announced by [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] in May in 2020.

"At first we were very disappointed because we found we hit the bedrock, meaning that the material culture, the human activity here in Jerusalem ended. What we found here was a rock-cut system—three rooms, all hewn in the bedrock of ancient Jerusalem" said co-director of the excavation Barak Monnickendam-Givon.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Researchers find ancient rooms under Jerusalem's Western Wall|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/05/20/researchers-find-ancient-rooms-under-jerusalems-western-wall.html|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|website=The Jakarta Post|language=en|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref>

The Western Wall is not mentioned at all by Nahmanides (13th century) in his detailed account of the Temple site in 1267 nor in the report of [[Ishtori Haparchi|Estori ha-Parhi]] (14th century).

===Ottoman period (1517–1917)===
[[File:Wailing Wall by Gustav Bauernfeind.png|thumb|right|upright|''Wailing Wall, Jerusalem'', by [[Gustav Bauernfeind]] (19th century).]]
In 1517, the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] under [[Selim I]] conquered Jerusalem from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] who had held it since 1250. Selim's son, [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], ordered the construction of an imposing wall to be built around the entire city, which still stands today. Various folktales relate Suleiman's quest to locate the Temple site and his order to have the area "swept and sprinkled, and the Western Wall washed with rosewater" upon its discovery.<ref name="Vilnay 2003 61–2">{{harvnb|Vilnay|2003|pp=61–2}}</ref> At the time, Jews received official permission to worship at the site and Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] built an oratory for them there.<ref name="Armstrong08">{{harvnb|Armstrong|2001}} "In the 16th century, Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent permitted the Jews to make the Western Wall their official holy place and had his court architect Sinan build an oratory for them there."</ref><ref name="Gonen03">{{harvnb|Gonen|2003|pp=135–7}} "It is possible that official recognition of the right of Jews to pray by the Wall was granted already in the second half of the sixteenth century by a ''firman'' (official decree) issued by Suleiman the Magnificent. This firman may have been related to the efforts of the Ottoman ruler to lure Jews to Palestine as a counterbalance to the Arab population, which had rebelled against the new rulers, who were Turkish rather than Arabs."</ref> In 1625 organised prayers at the Wall are mentioned for the first time.<ref name="Ben-Dov83">{{harvnb|Ben-Dov|Naor|Aner|1983|pp=83–97}}</ref>

Over the centuries, land close to the Wall became built up. Public access to the Wall was through the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a labyrinth of narrow alleyways. In May 1840 a [[firman (decree)|firman]] issued by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] forbade the Jews to pave the passageway in front of the Wall. It also cautioned them against "raising their voices and displaying their books there." They were, however, allowed "to pay visits to it as of old."<ref name="report1930"/>

{{interlanguage link|Rabbi Joseph Schwarz|he|יהוסף שוורץ}} writing in the mid-19th century records:

<blockquote>This wall is visited by all our brothers on every feast and festival; and the large space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as we have a very old [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.<ref>{{cite book

Over time the increased numbers of people gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish visitors who wanted easier access and more space, and the residents, who complained of the noise.<ref name="report1930">Löfgren, Eliel; Barde, Charles; Van Kempen, J.

The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the [[Chacham Bashi]]. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, [[Edward Keith-Roach]], acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible [[modus vivendi]] had emerged and such screens had been put up from time to time when large numbers of people gathered to pray.
[[File:Kotel jerusalem.jpg|thumb|upright|The placing of a ''[[Mechitza]]'' similar to the one in the picture was the catalyst for confrontation between the Arabs, Jews and Mandate authorities in 1928.]]

On September 24, 1928, the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]], British police resorted to removing by force a [[Mechitza|screen]] used to separate men and women at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]], the Chief Rabbi of the ultraorthodox Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter on behalf of his community, the [[Edah HaChareidis]], and [[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Yisroel]] strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the [[Etz Chaim Yeshiva]], following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed [[Douglas Valder Duff]], the British officer involved, was sheltering.<ref name=GoJ/>

Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach described the screen as violating the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Ottoman status quo]] that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the [[Supreme Muslim Council]]. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].<ref name=PYIL>{{cite book

The Supreme Muslim Council provided documents dating from the Turkish regime supporting their claims. However, repeated reminders to the Chief Rabbinate to verify which apparatus had been permitted failed to elicit any response.

====1929 Palestine riots====
:{{Main|1929 Palestine riots}}
In the summer of 1929, the Mufti [[Amin al-Husseini|Haj Amin Al Husseinni]] ordered an opening be made at the southern end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.<ref name=VI/>

On August 14, 1929, after attacks on individual Jews praying at the Wall, 6,000 Jews demonstrated in Tel Aviv, shouting "The Wall is ours." The next day, the Jewish fast of [[Tisha B'Av]], 300 youths raised the Zionist flag and sang [[Hatikva]] at the Wall.<ref name=OR/> The day after, on August 16, an organized mob of 2,000 Muslim Arabs descended on the Western Wall, injuring the beadle and burning prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town, and was followed a few days later by the [[1929 Hebron massacre|Hebron massacre]].<ref>{{cite book

One hundred and thirty-three Jews were killed and 339 injured in the Arab riots, and in the subsequent process of quelling the riots 110 Arabs were killed by British police. This was by far the deadliest attack on Jews during the period of British Rule over Palestine.

====1930 international commission====
{{Main|1930 Western Wall Commission}}
In 1930, in response to the 1929 riots, the British Government appointed a commission "to determine the rights and claims of Muslims and Jews in connection with the Western or Wailing Wall", and to determine the causes of the violence and prevent it in the future. The [[League of Nations]] approved the commission on condition that the members were not British.

The Commission noted that 'the Jews do not claim any proprietorship to the Wall or to the Pavement in front of it (concluding speech of Jewish Counsel, Minutes, page 908).'

[[File:Anglo-American Committee at the Western Wall.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] at the Western Wall, 1946]]
The Commission concluded that the wall, and the adjacent pavement and Moroccan Quarter, were solely owned by the Muslim ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|waqf]]''. However, Jews had the right to "free access to the Western Wall for the purpose of devotions at all times", subject to some stipulations that limited which objects could be brought to the Wall and forbade the blowing of the [[shofar]], which was made illegal. Muslims were forbidden to disrupt Jewish devotions by driving animals or other means.<ref name="report1930"/>

The recommendations of the Commission were brought into law by the Palestine (Western or Wailing Wall) Order in Council, 1931, which came into effect on June 8, 1931.<ref name=Gaz31>Palestine (Western or Wailing Wall) Order in Council, 1931, Official Gazette of the Government of Palestine, Gazette Extraordinary (Suppl. No. 8/1931), June 8, 1931, pp. 464–468; also printed in The Palestine Yearbook of International Law, Vol. 9, Iss. 1, p.411ff.</ref> Persons violating the law were liable to a fine of 50 pounds or imprisonment up to 6 months, or both.<ref name=Gaz31/>

During the 1930s, at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, young Jews persistently flouted the shofar ban each year and blew the shofar resulting in their arrest and prosecution. They were usually fined or sentenced to imprisonment for three to six months. The Shaw commission determined that the violence occurred due to "racial animosity on the part of the Arabs, consequent upon the disappointment of their political and national aspirations and fear for their economic future."

===Jordanian rule (1948–67)===
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] the Old City together with the Wall was [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|controlled by Jordan]]. Article VIII of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements#With Jordan|1949 Armistice Agreement]] called for a Special Committee to make arrangements for (amongst other things) "free access to the Holy Places and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives".<ref>Yale Avalon Project, https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arm03.asp [https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arm03.asp Israel-Jordan Armistice Agreement].</ref> The committee sat multiple times during 1949, but both sides made additional demands and at the same time the [[Palestine Conciliation Commission]] was pressing for the internationalization of Jerusalem against the wishes of both parties.<ref name=BenDror>{{cite journal | author = Elad Ben-Dror and Asaf Ziedler | title = Israel, Jordan, and their Efforts to Frustrate the United Nations Resolutions to Internationalise Jerusalem | journal = Diplomacy & Statecraft | year = 2015 | volume = 26 | pages = 636–658 | doi = 10.1080/09592296.2015.1096685}}</ref> No agreement was ever reached, leading to recriminations in both directions.

Following Israel's victory during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the Western Wall came under Israeli control. Brigadier Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] proclaimed after its capture that "Israel would never again relinquish the Wall", a stance supported by Israeli Minister for Defence [[Moshe Dayan]] and Chief of Staff General [[Yitzhak Rabin]].<ref name="JaphethRajiv1967">{{cite book |author1= Maurice David Japheth |author2= P.

He proclaimed that Israel would never again relinquish the Wall. A little later, the Minister for Defence, Moshe Dayan, accompanied by the Chief of Staff, General Yitzhak Rabin, arrived. They repeated the pledge of the Rabbi. "Today we have reunited Jerusalem. We have returned to all that is holy in our land. We have returned, never to be parted from it again," Dayan said.}}</ref> Rabin described the moment Israeli soldiers reached the Wall:

<blockquote>"There was one moment in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers—under [[Mordechai Gur|Gur]]'s command—reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody prepared it and nobody was prepared for it; it was as if Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping—loudly and in pain—over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the [[Kaddish]] prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of "[[Hatikvah]]"".<ref>{{cite web

According to [[Eyal Weizman]], [[Chaim Herzog]], who later became Israel's sixth president, took much of the credit for the destruction of the neighbourhood:

<blockquote>When we visited the Wailing Wall we found a toilet attached to it ... we decided to remove it and from this we came to the conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the Wailing Wall ... a historical opportunity that will never return ...

==The plaza==
The new plaza created in 1967 is used for worship and public gatherings, including [[Bar mitzvah]] celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of [[Tisha B'Av]], which marks the destruction of the Temple and on [[Yom Yerushalayim|Jerusalem Day]], which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.

In November 2010, the government approved a NIS 85m ($23m) scheme to improve access from the Jewish Quarter and upgrade infrastructure at the Wall.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-approves-23-million-plan-to-renovate-near-western-wall-1.325927 Israel approves $23 million plan to renovate near Western Wall], ''Haartez'', (November 21, 2010).</ref>

===Orthodox rules===
Conflicts over prayer at the national monument began a little more than a year after Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, which again made the site accessible to Jews. In July 1968 the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]], which had planned the group's international convention in Jerusalem, appealed to the [[Knesset]] after the Ministry of Religious Affairs prohibited the organization from hosting mixed-gender services at the Wall. The Knesset committee on internal affairs backed the Ministry of Religious Affairs in disallowing the Jewish convention attendees, who had come from over 24 countries, from worshiping in their fashion. The Orthodox held that services at the Wall should follow traditional Jewish law for segregated seating followed in synagogues, while the non-Orthodox perspective was that "the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism."<ref name="jta.org">[http://www.jta.org/2015/04/24/news-opinion/the-telegraph/from-the-archive-when-the-western-wall-battles-began From the Archive: First rumblings in the battle for pluralism at the Western Wall] JTA, April 24, 2015.</ref>

Its goal was to renovate and restructure the area within [[Wilson's Arch (Jerusalem)|Wilson's Arch]], the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.<ref name="kotel">[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=3 English.thekotel.org TheKotel.org], retrieved March 11, 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.iaa-conservation.org.il/Projects_Item_eng.asp?id=49&subject_id=10&site_id=3 iaa-conservation.org], retrieved March 11, 2011.</ref>

The restoration to the men's section included a [[Torah ark]] that can house over 100 [[Torah scroll]]s, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, heating for the winter, and air conditioning for the summer.<ref name="kotel"/> A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall.<ref name="kotel"/> New construction also included a women's section,<ref>[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=803&CatId=2 The Kotel, note about May 25, 2006.], retrieved March 11, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724161100/http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=803&CatId=2 |date=July 24, 2011}}</ref> overlooking the men's prayer area, so that women could use this separate area to "take part in the services held inside under the Arch" for the first time.<ref>[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=628&CatId=4 English.TheKotel.org], retrieved March 24, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724161119/http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=628&CatId=4 |date=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

On July 25, 2010, a [[Ner Tamid]], an oil-burning "eternal light," was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson's Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall.<ref name="ner">[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=2715&CatId=4 Thekotel.org, note for July 25, 2010], retrieved March 12, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724161214/http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=2715&CatId=4 |date= July 24, 2011}}</ref> According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests had been made for many years that "an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple," especially in the closest place to those ancient flames.<ref name="ner"/>

[[File:USNAVY Kotel Service.jpg|thumb|Asst. U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain [[Arnold Resnicoff|Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff]] leads an unusual interfaith service]]
A number of special worship events have been held since the renovation. They have taken advantage of the cover, temperature control,<ref name="night">[http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=131&CatId=4 The Kotel.org, note on February 3, 2006.], retrieved March 13, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724160935/http://english.thekotel.org/today/Event.asp?EventId=131&CatId=4 |date= July 24, 2011}}</ref> and enhanced security.<ref name="pope">[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=80 TheKotel.org, Lag B'omer 2009], retrieved March 13, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724160944/http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=80 |date= July 24, 2011}}</ref> However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain, Rabbi [[Arnold Resnicoff]] was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the [[Priestly Blessing]], recited by Resnicoff, who is a [[Kohen]]. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.<ref>''Jerusalem Post'', Sep 5, 1983, and ''Jerusalem Post'' International Edition, Sep 11–17, 1983, "U.S. Navy Chaplain Conducts Western Wall Interfaith Litany"</ref><ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/News/122901/news_pf/NorthPinellas/Lion__lamb_reside_in_.shtml ''St Petersburg Times''], retrieved March 25, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-day-in-1983-when-the-israeli-government-gave-its-blessing-to-a-mixed-gender-prayer-service-at-the-western-wall |title= The day Israel gave its blessing to egalitarian prayer at Western Wall |newspaper= Times of Israel}}</ref>

==Robinson's Arch area==
[[File:The remains of Robinson's Arch on the western side of the Temple Mount.jpg|thumb|The remains of Robinson's Arch above excavated remnants of the ancient street below.]]
{{Main|Robinson's Arch}}

At the southern end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount.<ref name="virtual">[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/Robinsons_Arch.html Jewish Virtual Library], retrieved March 26, 2011.</ref>

The so-called Isaiah Stone, located under Robinson's Arch, has a carved inscription in Hebrew with a partial and slightly faulty quote from (or [[paraphrase]] of) {{Bibleref2|Isaiah 66:14}}: "And you will see and your heart will rejoice and ''their'' bones like an herb [will flourish]" (the correct line from Isaiah would read "...''your'' bones".) This gave room to various interpretations, some speculating about it being written during a period of hope for Jews. Alternatively, it might be connected to nearby graves. The inscription has tentatively been dated to the 4th-8th century, some extending the possible timespan all the way to the 11th century.<ref>{{cite book |first= Jack |last= Friedman |title= The Jerusalem Book of Quotations: A 3,000- Year Perspective |page= 27 |publisher= Gefen Publishing House |year= 2007 |isbn= 9789652293923 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4E3fG3uGgbYC&pg=PA27 |access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref>

===Non-Orthodox worship===
{{Main|Western Wall#Egalitarian and non-Orthodox prayer}}
Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi of the Western Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.<ref name="virtual"/> The worship site was inaugurated in 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall.<ref name="NYT2013"/> A platform has been added in 2013 in order to expand the prayer area.<ref name="platform"/>

==In Judaism==
===History as place of prayer===
====11th-12th centuries====
The [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel#Chronicle of Ahimaaz|Scroll of Ahimaaz]], a historical document written in 1050 CE, distinctly describes the Western Wall as a place of prayer for the Jews.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} In around 1167 CE during the late [[Crusades|Crusader]] Period, [[Benjamin of Tudela]] wrote that "In front of this place is the western wall, which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court".<ref name="itinerary222">Adler N. M. (1907) ''The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela'' London; page 23.</ref>

====17th century====
In 1625 "arranged prayers" at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved.<ref name="report1930"/>

In 1994, [[Shlomo Goren]] wrote that the tradition of the wall as a Jewish prayer site was only 300 years old, the Jews being compelled to pray there after being forbidden to assemble on the mount itself.<ref name="Goren"/>

====18th-19th centuries====
Scrolls of the Law were brought to the Wall on occasions of public distress and calamity, as testified to in a narrative written by Rabbi Gedaliah of Semitizi who went to Jerusalem in 1699.

His great-grandmother, who arrived in Palestine in 1841, "used to go to the Western Wall every Friday afternoon, winter and summer, and stay there until candle-lighting time, reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs...she would sit there by herself for hours."<ref>{{cite book

In the past{{dubious|This is not an acceptable definition. I presume it refers to C20.

In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/>

Throughout several centuries, the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy. On news of the [[Normandy landings]] on June 6, 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the "success of His Majesty's and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy-occupied territory."<ref>{{cite book

===Relation to the Foundation Stone===
In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]]. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: "Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone."; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: "I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct."</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: "In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall."</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.

===Part of the Temple proper===
Rabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be’aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>

Some medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book

| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =
| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>

===Divine custody===
A [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which "would never be destroyed",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>

===Divine Presence===
Another Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: "Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that "the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>

Eighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that "after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>

===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===
Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall. He cites the Zohar which writes that the word ''kotel'', meaning wall, is made up of two parts: "Ko", which has the numerical value of God's name, and "Tel", meaning mount, which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall.<ref>''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 50</ref>

===Ritual===
[[File:Jews at Western Wall by Felix Bonfils, 1870s.jpg|thumb|right|Jews at the Western Wall, 1870s]]

====Status as a synagogue====
Many contemporary Orthodox [[poskim|scholars]] rule that the area in front of the Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect.<ref name=KHB/> This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall to show its sanctity.<ref name=KHB/> On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the [[Sabbath]].

====Contact with the Wall====
Some Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against inserting fingers into the cracks of the Wall as they believe that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.<ref>See ''[[Avrohom Bornsztain|Avnei Nezer]]'' [[Yoreh Deah]] 450</ref>{{primary source inline|date=February 2016}}

In the past, some visitors would write their names on the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book

====Barefoot approach====
[[File:Wall of Solomon, c1880.jpg|thumb|The faithful remove their shoes upon approaching the Wall, {{Circa|1880}}]]
There was once an old custom of removing one's shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th-century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that "upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...".<ref name=SLC/> Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote{{year needed|date=February 2016}} that "it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite "This is nothing other than the House of God and here is the gate of Heaven." When within four [[cubit]]s of the Wall, one should remove their footwear."<ref name=SLC/> Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, as there is no need to remove one's shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.<ref name=YY/>

====Mourning over the Temple's destruction====
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3432 9 av kotel.JPG|thumb|[[Tisha B'Av]] at the Western Wall, 1970s]]

According to Jewish Law, one is obliged to grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple.<ref>[[Moed Katan]] 26a; [[Orach Chaim]] 561; [[Yoreh Deah]] 340</ref> [[Yoel Sirkis|Bach]] (17th century) instructs that "when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall, which is the wall [[David|King David]] built, he should recite: Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord".<ref>''Bayit Chadash'' to [[Orach Chaim]] 561. He contends that the city itself is in such a state of disrepair that once a person has reached the hills surrounding Jerusalem, he can immediately view the Western Wall.</ref> Some [[poskim|scholars]] write that rending one's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control. Others disagree, pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim ''[[Office of the Waqf Administrator|waqf]]'' and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn't seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one's garments, but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals.<ref>[[Shlomo Zalman Aurbach|Minchas Shlomo]] Vol. 1, Ch. 73.

====Significance as place of prayer====
[[File:Women at western wall.jpg|thumb|Women at prayer, early 20th century]]

The Sages of the Talmud stated that anyone who prays at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], "it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer."<ref>[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] 35</ref> Jewish Law stipulates that the [[Amidah|Silent Prayer]] should be recited facing [[mizrah|towards Jerusalem]], the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies,<ref>''[[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' 18:10.

While during the late 19th century, no formal segregation of men and women was to be found at the Wall,<ref>[http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/130878/the-womens-wall The Women's Wall] Tablet Magazine, April 30, 2013</ref> conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]] were denied the right to host a mixed-gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the gender segregation customary at Orthodox places of worship.

In 1988, the small but vocal group called [[Women of the Wall]] launched a campaign for recognition of non-Orthodox prayer at the Wall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/mission-statement/ |title= Mission Statement |work= Women of the Wall - נשות הכותל |url-status= dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308072412/http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/mission-statement/ |archive-date= March 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/history/ |title= History |work =Women of the Wall - נשות הכותל |url-status= dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308070301/http://womenofthewall.org.il/about/history/ |archivedate= March 8, 2016 |df= mdy-all}}</ref> Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were subsequently banned from holding services at the site.<ref name="NYT2013"/> After repeated attacks by [[haredim]], in 1989 the Women of the Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions.<ref name="wound"/>

In 2003 [[Israel's Supreme Court]] upheld the ban on non-Orthodox worship at the Wall,<ref name="virtual"/> disallowing any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional [[tallit|prayer shawls]] at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson's Arch to host such events,<ref name="wound">{{cite news |last= Nathan-Kazis |first= Josh |title= Embassy Letter on Kotel Rubs Salt in the Wound |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/124477/ |access-date= July 13, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]] |date= February 5, 2010 |location= New York, New York}}</ref> given that this area does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs.<ref name="virtual"/> The government responded by allocating Robinson's Arch for such purposes.<ref name="wound"/>

====Chabad tefillin stand====
Shortly after the Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a stand of the [[Chabad]] movement offering [[Tefillin|phylacteries]] (''tefillin'') was erected with permission from Rabbi [[Yehuda Meir Getz]], the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers male visitors the chance to put on ''tefillin'', a daily Jewish prayer ritual.

==In Islam==
[[File:WilsonHoshAlBurak.png|thumb|South-west corner of the Haram from the [[Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem]], 1865)]]

===Tradition of the place of tethering===
Muslim reverence for the site is derived from the belief that the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed [[Buraq]] nearby during his [[Isra and Mi'raj|night journey]] to Jerusalem. Various places have been suggested for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the [[al-Buraq Mosque]], which is just inside the wall at the south end of the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Barclay's Gate|Barclay's Gate]] whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the [[Gates of the Temple Mount#Moroccans' Gate|Maghrebi gate]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Amikam Elad |title= Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship |publisher= Brill |year= 1999 |place= Leiden |pages= 101–102}}</ref>

When a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote:
:It is evident from the copy of the record of the deliberations of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the Haram al-Sharif and also the spot where al-Buraq was tethered, and is included in the endowment charter of [[Abu Madyan]], may God bless his memory; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past. ... Therefore the Jews must not be enabled to pave the place.<ref>{{cite book |author= F. E. Peters |title= Jerusalem |publisher= Princeton University Press |place= Princeton |year= 1985 |pp=541–542}}.

[[Carl Sandreczki]], who was charged with compiling a list of place names for [[Charles William Wilson|Charles Wilson's]] [[Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem]] in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the ''[[Hosh (architecture)|Hosh]]'' (court/enclosure) of ''al Burâk'', "not ''Obrâk'', nor ''Obrat''".<ref>{{cite book |author= Carl Sandrecki |year= 1865 |title= Account of a Survey of the City of Jerusalem made in order to ascertain the names of streets etc.|at=Day IV}} reproduced in {{cite book |author= Captain Charles W.

Obrâk is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of Bōrâk, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above."<ref>{{cite book |author= G.

==In Christianity==
[[File:Franciscus kotel.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Francis]] at the Western Wall]]
Some scholars{{who|date=May 2019}} believe that when Jerusalem came under Christian rule in the 4th century, there was a purposeful "transference" of respect for the Temple Mount and the Western Wall in terms of sanctity to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], while the sites around the Temple Mount became a refuse dump for Christians.<ref name="catholic">[http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2009/08/sensitivity-training USCatholic.org], retrieved March 27, 2011.</ref> However, the actions of many modern Christian leaders, including [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI]], who visited the Wall and left prayer messages in its crevices, have symbolized for many Christians a restoration of respect and even veneration for this ancient religious site.<ref name="catholic"/>

Most Jews, religious and secular, consider the wall to be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the [[Second Temple]].

The Committee of the League of Nations recommended in 1930, to allow the Jews to pray there, in order to keep them quiet. But by no means did it acknowledge that the wall belongs to them."<ref>{{cite web

In 2006, Dr. Hassan Khader, founder of the Al Quds Encyclopedia, told PA television that the first connection of the Jews to the Wall is "a recent one, which began in the 16th century...not ancient...like the roots of the Islamic connection".<ref>{{cite web

In November 2010, an official paper published by the PA Ministry of Information denied Jewish rights to the Wall. It stated that "Al-Buraq Wall is in fact the western wall of Al-Aksa Mosque" and that Jews had only started using the site for worship after the 1917 Balfour Declaration.<ref>Khaled Abu Toameh.

While recognizing the difficulties inherent in any ultimate peace agreement that involves the status of Jerusalem, the official position of the United States includes a recognition of the importance of the Wall to the Jewish people, and has condemned statements that seek to "delegitimize" the relationship between Jews and the area in general, and the Western Wall in particular. For example, in November 2010, the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration "strongly condemned a Palestinian official's claim that the Western Wall in the Old City has no religious significance for Jews and is actually Muslim property." The U.S. State Department noted that the United States rejects such a claim as "factually incorrect, insensitive and highly provocative."<ref name="cleveland">[https://www.cleveland.com/world/2010/11/us_condemns_palestinian_claim.html U.S. condemns Palestinian claim on Western Wall of Temple Mount], Cleveland.com, retrieved March 27, 2011.</ref>
