==History==

===Beginnings in the 19th century===
[[File:ThierryHermès.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thierry Hermès, founder of Hermès.]]

[[Thierry Hermès]] was born in [[Krefeld]], [[Germany]], to a [[France|French]] father and a German mother. The family moved to France in 1828.<ref name="fashion">

Hermès's son, Charles-Émile,<ref name="fashion"/> took over management from his father in 1880 and moved the shop to ''24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré'', where it remains. With the help of his sons Adolphe and Émile-Maurice, Charles-Émile introduced [[saddle]]ry and started selling his products retail.<ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/> The company catered to the élite of Europe, North Africa, Russia, Asia, and the Americas. In 1900, the firm offered the ''Haut à Courroies'' bag, specially designed for riders to carry their saddles with them.

===Hermès Frères era===
After Charles-Émile Hermès's retirement, sons Adolphe and Émile-Maurice took leadership and renamed the company Hermès Frères. Shortly after, Émile-Maurice began furnishing the [[czar]] of Russia with saddles.<ref name="fashion"/> By 1914, up to 80 saddle craftsmen were employed. Subsequently, Émile-Maurice was granted the exclusive rights to use the [[zipper]] for leather goods and clothing, becoming the first to introduce the device in France.<ref name="world tempus"/> In 1918, Hermès introduced the first leather golf jacket with a zipper, made for [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]].<ref name="fashionhist"/> Because of its exclusive rights arrangement the zipper became known in France as the ''fermeture Hermès'' (Hermès fastener).<ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/>

Throughout the 1920s when he was the sole head of the firm, Émile-Maurice added accessories and clothing collections.<ref name="world tempus"/><ref name="finding"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.styl.sh/articles/186-the-story-behind-hermes | title = The Story Behind Hermès | publisher = Styl.sh | access-date = 7 September 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140111010629/https://www.styl.sh/articles/186-the-story-behind-hermes | archive-date = 11 January 2014 | url-status = dead}}</ref> He also groomed his three sons-in-law (Robert Dumas, Jean-René Guerrand, and Francis Puech) as business partners. In 1922, the first leather handbags were introduced after Émile-Maurice's wife complained of not being able to find one to her liking. Émile-Maurice created the handbag collection himself.<ref name="fashion"/>

[[File:Hermès-1923.jpg|thumb|220px|Hermès Frères advertisement, 1923]]
In 1924, Hermès established a presence in the United States and opened two shops outside of Paris. In 1929, the first women's [[haute couture|couture]] apparel collection was previewed in Paris.<ref name="fashion"/> During the 1930s, Hermès introduced some of its most recognized original goods<ref name="world tempus"/> such as the leather "Sac à dépêches" in 1935 (later renamed the "[[Kelly bag]]" after [[Grace Kelly]]) and the Hermès ''carrés'' (square scarves) in 1937.<ref name="world tempus"/>

The scarves became integrated into [[Culture of France|French culture]].<ref name="finding"/> In 1938, the "Chaîne d'ancre" bracelet and the riding jacket and outfit joined the classic collection. By this point, the company's designers began to draw inspirations from paintings, books, and ''objets d'art''.<ref name="world tempus"/> The 1930s also witnessed Hermès's entry into the [[United States]] market by offering products in a Neiman Marcus department store in New York; however, it later withdrew.<ref name="finding"/> In 1949, the same year as the launch of the Hermès silk tie, the first perfume, "Eau d'Hermès", was produced.

From the mid-1930s, Hermès employed [[Swiss made#A Swiss watch|Swiss watchmaker]] [[Universal Genève]] as the brand's first and exclusive designer of timepieces, producing a line of men's wrist [[chronograph]]s<ref>{{cite web | url = http://catalog.antiquorum.com/catalog.html?action=load&lotid=384&auctionid=206 | title = Pour Hermès Universal, Genève, case No. 605738.

Both models contained dials signed either "Hermès" or "Hermès Universal Genève", while the [[Movement (clockwork)|watch movements]] were signed "Universal Genève S.A.". The Hermès/Universal partnership lasted until the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://catalog.antiquorum.com/catalog.html?action=load&lotid=40&auctionid=124 | title = Universal Genève for Hermes-Paris, year 1950.

===Post-Émile-Maurice Hermès===
Robert Dumas-Hermès (1898–1978), who succeeded Émile-Maurice after his death in 1951, closely collaborated with brother-in-law Jean-René Guerrand.<ref name="world tempus"/> Dumas became the first man not directly descended from ''Hermès père'' to lead the company because his connection to the family was only through marriage. Thus, he incorporated the Hermès name into his own, Dumas-Hermès.

The company also acquired its Duc-carriage-with-horse logo and signature orange paper boxes in the early 1950s.<ref name="world tempus"/> Dumas introduced original handbags, jewelry, and accessories and was particularly interested in design possibilities with the silk scarves.<ref name="world tempus"/> Ironically, during the mid-20th century, scarf production diminished.<ref name="finding"/> World Tempus, a [[Web portal]] dedicated to watchmaking, states: "Brought to life by the magic wand of Annie Beaumel, the windows of the store on the [rue du] Faubourg Saint-Honoré became a theatre of enchantment and [established the store as] a Parisian meeting-place for international celebrities."<ref name="world tempus"/> In 1956, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photograph of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of [[Monaco]], carrying the "Sac à dépêches" bag. Purportedly, she held it in front of herself to disguise her pregnancy. Thus, when the public began calling it the "Kelly" bag, a name subsequently adopted by Hermès, it became hugely popular.

The perfume business became a subsidiary in 1961, concurrently with the introduction of the "Calèche" scent, named after a hooded four-wheeled horse carriage, known since the 18th century, and is also the company's logo since the 1950s. (In 2004, [[Jean-Claude Ellena]] became the in-house perfumer or "nose" and has created several successful scents, including the Hermessence line of fragrances.)<ref name="fashion"/>

===Decline and revamp===
[[File:Hermès Store, Avenue George V, Paris 8e 003.JPG|thumbnail|Hermes Store at [[Avenue George V]] in [[8th arrondissement of Paris|Paris 8th arrondissement]], France.]]
Despite the company's apparent success in the 1970s, exemplified by multiple shops' being established worldwide, Hermès began to decline, compared to competitors. Some industry observers have assigned the cause to Hermès's insistence on the exclusive use of natural materials for its products, unlike other companies that were calling on new man-made materials.<ref name="finding"/> During a two-week lapse in orders, the Hermès workrooms were silent.<ref name="finding"/> The renewed success of Hermès's fragrances in the marketplace was probably due to the public's increasingly paradigmatic shift of back to natural materials as opposed to artificial. This point undoubtedly contributed to reestablishing Hermès's scents as a major player in the fragrances marketplace.

[[Jean-Louis Dumas]], the son of Robert Dumas-Hermès, became chairman in 1978 and had the firm concentrate on silk and leather goods and ready-to-wear, adding new product groups to those made with its traditional techniques. Unlike his father, Jean-Louis was maternally related to the Hermès family. Travelling extensively<ref name="fashion"/> and marrying Rena Gregoriadès, he entered the buyer-training program at [[Bloomingdale's]], the New York department store. Having joined the family firm in 1964, he was instrumental in turning around its decline.<ref name="finding"/>

Dumas brought in designers Eric Bergère and Bernard Sanz to revamp the apparel collection and, in collaboration, added unusual entries. They included the [[Pythonidae|python]] motorcycle jackets and ostrich-skin jeans, which were dubbed as "a snazzier version of what Hermès has been all along." (Annual sales in 1978, when Jean-Louis became head of the firm, were reported at US$50&nbsp;million.<ref name="finding"/> By 1990, annual sales were reported at US$460 million, mainly due to Dumas's strategy.) In 1979, he launched an advertising campaign featuring a young, denim-clad woman wearing an Hermès scarf. The purpose was to introduce the Hermès brand to a new set of consumers. As one fashion-sector observer noted: "Much of what bears the still-discreet Hermès label changed from the object of an old person's [[nostalgia]] to the subject of young peoples' dreams."<ref name="finding"/> However, Dumas's change-of-image created outrage both within and outside of the firm.

Also in the 1970s, the watch subsidiary, La Montre Hermès, was established in [[Bienne, Switzerland]]. Then, throughout the 1980s, Dumas strengthened the company's hold on its suppliers,<ref name="finding"/> resulting in Hermès's gaining great stakes in prominent French [[glassware]], [[silver (household)|silver]]ware acquiring venerable [[tableware]] manufacturers such as Puiforcat, St. Louis, and Périgord.<ref name="finding"/>

===Growth===
[[File:HK Causeway Bay Lee Garden Hermes Shop.JPG|thumb|300px|Hermes boutique at The [[Lee Garden One]], [[Hong Kong]]]]
From the 1980s, tableware became a strong segment of the firm.<ref name="finding"/> And, overall, the collection of Hermès goods expanded in 1990 to include over 30,000 pieces. New materials used in the collection included porcelain and crystal.<ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/>

Hermès relocated its workshops and design studios to Pantin, just outside Paris.<ref name="world tempus"/> By June 1993 Hermès had gone public on the [[Paris Bourse]] (stock exchange). At the time, the equity sale generated great excitement. The 425,000 shares floated at FFr 300 (US$55 at the time) were oversubscribed by 34 times.<ref name="finding"/> Dumas told ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' that the equity sale would help lessen family tensions by allowing some members to liquidate their holdings without "squabbling over share valuations among themselves."<ref name="finding"/>

To this time, the Hermès family was still retaining a strong hold of about 80% in stocks, placing Jean-Louis Dumas and the entire family on the ''[[Forbes]]'' [[list of billionaires]].<ref name="finding"/> Mimi Tompkins of ''U.S. News & World Report'' called the company "one of Paris' best guarded jewels."

In the following years, Dumas decreased Hermès franchises from 250 to 200 and increased company-owned stores from 60 to 100 to better control sales of its products.<ref name="finding"/> The plan was to cost about FFr 200&nbsp;million in the short term but to increase profits in the long term. Having around FFr 500&nbsp;million to invest, Hermès pressed ahead, targeting China for company-operated boutiques, finally opening a store in [[Beijing]] in 1996.

In 1997, Jean-Louis hired iconoclastic Belgian designer [[Martin Margiela]] to supervise women's ready-to-wear.

By the late 1990s, Hermès continued extensively to diminish the number of [[Franchising|franchise]]d stores, buying them up and opening more company-operated boutiques. The fashion industry was caught off guard in September 1999, when Jean-Louis decided to pay FFr 150&nbsp;million for a 35% stake in the [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] fashion house.<ref name="finding"/> In the latter part of the 1900s, the company encouraged its clientele to ''faites nous rêver'' (make us dream), producing throughout the period artistically atypical orders.

===The 2000s to today===
[[File:Hermès, Madrid, Spain España.jpg|thumb|right|277px|Hermès, [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] (2016)]]
In 2003, Margiela left Hermès, and highly controversial [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], as the head designer, debuted his first ready-to-wear collection for fall/winter 2004–05.<ref name="fashion"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/jean_paul_gaultier/index.html |title=Jean Paul Gaultier News|work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Wilson | access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref>

After 28 years as head of the firm, Jean-Louis Dumas retired in January 2006. Known for his charm and one of Europe's greatest authorities on luxury, he died in 2010 after a long illness.<ref name="fashion"/> Patrick Thomas, who had joined the company in 1989 and who had worked with Jean-Louis as the co-CEO from 2005, replaced him. Thomas became the first non-Hermès family member to head the company.

In February 2015, Hermès has announced an increase of its turnover of 9.7%, which represents more than €4 billion in sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/record-profit-and-exceptional-dividend-offset-lower-target-for-herme-s/2015032715991|first=Angela|last=Gonzalez-Rodriguez|date=27 March 2015|access-date=17 June 2015|work=[[FashionUnited]]|title=Record profit and exceptional dividend offset lower target for Hermès}}</ref>

This increase is internationally visible. In Asia, excluding Japan, where the turnover grew 7%, in America, with 10% rise, in Europe where it grew 7% growth and generated a good performance in the group's stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/hermes-h1-revenues-accelerate-21-percent/2015072117113|first=Prachi|last=Singh|date=21 July 2015|access-date=29 July 2015|work=[[FashionUnited]]|title=Hermes H1 revenues accelerate 21 percent}}</ref>

In March 2018, Hermès opened its largest, multi-storey shop, in middle east, at The Dubai Mall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/fashion/first-look-dubai-mall-extension-is-now-open-1.711573|title=First look: Dubai Mall extension is now open|website=The National|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>

On 17 May 2018, Malaysian police seized 284 luxury bags, believed to be some Hermès handbags from the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Najib Razak's-linked apartments.

In 2019, the brand was ranked 33rd in the Forbes List "World's Most Valuable Brands".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/hermes-international/#14fc29f93329|title=Hermès International profile|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref>

==Designers==
The designers throughout the company's history have included [[Lola Prusac]], Jacques Delahaye, Catherine de Karolyi, Monsieur Levaillant, Nicole de Vesian, Eric Bergère, Claude Brouet, Tan Giudicelli, Marc Audibet, Mariot Chane, Bernard Sanz, [[Martin Margiela]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], Christophe Lemaire, Véronique Nichanian (the men's-wear designer since 1988), and Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski (since 2014 succeeding Lemaire).<ref name="fashion"/>

==Goods and products==
[[File:Hermes soap.jpg|270px|thumb|right|An Hermès soap bar bearing the logo.]]
Known for [[luxury goods]], by 2008, Hermès had 14 product divisions that encompassed leather, scarves, ties, men's and women's wear, perfume, watches, stationery, footwear, gloves, enamelware, decorative arts, tableware, and jewellery.<ref name="world tempus"/>

Hermès sales compose about 30% leather goods, 15% clothes, 12% scarves, and 43% other wares.<ref name="fashion"/> The company licenses no products and keeps tight control over the design and manufacture of its vast inventory.<ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/>

The firm is very attached to its traditional business model and rejects mass production, assembly lines, and mechanization. Hermès's goods are almost entirely made in France by hand in middle-sized workshops known as Les Ateliers Hermès that emphasise high-quality manufacturing. Indeed, Hermès claims most items are fabricated from beginning to end by only one person, which is supposed to guarantee the quality and uniqueness of its products.

In 2012, Hermès retail outlets changed their policy regarding returns and exchanges of products. Consumers may only exchange items within ten days of purchase and only for another color variant of the original purchase. No other post-purchase exchanges are permitted, and refunds are never offered, regardless of the consumer's having a receipt.

===Scarves===

The scarf or ''carré'' (square) was introduced in 1937.<ref name="finding"/> The first example was a 70&nbsp;cm x 70&nbsp;cm print of white-wigged females playing a popular period game, a custom-made accessory named "Jeu des Omnibus et Dames Blanches."<ref name="finding"/> Hermès oversaw the production of its scarves throughout the entire process, purchasing raw Chinese silk, spinning it into [[yarn]], and weaving it into fabric twice as strong and heavy as most scarves available at the time.<ref name="finding"/>

The company's scarf designers spend years creating new print patterns that are individually screen-printed.<ref name="finding"/> Designers can choose from over 70,000 different colors.<ref name="coleno">{{cite book | title=The Hermès Scarf: History & Mystique | publisher=Thames & Hudson | author=Colino, Nadine | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-500-51518-1}}</ref> When production first began, a dedicated factory was established in [[Lyon]], France, the same year that Hermès celebrated its 100th anniversary.

Contemporary Hermès ''carrés'' measure 90&nbsp;cm × 90&nbsp;cm, weigh 65&nbsp;grams and are woven from the silk of 250 [[Bombyx mori|mulberry moth]] [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoon]]s.<ref name="coleno"/> All hems are hand-stitched. Motifs are wide-ranging, Two silk-scarf collections per year are released, along with some reprints of older designs and limited editions. And two collections per year are introduced in a [[Cashmere wool|Cashmere]]/silk blend. Since 1937, Hermès has produced over 2,000 unique designs; the horse motif is particularly famous and popular.<ref name="coleno"/> The ubiquitous "Brides de Gala" version, introduced in 1957, has been produced more than 70,000 times. An Hermès scarf is sold somewhere in the world every 25 seconds; by the late 1970s, more than 1.1 million scarves had been sold worldwide.<ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/>

The scarves<ref name="ContemporaryFashion"/> have been worn by an array of celebrities, partially such as:
* [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in a large number of [[paparazzi]] photographs also with sister Princess Margaret, in the middle of one of three portraits on a 1986 British postage stamp, and by Helen Mirren playing the monarch in the film ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'', 2006.
* Princess [[Grace Kelly]] in a photograph on the cover of a 1956 issue of ''Life'' magazine and, in the same year, tied by her as a sling for a broken arm.
* Jackie Kennedy Onassis over her head and tied around her neck.
* actress Audrey Hepburn in a photograph on the cover of a 1956 issue of ''Life" magazine and in the film ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', 1963.
* actress [[Sharon Stone]] in a [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] scene in the film ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', 1992.
* actress [[Cameron Diaz]] in the film ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]'', 1997.
* actress [[Anne Hathaway]] in the film ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', 2001.
* deputy artistic director of Hermès women's wear, Bali Barret, as a cape, 2011.
* entertainer [[Madonna]] wearing "La Vie au Cheval" design as a halter top, 2002.

===Neckties===
[[File:Hermes ties.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Hermès silk [[Neckties|ties]].]]
In 1946, the brand introduced a range of men's silk neckties in an array of motifs and widths. Neckties account for 10% of the company's annual sales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/history-hermes-alessio-farnetani/|title=THE HISTORY OF HERMES|date=2015-09-15|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}</ref>

===Partnership with the Tuareg===
For years, Hermès has partnered with [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] tribesmen for silver jewelry. The [[Sahara]]n [[nomad]]s' traditional motifs are often mirrored in various Hermès products, including scarves.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/tuareg-chic-164951187/|title=Tuareg Chic|access-date=8 December 2014|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}</ref>

==Leather Goods==

[[File:Hermes Birkin.JPG|160px|thumb|A Hermès [[Birkin bag]]]]

Hermès is known for its handmade luggage and handbags. One of them might require 18 to 24 hours to produce. The construction of each [[Kelly bag]], for example, requires 18 hours to fully realize.<ref name="finding"/> Hermès's leathers come from all over the world. Customers may currently wait from six months to one year for delivery of one of the house's signature bags. Incidentally, should Hermès's leather goods require repair, owners can bring an item to any Hermès store, where it will be shipped to Les Ateliers Hermès in [[Pantin]] for repair or reconditioning.

Another famous Hermès handbag, the "[[Birkin bag|Birkin]]", was named after English actress [[Jane Birkin]]. In a chance encounter with Jean-Louis Dumas, she complained that her bag was not practical for everyday use. Consequently, he invited her to France where they co-designed the bag in 1984. Birkin has since stopped carrying her namesake bag due to her [[tendonitis]], as the bag became too large and heavy for her to carry.<ref>https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/the-birkin-rules</ref> Asked by her that her name be removed and with much back-and-forth comments about various issues such as having her name removed. According to ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'': "Jane Birkin 'is satisfied by the measures taken by Hermès', according to the brand, following an investigation by the fashion house [that refuted] claims made by PETA [the animal-rights organization] that its famous Birkin bags were being 'constructed from the skins of factory-farmed and cruelly slaughtered crocodiles.' "<ref>Scarlet Conlon, "Birkin 'Satisfied" by Hermès Investigation," [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], 15 September 2015</ref>

==Perfumery==
Since 1951, the company has created a number of scents for both men and women, as well as unisex lines.<ref>[https://assets.hermes.com/is/content/hermesedito/RSE/PDF/PDF_RSE_DocumentDeReference_2016_EN.pdf Hermès International, 2016 Registration Document]</ref>

Belonging to the group is the crystal glass manufacturer [[Saint-Louis (glass manufacturer)|Saint-Louis]], the oldest [[lead glass|crystal]] company in the world. Since its founding in 1586, Saint-Louis has drawn design inspiration from the decorative periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, from the Restoration to Modern styles, through Napoléon III, [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Déco]].
