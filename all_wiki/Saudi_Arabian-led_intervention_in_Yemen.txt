Saudi-backed [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], running unopposed as the only candidate for president, won the [[2012 Yemeni presidential election|2012 Yemeni elections]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22096125|title=Yemen President Hadi 'removes Republican Guard commander'|work=BBC News |date=10 April 2013|access-date=12 April 2015}}</ref> Since August 2014, the [[Houthis]] (or Ansar Allah), a [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] movement and militant group thought to be backed by [[Iran]], dissatisfied with Hadi government's decisions and the new constitution, arranged mass protests which culminated into [[2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|their takeover of the Yemeni government]] in 2015, declaring victory of the revolution and drafting a new constitution when Hadi's provisional government had already expired its term. Saudi Arabia and other countries denounced this as an unconstitutional coup d'état.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/01/21/uk-yemen-security-gcc-idUKKBN0KU1YX20150121|title=Gulf Arab ministers condemn Houthi 'coup' in Yemen|work=[[Reuters]]|date=21 January 2015|access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>

In military operations on the ground, the Houthis were supported by sections of the Yemeni armed forces loyal to former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], who was removed from power as part of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/rebels-push-offensive-in-aden-killing-dozens-with-artillery-fire/2015/03/31/79f53d9e-d729-11e4-bf0b-f648b95a6488_story.html|title=Yemen's Houthi Rebels get boost from country's ousted dictator|date=31 March 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Ali|last=al-Mujahed}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemen-leak-collusion-between-houthis-and-ex-president-saleh-1125273454|title=Yemen leak: Collusion between Houthis and ex-president Saleh|publisher=[[Middle East Eye]]|date=22 January 2015}}</ref> Houthi leaders claimed<ref name="Al Monitor">{{cite news |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/yemen-saudi-saleh-airstrikes.html#|title=Yemen's Saleh proves to be a survivor|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]] |date=29 March 2015}}</ref> that Saudi Arabia was trying to break the alliance between the Houthis and Saleh's supporters, reports<ref name="Al Monitor"/> claimed that Saleh's son Ahmed Ali Saleh had traveled to the Saudi capital to attempt to broker a deal to end the airstrikes.

By September 2014, Houthi fighters captured [[Sana'a|Sanaʽa]], toppling Hadi's government. Soon after, a peace deal (known as the 'Peace and Partnership Agreement') was sealed between the Hadi government and the Houthis, but was not honored by either party. The deal was drafted with the intent of defining a power-sharing government. A conflict over a draft constitution resulted in the Houthis consolidating control over the Yemeni capital in January 2015. After resigning from his post alongside his prime minister and remaining under virtual house arrest for one month, Hadi fled to [[Aden]] in [[South Yemen|southern Yemen]] in February.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/iraq-iran-gulf/yemen/b045-yemen-at-war.aspx |title= Yemen at War | publisher=[[International Crisis Group]] |date= 27 March 2015| access-date= 6 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Heinze|first=Marie-Christine|url= http://en.qantara.de/content/the-crisis-in-yemen-the-primacy-of-stability-over-real-change |title= The crisis in Yemen – The primacy of stability over real change | publisher= [[Qantara.de]] |date=30 January 2015|access-date=12 April 2015}}</ref> Upon arriving in Aden, Hadi withdrew his resignation, saying that the actions of the Houthis from September 2014 had amounted to a "coup" against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemens-hadi-withdraws-resignation-un-pushes-dialogue-1907885482|title=Yemen's Hadi withdraws resignation, as UN pushes for dialogue|date=24 February 2015|publisher=[[Middle East Eye]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/yemen-abd-rabbu-masnour-hadi-150224001628332.html|title=Yemen's ousted president withdraws resignation|date=24 February 2015|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] }}</ref> By 25 March, forces answering to Sanaʽa were [[Battle of Aden (2015)|rapidly closing in on Aden]], which Hadi had declared to be Yemen's temporary capital.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yementimes.com/en/1871/news/4999/Al-Subaihi-captured-and-Lahj-falls-as-Houthis-move-on-Aden.htm|newspaper=[[Yemen Times]] |title=Al Subaihi captured and Lahj falls as Houthis move on Aden|date=25 March 2015|access-date=26 March 2015}}</ref>

On the night of 6 May 2015, the Saudi-led coalition carried out 130 airstrikes in Yemen in a 24-hour period. At first, coalition spokesperson Ahmed Asiri admitted that schools and hospitals were targeted but claimed that these were used as weapon storage sites. Asiri later claimed that his words had been mistranslated. The United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Yemen Johannes Van Der Klaauw said that these bombings constituted a [[war crime]]. "The indiscriminate bombing of populated areas, with or without prior warning, is a contravention international humanitarian law," he said. He continued to say that he was particularly concerned about airstrikes on Saada "where scores of civilians were reportedly killed and thousands were forced to flee their homes after the coalition declared the entire governate a military target".<ref name="edition.cnn.com">{{cite news |title=U.N. rep accuses Saudi-led coalition of violating international law |author=Mariano Castillo |date=12 May 2015 |publisher=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/09/asia/saudi-airstrikes-yemen/|author-link=Mariano Castillo }}</ref>

=== Declaring the entire governorate of Sa'ada a military target ===
On 8 May 2015, a spokesperson for the Saudi-led coalition declared the entire city of [[Sa'dah]], with a population of around 50,000 people, a military target. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]: "This not only violated the laws-of-war prohibition against placing civilians at particular risk by treating a number of separate and distinct military objectives as a single military target, but possibly also the prohibition against making threats of violence whose purpose is to instill terror in the civilian population."<ref name="HRW Targeting Saada">{{cite web |date=30 June 2015 |title=Targeting Saada: Unlawful Coalition Airstrikes on Saada City in Yemen |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/06/30/targeting-saada/unlawful-coalition-airstrikes-saada-city-yemen}}</ref>

U.N.

[[Save the Children]]'s Country Director in Yemen, Edward Santiago, said that the "indiscriminate attacks after the dropping of leaflets urging civilians to leave Sa'ada raises concerns about the possible pattern being established in breach of International Humanitarian Law. Warning civilians does not exonerate the coalition from their obligation to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, and we have seen in the last days that the warnings have not been enough to spare civilian lives.

MSF's director of operations Raquel Ayora said: "The way war is being waged in Yemen is causing enormous suffering and shows that the warring parties do not recognise or respect the protected status of hospitals and medical facilities.

HRW declared, on 17 February 2016, that Saudi Arabia's warnings to stay away were insufficient to fulfil their legal obligations to protect aid stations and their occupants.

=== Usage of cluster munitions ===
In early May 2015, [[Human Rights Watch]] accused Saudi Arabia of using US-supplied [[cluster munition]]s on at least two occasions. The Saudi military acknowledged using [[CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon|CBU-105 bombs]], but it claimed they were only employed against armoured vehicles and not in population centers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/03/middleeast/yemen-hrw-cluster-munitions-saudi-arabia/|publisher=CNN|title=Report: Saudi Arabia used U.S.-supplied cluster bombs in Yemen|date=3 May 2015|access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref><ref name="NYT20150503SLG">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/world/middleeast/saudi-led-group-said-to-use-cluster-bombs-in-yemen.html| newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Kareem | last=Fahim | title=Saudi-Led Group Said to Use Cluster Bombs in Yemen | date=3 May 2015}}</ref> Yemeni security officials claimed that cluster bombs were dropped in a civilian area of the Western suburbs of the Yemeni capital Sanaa.

In December 2016, a Saudi spokesperson admitted that at least some of the coalition's cluster bombs were manufactured in the United Kingdom. British prime minister [[Theresa May]] refused to answer when asked in parliament when she first became aware that UK-made cluster bombs were being used.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rowena Mason |author2=Ewen MacAskill |date=19 December 2016 |title=Saudi Arabia admits it used UK-made cluster bombs in Yemen; Confirmation by Saudi-led coalition raises pressure on UK government which has refused to curb arms sales to Riyadh |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/19/saudi-arabia-admits-use-uk-made-cluster-bombs-yemen|author2-link=Ewen MacAskill }}</ref>

[[Amnesty International]] has called on Saudi Arabia to destroy its stockpile of cluster bombs and accede to the International Convention on Cluster Munitions.

===Alleged use of white phosphorus===
In September 2016, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Saudi Arabia "appears" to be using US-made [[white phosphorus munitions]] against Yemen, based on images and videos posted to social media. Under US regulations, white phosphorus is only allowed to be used to signal to other troops and to reduce visibility in open ground, creating a smoke-screen. It is not to be used to attack humans as it burns human flesh down to the bone, which is considered excessively cruel. A United States official said the department was looking into whether the Saudis used white phosphorus improperly.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saudi Arabia appears to be using U.S.-supplied white phosphorus in its war in Yemen |author=Thomas Gibbons-Neff |date=19 September 2016 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/09/19/saudi-arabia-appears-to-be-using-u-s-supplied-white-phosphorus-in-its-war-in-yemen/}}</ref>

=== UAE secret prisons ===
In October 2017, a Yemeni citizen died under "severe torture" inside a secret prison run by the United Arab Emirates in the south of Yemen. As videos showed, the body of Ahmed Dubba revealed disturbing signs of torture after it was released from Khanfar Prison. According to media reports, UAE forces in Yemen had carried out a detention campaign against religious scholars and preachers who opposed their presence in the country where prisoners were subject to physical and psychological torture. According to Yemeni rights group Sam, the issue of secret prisons in Yemen has become a regular phenomenon.<ref>{{cite news |date=30 September 2017 |title=Yemeni dies of torture in UAE run prison in Yemen |publisher=Middle East Monitor |url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170930-yemeni-dies-of-torture-in-uae-run-prison-in-yemen/}}</ref>

In a controversial decision in 2019, that was opposed by many career professionals, the U.S. secretary of state waived the inclusion of Saudi Arabia on its annual list of countries that recruit child soldiers, even though it met all the criteria to be included. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/18/mike-pompeo-saudi-arabia-yemen-sudan-child-soldiers|title=Pompeo blocks inclusion of Saudi Arabia on US child soldiers list|date=18 June 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Former deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, [[Michael Mulroy]], said, "this is a glaring example of an OPAC signatory not adhering to the stipulations of their signed commitments.

in 2018. Andrew Smith of the [[Campaign Against Arms Trade]] condemned the increase and criticized the UK arms industry of being dominated by human rights abusers and dictatorships. UK-made fighter jets have been accused of causing catastrophic damage in [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/uk-arms-trade-repressive-regimes|title=Britain boosts arms sales to repressive regimes by £1bn|accessdate=25 April 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref> According to a May 28, 2020 article by [[The New York Times]], the [[Donald Trump|Trump]] administration in January 2020 told lawmakers that it was planning to sell a cache of munitions to [[Saudi Arabia]], despite the kingdom's [[human rights]] record. Reportedly, the sale of the said $478 million, precision-guided missiles used in Yemen war to Saudi, and approval of licenses permitting [[Raytheon]] to expand manufacturing in Riyadh are objected by lawmakers in both, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/congress-saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html|title=Trump Officials Consider Defying Congress to Sell More Weapons to Saudi Arabia|accessdate=28 May 2020|website=The New York Times}}</ref>

In early June 2020, the [[Government of France|French government]] published a report on the arms exports of 2019, where the sale of €1.4 billion arms was made to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Human Rights Watch]] urged the French authorities to halt any arms sale to Saudi, considering the country is accused in possible war crimes and human rights abuses in [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/10/france-should-halt-arms-exports-saudi-arabia-egypt|title=France Should Halt Arms Exports to Saudi Arabia, Egypt|accessdate=10 June 2020|website=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>In July 2020, Amnesty International revealed that France had promoted a private military center to train Saudi troops and backed it both, financially and politically. According to the report, France intended to train the Saudi soldiers in the operations of the latest versions of weapons that had already been used in the Yemeni conflict. The training center has been set up at the town of [[Commercy]] in [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]] with funds extracted from the French taxpayer's money, violating international treaties, as per Lebel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20200707-saudi-soldiers-are-training-in-military-camp-in-france-says-amnesty|title=Saudi soldiers are training in military camp in France, says Amnesty|accessdate=7 July 2020|website=RFI}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/world/mid-east/france-trains-saudi-soldiers-in-military-camp-to-wage-war-in-yemen-amnesty-international|title= France trains Saudi soldiers in military camp to wage war in Yemen: Amnesty International |accessdate= 4 October 2020|website=Daily Sabah}}</ref> In September 2020, [[Canada]] was listed among the countries, who contributed in fueling the [[Yemeni Civil War (2014–present)|Yemen Civil War]], by a [[United Nations]] panel. Following that, 39 human rights organizations, arms-control groups and labor unions, including the [[Public Service Alliance of Canada]], sent a joint letter to the Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], urging for the country to end arms exports to [[Saudi Arabia]], which had been one of the crucial contributor to the humanitarian crisis causes in [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-urged-to-end-arms-exports-to-saudi-arabia-after-canada-cited/|title=Trudeau urged to end arms exports to Saudi Arabia after Canada cited for fueling Yemen war|accessdate=17 September 2020|website=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

According to official figures released by the [[Department for International Trade]](DIT), the [[United Kingdom]] has exported £11bn worth of arms in 2019, becoming the second highest arms exporter after [[United States]]. The UK traded arms despite June 2019 court ruling halting weapons sale to [[Saudi Arabia]] due to use in Yemen war causing the worst humanitarian crisis. In July 2020, Britain resumed arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Official figures of the weapons sale to Saudi Arabia were not included in the data, however, in 2019, 60% of the arms sales were made to Middle Eastern countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/06/uk-remains-second-biggest-arms-exporter-with-11bn-of-orders|title=UK remains second biggest arms exporter with £11bn of orders|accessdate=6 October 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

In October 2020, anti-arms trade campaigners legally challenged Britain’s arms sale to Saudi Arabia. The [[Campaign Against Arms Trade]] (CAAT) stated that UK-made weapons had been fueling a prolonged conflict in Yemen as the bombing by coalition led by Saudi Arabia has resulted in the killing of thousands of civilians over the past 5 years of war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/27/uk-faces-new-legal-challenge-over-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia|title=UK faces new legal challenge over arms sales to Saudi Arabia|accessdate=27 October 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

In late November 2020, Fourteen French human rights [[NGO]]s and humanitarian organisations urged the government to end its opacity on the sale of arms to [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], in order to initiate parliamentary control. A December 2018 fact-finding mission on arms export control by co-rapporteurs and MPs, Jacques Maire and Michele Tabarot, was based on public opinion and mobilisation of NGOs against arms sale by the government to Saudi-led coalition, including UAE, which likely used it illicitly against Yemeni civilians. In the November 2020 dialogue, NGOs stressed over the significance of the Parliament’s duty to administer arms export by the French government to prevent its complicity in [[war crimes]] and events violating the international humanitarian law, specially in [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fidh.org/en/region/europe-central-asia/france/call-for-parliamentary-control-over-french-arms-sales|title=A call for the establishment of parliamentary control over French arms sales|accessdate=26 November 2020|website=International Federation for Human Rights}}</ref>

On 25 July airstrikes killed over 120 civilians in the town of Mokha, marking the deadliest strike yet against civilians. The airstrikes hit workers' housing for a power plant in Mokha, flattening some of the buildings, the officials said. A fire erupted in the area, charring many of the corpses. "It just shows what is the trend now of the airstrikes from the coalition," said Hassan Boucenine of the Geneva-based Doctors Without Borders. "Now, it's a house, it's a market, it's anything." He added that many of the workers had families visiting for the Eid al-Fitr holiday at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Mokha, populated largely by fishermen, had a reputation as one of the safest places in the country embroiled in war, said Boucenine.<ref name="ap.org"/>

Peace talks between the exiled government and the Houthis concluded in Geneva without reaching a ceasefire.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1189260/talks-on-yemen-war-end-without-agreement |title=Talks on Yemen war end without agreement | newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |location=Pakistan |date= 20 June 2015| access-date= 20 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Chanda|first=Abikh|url=https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Jun-15/302154-ban-calls-for-two-week-ceasefire-in-yemen-talks.ashx |title= Ban calls for immediate humanitarian truce in Yemen |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]] |location=Lebanon |date= 15 June 2015| access-date= 20 June 2015}}</ref>

=== Ramadan peace agreement ===
On 4 July 2015, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul Salam said in a post on his Facebook page that he had met Ahmed on Friday to discuss a Ramadan truce. The US and EU announced their support for a humanitarian truce.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/04/us-yemen-security-idUSKCN0PD12N20150704|title=Yemen's Houthis say Ramadan humanitarian pause under discussion |work=[[Reuters]] |date=4 July 2015 |access-date=13 July 2015}}</ref>

=== Further peace talks ===
On 8 September 2015, [[Vice News]] revealed a leaked email by UN Envoy to Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed. In it, the envoy confirms that Houthi rebels and the party of former president and Houthi ally Ali Abdullah Saleh have expressed willingness to accept—with some reservations—a UN Security Council resolution, approved in April. This demanded the rebels "withdraw their forces from all areas they have seized, including the capital, Sanaa". "AA/GPC agreed to a new wording on UNSC resolution 2216 that states unequivocally that they are committed to the implementation of 2216 (see document attached) with the exception of article which infringe on Yemeni sovereignty and those related to sanctions," wrote Ould Cheikh Ahmed, referring to Ansar Allah (AA)—another name for the Houthis—and Saleh's General People's Congress party (GPC). "In addition, the new text includes acceptance of the return of the current government for a period of 60 days during which a government of national unity shall be formed," wrote the envoy in the email. According to Ould Cheikh Ahmed, during talks, the Houthis gave ground on certain language, including "mandatory support by the international community for reconstruction that was in the earlier version". "The latter was particularly opposed by KSA [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] and GCC [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] who did not want it to be interpreted as a form of mandatory compensation," added the UN envoy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.vice.com/article/leaked-un-email-on-yemen-shows-difficulty-of-negotiations-and-fears-over-al-qaedas-growing-presence|title=Leaked UN Email on Yemen Shows Difficulty of Negotiations – and Fears Over Al Qaeda's Growing Presence|publisher=[[Vice News]]|access-date=15 November 2015}}</ref>

On 10 September, UN Envoy to Yemen announced that all parties had agreed to peace talks. A statement from Hadi's office following a meeting on the issue of new talks affirmed the president's "complete support for the sincere efforts exerted by the special envoy". It urged Ahmed to "exert efforts to achieve the public and honest commitment on the part of the Houthis and Saleh" to implement 14 April council resolution unconditionally.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/09/10/un-envoy-announces-new-yemen-peace-talks-next-week|title=UN envoy announces new Yemen peace talks next week|work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |access-date=15 November 2015}}</ref> On 13 September, the exiled Yemeni government announced that it would no longer participate in the peace talks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/13/middleeast/yemen-president-u-n-talks/|title=As U.N.

=== 2016 talks ===
On 18 April, peace talks aimed at ending Yemen's civil war that were set to begin faltered before they could start, when delegates representing Yemen's Houthi rebels refused to attend.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/world/middleeast/yemen-peace-effort-falters-as-houthis-refuse-to-attend-talks.html|title=Yemen Peace Effort Falters as Houthis Refuse to Attend Talks|last1=Al-batati|first1=Saeed|date=18 April 2016|last2=Fahim|first2=Kareem|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref>

On 20 April, talks convened, based on UN Security Council resolution 2216 which called for the Houthi fighters to withdraw from areas they seized since 2014 and hand heavy weapons back to the government.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/yemen-peace-talks-kuwait-160423045644770.html|title=UN Yemen envoy hails 'constructive' peace talks|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref>

On 6 August, the UN special envoy to Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, announced the suspension in Kuwait, where the talks were being held. He said that the negotiations were not a failure and that they would resume in a month at an undisclosed location. Mr. Ahmed is the second United Nations envoy to try to broker peace talks between the Houthis and other factions in Yemen since March 2015. His predecessor quit after similar peace talk efforts failed. After the breakdown of the talks, one of the Houthi negotiators, Nasser Bagazgooz, blamed the United Nations envoy for seeking what he said amounted to a military solution on behalf of the Saudi-led coalition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/world/middleeast/yemen-peace-talks-cease-fire.html|title=Talks to End War in Yemen Are Suspended|last=Nordland|first=Rod|date=6 August 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref> Previous negotiations floated the idea of forming a unity government—composed of Houthi and former Hadi government leaders. But the exiled Hadi leaders have consistently rejected any deal that would diminish their power over Yemen, and the Houthis have said that they will reject any deal that does not give them a seat at the table.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/08/11/lopsided-peace-talks-collapse-saudis-resume-yemen-bombing-and-u-s-sells-more-weapons/|title=Lopsided Peace Talks Collapse, Saudis Resume Bombing Yemen and U.S. Sells More Weapons|last=Emmons2016-08-11T18:45:04+00:00|first=Alex EmmonsAlex|website=[[The Intercept]] |access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/yemen-talks-kuwait-war-saudi-arabia-houthis-hadi-government.html|title=Yemen peace talks stuck in stalemate|date=20 May 2016 |publisher=[[Al-Monitor]] |access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/yemens-houthis-challenge-un-peace-deal-demanding-unity-president-2076774143|title=Houthis demand 'unity' president as part of Yemen peace deal|access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref>

;November ceasefire

The Saudi-led military coalition and Houthis (Ansar Allah) arrived at a swift ceasefire agreement effective 17 November 2016, as a result of efforts of US Secretary of State John Kerry and Omani dignitaries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.shiitenews.org/index.php/yemen |title=John Kerry says Yemen's Houthis and Saudi coalition agree to ceasefire |work=[[The Guardian]] | date= 15 November 2016| accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>
