The '''Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany''' (German: ''Verdienstorden der Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', or ''Bundesverdienstorden'', BVO)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford dictionary of abbreviations |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780192800732 |page=70 |edition=2nd |accessdate=27 October 2018 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWwKWnp9vaoC}}</ref> is the only [[state decoration|federal decoration]] of [[Germany]]. It was created by the first [[President of Germany|President of the Federal Republic of Germany]], [[Theodor Heuss]], on 7 September 1951, and has been awarded to over 200,000 individuals in total, both Germans and foreigners. Since the 1990s, the number of annual awards has declined from over 4,000, first to around 2,300–2,500 per year, and now under 2,000, with a low of 1752 in 2011. In recent years,{{When?|date=January 2020}} women have made up a steady 30–31% of recipients.<ref>[http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Role-and-Functions/HonoursAndDecorations/TheOrderOfMerit/theorderofmerit-node.html The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany], English; [http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Amt-und-Aufgaben/Orden-und-Ehrungen/Verdienstorden/Statistik/statistik-der-ordensverleihungen-node.html German, statistics], both Website of the President, and accessed 29 March 2014</ref>  Colloquially, the decorations of the different classes of the Order are also known as the '''Federal Cross of Merit''' (''Bundesverdienstkreuz'').

Most of the [[States of Germany|German federal states]] (''Länder'') have each their own [[Order of Merit (disambiguation)|order of merit]] as well, with the exception of the [[Free Imperial City|Free]] and [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] Cities of [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]], which reject any orders (by old tradition their citizens, particularly former or present senators, will refuse any decoration in the form of an order, the most famous example being former [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Schmidt]]).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Binder |first1=Elisabeth |title=Bundesverdienstkreuz: Das Kreuz mit dem Dank |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bundesverdienstkreuz-das-kreuz-mit-dem-dank/253942.html |accessdate=22 March 2017 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |date=6 September 2001 |language=German}}</ref>

==History==
The order was established on 7 September 1951 by the decree of the then Federal President [[Theodor Heuss]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Wördehoff |first=Bernhard  |date=26 May 1989 |title=Ehre in Serie |url=https://www.zeit.de/1989/22/ehre-in-serie |work=[[Die Zeit]] |location=Hamburg |language=German |access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> The decree, which was co-signed by the President Heuss together with [[Chancellor]] [[Konrad Adenauer]] and the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Minister of the Interior]], [[Robert Lehr]], signed, states:

{{quote|Desiring to visibly express recognition and gratitude to deserving men and women of the German people and of foreign countries, on the second Anniversary of the Federal Republic of Germany, I establish the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. It is awarded for achievements that served the rebuilding of the country in the fields of political, socio-economic and intellectual activity, and is intended to mean an award of all those whose work contributes to the peaceful rise of the Federal Republic of Germany.}}

==Classes==
The Order comprises four groups with eight regular and one special classes, hereafter the official denominations in English:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/blob/215266/5c40f9ea236ed39858e8c2e8194ba175/ordensstufen-data.pdf |title=Ordensstufen des Verdienstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland |publisher=[[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Federal Foreign Office]]|author=|date=|website=auswaertiges-amt.de|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>

** Grand Cross special class (''Sonderstufe des Großkreuzes''); the highest class of the Order reserved for heads of state.

** Grand Cross 1st class (''Großkreuz''); Grand Cross
* '''Great Cross of Merit''' (German: Großes Verdienstkreuz)
** Grand Cross (''Großes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern und Schulterband''); Great Cross with Star and Sash
** Knight Commander's Cross (''Großes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern''); Great Cross with Star

The President of the Federal Republic holds the ''Grand Cross special class'' [[ex officio]]. It is awarded to him in a ceremony by the [[President of the Bundestag]], attended by the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of Germany]], the [[President of the German Bundesrat|President of the Bundesrat]], and the [[Supreme Court of Germany|Supreme Court President]]. Other than the German president, only a foreign [[head of state]] and their spouse can be awarded with this highest class. There is also the provision of awarding the ''Grand Cross'' in a "special issue" with laurel wreath design (''Großkreuz in besonderer Ausführung''), in which the central medallion with the black eagle is surrounded by a stylized [[laurel wreath]] in relief. This ''Grand Cross special issue'' has been awarded so far only twice, to former German chancellors [[Konrad Adenauer]] and [[Helmut Kohl]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bundesverdienstkreuz mit Lorbeerkranz für Kohl |language=German |url=http://rhein-zeitung.de/on/98/10/26/topnews/kohl.html |publisher=Rhein-Zeitung |date=26 October 1998}}</ref>

==Insignia==
Except for the lowest class, the badge is the same for all classes, but with slightly different versions for men and women (slightly smaller badge and ribbon for women):

The ''badge'' is a golden [[cross]] enamelled in red, with a central disc bearing a black eagle.

The ''star'' is a golden star with straight rays, its size and points vary according to class, with the badge superimposed upon it.
* 8-pointed golden Star: Grand Cross special class
* 6-pointed golden Star: Grand Cross 1st class (and ''special issue'' design if golden oak crown between the cross branches around the medallion)
* 4-pointed golden Star: Grand Cross (Grand Cross of Merit with Star and Sash)
* silver Square-upon-point: Knight Commander (Grand Officer)

The ''[[riband]]'' is red with gold-black-gold stripes.<ref>Hieronymussen, P. O., ''Orders and Decorations of Europe in Color''	([[London]]: [[Macmillan Publishers]], 1967).</ref>
