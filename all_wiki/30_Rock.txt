'''''30 Rock''''' is<!--Do not change this to "was"; we continue using "is" after a TV show concludes.--> an American [[satire|satirical]] [[sitcom]] television series created by [[Tina Fey]] that originally aired on [[NBC]] from October 11, 2006 to January 31, 2013. The series, based on Fey's experiences as head writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', takes place behind the scenes of a fictional live [[sketch comedy]] show depicted as airing on NBC. The series' name refers to [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] in [[New York City]], the address of the now [[30 Rockefeller Center|Comcast Building]], where the [[NBC Studios (New York City)|NBC Studios]] are located and where ''Saturday Night Live'' is written, produced, and performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ndsmcobserver.com/media/storage/paper660/news/2007/09/19/Scene/Rock-Solid.Comedy.Shines.In.First.Season-2976690.shtml |title=Rock Solid Comedy Shines in First Season |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |author=Belek, Cassie |date=September 19, 2007 |work=The Observer |location=UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206021522/http://media.www.ndsmcobserver.com/media/storage/paper660/news/2007/09/19/Scene/Rock-Solid.Comedy.Shines.In.First.Season-2976690.shtml |archivedate=December 6, 2008  }}</ref> The series was produced by [[Lorne Michaels]]' [[Broadway Video]] (which also produces ''Saturday Night Live'') and Fey's [[Little Stranger (film company)|Little Stranger, Inc.]], in association with [[NBCUniversal]].<ref name="nbcseriespress">{{cite press release | url=http://www.nbc.com/30-rock/about/ | title=30 Rock Comedy TV Show | publisher=[[NBC Universal]] Media Village | accessdate=February 18, 2012 | archive-date=October 11, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011082628/http://www.nbc.com/30-rock/about/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

Tonally, ''30 Rock'' uses [[surreal humor]] to parody the complex corporate structure of NBC and its then parent company [[General Electric]]. A critic for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' once remarked that it "usually adopts the manic pacing of a live-action cartoon."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van der Werff|first1=Todd|title=Live Show review|url=https://www.avclub.com/tvclub/30-rock-live-show-46199|website=AV Club|access-date=April 17, 2020|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114234855/https://tv.avclub.com/30-rock-live-show-1798166261|url-status=live}}</ref> The show was influential in its extensive use of [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]]: sudden, short cuts to unrelated scenes showing something the characters are briefly discussing. ''30 Rock'' also became known for its dedication to making sets extremely elaborate, once showing a set that took three days to build for only six seconds of video.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wyatt|first1=Edward|title=Werewolf Bar Mitzvah|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/arts/television/25were.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 27, 2014|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114234857/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/arts/television/25were.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref>

''30 Rock'' won several major awards (including [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|2007]], [[60th Primetime Emmy Awards|2008]], and [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards|2009]] and nominations for every other year it ran), and appeared on many critics' year-end "best of" 2006–2013 lists.

==Premise==
Liz Lemon (Fey) is head writer and showrunner of the [[NBC]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' (originally called ''The Girlie Show''), produced in Studio 6H in 30 Rockefeller Plaza. She supervises cast and crew including star Jenna Maroney (Krakowski), her best friend, while working with network executive Jack Donaghy (Baldwin) and [[NBC page|page]] Kenneth Parcell (McBrayer). In the first episode, Donaghy forces Lemon to hire the unpredictable Tracy Jordan (Morgan) as costar.

Episodes often depict conservative Donaghy and liberal Lemon's disagreements, Maroney's attempts to become a film star, Jordan's behavior, and the characters' romantic and personal lives. The show satirizes the cultures of NBC, parent company [[General Electric]], and the entertainment industry. The network airs programs like [[reality television|reality shows]] ''MILF Island'', ''Queen of Jordan'' and ''America's Kidz Got Singing'' as well as paranormal drama ''Hunchbacks'', and game show ''Gold Case''. In later seasons, the show depicts the network being acquired by Philadelphia-based media company [[Acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast|Kabletown]] (a parody of [[Comcast]]).

==Development and production==

===Conception===
In 2002, Fey was the head writer and a performer on the television show ''Saturday Night Live'' (''SNL''). She pitched the show that became ''30 Rock'' to NBC, originally as a sitcom about [[cable television|cable]] [[news broadcasting|news]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Hiatt|first1=Brian|title=The Last Days of '30 Rock'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-last-days-of-30-rock-20130131|accessdate=August 17, 2015|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=January 31, 2013|archive-date=June 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627224924/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-last-days-of-30-rock-20130131|url-status=live}}</ref> NBC Entertainment president [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]] felt that "Fey was using the news setting as a [[Fig leaf#Metaphorical use|fig leaf]] for her own experience and [he] encouraged her to write what she knew."<ref name="dev_1">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535853,00.html |title=Do Not Adjust Your Set |first=James |last=Poniewozik |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |date=September 18, 2006 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009001021/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1535853%2C00.html |archivedate=October 9, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an ''SNL''-style sketch show. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 2005–2006 television season.

In May 2003, Fey signed a contract with NBC to remain in her ''SNL'' head writer position until at least the 2004–2005 television season and to develop a primetime project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal.<ref name="dev_2">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Schneider |title=Peacock updates ''SNL'' anchor's deal |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117885681.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=tina+fey+snl+2004%2D05 |work=Variety |date=May 5, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206085913/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117885681.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=tina+fey+snl+2004%2D05 |archivedate=December 6, 2008  }}</ref> Filming was postponed due to Tina Fey's first pregnancy.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoINgNgCx3Q Interview: Tina Fey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114234918/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoINgNgCx3Q |date=November 14, 2020 }}, ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|Adam Carolla Show]]'', October 25, 2006.</ref>

During the 2004–2005 [[Television pilot#Pilot season|pilot season]], a pilot was announced named ''Untitled Tina Fey Project''. The ''30 Rock'' pilot focused on the boss of a variety show who must manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer.

The series underwent further changes during the months leading up to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from ''The Girlie Show'' would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, [[Dot Comedy|DotComedy.com]]. The idea was to air the fictitious ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' online.<ref name="Consoli">{{cite news |first=John |last=Consoli |author2=Berman, Marc |title=NBC Upfront: Unveils DotComedy.com; ''Kidnapped'', ''Studio 60'' Set for Fall |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002502554 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612101404/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002502554 |archivedate=June 12, 2007 |work=Mediaweek |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> This aspect of the series was abandoned prior to its debut.

===Filming===
Interior scenes for ''30 Rock'' were mostly filmed at [[Silvercup Studios]] in Long Island City, Queens, New York City (Studio 8H in 30 Rock in Manhattan for two live episodes).<ref name="filminglocations" /> In the episodes "[[Cleveland (30 Rock)|Cleveland]]" and "[[Hiatus (30 Rock)|Hiatus]]", [[Battery Park City, Manhattan]], and [[Douglaston, Queens]], doubled for [[Cleveland]], Ohio and [[Needmore, Pennsylvania]], respectively.<ref name="cleveneedmorelocations">{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Webb Mitovich |title=Funny Business: Tina Fey Previews 30 Rock's Future |url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/funny-business-tina/070612-02 |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523072255/http://www.tvguide.com/News/funny-business-tina/070612-02 |archivedate=May 23, 2008 }}</ref> In the episode "Gavin Volure", [[stock footage]] of the [[Arkansas Governor's Mansion]] was used for exterior shots of the home of [[Steve Martin]]'s character.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Gambrell |title=Arkansas Governor's Mansion Has "30 Rock" Cameo |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/26/governors-mansion-has-30_n_146578.html |work=The Huffington Post |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=November 28, 2008 |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114234915/https://www.huffpost.com/?err_code=404&err_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2008%2F11%2F26%2Fgovernors-mansion-has-30_n_146578.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The title sequence is made up of photos and video of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and features the series regulars. The sequence ends with a [[Time-lapse photography|time lapse]] of the building and then a title card reading "30&nbsp;Rock". The sequence has remained mostly the same throughout the series, although changes have been made to the images of most of the actors.

===Music===

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of 30 Rock characters}}
<!-- No-free image with insufficient rationale [[File:30 Rock cast image for Season 2.JPG|alt=Informally posed shot of the show's five main cast members huddled together. All are smiling broadly.|thumb|From left: Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan, Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy, Tina Fey as Liz Lemon, Jane Krakowski as Jenna Maroney and Jack McBrayer as Kenneth Parcell]] -->

''30 Rock'' features an [[ensemble cast]].<ref name="nbcseriespress" /> The seven roles that receive star [[billing (film)|billing]] during the [[opening credits]] are:
* [[Tina Fey]] as [[Liz Lemon]], a "sexually frightened know-it-all" and head writer of ''TGS with Tracy Jordan''.
* [[Tracy Morgan]] as [[Tracy Jordan]], the loose-cannon, crazy, and unpredictable star of ''TGS''.
* [[Jane Krakowski]] as [[Jenna Maroney]], the original star of "The Girlie Show", co-star of ''TGS'' and Liz's constantly attention-seeking, arrogant and clueless best friend.
* [[Jack McBrayer]] as [[Kenneth Ellen Parcell]], a cheerful, obedient [[Southern United States|Southern]]-born [[NBC page]] who "lives for television".
* [[Scott Adsit]] as [[Pete Hornberger]], the "sane", quick-witted producer of ''TGS'', who often reveals embarrassing details about his family life.
* [[Judah Friedlander]] as [[Frank Rossitano]], a [[trucker hat]]-wearing, [[Puer aeternus|manchildish]], sarcastic writer at ''TGS''. His hat bears a different phrase in every episode.
* [[Alec Baldwin]] as [[Jack Donaghy]], the decisive, controlling, suave, and occasionally senseless network executive who constantly interferes with the goings-on at ''TGS''.

Beginning with season two, several actors received star billing after the opening credits.<ref name="nbcseriespress" />
* [[Katrina Bowden]] as [[Cerie Xerox]], Liz's attractive, laid-back assistant, who usually wears revealing outfits to work, much to the delight of the writers' room. (seasons 2–7; recurring season 1)
* [[Keith Powell]] as [[James "Toofer" Spurlock]], a TGS writer who is "two for one", a Harvard guy and a black guy, and the polar opposite of both Tracy and Frank. (seasons 2–7; recurring season 1)
* [[Lonny Ross]] as [[Josh Girard]], a young and immature ''TGS'' writer and co-star, known for his impressions. (seasons 2–4; recurring season 1)
* [[Kevin Brown (actor)|Kevin Brown]] as [[Dot Com (30 Rock)|Walter "Dot Com" Slattery]], an erudite member of Tracy's entourage who is also a [[Wesleyan University]]-trained stage actor. (seasons 3–7; recurring seasons 1–2)
* [[Grizz Chapman]] as [[Characters of 30 Rock#Grizz|Warren "Grizz" Griswold]], a gentle giant member of Tracy's entourage. (seasons 3–7; recurring seasons 1–2)
* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as [[List of recurring characters on 30 Rock#Jonathan|Jonathan]], Jack's loyal and overprotective personal assistant, who at times appears to be possibly in love with Jack. (seasons 3–5, 7; recurring seasons 1–2)
* [[John Lutz]] as [[J. D. Lutz]], a lazy, overweight ''TGS'' writer who is often insulted or made fun of by the rest of the staff. (seasons 4–7; recurring seasons 1–3)

===Additional characters===
* [[Dean Winters]] as [[List of 30 Rock characters#Dennis Duffy|Dennis Duffy]], the irresponsible ex-boyfriend of Liz, who had guest appearances throughout the series.
* [[Chris Parnell]] as Leo Spaceman, Tracy's [[quackery|quack]] doctor who regularly provides him with experimental treatments.
* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Floyd DeBarber, a lawyer working in 30 Rockefeller who dates Liz before moving home to Cleveland.
* [[Rachel Dratch]] appears as several minor characters throughout the first six seasons, most notably as [[List of 30 Rock characters#Greta Johansen|Greta Johansen]], a cat wrangler working on ''TGS''.
* Sue Galloway as [[List of 30 Rock characters#Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout|Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout]], a French-Dutch writer hired by ''TGS'' and often referred to as "girl-writer".
* [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as Jack "Danny" Baker, a ''TGS'' cast member added in the fourth season.
* [[James Marsden]] as Criss Chros, Liz's boyfriend and later husband, who ran a hot dog stand in his first episodes of the series.

===Casting===
Tina Fey worked with Jen McNamara and [[Adam Bernstein]] for the casting of the series.<ref name="rockcasting">{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Interview-Tina-Fey-Talks-About-30-Rock-Part-1-9723.html |title=Interview: Tina Fey Talks About ''30 Rock'' (Part 1) |accessdate=July 8, 2008 |author=West, Kelly|date=April 1, 2008 |publisher=Cinema Blend| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080625085840/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Interview-Tina-Fey-Talks-About-30-Rock-Part-1-9723.html| archivedate= June 25, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Fey's first act as [[casting director]] was to cast herself as the lead character, Liz Lemon, who is said to be much like Fey herself when she first became head writer on ''SNL''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/#mea=34901 |title=''30 Rock'' Exclusive Video Clips&nbsp;– NBC Official Site |publisher=Nbc.com |accessdate=April 12, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001023916/http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/ |archivedate=October 1, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The next actor to be cast was Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan,<ref name="dev_5">{{cite news |title=NBC comedy a reunion for Morgan, Fey |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001657605 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=December 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 1, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> who was then a former castmate of Fey's in ''SNL''.

[[Rachel Dratch]], Fey's longtime comedy partner and fellow ''SNL'' alumna, was originally cast to portray Jenna.

However, this aspect of the show was scrapped,<ref name="Consoli"/> thus they required more of a straight-ahead acting part for the role of Jenna.

Although Fey went on to say, "Rachel and I were both very excited about this new direction",<ref name="ctvhope"/> Dratch said that she was not happy with the media's depiction of the change as a demotion;<ref name="nymag-dratch">{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/22836/ |title=Rachel Rolls With It |author=Rosenblum, Emma |date=October 16, 2006 |accessdate=September 2, 2008 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5PqXMZmBZ?url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/22836/ |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> furthermore, she was also skeptical about the reasons she was given for the change, and was not happy with the reduction in the number of episodes in which she would appear.<ref name="nymag-dratch" /> Following the first season, Dratch only appeared in a handful of episodes.

The show's cast and crew are outraged by this, especially head writer Liz Lemon and main actress Jenna Maroney. Jack proceeds to wreak havoc on ''The Girlie Show'', forcing Liz to hire off-the-wall movie star Tracy Jordan. He again irritates the cast and crew of ''The Girlie Show'' when he changes the name to ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' (or just ''TGS'').

As the season progresses, the episodes become less about ''TGS'' and more about how the characters deal with juggling their lives and their jobs&nbsp;—specifically the protagonist, Liz Lemon, but other characters are also explored. Episodes also become less self-contained and various story arcs develop in the second half of the season. For example, the first major story arc centers on Liz's relationship with [[Dennis Duffy]] (Dean Winters), "The [[Pager|Beeper]] King". Other story arcs include: Jenna promoting her movie ''[[The Rural Juror]]''; Tracy going on the run from the Black Crusaders; Jack's engagement, which was eventually called off, to a [[Christie's]] auctioneer named [[List of 30 Rock characters#Phoebe|Phoebe]] ([[Emily Mortimer]]); and another relationship of Liz's with [[List of 30 Rock characters#Floyd DeBarber|Floyd]] ([[Jason Sudeikis]]).

Guest stars include [[John McEnroe]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Paul Reubens]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Wayne Brady]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Rip Torn]], and [[Ghostface Killah]].

The fourth season of ''30 Rock'' premiered on October 15, 2009. Like the previous season, it also consisted of 22 episodes.

The latter half of the season focused on complementary story arcs: Jack's inability to choose between his two girlfriends, Liz's inability to find a boyfriend to live up to her expectations, and Jenna's relationship with a Jenna Maroney impersonator. The season has also featured such guest stars as [[Julianne Moore]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Cheyenne Jackson]], Sherri Shepherd, [[Will Forte]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Michael Sheen]], [[Matt Damon]], and [[James Franco]].

Season seven continues to develop the relationship between Liz and Criss ([[James Marsden]]), as the pair tries for children and considers getting married. Meanwhile, Jack attempts to improve his future prospects at the company, first by trying to "tank" NBC and convince Kabletown CEO Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) to sell it, and later by plotting to discredit Hooper's granddaughter and future CEO, Kaylee Hooper ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]). Ultimately, however, he begins to wonder if he is truly happy. Elsewhere, Tracy has found success with his new movie studio, which produces comedy films mostly starring African American actors, in similar fashion to [[Tyler Perry]]; Jenna prepares to marry her longterm boyfriend Paul (Will Forte), and Kenneth has started a relationship with Hazel ([[Kristen Schaal]]), unaware that she is using him to get her moment on ''TGS''.

===Ratings===
Below, "Rank" refers to how well ''30 Rock'' rated compared to other television series which aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season; for example, in its first year, 101 television series were rated higher. The television season tends to begin in September of any given year and end during May of the following year. "Viewers" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes (broadcast in the series' "Regular Timeslot") of ''30 Rock'' aired during the television season. Although the viewer average may be higher for some seasons than others, the rank will not necessarily be higher. This is due to the number of programs aired during primetime. In some seasons, more regular programs may be aired during primetime than in others.

===Similarities to other media===
Two shows debuting on [[2006–07 United States network television schedule|2006–07 NBC lineup]], ''30 Rock'' and ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', revolved around the off-camera happenings on a ''Saturday Night Live''-analogue sketch comedy series. Similarities between the two led to speculation that only one of them would be picked up. Baldwin said, "I'd be stunned if NBC picked up both shows. And ours has the tougher task, as a comedy, because if it's not funny, that's it."<ref name="newyorker">{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_friend |title=Who's on First Dept: Shows about Shows |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |author=Friend, Tad |date=April 24, 2006|work=The New Yorker| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080911001913/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424ta_talk_friend| archivedate= September 11, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], then president of NBC Entertainment, was supportive of Fey, describing the situation as a "high-class problem":

Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when [[Aaron Sorkin]], the creator of ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'', asked [[Lorne Michaels]] to allow him to observe ''Saturday Night Live'' for a week, a request Michaels denied.<ref name="newyorker" /> Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with ''30 Rock''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/archives/105252.asp |title=Tina Fey's Weekend Update: Aaron Sorkin calls her out! |accessdate=July 31, 2008 |author=McFarland, Melanie |date=July 22, 2006 |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5PqE41I68?url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/archives/105252.asp |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Fey said, "it's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television.

At least five ''30 Rock'' episodes have briefly parodied ''Studio 60'':

* "[[Jack Meets Dennis]]": Liz says the upcoming show will be "worse than that time we did that Gilbert and Sullivan parody". The second episode of ''Studio 60'', "The Cold Open", included a parody of the "[[Major-General's Song]]" on the show-within-the-show.
* "[[The Fabian Strategy]]": In the ending sequence, Kenneth watches the credits for ''TGS'', which include [[Ricky Tahoe|Ricky]] and [[Ron Oswald|Ronnie]] as writers, the two ex-head writers on ''Studio 60''.
* "[[Plan B (30 Rock)|Plan B]]": Aaron Sorkin appears as himself as Liz is attempting to get a new job at NBC's ''[[The Sing-Off]]''. Sorkin explains to Liz that he, too, is having trouble finding work writing for television, despite having written such works as ''[[The West Wing]]'', ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', and ''[[The Social Network]]''. Liz adds ''Studio 60'' to that list, but Sorkin tells her to "shut up". The two of them also engage in Sorkin's signature "Walk and Talk" during their exchange, leading them to where they started the conversation, something which Liz points out.

Some critics have compared ''30 Rock'' to ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', with parallels drawn between the relationship of Liz and Jack and that of [[Mary Richards]] and [[Lou Grant (fictional character)|Lou Grant]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20033306,00.html |title=There's 'Moore' to '30 Rock' Than Meets the Eye |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |date=April 2, 2007 |work=Entertainment Weekly |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5PqGbw4Di?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20033306,00.html |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |url-status=live |first=Kera |last=Bolonik  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nwitimes.com/articles/2007/01/19/entertainment/entertainment/371a8d51218c1834862572660075efb8.txt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5PqQuU6Xk?url=http://nwitimes.com/articles/2007/01/19/entertainment/entertainment/371a8d51218c1834862572660075efb8.txt |archivedate=June 24, 2007 |title=Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin help make '30 Rock' funny |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Moore |first=Frazier |date=January 19, 2007 |publisher=nwitimes.com |url-status=live  }}</ref> It has also been compared to ''[[That Girl]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1595332,00.html |title=Tina Fey |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Poniewozik |first=James |work=Time Magazine |date=May 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226192701/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0%2C28804%2C1595326_1595332%2C00.html |archivedate=December 26, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/10/11/jmer-10-11-06/ |title=30 Rock Brings New Energy to Television Comedy |accessdate=December 23, 2007 |last=Martin |first=Ed |date=October 11, 2006 |publisher=[[Media Village]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111021121/http://www.mediavillage.com/jmentr/2006/10/11/jmer-10-11-06/ |archivedate = November 11, 2007}}</ref> Like ''That Girl'' and ''Mary Tyler Moore'', ''30 Rock'' is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living in a big city where she works in the television industry.

==Aborted potential spin-off and removed episodes==
In 2019, Tina Fey and ''30 Rock'' co-showrunner [[Robert Carlock]] received a straight-to-series order for an untitled comedy series from NBC. The original script was meant to see Baldwin reprise his role of Jack Donaghy, and was to follow his political career as mayor of New York following the series finale. Baldwin was in negotiations for a year to star in the project before dropping out. [[Ted Danson]] replaced Baldwin as the lead character, and the series setting was changed to [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Danson's wish to remain in his home city. Following this, the series was rewritten to lose any connections to ''30 Rock''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/nbcs-ted-danson-tina-fey-comedy-was-originally-a-30-rock-spinoff-1229574|title=NBC's Ted Danson-Tina Fey Comedy Was Originally a '30 Rock' Spinoff|accessdate=August 9, 2019|date=August 8, 2019|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

On June 22, 2020, Tina Fey, the show's creator, and NBC announced that four episodes of the series that depict actors in [[blackface]] would be removed from streaming services and taken off circulation on TV after a request by the show's producers.
Fey stated: "As we strive to do the work and do better in regards to race in America, we believe that these episodes featuring actors in race-changing makeup are best taken out of circulation. I understand now that 'intent' is not a free pass for white people to use these images. I apologize for pain they have caused [...]".  The episodes that were removed are the [[30 Rock (season 3)|third season episode]] "Believe In The Stars" and the [[30 Rock (season 5)|fifth season episode]] "Christmas Attack Zone", both of which featured [[Jane Krakowski]]'s character, Jenna, in blackface; the [[30 Rock (season 6)|sixth season episode]] "Live from Studio 6H", which featured [[Jon Hamm]] in blackface; and the east coast version [[30 Rock (season 5)|fifth season episode]] "Live Show". The lattermost was replaced with the west coast version. The decision to remove the episodes came as [[George Floyd protests|protests]] over the [[killing of George Floyd]], an unarmed black man killed by four Minneapolis Police Department officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/arts/television/30-rock-blackface-Tina-fey|title=Streaming Services Remove '30 Rock' Blackface Episodes|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=June 23, 2020|accessdate=June 23, 2020}}</ref>

{{main|30 Rock: A One-Time Special}}
On June 16, 2020, NBC announced that it would produce a one-off, hour-long reunion special, which premiered on July 16.

The special was produced with the involvement of NBCUniversal Creative Partnerships. The same day, an accompanying online summit for media and advertisers included an early screening of the special, while the special became available on Peacock and aired on other NBCUniversal cable networks on July 17. A number of major NBC affiliate groups declined to air the special, citing concerns over its aim to be a vehicle for promoting NBCUniversal's cable networks and Peacock.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=2020-06-16|title=‘30 Rock’ Returns To NBC For Upfront Special|url=https://deadline.com/2020/06/30-rock-returns-to-nbc-for-upfront-special-1202960679/|access-date=2020-07-14|website=Deadline|language=en|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114234932/https://deadline.com/2020/06/30-rock-returns-to-nbc-for-upfront-special-1202960679/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hayes|first=Dade|date=2020-07-14|title=’30 Rock’ Reunion Special Won’t Air On Majority Of NBC Affiliates As Stations Push Back On Peacock Promo|url=https://deadline.com/2020/07/30-rock-reunion-special-wont-air-on-majority-of-nbc-affiliates-as-stations-push-back-on-peacock-promo-1202985534/|access-date=2020-07-14|website=Deadline|language=en|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114235032/https://deadline.com/2020/07/30-rock-reunion-special-wont-air-on-majority-of-nbc-affiliates-as-stations-push-back-on-peacock-promo-1202985534/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=2020-07-14|title=Blerg, Most NBC Stations Won’t Air the 30 Rock Reunion|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/30-rock-reunion-nbc-peacock-boycott.html|access-date=2020-07-14|website=Vulture|language=en-us|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114234934/https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/30-rock-reunion-nbc-peacock-boycott.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=NBC Affiliates Opt Out of '30 Rock' Upfront Special|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-affiliates-opt-30-rock-upfront-special-1303177|access-date=2020-07-14|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114235031/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbc-affiliates-opt-30-rock-upfront-special-1303177|url-status=live}}</ref>
