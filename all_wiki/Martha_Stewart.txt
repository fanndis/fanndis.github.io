'''Martha Helen Stewart''' ([[Given name#Name at birth|née]] '''Kostyra'''; {{IPA-pl|kɔ'stɨra}}; born August 3, 1941) is an American retail businesswoman, writer, [[television personality]], and former model. As founder of [[Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia]], she gained success through a variety of business ventures, encompassing publishing, broadcasting, merchandising and [[e-commerce]]. She has written numerous bestselling books, is the publisher of ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine and hosted two [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television programs: ''Martha Stewart Living'', which ran from 1993 to 2004, and ''[[Martha (TV series)|Martha]]'', which ran from 2005 to 2012.

In 2004, Stewart was convicted of charges related to the [[ImClone stock trading case]]; she served five months in federal prison and was released in March 2005.

==Career==
In 1967, Martha Stewart began a second career as a stockbroker, her father-in-law's profession.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Newenham|first1=Pamela|title=Martha Stewart: oasis of calm as she rebuilds household goods empire|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/martha-stewart-oasis-of-calm-as-she-rebuilds-household-goods-empire-1.1838406|access-date=January 31, 2018|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=June 20, 2014}}</ref><ref name="TheBestRevenge">{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Michelle|title=The Best Revenge|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-best-revenge-vol-45-no-14/|access-date=January 31, 2018|work=People|date=October 2, 1995}}</ref> Meanwhile, Andrew Stewart founded a publishing house and served as chief executive of several others. Andrew and Martha Stewart moved to [[Westport, Connecticut]], where they purchased and restored the 1805 farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road that would later become the model for the TV studio of ''[[Martha Stewart Living#Television program|Martha Stewart Living]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Salzman|first=Avi|title=Martha Stewart Puts Farmhouse on Market|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/nyregion/02martha.html?_r=0|access-date=March 6, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 2, 2006}}</ref> During the project, Stewart's panache for restoring and decorating became apparent. In 1976, Stewart started a catering business in her basement with a friend from her modeling days, Norma Collier. The venture quickly became successful but soured when Collier alleged that Stewart was difficult to work with, and was also taking catering jobs on the side. Stewart soon bought Collier's portion of the business. Stewart was also hired as the manager of a gourmet food store, the Market Basket, but after a disagreement with the owners at the mini-mall she was forced out and opened her own store.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Martha Stewart|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/businesses/M-Z/Stewart-Martha.html|encyclopedia=Reference for Business: Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd ed|publisher=Advameg, Inc|access-date=October 29, 2010}}</ref>

Mirken was impressed by Stewart's talent as a chef and hostess and later contacted her to develop a [[cookbook]], featuring recipes and photos from the parties that Stewart hosted. The result was her first book, ''Entertaining'' (December 13, 1982),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marthastewart.com/264286/history-of-entertaining |title=History of Entertaining |publisher= Martha Stewart Entertaining |access-date=December 28, 2011|date=2011-08-17 }}</ref> [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by Elizabeth Hawes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://adage.com/article?article_id=84085|title=referenced, ''Entertaining''}}</ref>

Following ''Entertaining''{{'s}} success, Stewart released many more books under the [[Random House|Clarkson Potter]] publishing [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], including ''Martha Stewart's Quick Cook'' (1983), ''Martha Stewart's Hors D'oeuvres'' (1984), ''Martha Stewart's Pies & Tarts'' (1985), ''Weddings'' (1987), ''The Wedding Planner'' (1988), ''Martha Stewart's Secrets for Entertaining'' (1988), ''Martha Stewart's Quick Cook Menus'' (1988), and ''Martha Stewart's Christmas'' (1989), among others. During this time, she also authored dozens of newspaper columns, magazine articles, and other pieces on [[homemaking]], and made numerous television appearances on programs such as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and ''[[Larry King Live]]''. Andrew and Martha Stewart separated in 1987 and divorced in 1990.<ref name=green/><ref name="didion new yorker" />

===Later career===
In 1990, Stewart signed with [[Time Inc.|Time Publishing Ventures]] to develop a new magazine, ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'', for which Stewart would serve as editor-in-chief. The first issue was released in late 1990 with an initial [[magazine circulation|rate base]] of 250,000. Circulation would peak in 2002 at more than 2 million copies per issue.<ref>{{cite news|title=Martha Stewart Living to Increase Frequency to Twelve Issues Per Year and Add Additional Special Issue of Martha Stewart Baby|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/martha-stewart-living-to-increase-frequency-to-twelve-issues-per-year-and-add-additional-special-issue-of-martha-stewart-baby-72893967.html|access-date=March 6, 2014|publisher=PR Newsire|date=May 2, 2000}}</ref> In 1993, she began a weekly half-hour television program, also called ''Martha Stewart Living'', based on her magazine.  The show expanded to weekdays in 1997 and later to a full hour show in 1999 with half-hour episodes on weekends, and ran until 2004.  Stewart also became a frequent contributor to [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' and later to [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Early Show]]'', and starred in several prime time [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] specials on the CBS network.<ref>{{cite web |title=Case Study - Martha Stewart |url=http://www.entrepreneuressacademy.com/blog/case-study-martha-stewart/ |publisher=Entrepreneuress Academy}}</ref>

On the cover of the May 1995 issue, ''[[New York Magazine]]'' declared her "the definitive American woman of our time."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lippert|first1=Barbara|title=Our Martha, Ourselves|url=http://nymag.com/news/media/48253/|access-date=December 24, 2015|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=May 15, 1995}}</ref>

===Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia===
In September 1997, with the assistance of business partner Sharon Patrick, Stewart was able to secure funding to purchase the various television, print, and merchandising ventures related to the Martha Stewart brand, and consolidate them into a new company, named [[Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia]] (MSLO). Stewart served as chairwoman, president, and CEO of the new company and Patrick became [[Chief Operations Officer]]. By organizing all of the brand's assets under one roof, Stewart thought she could promote synergy and have greater control of the brand's direction through the business's activities. That same month, Stewart announced in ''Martha Stewart Living'' the launch of a companion website and a [[Mail-order catalog|catalogue]] business, called [[Martha by Mail]]. The company also had a direct-to-consumer floral business.

On October 19, 1999, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia went public on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker symbol MSO. The initial public offering was set at $18 per share, and rallied to $38 by the end of trading, making Stewart a billionaire on paper and the first female self-made billionaire in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sellers|first=Patricia|title=Martha Stewart's comeback trail|url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/10/31/news/newsmakers/stewart_fortune_111405/|access-date=March 6, 2014|publisher=CNNMoney|date=November 2, 2005}}</ref> The stock price slowly went down to $16 per share by February 2002. Stewart was then and continues to be the majority shareholder, commanding 96% control of voting power in the company.<!-- possible ref http://money.cnn.com/1999/10/19/companies/ipos/ -->

==Stock trading case and conviction==
{{Main|ImClone stock trading case}}
According to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), Stewart avoided a loss of $45,673 by selling all 3,928 shares of her [[ImClone Systems]] stock on December 27, 2001, after receiving [[Materiality (law)|material]], [[Insider trading|nonpublic information]] from [[Peter Bacanovic]], who was Stewart's broker at [[Merrill Lynch]]. The day following her sale, the stock value fell 16%.<ref name="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">{{cite press release |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |author=Wayne M.

In the months that followed, Stewart drew heavy media scrutiny, including a ''Newsweek'' cover headlined "Martha's Mess".<ref>{{cite news|title=Newsweek Cover: Martha's Mess|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newsweek-cover-marthas-mess-77960517.html|access-date=March 5, 2014|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]|date=June 23, 2002}}</ref> Notably, on June 25, 2002, CBS anchor [[Jane Clayson]] grilled Stewart on the air about ImClone during her regular segment on ''The Early Show''.

On June 4, 2003, Stewart was indicted by the government on nine counts, including charges of [[securities fraud]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. Stewart voluntarily stepped down as CEO and Chairwoman of MSLO, but stayed on as chief creative officer. She went on trial in January 2004. Prosecutors showed that Bacanovic had ordered his assistant to tell Stewart that the CEO of ImClone, [[Samuel D.

===Sentence===
After a highly publicized six-week jury trial, Stewart was found guilty in March 2004 of [[felony]] charges of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and [[making false statements]] to federal investigators, and was sentenced in July 2004 to serve a five-month term in a federal correctional facility and a two-year period of [[supervised release]] (to include five months of [[electronic monitoring]]).<ref name="CNN All Charges"/>

Stewart wanted to go to prison in Connecticut or Florida.

Following her release from prison in March 2005, Stewart launched a highly publicized comeback and was once again involved in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]''. Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at [[Kmart]] were expanded to include a new line of ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior paint line became available at the larger [[Sears]] stores. However, the most heavily promoted aspect of her comeback was in television. Stewart returned to daytime television with ''[[Martha (TV series)|The Martha Stewart Show]]'' and appeared in an adapted version of ''[[The Apprentice (TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' (called ''[[The Apprentice: Martha Stewart]]''). Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by [[Mark Burnett]]. Her prime time ''Apprentice'' spin-off received poor ratings.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/12/19/martha-stewart-too-bad-do_n_77543.html | title=Martha Stewart: "Too Bad" Donald Trump Wasn't Slaughtered for His Meat| newspaper=Huffington Post| date=2008-03-28| last1=Shea| first1=Danny}}</ref> ''The Apprentice: Martha Stewart'' was not renewed for a second season.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Citrano|first1=Virginia|title=NBC Declines to Renew Martha's 'Apprentice'|url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/11/14/martha-stewart-apprentice-cx_vc_1114autofacescan10.html|access-date=December 24, 2015|work=[[Forbes]]|date=November 14, 2005}}</ref>

In October 2005, Stewart released a new book, titled ''The Martha Rules'', on starting and managing a new business,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wyatt|first1=Edward|title=Martha Stewart's New Book Is Strictly Business|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E4D61330F936A25754C0A9639C8B63|access-date=December 24, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=July 15, 2005}}</ref> and a month later, her company released ''Martha Stewart Baking Handbook''.<ref>{{cite news|title="Martha's Baking Favorites," the Newest Title from the Martha Stewart Home Entertainment Library, to Debut on DVD December 20, from Warner Home Video|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20051129005840/en/Marthas-Baking-Favorites-Newest-Title-Martha-Stewart|access-date=December 24, 2015|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=November 29, 2005}}</ref> In October 2006, ''Martha Stewart's Homekeeping Handbook'', a reference book about looking after a house, was published by [[Clarkson Potter]]. She also is a regular contributor of cooking, crafts, and gardening segments on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show. Stewart's daily talk show was nominated in six categories for the [[33rd Daytime Emmy Awards]] in 2006, including Best Host and Best Show.

MSLO launched a line of houses that carry her name to be built by [[KB Home]], initially in [[Cary, North Carolina]], and ultimately in various other locations nationwide. The first homes, which were inspired by Stewart's homes in New York and [[Mount Desert Island]] in [[Maine]], were completed in early 2006. Ultimately, 650 homes are planned, with prices from the low $200,000s to mid-$400,000s. A line of paper-based crafts for EK Success is also in development. In September 2007, she launched an upscale line of housewares for [[Macy's]], which was the largest brand launch in Macy's history. Appearing in commercials for the line, Stewart stated she has designed more than 2,000 items exclusively for Macy's. The line includes bedding, bath, cookware, and dinnerware. In addition to television and merchandising, MSLO launched a 24-hour [[satellite radio]] channel with [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] in November 2005, on which Stewart currently hosts a weekly call-in show.

Stewart also made a special appearance on the comedy-drama series ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', in the November 16, 2006, episode "[[Four Thanksgivings and a Funeral]]," in which she gave her friend [[Wilhelmina Slater]] (played by [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]]) tips on how to prepare a turkey.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Rick|title=Sweeps guest star watch: Martha Stewart on 'Ugly Betty'|url=http://zap2it.com/2006/11/sweeps-guest-star-watch-martha-stewart-on-ugly-betty/|access-date=December 24, 2015|publisher=[[Zap2It]]|date=Nov 16, 2006|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Justin Suarez]] (played by [[Mark Indelicato]]) is a fan of Stewart.

The Martha Stewart Floor Designs by FLOR<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flor.com/service/flor/shop/collections/Martha-Stewart.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106014959/http://www.flor.com/service/flor/shop/collections/Martha-Stewart.html|url-status=dead|title=Flor.com|archive-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref> line debuted in 2007 with the distinctive design and color palette associated with the Martha Stewart brand. The agreement with FLOR was part of the Martha Stewart organization's growing home furnishings program, which includes a wide range of products such as furniture with Bernhardt, wall color with Lowe's, and floor coverings with FLOR.

On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it had signed a partnership with [[E & J Gallo Winery]] to produce a wine brand with label Martha Stewart Vintage (for sale in six cities, in January 2008, at $15). The 15,000 cases to be sold included 2006 [[Sonoma County]] [[Chardonnay]], 2005 Sonoma County [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], and 2006 Sonoma County [[Merlot]] (for [[Atlanta]], Boston, [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], [[Denver]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and [[Portland, Oregon]]).

In July 2008, craft items under the names "Martha Stewart Celebrate" and "Martha Stewart Create," two divisions of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, premiered in [[Walmart]] stores. The deal came about, in part, due to the closing of more than 600 [[Kmart]] stores in the U.S.

In a move from broadcast television to cable, on January 26, 2010, [[Hallmark Channel]] and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year strategic partnership. Her hour-long daytime television series ''[[Martha (TV series)|Martha]]'', formerly ''The Martha Stewart Show'', moved to the [[Hallmark Channel]] on September 13, 2010.
