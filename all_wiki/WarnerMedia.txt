'''Warner Media, LLC''' (stylized as '''WarnerMedia''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] mass media and [[show business|entertainment]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] corporation owned by [[AT&T]] and headquartered in [[New York City]], [[United States]]. It was originally formed in 1990 by [[Steve Ross (businessman)|Steve Ross]] and formerly known as '''Time Warner''' from 1990 to 2001 and 2003 to 2018, from the merger of [[Time Inc.]] and the original Warner Communications. The company has film, television and [[cable television|cable]] operations, with its assets including WarnerMedia Studios & Networks (consisting of the entertainment and family-friendly assets of [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]], [[HBO]], and [[Cinemax]] as well as [[Warner Bros.]], which itself consists of the film, animation, and television studios [[DC Comics]], [[New Line Cinema]], and, together with [[ViacomCBS]], a 50% interest in [[The CW]] television network); WarnerMedia News & Sports (consisting of the news and sports assets of Turner Broadcasting, as well as [[AT&T SportsNet]]); WarnerMedia Commercial (consisting of digital analytics company [[Xandr]], [[Otter Media]], and [[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment|the company's home entertainment division]]); and WarnerMedia Direct (consisting of the [[HBO Max]] streaming service).

== Background ==
[[File:Warner Communications.svg|thumb|left|Warner Communications logo, used from 1972 to 1990.]]
On February 10, 1972, the entertainment assets of the [[Kinney National Company]] reincorporated as '''Warner Communications''' due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations. Warner Communications served as the parent company for [[Warner Bros.]], the [[Warner Music Group]] (WMG), [[Warner Cable]], and [[Dimension Pictures (1970s company)|Dimension Pictures]] during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned [[DC Comics]] and [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]].

During its time as Warner Communications, the company made a number of further acquisitions. In 1979, Warner formed a joint venture with credit card company [[American Express]], [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]], which owned such cable channels as [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[The Movie Channel]], and [[VH1]] (which was launched in 1985 on the channel space left by [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]]'s [[Cable Music Channel]]). Warner bought out American Express's half in 1984 and sold the venture a year later to the [[Viacom (1952–2006)|original iteration of Viacom]], which renamed it [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] (now known as ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks). In 1982, Warner purchased [[Popular Library]] from [[CBS Publications]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Copyrights of Golden-Age Comics | url=http://www.herogoggles.com/copyright1.html|encyclopedia=Golden-Age Comic book Superheroes & Villains Encyclopedia | accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref>

By the mid to late 1980s, Warner began to face financial difficulties. From 1976 to 1984, Warner Communications owned [[Atari, Inc.]], but suffered substantial losses due to the [[video game crash of 1983]]. Taking advantage of Warner Communications's financial situation, the neighboring company of [[Time Inc.]] announced on March 4, 1989, that the two companies were to merge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/us/time-inc-and-warner-to-merge-creating-largest-media-company.html|title=Time Inc. and Warner to Merge, Creating Largest Media Company|last=Norris|first=Floyd|date=1989-03-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

During the summer of 1989, Paramount Communications (then [[Gulf+Western]]) launched a $12.2 billion [[hostile bid]] to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. Time raised its bid to $14.9 billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the two companies to merge, which was completed on January 10, 1990.

==History==
===Time Warner and Time Warner Entertainment (1990–2001) (first incarnation)===
[[US West]] partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as [[TW Telecom]], initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment. US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company [[MediaOne]], then to [[AT&T Broadband]] in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to [[Comcast]] in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable.

On October 10, 1996, Time Warner merged with Turner Broadcasting System, which was established by [[Ted Turner]]. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950<ref> ''You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story'' (2008), p. 255.</ref><ref>WB retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948; in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.</ref> film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/11/business/holders-back-time-warner-turner-merger.html|title=Holders Back Time Warner-Turner Merger|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|date=1996-10-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> while Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned properties. The Turner deal also brought two separate film companies, [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], into the Time Warner fold.

Time Warner completed its purchase of [[Six Flags|Six Flags Theme Parks]] in 1993 after buying half of the company in 1991, saving it from financial trouble. The company was later sold to Oklahoma-based theme park operator [[Six Flags#History of Premier Parks|Premier Parks]] under certain terms and conditions on April 1, 1998.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-09-21-fi-37629-story.html |title=Time Warner Completes Six Flags Purchase : Amusement: Company will use more of its cartoon characters at theme parks, including site near Valencia. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 21, 1993 |last1=Bryant |first1=Rebecca}}</ref>

Dick Parsons, already a director on the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although the division operational heads continued to report directly to chairman and CEO [[Gerald M. Levin|Gerald Levin]].<ref>[https://business.time.com/2007/05/04/time_warner_coo_for_media_corp/ Time Warner COO: For Media, Corporate Diversity Is About Business], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>

In 1991, HBO and [[Cinemax]] became the first premium pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels supplementing the main networks.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2011/08/20/the-winning-streak |title=The winning streak |work=The Economist}}</ref> In 1993, HBO became the world's first digitally transmitted television service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://prmarketingcommunication.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/brand-history-hbo/ |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130618035819/http://prmarketingcommunication.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/brand-history-hbo/ |url-status=dead |title=WordPress.com |date=June 18, 2013 |archivedate=June 18, 2013 |website=Wordpress.com |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref> In 1995, CNN introduced CNN.com which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both online and mobile.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://img.ctrlq.org/files/translation.html |title=CNN News Website – Wikipedia |work=labnol.org}}</ref> In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction of the DVD, which gradually replaced VHS tapes as the standard format for home video in the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spannerworks.net/reference/10_8a.asp |title=DVD Basics and History |website=Spannerworks.net}}</ref> In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a high–definition version of its channel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.multichannel.com/technology/hbo-cto-zitter-step-down/140623 |title=HBO CTO Zitter to Step Down |website=Multichannel.com}}</ref>

In January 2000, [[AOL]] stated its intentions to purchase Time Warner for $164 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://imaa-institute.org/mergers-and-acquisitions-statistics/#TopMergersAcquisitions_Worldwide |title=Statistics on Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) – M&A Courses &#124; Company Valuation Courses &#124; Mergers & Acquisitions Courses |website=Imaa-institute.org |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106045040/http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html |archivedate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> Due to the larger market capitalization of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while [[Time Warner]] shareholders owned only 45%,<ref name="aoltw-merger-pressrelease">{{cite web |url=https://www.warnermediagroup.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,667602,00.html |title=America Online and Time Warner Will Merge to Create World's First Internet-Age Media and Communications Company |work=Time Warner corporate homepage |date=January 10, 2000 |accessdate=May 6, 2007}}</ref> so in actual practice AOL had merged with Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues.

'''AOL Time Warner Inc.''', as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. [[Gerald Levin]], who had served as chairman and CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. AOL co-founder [[Steve Case]] served as [[Executive Chairman]] of the board of directors, [[Robert W. Pittman]] (president and COO of AOL) and [[Richard Parsons (businessman)|Dick Parsons]] (president of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the chief financial officer.<ref name="ninamunk.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.ninamunk.com/documents/PowerFailure.htm |title=Power Failure |publisher=Nina Munk |accessdate=June 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714183334/http://www.ninamunk.com/documents/PowerFailure.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2011}}</ref>

According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet company." The vision for Time Warner's future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have created 130 million subscription relationships.

However, the growth and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and loss of market share to the growth of high-speed broadband providers. The value of the America Online division dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] [[write-off]], causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060727/wr_nm/media_timewarner_aol_dc_7 |title=AOL expected to scrap charges |first=Kenneth |last=Li |newspaper=Yahoo!

An outburst by Vice-Chairman [[Ted Turner]] at a board meeting prompted Steve Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" at the combined company and handed in his resignation in the fall of 2001, effective in May 2002.<ref name="ajbianco.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.ajbianco.com/can_dick_parsons_rescue_time_warner.php |title=Anthony Bianco – Cover Stories |website=Ajbianco.com |date=May 19, 2003 |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518142337/http://www.ajbianco.com/can_dick_parsons_rescue_time_warner.php |archive-date=May 18, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted to COO of the AOL division and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion.

Many of the expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under [[Don Logan]].<ref name="kara.allthingsd">{{cite web |url=http://kara.allthingsd.com/20080806/the-125-million-sweet-dailycandy-revenge-of-bob-pitchman/# |title=The $125 Million-Sweet DailyCandy Revenge of Bob "Pitchman" – Kara Swisher – News – AllThingsD |website=Kara.allthingsd.com |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted Pittman's synergy initiatives.<ref name="ninamunk.com" /><ref name="observer.com">{{cite web |last=Hagan |first=Joe |url=http://www.observer.com/node/46271 |title=Pittman's Last Stand &#124; The New York Observer |website=Observer.com |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref>

Pittman resigned as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.<ref name="observer.com" /> Pittman's departure was seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time Warner Book Group, and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, Cinemax, New Line Cinema, The WB, TNT, Turner Networks, Warner Bros., and Warner Music Group. Both Logan and Bewkes, who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.<ref name="kara.allthingsd" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/pittman-to-leave-aol-time-warner/ |title=Pittman to leave AOL Time Warner – CNET News |website=CNET |publisher=CBS Interactive |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> Logan, generally admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk-taker, moved to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".<ref name="ajbianco.com" />

[[File:Time Warner wordmark.svg|thumb|right|Logo for Time Warner (2003–2018)]]
AOL Time Warner Chairman Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice-president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case stated in January 2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect.

On October 20, 2016, it was reported that [[AT&T]] was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry.

In the wake of the presidency of U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Time Warner's ownership of CNN was considered a potential source of scrutiny for the deal, as Trump has repeatedly criticized the network for how it has covered his [[Trump administration|administration]], and stated during his campaign that he planned to block the acquisition because of the potential impact of the resulting consolidation.

On November 8, 2017, reports of a meeting between AT&T CEO [[Randall L. Stephenson]] and [[Makan Delrahim]], assistant Attorney General of the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Department of Justice's Antitrust Division]], indicated that AT&T had been recommended to divest DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting, seek alternative antitrust remedies, or abandon the acquisition. Some news outlets reported that AT&T had been ordered to specifically divest CNN, but these claims were denied by both Stephenson and a government official the following day, with the latter criticizing the reports as being an effort to politicize the deal. Stephenson also disputed the relevance of CNN to the antitrust concerns surrounding the acquisition, as AT&T does not already own a national news channel.<ref>{{cite web |title=Government never tried to force CNN sale in AT&T-Time Warner deal, official says |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/09/government-never-tried-to-force-cnn-sale-in-att-time-warner-deal-official-says.html |work=CNBC |accessdate=November 10, 2017 |date=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/randall-stephenson-att-cnn-time-warner-1202611055/ |title=AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson: We're Not Selling CNN and We'll Fight for Time Warner in Court |last=Johnson |first=Ted |date=November 9, 2017 |work=Variety |accessdate=November 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://beta.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-att-time-warner-20171108-story.html |title=AT&T says it will not sell CNN despite pressure from Trump's Justice Department |last=James |first=Meg |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/att-time-warner-merger-cnn-trump-1202610228/ |title=AT&T Can't Easily Cut a Connection With CNN or Turner (Analysis) |last=Steinberg |first=Brian |work=Variety |date=November 8, 2017 |accessdate=November 8, 2017}}</ref>

On November 20, 2017, the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit over the acquisition; Delrahim stated that the deal would "greatly harm American consumers". AT&T asserts that this suit is a "radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-20/at-t-is-said-to-face-u-s-antitrust-lawsuit-over-time-warner |title=AT&T Sued by U.S. Seeking to Block Merger With Time Warner |last=Foden |first=Sara |last2=McLaughlin |first2=David |last3=Moritz |first3=Scott |work=Bloomberg |date=November 20, 2017 |accessdate=November 20, 2017}}</ref> On December 22, 2017, the merger agreement deadline was extended to June 21, 2018, under a big vote of confidence.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/att-time-warner-extend-merger-agreement-june-21-trial-1202647896/ |title=AT&T, Time Warner Extend Merger Agreement Deadline as Trial Looms |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |work=Variety |date=December 22, 2017 |accessdate=December 22, 2017}}</ref>

On June 12, 2018, [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|District]] Judge [[Richard J. Leon]] ruled in favor of AT&T, thus allowing the acquisition to go ahead with no conditions or remedies. Leon argued that the Department of Justice provided insufficient evidence that the proposed transaction would result in lessened competition. He also warned the government that attempting to obtain an appeal or stay on the ruling would be manifest unjust, as it would cause "certain irreparable harm to the defendants".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-time-warner-judge-fires-starting-gun-in-the-battle-against-tech-1528842076 |title=AT&T-Time Warner Judge Fires Starting Gun in the Battle Against Tech |last=Winkler |first=Elizabeth |date=June 12, 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |access-date=June 12, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0099-9660}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/06/12/att-time-warner-decision/?noredirect=on |title=AT&T-Time Warner merger approved, setting the stage for more consolidation across corporate America |date=June 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-trial-antitrust-ruling.html|title=Why the AT&T-Time Warner Case Was So Closely Watched|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=2018-06-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/att-time-warner-merger-approved-1202840369/ |title=AT&T-Time Warner Merger Approved |last=Johnson |first=Ted |date=June 12, 2018 |work=Variety |access-date=June 12, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

====Rebranding Time Warner as WarnerMedia====
On June 14, 2018, AT&T announced that it had closed the acquisition deal on Time Warner. Jeff Bewkes stepped down as CEO of Time Warner while retaining ties with the company as senior advisor of AT&T. [[John Stankey]], who headed the AT&T/Time Warner integration team, took over as CEO. It was also announced that the Time Warner brand would be dropped and its name changed to WarnerMedia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/15/time-warner-is-changing-its-name-to-warnermedia-turner-ceo-to-depart.html |title=Time Warner is changing its name to WarnerMedia; Turner CEO to depart |date=June 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/15/media/warnermedia-john-stankey-announcements/index.html |title=Time Warner's new name: WarnerMedia |date=June 15, 2018}}</ref>

On July 12, 2018, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] filed a notice of appeal with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]] to reverse the District Court's approval. Although the Department of Justice reportedly contemplated requesting an injunction to stop the deal from closing after the District Court's ruling, the department ultimately did not file the motion because WarnerMedia's operation as a separate group from the rest of AT&T would make the business relatively easy to unwind should the appeal be successful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/business/justice-department-plans-appeal-of-att-time-warner-merger-approval.html|title=AT&T-Time Warner Deal Approval Gets Justice Department Challenge|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=2018-07-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-18|last2=Lee|first2=Edmund|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The next day, however, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told CNBC that the appeal would not affect its plans to integrate WarnerMedia into AT&T, or services already launched.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/doj-challenge-to-att-time-warner-deal-could-affect-disney-fox-comcast.html |title=DOJ challenge to AT&T-Time Warner deal could affect Disney and Comcast's bidding war for Fox, says AT&T's Stephenson |last=Shapiro |first=Ariel |date=July 13, 2018 |work=CNBC |access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref> In a brief filed by the Justice Department, it was argued that the decision to approve the acquisition ran "contrary to fundamental economic logic and the evidence."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/6/17658532/justice-department-att-time-warner-merger-appeal |title=Justice Department appeal says AT&T-Time Warner merger decision is 'contrary to fundamental economic logic' |work=The Verge |access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/08/06/doj-calls-judges-approval-att-time-warner-merger-deeply-flawed/ |title=Justice Dept. calls judge's approval of AT&T-Time Warner merger 'deeply flawed' |newspaper=Washington Post |language=en |access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref>
