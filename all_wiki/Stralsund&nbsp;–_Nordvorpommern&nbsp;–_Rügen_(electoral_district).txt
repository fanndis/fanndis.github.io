[[File:BWahlkreis 15.svg|thumb|250px|Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]
'''Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen''' was an electoral constituency ([[German language|German]]: ''Wahlkreis'') represented in the [[Bundestag|German Bundestag]] from 1990 to 2013. Part of the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], the constituency elected one representative under the [[mixed member proportional representation]] (MMP) system. Under the current constituency numbering system, it was designated as constituency 15. The constituency was abolished as part of the 2012 federal boundary review, which saw the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern lose one of its 18 geographic constituencies as a result of population change.<ref>[http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_13/wahlkreiseinteilung/ Details of the 2012 boundary review (German)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921115326/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_13/wahlkreiseinteilung/ |date=2013-09-21 }}</ref> It was largely replaced with the [[Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I]] constituency, which took its district number of 15.

==Members of the Bundestag==
The constituency has been held since its creation in 1990 by the CDU's [[Angela Merkel]], Federal Chancellor since 2005. In the 2009 federal election, Merkel won the seat by 23 percentage points over her nearest opponent.
