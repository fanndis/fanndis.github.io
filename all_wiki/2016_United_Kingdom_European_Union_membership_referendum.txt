The '''United Kingdom European Union membership referendum''', commonly referred to as the '''EU referendum''' or the '''Brexit referendum''', took place on 23 June 2016 in the United Kingdom (UK) and [[Gibraltar]] to ask the electorate whether the country should remain a member of, or leave, the [[European Union]] (EU). The result would then be facilitated through the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]] and also the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]]. The referendum resulted in 51.9% of the votes cast being in favour of leaving the EU. Although the referendum was legally non-binding, the government of the time promised to implement the result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-cameron-idUKKCN0Y81VK|title=Cameron says no second EU referendum if result is close|date=17 May 2016|publisher=Reuters}}</ref> [[First May ministry|The succeeding government]], led by [[Theresa May]], initiated the official withdrawal process on 29 March 2017, meaning that the UK was due to [[Brexit#Date of Brexit|leave the EU]] on 29 March 2019 (when the two-year period for [[Brexit negotiations]] was due to expire).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887 |title=Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU |date=31 January 2019 |work=BBC News |quote=As things stand, the UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, regardless of whether there is a deal with the EU or not}}</ref> This negotiation period was later extended until 31 October 2019.

Membership of the EU had long been a topic of debate in the United Kingdom. The country joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) or Common Market, the forerunner to the European Union, in 1973, along with the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC or Euratom). [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|A referendum on continued membership of the Common Market]] was held in 1975, with 67.2% of the population voting in favour of Britain remaining a member.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.open.edu/openlearn/people-politics-law/politics-policy-people/politics/true-stories-the-1975-eec-referendum|title=True stories of the 1975 EEC Referendum|website=OpenLearn|access-date=24 December 2019}}</ref>

In May 2015, following a Conservative Party manifesto pledge, the legal basis for the EU referendum was established through the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]]. [[Britain Stronger in Europe]] became the official group campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU, and was endorsed by the Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[George Osborne]]. [[Vote Leave]] was the official group campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, and was fronted by Conservative [[Member of parliament|MPs]] [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Michael Gove]], along with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Gisela Stuart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/gisela_stuart_to_chair_vote_leave_campaign|title=Gisela Stuart to Chair Vote Leave campaign – Vote Leave|date=27 July 2016|access-date=23 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727232557/http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/gisela_stuart_to_chair_vote_leave_campaign|archive-date=27 July 2016}}</ref> Other campaign groups, political parties, businesses, trade unions, newspapers and prominent individuals were also involved, with both sides having supporters from across the [[political spectrum]].

Immediately after the result, financial markets reacted negatively worldwide, and Cameron announced that he would resign as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]], having campaigned unsuccessfully to remain in the European Union. It was the first time that a national referendum result had gone against the preferred option of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]].

The [[European Communities]] were formed in the 1950s{{snd}} the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) in 1952, and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC or Euratom) and [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1957.<ref name="history" /> The EEC, the more ambitious of the three, came to be known as the "Common Market".

===Growing pressure for a referendum===
Prior to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the then [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] and Leader of the Opposition [[David Cameron]] promised a referendum on the [[Lisbon Treaty]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cameron |first1=David |title=David Cameron: We need to be clear about the best way of getting what is best for Britain |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9367479/David-Cameron-We-need-to-be-clear-about-the-best-way-of-getting-what-is-best-for-Britain.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=23 January 2020 |date=30 June 2012|url-access=subscription}}</ref> which he backtracked on after all EU countries had ratified the treaty before the election.

[[File:David Cameron official.jpg|thumb|upright|During the 2015 general election campaign, David Cameron promised to renegotiate the terms of the UK's EU membership and later hold a referendum on the subject if a Conservative majority government was elected.]]

When they attended the May [[2012 Chicago summit|2012 NATO summit meeting]], UK Prime Minister David Cameron, [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] and [[Edward Llewellyn, Baron Llewellyn of Steep|Ed Llewellyn]] discussed the idea of using a European Union referendum as a concession to energise the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of the Conservative Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-brexit-ohare-pizza-20160624-story.html |title=Fateful O'Hare Airport pizza meeting sealed Brexit vote deal: British media |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |first=Chicago |last=Tribune}}</ref> In January 2013, Cameron delivered the [[Bloomberg speech]] and promised that, should the Conservatives win a parliamentary majority at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] would negotiate more favourable arrangements for continuing British membership of the EU, before holding a referendum on whether the UK should remain in or leave the EU.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Cameron Pledges EU Referendum if Conservatives Win Next Election |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0123/364037-david-cameron-eu/ |access-date=19 February 2013 |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |date=24 January 2013}}</ref> The Conservative Party published a draft EU Referendum Bill in May 2013, and outlined its plans for renegotiation followed by an in-out vote (i.e. a referendum giving options only of leaving and of remaining in under the current terms, or under new terms if these had become available), were the party to be re-elected in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22530655 |title=David Cameron: EU referendum bill shows only Tories listen |work=BBC News |access-date=14 July 2013 |date=14 May 2013}}</ref> The draft Bill stated that the referendum had to be held no later than 31 December 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=European Union (Referendum) Bill (HC Bill 11)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2013-2014/0011/cbill_2013-20140011_en_2.htm |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|date=20 June 2013 }}</ref>

The draft legislation was taken forward as a [[Private Member's Bill]] by Conservative MP [[James Wharton (politician)|James Wharton]] which was known as the [[European Union (Referendum) Bill 2013]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/bills/private-members |title=Private Members' Bills |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref> The bill's First Reading in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] took place on 19 June 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2013/may/private-members-bill-ballot-16-may-2013 |title=Presentation of Bills |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref> Cameron was said by a spokesperson to be "very pleased" and would ensure the Bill was given "the full support of the Conservative Party".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22542207 |title=EU referendum: Tory MP will take forward bill |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2013 |access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref>

Regarding the ability of the bill to bind the UK Government in the [[56th Parliament of the United Kingdom|2015–20 Parliament]] (which indirectly, as a result of the referendum itself, proved to last only two years) to holding such a referendum, a parliamentary research paper noted that:<blockquote>The Bill simply provides for a referendum on continued EU membership by the end of December 2017 and does not otherwise specify the timing, other than requiring the Secretary of State to bring forward orders by the end of 2016. [...] If no party obtained a majority at the [next general election due in 2015], there might be some uncertainty about the passage of the orders in the next Parliament.<ref>European Union (Referendum) Bill, Bill 11 of 2013–14 Research Paper 13/41 (page 1), 28 June 2013; accessdate 5 July 2014.</ref></blockquote>

The bill received its Second Reading on 5 July 2013, passing by 304 votes to none after almost all [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs and all [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MPs abstained, cleared the Commons in November 2013, and was then introduced to the [[House of Lords]] in December 2013, where members voted to block the bill.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rigby |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Pickard |first2=Jim |title=EU referendum bill blocked in Lords |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fbad2f36-8a95-11e3-9c29-00144feab7de.html |access-date=5 July 2014 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=31 January 2014}}</ref>

The Act was, in turn, confirmed, enacted and implemented in Gibraltar by the [[European Union (Referendum) Act 2016 (Gibraltar)]],<ref>Act No. 2016-01 (Legislation Number (L.N.) 2016/034, as amended by L.N. 2016/035, L.N. 2016/082 and L.N. 2016/120.</ref> which was passed by the [[Gibraltar Parliament]] and entered into law upon receiving the assent of the [[Governor of Gibraltar]] on 28 January 2016.

The European Union Referendum Act required a referendum to be held on the question of the UK's continued membership of the European Union (EU) before the end of 2017. It did not contain any requirement for the UK Government to implement the results of the referendum. Instead, it was designed to gauge the electorate's opinion on EU membership. The referendums held in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in 1997 and 1998 are examples of this type, where opinion was tested before legislation was introduced. [[Referendums in the United Kingdom#Status of referendums|The UK does not have constitutional provisions which would require the results of a referendum to be implemented]], unlike, for example, the [[Republic of Ireland]], where the circumstances in which a binding referendum should be held are set out in [[Constitution of Ireland|its constitution]]. In contrast, the legislation that provided for the referendum held on AV in May 2011 would have implemented the new system of voting without further legislation, provided that the boundary changes also provided for in the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]] were also implemented. In the event, there was a substantial majority against any change. The 1975 referendum was held after the re-negotiated terms of the UK's EC membership had been agreed by all EC Member States, and the terms set out in a command paper and agreed by both Houses.<ref>House of Commons Library BRIEFING PAPER Number 07212, 3 June 2015.

==Administration==
===Date===
Prior to being officially announced, it was widely speculated that a June date for the referendum was a serious possibility. The First Ministers of Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales co-signed a letter to Cameron asking him not to hold the referendum in June, as devolved elections were scheduled to take place the previous month. These elections had been postponed for a year to avoid a clash with the 2015 general election, after Westminster had implemented the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|Fixed-term Parliament Act]]. Cameron refused this request, saying people were able to make up their own minds in multiple elections spaced a short time from each other.<ref>{{cite news|title=David Cameron just gave a massive hint about when the EU referendum will happen|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-first-ministers-of-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland-write-to-david-cameron-opposing-a6850816.html|work=The Independent|access-date=17 May 2016}}</ref>

In February 2016, Cameron announced that the UK Government would formally recommend to the British people that the UK should remain a member of a reformed European Union and that the referendum would be held on 23 June, marking the official launch of the campaign. He also announced that Parliament would enact secondary legislation on 22 February relating to the European Union Referendum Act 2015. With the official launch, ministers of the UK Government were then free to campaign on either side of the argument in a rare exception to [[Cabinet collective responsibility]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35621079|title=EU referendum: Cameron sets June date for UK vote|date=20 February 2016|access-date=17 May 2016|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Eligibility to vote===
The right to vote in the referendum in the United Kingdom is defined by the legislation as limited to residents of the United Kingdom who were either also [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth citizens]] under the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] (which include [[British Nationality Act 1981|British citizens]] [[British nationality|and other British nationals]]), or those who were also [[Irish nationality law|citizens of the Republic of Ireland]], or both. Members of the [[House of Lords]], who could not vote in general elections, were able to vote in the referendum. The electorate of 46,500,001 represented 70.8% of the population of 65,678,000 ([[Demography of the United Kingdom#Vital statistics (1938–2017)|UK]] and [[Demographics of Gibraltar#Population overview|Gibraltar]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Who can vote in the EU referendum? |url=https://fullfact.org/europe/who-can-vote-eu-referendum/ |publisher=fullfact.org |date=7 June 2016 |access-date=24 December 2017}}</ref> Other than the residents of Gibraltar, British Overseas Territories Citizens residing in the British Overseas Territories were unable to vote in the referendum.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/editorials/article/20160616/brexit-and-threats-it-poses-to-bermuda [[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]: ''Brexit and the threats it poses to Bermuda''] 16 June 2016</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.penguin-news.com/index.php/headlines/all-headlines/15-politics/41-brexit-and-the-falkland-islands|title=Brexit and the Falkland Islands - Penguin News|website=www.penguin-news.com}}</ref>

Residents of the United Kingdom who were citizens of other EU countries were not allowed to vote unless they were citizens (or were also citizens) of the Republic of Ireland, of [[Malta]], or of the Republic of [[Cyprus]].<ref>{{cite news |title=EU citizens not eligible for referendum vote, says No 10 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32872211 |access-date=24 December 2017 |work=BBC News |date=25 May 2015}}</ref>

Voting on the day of the referendum was from 0700 to 2200 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[Western European Summer Time|WEST]]) (0700 to 2200 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]] in Gibraltar) in some 41,000 polling stations manned by over 100,000 staff. Each polling station was specified to have no more than 2,500 registered voters.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Under the provisions of the [[Representation of the People Act 2000]], postal ballots were also permitted in the referendum and were sent out to eligible voters some three weeks ahead of the vote (2 June 2016).

The minimum age for voters in the referendum was set to 18 years, in line with the Representation of the People Act, as amended. A House of Lords amendment proposing to lower the minimum age to 16 years was rejected.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sims|first1=Alexandra|last2=Stone|first2=Jon |title=MPs block plan to let 16 and 17-year olds vote in the EU referendum |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/house-of-commons-votes-against-lowering-voting-age-for-eu-referendum-a6764966.html |access-date=30 January 2017|work=The Independent|date=8 December 2015}}</ref>

The deadline to register to vote was initially midnight on 7 June 2016; however, this was extended by 48 hours owing to technical problems with the official registration website on 7 June, caused by unusually high web traffic. Some supporters of the Leave campaign, including the Conservative MP [[Sir Gerald Howarth]], criticised the government's decision to extend the deadline, alleging it gave Remain an advantage because many late registrants were young people who were considered to be more likely to vote for Remain.<ref>{{cite news|title=EU vote registration deadline extended|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36480764|access-date=21 June 2016|work=BBC News|date=8 June 2016}}</ref> According to provisional figures from the Electoral Commission, almost 46.5&nbsp;million people were eligible to vote.<ref name="BBC46m">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36602702 |title=European Union referendum: UK goes to the polls |access-date=23 June 2016 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Registration problems===
[[Nottingham City Council]] emailed a [[Vote Leave]] supporter to say that the council was unable to check whether the nationality that people stated on their voting registration form was true, and hence that they simply had to assume that the information that was submitted was, indeed, correct.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36446521 |title=EU referendum: Thousands wrongly sent polling cards |date=3 June 2016 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

[[Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council]] and the Electoral Commission stated that Jakub Pawlowski, a Polish voter in Kingston upon Thames declared himself as being British on his registration form, and hence, received a referendum polling card in the post, although he is not a UK citizen and did not have the right to receive such a polling card.

3,462 EU nationals were wrongly sent postal voting cards, due to an IT issue experienced by Xpress, an electoral software supplier to a number of councils. Xpress was initially unable to confirm the exact number of those affected. The matter was resolved by the issuance of a software patch which rendered the wrongly recorded electors ineligible to vote on 23 June.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Crown Dependencies===
Residents of the [[Crown Dependencies]] (which are not part of the United Kingdom), namely the [[Isle of Man]] and the Bailiwicks of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], even if they were British citizens, were excluded from the referendum unless they were also previous residents of the United Kingdom (that is: England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland).<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news |title=Lord of the Rings star launches Manx EU referendum petition |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-35429021 |date=29 January 2016 |work=BBC News |access-date=15 February 2016}}</ref>

Some residents of the Isle of Man protested that they, as full British citizens under the British Nationality Act 1981 and living within the [[British Islands]], should also have been given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, as the Isle and the Bailiwicks, although not included as if they were part of the United Kingdom for the purpose of European Union (and [[European Economic Area]] (EEA)) membership (as is the case with Gibraltar), would also have been significantly affected by the outcome and impact of the referendum.<ref name="BBC News"/>

In the week beginning on 16 May, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] sent a voting guide regarding the referendum to every household within the UK and Gibraltar to raise awareness of the upcoming referendum. The eight-page guide contained details on how to vote, as well as a sample of the actual ballot paper, and a whole page each was given to the campaign groups Britain Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave to present their case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36286993|title=All voters to get EU referendum guide|date=15 May 2016|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/203410/EU-Referendum-voting-guide_England-and-Scotland.pdf|title=The 2016 EU Referendum Voting Guide |website=About My Vote |publisher=Electoral Commission |access-date=4 June 2016}}</ref>

The Vote Leave campaign argued that if the UK left the EU, national [[sovereignty]] would be protected, immigration controls could be imposed, and the UK would be able to sign trade deals with the rest of the world. The UK would also be able to stop membership payments to the EU every week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/why_vote_leave.html|title=Why Vote Leave|website=Vote Leave|access-date=22 December 2019}}</ref>{{refn|group="note"|The figure widely circulated by the Vote Leave campaign that the UK sends the EU £350m a week was declared a "misuse of official statistics" by the UK Statistics authority.<ref>{{Cite report | url=https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Letter-from-Sir-David-Norgrove-to-Foreign-Secretary.pdf|title=Use of '£350m per week' figure to describe UK's financial contributions to the EU | date=17 September 2017 | access-date=22 December 2019 }}</ref> This figure did not take into account the UK's budget rebate.

In the week following conclusion of the [[UK renegotiation of EU membership, 2016|UK's renegotiation]] (and especially after [[Boris Johnson]] announced that he would support the UK leaving), the pound fell to a seven-year low against the dollar and economists at [[HSBC]] warned that it could drop even more.<ref>P.

Uncertainty over the referendum result, together with several other factors—US interest rates rising, low commodity prices, low Eurozone growth and concerns over emerging markets such as China—contributed to a high level of stock market volatility in January and February 2016.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} On 14 June, polls showing that a Brexit was more likely led to the FTSE 100 falling by 2%, losing £98&nbsp;billion in value.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36526008 |title=FTSE 100 falls 2% as investors fret over Brexit|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/14/ftse-100-slides-towards-6000-and-pound-falls-as-brexit-fears-dri/ |title=FTSE 100 loses £100bn in four days as Brexit paralyses markets and pound crumbles|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> After further polls suggested a move back towards Remain, the pound and the FTSE recovered.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36573757 |title= The pound has made strong gains against the dollar |work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Economists===
In November 2015, the Governor of the [[Bank of England]] [[Mark Carney]] said that the Bank of England would do what was necessary to help the UK economy if the British people voted to leave the EU.<ref>P.

In December 2015, the Bank of England published a report about the impact of immigration on wages. The report concluded that immigration put downward pressure on workers' wages, particularly low-skilled workers: a 10 percent point rise in the proportion of migrants working in low-skilled services drove down the average wages of low-skilled workers by about 2 percent.<ref name=BoEDec2015WPM>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2015/swp574.pdf The impact of immigration on occupational wages: evidence from Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607123503/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2015/swp574.pdf |date=7 June 2016 }} S.

In March 2016, Nobel prize-winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argued that he might reconsider his support for the UK remaining in the EU if the proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP) were to be agreed to.<ref name=indep02032016HS>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eu-referendum-joseph-stiglitz-ttip-labour-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-a6907806.html EU referendum: UK could be better off leaving if TTIP passes, Joseph Stiglitz says], H.

The German economist [[Clemens Fuest]] wrote that there was a liberal, free-trade bloc in the EU comprising the UK, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, controlling 32% of the votes in the European Council and standing in opposition to the ''[[Dirigisme|dirigiste]]'', protectionist policies favoured by France and its allies.<ref name="Fuest">{{cite web|last=Fuest|first=Clemens|title = How Germany Views Brexit|publisher=Project Syndicate|date=19 April 2016|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brexit-consequences-for-germany-by-clemens-fuest-2016-04|access-date=29 November 2015}}</ref> Germany with its 'social market' economy stands midway between the French ''dirigiste'' economic model and the British free-market economic model. From the German viewpoint, the existence of the liberal bloc allows Germany to play-off free-market Britain against ''dirigiste'' France, and that if Britain were to leave, the liberal bloc would be severely weakened, thereby allowing the French to take the EU into a much more ''dirigiste'' direction that would be unattractive from the standpoint of Berlin.<ref name="Fuest"/>

A study by Oxford Economics for the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] has suggested that Brexit would have a particularly large negative impact on the UK financial services industry and the law firms that support it, which could cost the law sector as much as £1.7bn per annum by 2030.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dakers|first1=Marion|title=Law firms will bear the brunt of Brexit, lawyers warn|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11896143/Law-firms-will-bear-the-brunt-of-Brexit-lawyers-warn.html|access-date=14 June 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 September 2015}}</ref> The Law Society's own report into the possible effects of Brexit notes that leaving the EU would be likely to reduce the role played by the UK as a centre for resolving disputes between foreign firms, whereas a potential loss of "[[passporting]]" rights would require financial services firms to transfer departments responsible for regulatory oversight overseas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The EU and the Legal Sector|url=https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/News/documents/eu-and-the-legal-sector-October-2015/|publisher=The Law Society of England and Wales|access-date=24 June 2016|date=October 2015|format=PDF}}</ref>

[[World Pensions & Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] director M. Nicolas J. Firzli has argued that the Brexit debate should be viewed within the broader context of [[Law and economics|economic analysis of EU law and regulation]] in relation to [[English law|English common law]], arguing: "Every year, the British Parliament is forced to pass tens of new statutes reflecting the latest EU directives coming from Brussels – a highly undemocratic process known as '[[Transposition (law)|transposition]]'... Slowly but surely, these new laws dictated by EU commissars are conquering English common law, imposing upon UK businesses and citizens an ever-growing collection of fastidious regulations in every field".<ref>{{cite web|first=Nicolas| last=Firzli | title=A Frenchman writes: Britain should say adiEU in June |url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2016-03-07/britain-should-say-adieu-to-eu |website=Dow Jones Financial News|access-date=7 March 2016}}</ref>

Thiemo Fetzer, professor of Economics from [[University of Warwick]], analyzed the welfare reforms in the UK since 2000 and suggests that numerous austerity-induced welfare reforms from 2010 onwards have stopped contributing to mitigate income differences through transfer payments.

Michael Jacobs, the current director of the Commission on Economic Justice at the Institute for Public Policy Research and Mariana Mazzucato, a professor in University College London in Economics of Innovation and Public Value have found that the Brexit campaign had the tendency to blame external forces for domestic economic problems and have argued that the problems within the economy wasn't due to 'unstoppable forces of globalisation' but rather the result of active political and business decisions. Instead, they claim that orthodox economic theory has guided poor economic policy such as investment and that has been the cause of problems within the British economy.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Brexit-Trump syndrome: it's the economics, stupid |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/id/eprint/69142 |access-date=20 December 2019}}</ref>

In May 2016, the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] said that an EU exit could mean two more years of austerity cuts as the government would have to make up for an estimated loss of £20&nbsp;billion to £40&nbsp;billion of tax revenue. The head of the IFS, Paul Johnson, said that the UK "could perfectly reasonably decide that we are willing to pay a bit of a price for leaving the EU and regaining some sovereignty and control over immigration and so on. That there would be some price though, I think is now almost beyond doubt."<ref>{{cite news|work =BBC News|date=25 May 2016| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36371700 |title=EU exit could add two years to austerity, IFS says}}</ref>

Shortly after the polls closed at 10&nbsp;pm on 23 June, the British polling company [[YouGov]] released a poll conducted among almost 5,000 people on the day; it suggested a narrow lead for "Remain", which polled 52% with Leave polling 48%. It was later criticised for overestimating the margin of the "Remain" vote,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38402133|title=Why were the polls wrong again in 2016?|first=David|last=Cowling|date=24 December 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=12 September 2018}}</ref> when it became clear a few hours later that the UK had voted 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of leaving the European Union.

<!-- THIS SECTION IS INTENDED AS A SUMMARY OF THE KEY ISSUES. BEFORE ADDING NEW MATERIAL, PLEASE CONSIDER IF IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE IN THE MAIN ARTICLE LINKED ABOVE -->
The number of jobs lost or gained by a withdrawal was a dominant issue; the BBC's outline of issues warned that a precise figure was difficult to find. The Leave campaign argued that a reduction in red tape associated with EU regulations would create more jobs and that small to medium-sized companies who trade domestically would be the biggest beneficiaries. Those arguing to remain in the EU, claimed that millions of jobs would be lost. The EU's importance as a trading partner and the outcome of its trade status if it left was a disputed issue. Whereas those wanting to stay cited that most of the UK's trade was made with the EU, those arguing to leave say that its trade was not as important as it used to be. Scenarios of the economic outlook for the country if it left the EU were generally negative. The United Kingdom also paid more into the EU budget than it received.<ref name=BBCinorout>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32793642 |title=UK and the EU: Better off out or in? |work=BBC News |date=23 February 2016 |access-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>

==Voting, voting areas and counts==
[[File:Brexit (27240041144).jpg|thumb|right|Sign outside a polling station in London on the morning of the referendum]]
Voting took place from 0700 BST (WEST) until 2200 BST (Same hours CEST in Gibraltar) in 41,000 polling stations across 382 voting areas, with each polling station limited to a maximum of 2,500 voters.<ref name=section11>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/36/section/11/enacted European Referendum Act 2015] Section 11.</ref> The referendum was held across all four countries of the United Kingdom, as well as in Gibraltar, as a single majority vote. The 382 voting areas were grouped into twelve regional counts and there was separate declarations for each of the regional counts.

In England, as happened in the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|2011 AV referendum]], the 326 [[Districts of England|districts]] were used as the local voting areas and the returns of these then fed into nine [[Regions of England|English regional]] counts. In Scotland the local voting areas were the [[Local government in Scotland|32 local councils]] which then fed their results into the Scottish national count, and in Wales the [[Local government in Wales|22 local councils]] were their local voting areas before the results were then fed into the Welsh national count. Northern Ireland, as was the case in the AV referendum, was a single voting and national count area although local totals by Westminster parliamentary constituency areas were announced.

Gibraltar was a single voting area, but as Gibraltar was to be treated and included as if it were a part of South West England, its results was included together with the South West England regional count.<ref name=section11/>

===Voter demographics and trends===
{{further|Causes of the vote in favour of Brexit}}

Researchers based at the [[University of Warwick]] found that areas with "deprivation in terms of education, income and employment were more likely to vote Leave". The Leave vote tended to be greater in areas which had lower incomes and high unemployment, a strong tradition of manufacturing employment, and in which the population had fewer qualifications.<ref name="Becker-Fetzer-Novy">Sascha O Becker, Thiemo Fetzer, Dennis Novy.

[[Economic Policy (journal)|''Economic Policy'']], Volume 32, Issue 92, 1 October 2017, pp.601–650. Quotes: "We find that fundamental characteristics of the voting population were key drivers of the Vote Leave share, in particular their education profiles, their historical dependence on manufacturing employment as well as low income and high unemployment. At the much finer level of wards within cities, we find that areas with deprivation in terms of education, income and employment were more likely to vote Leave. [...] A larger flow of migrants from Eastern Europe reaching a local authority area with a larger share of unqualified people or a larger share of manufacturing workers is also associated with a larger Vote Leave share".</ref> It also tended to be greater where there was a large flow of Eastern European migrants (mainly low-skilled workers) into areas with a large share of native low-skilled workers.<ref name="Becker-Fetzer-Novy"/> Those in lower [[NRS social grade|social grades]] (especially the 'working class') were more likely to vote Leave, while those in higher social grades (especially the '[[upper middle class]]') were more likely to vote Remain.<ref>Noel Dempsey & Neil Johnston.

One analysis suggests that in contrast to the general correlation between age and likelihood of having voted to leave the EU, those who experienced the majority of their formative period (between the ages of 15 to 25) during the [[Second World War]] are more likely to oppose Brexit than the rest of the over-65 age group,{{failed verification|date=October 2019}} for they are more likely to associate the EU with bringing peace.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/03/21/not-all-the-over-65s-are-in-favour-of-brexit-britains-wartime-generation-are-almost-as-pro-eu-as-millennials/ |title=Not all the 'over 65s' are in favour of Brexit – Britain's wartime generation are almost as pro-EU as millennials |last=Devine |first=Kevin |date=21 March 2019 |website=London School of Economics |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |access-date=19 October 2019}}</ref>

{{main|Aftermath of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum}}

====Youth protests and non-inclusion of underage citizens====
The referendum was criticised for not granting people younger than 18 years of age a vote. Unlike in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], the vote was not extended to 16- and 17-year-old citizens. Critics argued that these people would live with the consequences of the referendum for longer than those who were able to vote. Some supporters for the inclusion of these young citizens considered this exclusion a violation of democratic principles and a major shortcoming of the referendum.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-eu-referendum-latest-protest-young-people-parliament-vote-a7101701.html |title=Young people are gathering at Parliament furious at not being given the vote |last1=Worley |first1=Will |last2=Forster |first2=Katie |date=24 June 2016 |work=The Independent  |access-date=25 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36619342 |title=Brexit: How much of a generation gap is there? |work=BBC News  |access-date=26 June 2016}}</ref>

In the UK, crimes are recorded as hate crimes based on the perception of the victim. Assistant Chief Constable Maurice Mason of the Essex police explained that "If the person feels it's a hate crime it'll get recorded as a hate crime", saying that his county's "50% increase in reported hate crimes" post referendum were "low level matters, some members of the public complaining about Nigel Farage or whatever ... that’ll get recorded as a hate crime".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yourharlow.com/2016/07/05/essex-police-reveal-hate-crime-spike-since-eu-referendum/ |title=Essex Police reveal hate crime spike since EU referendum |date=5 July 2016 }}</ref>

In reaction to the lack of a unified pro-EU voice following the referendum, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and others discussed the launch of a new centre-left political movement.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|title=Liberals, celebrities and EU supporters set up progressive movement|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement|access-date=24 July 2016|date=19 July 2016}}</ref> This was officially launched on 24 July 2016 as [[More United]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Shead|first=Sam|title=Paddy Ashdown has launched a tech-driven political startup called More United that will crowdfund MPs across all parties|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/paddy-ashdown-has-launched-a-tech-driven-political-startup-called-more-united-2016-7|access-date=24 July 2016|date=24 July 2016|work=Business Insider UK}}</ref>

===Economy===
{{main|Economic effects of Brexit}}
On the morning of 24 June, the pound sterling fell to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-36570120|title=Corbyn ballot challenge ruling & Boris Johnson in Paris talks|website=BBC News}}</ref> The drop over the day was 8% – the biggest one-day fall in the pound since the introduction of floating exchange rates following the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite news |last= McGeever |first= Jamie |date= 7 July 2016|title= Sterling's post-Brexit fall is biggest loss in a hard currency|url= https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling/sterlings-post-brexit-fall-is-biggest-loss-in-a-hard-currency-idUKKCN0ZN1R0 |access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref>

The referendum result also had an immediate impact on some other countries. The South African rand experienced its largest single-day decline since 2008, dropping over 8% against the United States dollar.<ref name="IOL Rand">{{cite news | url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/markets/currencies/rand-slumps-more-than-8-against-dollar-2038150 | title=Rand slumps more than 8% against dollar | agency=Reuters | date=24 June 2016 | access-date=26 June 2016}}</ref><ref name="Quarts Africa Impact">{{cite news | url=http://qz.com/715710/brexit-could-be-terrible-for-africas-largest-economies/ | title=Brexit will be terrible for Africa's largest economies | work=Quartz | date=24 June 2016 | access-date=26 June 2016 |author=Kuo, Lily |author2=Kazeem, Yomi}}</ref> Other countries affected included Canada, whose stock exchange fell 1.70%,<ref name="CanadaImpact">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/brexit-vote-business-impact-1.3650553 | title=Loonie loses more than a penny, TSX sheds 239 points after Britons vote to quit EU | publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | date=24 June 2016 | access-date=26 June 2016 | author=Evans, Pete}}</ref> Nigeria<ref name="Quarts Africa Impact" /> and Kenya.<ref name="Quarts Africa Impact" />

On 28 June 2016, former governor of Bank of England [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]] said that current governor [[Mark Carney]] would help to guide Britain through the next few months, adding that the BOE would undoubtedly lower the temperature of the post-referendum uncertainty, and that British citizens should keep calm, wait and see.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-28/king-says-carney-calm-will-guide-u-k-through-brexit-uncertainty|title=King Says Carney Calm Will Guide U.K. Through Brexit Uncertainty|publisher=Bloomberg|date=28 June 2016|access-date=26 December 2016}}</ref>

On 5 January 2017, [[Andy Haldane]], chief economist and the executive director of monetary analysis and statistics at the [[Bank of England]], admitted that the bank's forecasts (predicting an economic downturn should the referendum favour Brexit) had proved inaccurate given the subsequent strong market performance.<ref name=Haldane /> He stated that the bank's models "were rather narrow and fragile [and] ill-equipped to making sense of behaviours that were deeply irrational" and said that his "profession is to some degree in crisis" due to this and the unforeseen [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007{{ndash}}2008 crisis]].<ref name=Haldane>{{cite news | last1=Inman | first1=Phillip | title=Chief Economist of Bank of England Admits Errors in Brexit Forecasting | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/05/chief-economist-of-bank-of-england-admits-errors | date=5 January 2017 | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last1=Swinford | first1=Steven | title=Bank of England Admits 'Michael Fish' Moment with Dire Brexit Predictions | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/05/bank-england-admits-michael-fish-moment-dire-brexit-predictions/ | date=6 January 2017 | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref>

===Electoral Reform Society===
In August 2016, the [[Electoral Reform Society]] published a highly critical report on the referendum and called for a review of how future events are run. Contrasting it very unfavourably with the 'well-informed grassroots' campaign for [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence]], [[Katie Ghose]] described it as "dire" with "glaring democratic deficiencies" which left voters bewildered. Ghose noted a generally negative response to establishment figures with 29% of voters saying David Cameron made them more likely to vote leave whereas only 14% said he made them want to vote remain. Looking ahead, the society called for an official organisation to highlight misleading claims and for [[Ofcom|Office of Communications (Ofcom)]] to define the role that broadcasters were expected to play.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/01/electoral-reform-campaigners-slam-dire-eu-referendum-debate|title=Electoral reform campaigners slam 'dire' EU referendum debate |work=Guardian newspapers|author=Rajeev Syal|date=1 September 2016|access-date=1 September 2016}}</ref>

===Television coverage===
The [[BBC News|BBC]], [[ITV News|ITV]] and [[Sky News]] all provided live coverage of the counts and the reaction to the result. The [[BBC]] simulcast their domestic coverage on the [[BBC World News]] Channel, [[BBC One]] and the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News Channel]] which was presented by [[David Dimbleby]], [[Laura Kuenssberg]] and [[John Curtice]]. ITV's coverage was presented by [[Tom Bradby]], [[Robert Peston]] and [[Allegra Stratton]].

The [[BBC]] called the referendum result for Leave with its projected forecast at 04:40 [[British Summer Time|BST]] on 24 June. David Dimbleby announced it with the words:

{{cquote|Well, at twenty minutes to five, we can now say the decision taken in 1975 by this country to join the Common Market has been reversed by this referendum to leave the EU. We are absolutely clear now that there is no way that the Remain side can win. It looks as if the gap is going to be something like 52 to 48, so a four-point lead for leaving the EU, and that is the result of this referendum, which has been preceded by weeks and months of argument and dispute and all the rest of it. The British people have spoken and the answer is: we're out!}}

(The remark about 1975 was technically incorrect:  the UK had joined the Common Market in 1973 and the 1975 referendum was on whether to remain in it.)

In February 2017, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] announced that it was investigating the spending of Stronger in and Vote Leave, along with smaller parties, as they had not submitted all the necessary invoices, receipts, or details to back up their accounts.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/election-watchdog-probes-spending-eu-referendum-campaign-groups/ Election watchdog probes spending by EU referendum campaign groups], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (24 February 2017).</ref> In April 2017, the Commission specified that 'there were reasonable grounds to suspect that potential offences under the law may have occurred' in relation to Leave.EU.<ref>[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-referendums/electoral-commission-statement-on-investigation-into-leave.eu Electoral Commission statement on investigation into Leave.EU], Electoral Commission (21 April 2017).</ref><ref name="auto1"/>

On 4 March 2017, the Information Commissioner's Office also reported that it was 'conducting a wide assessment of the data-protection risks arising from the use of data [[analytics]], including for political purposes' in relation to the Brexit campaign. It was specified that among the organisations to be investigated was [[Cambridge Analytica]] and its relationship with the Leave.EU campaign.<ref>Jamie Doward, Carole Cadwalladr and Alice Gibbs, '[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/04/cambridge-analytics-data-brexit-trump Watchdog to launch inquiry into misuse of data in politics]', ''The Observer'' (4 March 2017).</ref><ref name="auto1">Carole Cadwalladr, '[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked]', ''The Observer'' (Sunday 7 May 2017).</ref>

In May 2017, ''[[The Irish Times]]'' reported that £425,622 donated by the Constitutional Research Council to the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] for spending during the referendum may have originated in [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>O'Toole, Fintan (16 May 2017) [https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/what-connects-brexit-the-dup-dark-money-and-a-saudi-prince-1.3083586 "What connects Brexit, the DUP, dark money and a Saudi prince?"].

In November 2017, the Electoral Commission said that it was investigating allegations that [[Arron Banks]], an insurance businessman and the largest single financial supporter of Brexit, violated campaign spending laws.<ref name="Mance">Henry Mance, [https://www.ft.com/content/308043a6-c026-382a-9e4a-5e694a89dd72 Brexit-backer Arron Banks to be investigated over campaign spending], ''Financial Times'' (1 November 2017).</ref> The commission's investigation focuses on both Banks and Better for the Country Limited, a company of which Banks is a director and majority shareholder.<ref>Holly Watt, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/01/electoral-commission-to-investigate-arron-banks-brexit-donations-eu-referendum Electoral Commission to investigate Arron Banks' Brexit donations: Watchdog to consider whether leave campaigner broke campaign finance rules in run-up to EU referendum], ''The Guardian'' (1 November 2017).</ref> The company donated £2.4&nbsp;million to groups supporting British withdrawal from the EU.<ref name="Mance"/> The investigation began after the Commission found "initial grounds to suspect breaches of electoral law".<ref name="ManceCampaign">Henry Mance, [https://www.ft.com/content/8d532c46-beff-11e7-b8a3-38a6e068f464 Arron Banks investigated for Brexit campaign spending], ''Financial Times'' (1 November 2017).</ref> The Commission specifically seeks to determine "whether or not Mr Banks was the true source of loans reported by a referendum campaigner in his name" and "whether or not Better for the Country Limited was the true source of donations made to referendum campaigners in its name, or if it was acting as an agent".<ref name="Mance"/>

In December 2017, the Electoral Commission announced several fines related to breaches of campaign finance rules during the referendum campaign.<ref name="fines">Maidment, Jack (19 December 2017) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/19/liberal-democrats-fined-18000-breaching-campaign-finance-rules/amp/ "Liberal Democrats fined £18,000 for breaching campaign finance rules relating to EU referendum"].

In March 2018, Deutsche Welle reported that Canadian whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] "told UK lawmakers during a committee hearing...that a firm linked to [[Cambridge Analytica]] helped the official [[Vote Leave]] campaign [the official pro-Brexit group headed by [[Boris Johnson]] and Michael Gove] circumvent campaign financing laws during the Brexit referendum".<ref>"[http://www.dw.com/en/what-role-did-cambridge-analytica-play-in-the-brexit-vote/a-43151460 What role did Cambridge Analytica play in the Brexit vote?]".

In May 2018, the Electoral Commission fined [[Leave.EU]] £70,000 for unlawfully overspending by a minimum of £77,380 – exceeding the statutory spending limit by more than 10%, inaccurately reporting three loans it had received from Aaron Banks totalling £6&nbsp;million including "a lack of transparency and incorrect reporting around who provided the loans, the dates the loans were entered into, the repayment date and the interest rate", and failing to provide the required invoices for "97 payments of over £200, totalling £80,224". The Electoral Commission's director of political finance and regulation and legal counsel said that the "level of fine we have imposed has been constrained by the cap on the commission's fines".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/leaveeu-fined-70k-breaches-of-electoral-law-eu-referendum|title=Leave.EU fined £70k over breaches of electoral law|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=11 May 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=11 May 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/party-and-election-finance-to-keep/leave.eu-fined-for-multiple-breaches-of-electoral-law-following-investigation "Leave.EU fined for multiple breaches of electoral law following investigation"].

In July 2018, the Electoral Commission fined Vote Leave £61,000 for not declaring £675,000 incurred under a common plan with [[BeLeave]], unlawfully overspending by £449,079, inaccurately reporting 43 items of spending totalling £236,501, failing to provide the required invoices for "8 payments of over £200, totalling £12,850", and failing to comply with an investigation notice issued by the commission.  Darren Grimes representing BeLeave was fined £20,000, the maximum permitted individual fine, for exceeding its spending limit as an unregistered campaigner by more than £660,000 and delivering an inaccurate and incomplete spending return.  [[Veterans for Britain]] was also fined £250 for inaccurately reporting a donation it received from Vote Leave.<ref>[https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/party-and-election-finance-to-keep/vote-leave-fined-and-referred-to-the-police-for-breaking-electoral-law "Vote Leave fined and referred to the police for breaking electoral law"].

===Speculation about Russian interference===
{{Main|Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum}}
In the run-up to the Brexit referendum, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] refrained from taking a public position on Brexit,<ref name="blamerussia">{{cite news |title=EU referendum: Would Brexit make Putin happy? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36461020 |work=BBC News |date=7 June 2016}}</ref> but Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that Russia "might be happy" with a positive Brexit vote, while the Remain campaign accused the [[Kremlin]] of secretly backing a "Leave" vote in the referendum.<ref name="Rosenberg">Steve Rosenberg, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36629146 EU referendum: What does Russia gain from Brexit?'], BBC News (26 June 2016).</ref> Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson [[Maria Zakharova]] denied these allegations, saying that "Russia is blamed for everything. Not only in the UK but all over the world. (...) But Russia has nothing to do with Brexit at all. We're not involved in this process."<ref name="blamerussia"/> [[Steve Rosenberg (journalist)|Steve Rosenberg]], the Moscow correspondent for BBC News, suggested on 26 June 2016 that the Russian government stood to gain from Brexit in several ways: (1) enabling Russian state media "to contrast post-referendum upheaval and uncertainty abroad with a picture of 'stability' back home and images of a 'strong' [[Vladimir Putin|President Putin]] at the helm" in a way that bolstered the ruling [[United Russia]] party; (2) to place the value of the [[British pound]] under pressure and thereby exact retaliation for [[sanctions against Russia]] imposed after its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|occupation of Crimea]]; (3) to "make the European Union more friendly towards Russia" in the absence of British membership; and (4) to force the resignation of Cameron, who had been critical of Russian actions.<ref name="Rosenberg"/> After the referendum result Putin said that Brexit brought "positives and negatives".<ref name="Rosenberg"/>

In December 2016, MP [[Ben Bradshaw]] speculated in Parliament that Russia may have interfered in the referendum.<ref>Joe Watts, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/russian-interference-brexit-highly-probable-referendum-hacking-putin-a7472706.html  Highly probable' that Russia interfered in Brexit referendum, Labour MP says], ''Independent'' (13 December 2016).</ref> In February 2017, he called on the [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] intelligence service to reveal the information it had on Russian interference.<ref>Jake Kanter & Adam Bienkov, [http://uk.businessinsider.com/labour-mp-ben-bradshaw-suspicious-russian-interference-brexit-2017-2?op=1  Labour MPs think the government is hiding info about Russia interfering with Brexit], 'Business Insider'' (23 February 2016).</ref> In April 2017, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee]] (PACAC) issued a report suggesting that there were technical indications that a June 2016 crash of the voter-registration website was caused by a [[distributed denial-of-service attack]] using [[botnet]]s.<ref name="Syal">Rajeev Syal, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/12/foreign-states-may-have-interfered-in-brexit-vote-report-says Brexit: foreign states may have interfered in vote, report says], ''The Guardian'' (12 April 2017).</ref> The [[Cabinet Office]], in response, stated that it did not believe that "malign intervention" had caused the crash, and instead attributed the crash "to a spike in users just before the registration deadline".<ref name="Syal"/>

In October 2017, MP [[Damian Collins]], chairman of the House of Commons [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]], sent a letter to Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] requesting documents relating to possible Russian government manipulation of Facebook during the Brexit referendum and the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election]] the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Joseph Cox|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/britain-requests-facebooks-russian-ad-data-from-run-up-to-brexit-election|title=Britain Requests Facebook's Russian Ad Data From Run-Up to Brexit, Election|date=24 October 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref>

In October 2017, a study by researchers at [[City, University of London]] was published in the journal ''[[Social Science Computer Review]]''.

In November 2017, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] told ''[[The Times]]'' that it had launched an inquiry to "examine the growing role of social media in election campaigns amid concerns from the intelligence and security agencies that Russia is trying to destabilise the democratic process in Britain".<ref name="WrightFisher">Oliver Wright, Lucy Fisher & Sean O'Neill, [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/watchdog-starts-inquiry-into-russia-brexit-links-lnf7h86t0 Watchdog starts inquiry into Russia Brexit links], ''The Times'' (2 November 2017).</ref> The commission was in contact with Facebook and Twitter as part of the inquiry.<ref name="WrightFisher"/>
