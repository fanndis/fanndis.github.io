'''Harald V''' ({{IPA-no|ˈhɑ̀rɑɫ|lang}}; born 21 February 1937) is [[King of Norway]], having ascended the throne upon the death of his father King [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]] on 17 January 1991.
 
Harald was the third child and only son of King Olav V and [[Princess Märtha of Sweden]]. He was second in the [[Line of succession to the Norwegian throne|line of succession]] at the time of his birth, behind his father. In 1940, as a result of the [[German occupation of Norway|German occupation]] during World War II, the royal family went into exile. Harald spent part of his childhood in Sweden and the United States. He returned to Norway in 1945, and subsequently studied for periods at the [[University of Oslo]], the [[Norwegian Military Academy]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]].

Following the death of his grandfather [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]] in 1957, Harald became crown prince as his father became king. A keen sportsman, he represented Norway in sailing at the [[Sailing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], and [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]], and later became patron of [[World Sailing]]. Harald married [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Sonja Haraldsen]] in 1968, their relationship having initially being controversial due to her status as a [[commoner]]. The couple had two children, [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Märtha Louise]] and [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Haakon]]. Harald succeeded his father as king in 1991, with Haakon becoming his [[heir apparent]].

==Early life and education==
===Birth===
[[File:92. Kronprinsesse Märtha med prins Harald - no-nb digifoto 20160108 00289 bldsa pk kgl0027.jpg|thumb|Prince Harald with his mother [[Princess Märtha of Sweden|Crown Princess Märtha]]]]
Prince Harald was born at the [[Skaugum|Skaugum estate]] during the reign of his grandfather [[King Haakon VII]] and was baptised in the [[Slottskapellet (Oslo)|Royal Chapel]] of the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] in [[Oslo]] on 31 March 1937 by Bishop Johan Lunde. His godparents were: his paternal grandparents King Haakon VII and [[Queen Maud of Norway]]; his maternal grandparents [[Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland|Prince Carl]] and [[Princess Ingeborg of Denmark|Princess Ingeborg of Sweden]]; [[King Leopold III of Belgium]]; [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and [[King George VI of the United Kingdom]]; and [[Ingrid of Sweden|Crown Princess Ingrid of Denmark]]. His parents already had two daughters, [[Princess Ragnhild, Mrs. Lorentzen|Princess Ragnhild]] and [[Princess Astrid, Mrs. Ferner|Princess Astrid]].

At the time of Harald's birth, he was 2nd in line of [[succession to the Norwegian throne]] following his father, [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]]; and also was 16th in line of [[succession to the British throne]] as a descendant of [[Queen Victoria]] through his paternal grandmother, Queen Maud.

===Second World War===
[[File:139. Prins Harald - no-nb digifoto 20160108 00334 bldsa pk kgl0090.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Harald as a child|upright]]
In 1940 the entire royal family had to flee Oslo because of the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion]]. It was deemed safer for the family to split up. The King and Crown Prince Olav would remain in Norway and the Crown Princess was to make her way to Sweden with the three children. The latter party reached Sweden on the night of 10 April, but although Crown Princess Märtha was Swedish-born, they encountered problems at the border station. According to Princess Astrid and others who were present, they were admitted only after the driver threatened to ram the border gate. Another account does not describe the escape so dramatically.<ref name="Hegge">[[Per Egil Hegge|Hegge, Per Egil]]; Harald V, En biografi; N.W. Damm & Søn AS; 2006.</ref> However, when the King and Crown Prince inquired of Swedish foreign minister [[Christian Günther]] whether they could sleep one night in Sweden without being interned, they were denied.<ref name="Hegge"/>

Harald spent the following days in [[Sälen]] before moving to [[Prince Carl, Duke of Östergötland|Prince Carl Bernadotte's]] home in [[Frötuna]] on 16 April. On 26 April the group moved to [[Drottningholm]] in [[Stockholm]]. [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V]] has been accounted to have had an amicable relationship with his Norwegian guests, but the topic of the war in Norway was not to be raised. However, influential Swedish politicians, including Minister of Justice [[Karl Gustaf Westman|Westman]], wanted the Crown Princess and Prince Harald to be sent back to Norway so he could be proclaimed King by the Germans.<ref name="Hegge"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764542,00.html|title=Kidnapper Foiled?|work=Time|date=2 September 1940|accessdate=17 January 2009}}</ref> After the King and Crown Prince had to leave Norway on 7 June they felt Sweden might not be the best place for the rest of the family, and started planning for them to go to the United States. On 17 August the Crown Princess and her children left for the United States from [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], Finland, aboard the United States Army transport ship {{SS|American Legion|1919|2}}.<ref name="Hegge"/>

Harald and his mother and sisters lived in [[Washington, D.C.]] during the war,<ref>{{cite news|title=Non-Political Campaign |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764591-2,00.html|work=Time Magazine|page=2|date=9 September 1940|accessdate=17 January 2009}}</ref> while his father, Crown Prince Olav, and his grandfather, King Haakon, stayed in London with the Norwegian government-in-exile. One of the notable events he remembers from that time is standing behind [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] when he was [[Fourth inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|sworn in for his fourth term]] on the South Portico of the [[White House]] in 1945. Such childhood experiences are reflected in a trace of an American accent when he speaks English.<ref name="nyt1971">[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/14/archives/those-apprentice-kings-and-queens-who-may-one-day-ascend-a-throne.html?sq=akihito%2520%2520and%2520Windsor&scp=1&st=cse "Those Apprentice Kings and Queens Who May – One Day – Ascend a Throne,"] ''New York Times.'' 14 November 1971.</ref> The Doris Kearns Goodwin book ''No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and the Home Front in World War II'' contains a picture of the King (then Prince) playing with FDR's dog, [[Fala (dog)|Fala]], on the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] of the White House in 1944.

Harald visited Norwegian servicemen training in the United States. The prince also made visits outside America, travelling north to visit Norwegian personnel at the training base "[[Little Norway]]" in Ontario, Canada. He attended The White Hall Country School from 1943. Prince Harald returned to Norway with his family at the war's end in 1945.

===Return===
In the autumn of 1945 he was enrolled in third grade of Smestad skole as the first member of the royal family to attend a public (state) school. Amidst this when he was only 17 years old in 1954, his [[Princess Märtha of Sweden|mother]] died of cancer. The Crown Princess's death was a tremendous loss for him and his family as well as for Norway,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=28675|title=Crown Princess Märtha (1901-1954)|work=Norwegian Royal House|access-date=7 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616030151/http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=28675|archive-date=16 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and he named his [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|daughter]] Märtha to honour her memory. Four years later in 1958 he would lose his maternal grandmother [[Princess Ingeborg of Denmark]].

==Crown prince==
[[File:117. H.K.H. Prins Harald - no-nb digifoto 20160111 00010 bldsa pk kgl0080.jpg|thumb|Prince Harald as a student in the Cavalry Officers' Candidate School, Trandum]]
In 1955 he graduated from [[Oslo katedralskole]] and in the autumn of that year, Harald began studies at the [[University of Oslo]]. He later attended the Cavalry Officers' Candidate School at [[Trandum]]<!--in [[Ullensaker]], but we should write a small article about Trandum as well-->, followed by enrollment at the [[Norwegian Military Academy]], from which he graduated in 1959.  On 21 September 1957 at the death of his grandfather, Harald became crown prince at the age of 20 and he attended the [[Council of State (Norway)|Council of State]] for the first time six days later and took the oath to the Constitution of Norway on 21 February 1958. In the same year, he also served as regent in the King's absence for the first time.

In 1960, Harald entered [[Balliol College, Oxford]] where he studied history, economics and politics.<ref name="nyt1971" /> He was a keen [[Rowing (sport)|rower]] during his student days at Oxford and was taught to row by fellow student and friend [[Nick Bevan]], later a leading British school rowing coach. In 1960, he also made his first official journey abroad, visiting the United States in connection with the fiftieth anniversary of the [[The American-Scandinavian Foundation|American Scandinavian Foundation]]. An avid sailor,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875198,00.html|title=Victory by Design|date=27 September 1963|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=17 January 2009|page=1}}</ref> Harald represented Norway in the [[yachting]] events of the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]] in [[Sailing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo in 1964]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898168-2,00.html|title=HP-Time.com|date=26 June 1964|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=17 January 2009|page=2}}</ref> [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|Mexico City in 1968]],<ref name="nyt1971" /> and [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Munich in 1972]]. The Crown Prince carried the Norwegian flag at the opening parade of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. Harald is an honorary president of the [[International Soling Association]].

===Marriage===
Harald married a [[commoner]], [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Sonja Haraldsen]], at [[Oslo Domkirke]] in Oslo on 29 August 1968. The pair had dated for nine years, but Olav was reluctant to allow his son to marry a commoner. Olav only relented when Harald told his father that if he was not allowed to marry Sonja he would not marry at all. This would have ended the reign of his family and the Norwegian monarchy, as Harald was the sole heir to the throne. The couple have two children, [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Princess Märtha Louise]] and [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince Haakon]], [[heir apparent]] to the Norwegian throne.

==Reign==
On the death of his father on 17 January 1991, Harald [[The king is dead, long live the king!|succeeded automatically]] to the Norwegian throne. He became the first Norwegian-born monarch since [[Magnus VII of Norway|Magnus VII]] abdicated in 1343, a gap of 648 years. Harald is the sixth King of Norway to bear that name, and the first in 855 years. The five other kings who have borne the name are [[Harald Fairhair]], [[Harald Greycloak]], [[Harald Bluetooth]], [[Harald Hardrada]], and [[Harald Gille]]. Harald Bluetooth is usually not given a number in the [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Norwegian list of kings]], therefore Harald is 'only' numbered as ''Harald V''. King Harald made the decision to use his grandfather's royal motto, "[[List of Norwegian monarchs' mottos|Alt for Norge]]". The King also chose to continue the tradition of royal [[benediction]], a tradition that had been introduced with his [[Olav V of Norway|father]], and was consecrated together with [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Queen Sonja]] in the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] on 23 June 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=28733&sek=27278|title=The Consecration of King Harald and Queen Sonja|website=www.kongehuset.no|language=no|access-date=2017-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228232601/http://www.kongehuset.no/artikkel.html?tid=28733&sek=27278|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The reign of King Harald has been marked by modernization and reform for the [[Norwegian royal family|Norwegian Royal family]]. The King has cooperated closely with Queen Sonja and the Crown Prince in making the [[Royal Household|royal household]] more open to the Norwegian public and the [[Media of Norway|Norwegian media]]. King Harald's decision to accept two more commoners into the royal family, [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Crown Princess Mette-Marit]] and [[Ari Behn]], has been interpreted as a sign of modernization and adjustment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/_-a-si-at-vi-ikke-er-apne_-er-rett-og-slett-feil-1.12571148|title=– Å si at vi ikke er åpne, er rett og slett feil|last=NRK|work=NRK|access-date=2017-12-29|language=nb-NO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/i/paAQW/Stanghelle-Kong-Harald-star-frem-som-mannen-som-forstar-sin-egen-tid|title=Stanghelle: "Kong Harald står frem som mannen som forstår sin egen tid"|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2017-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229112459/https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/i/paAQW/Stanghelle-Kong-Harald-star-frem-som-mannen-som-forstar-sin-egen-tid|archive-date=29 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Under King Harald and Queen Sonja's leadership, comprehensive renovation projects on the [[Bygdøy Royal Estate]], the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]], [[The Queen Sonja Art Stable|the royal stables]] and [[Oscarshall]] have also taken place.

While the Constitution vests the King with executive power, he is not politically responsible for exercising it. This is in accordance not only with provisions of the Constitution, but with conventions established since the definitive establishment of parliamentary rule in Norway in 1884. His acts are not valid without the countersignature of a member of the [[Council of State (Norway)|Council of State]] (cabinet)–usually the [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]]–and proceedings of the Council of State are signed by all of its members. Although he nominally has the power of veto, no Norwegian king has exercised it since the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905. Even then, the king's veto power is suspensive, not absolute as is the case with British monarchs. A royal veto can be overridden if the Storting passes the same bill following a general election.

While the Constitution nominally vests the King with the power to appoint the government, in practice the government must maintain the confidence of [[Storting|Parliament]]. The King appoints the leader of the parliamentary bloc with the majority as prime minister. When the parliamentary situation is unclear, the king relies on the advice of the [[President of the Storting|President of Parliament]] and the sitting prime minister. Unlike most monarchs, Harald does not have the power to dissolve Parliament; the Constitution does not allow snap elections.

The King meets with the Council of State at the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] every Friday. He also has weekly meetings with the Prime Minister and the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. He receives foreign envoys, and formally opens parliament every October delivering a [[speech from the throne]] during each opening. He travels extensively throughout Norway and makes official [[List of state visits made by King Harald V of Norway|state visits]] to other countries, as well as receiving and hosting guests.

In 1994, both the King and Crown Prince Haakon played roles during the opening ceremony of the [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer Olympics]]. The King opened the games, while the Crown Prince [[List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron|lit the cauldron]], paying tribute to both the King and his [[Olav V of Norway|grandfather]] as Olympians. The King has also represented Norway at opening ceremonies of Olympic Games, among them [[2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|Torino]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Beijing]]. However, he wasn't present in [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|Vancouver]]; the Crown Prince attended instead, with the King and Queen attending later in the games.

With his sailing crew he won World Championship bronze, silver and gold medals, in 1988, 1982 and 1987, respectively. In July 2005, the King and his crew aboard the royal sailboat ''Fram XV'' won the gold medal at the European Championships in Sweden. In the 2007 World Championship the King came in sixth place.<ref>[http://www.sb.no/article/20070818/NTBS/2098715440 Sandefjords Blad on the King's performance in the World Championship] {{in lang|no}} Retrieved 10 September 2007. {{Dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref>

Twice since the start of the twenty-first century King Harald was unable to perform his monarchical duties due to ill health: from December 2003 to mid-April 2004 due to urinary [[bladder cancer]], and from April to early June 2005 due to [[aortic stenosis]]. Crown Prince Haakon served as the country's [[regent]] on both occasions.

Until 2012, the King of Norway was, according to the constitution, the formal head of the [[Church of Norway]]. The constitutional amendment of 21 May 2012 made the King no longer the formal head, but he is still required to be of the Evangelical Lutheran religion.

On 8 May 2018, the King's [[Constitution of Norway|constitutional]] status as [[Sacred|holy]] was dissolved, while leaving his [[sovereign immunity]] intact.<ref>[[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] 2018. 'Fra tirsdag er ikke kongen lenger hellig'. ''[[Norsk Rikskringkasting|NRK]], 7 May. Retrieved on 8 May. https://www.nrk.no/norge/fra-tirsdag-er-ikke-kongen-lenger-hellig-1.14039929</ref>

===Patrilineal descent===

{{chart top|text-align=left|Patrilineal descent}}
Harald's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.

[[Patrilineal descent]] is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations – which means that if Harald V were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.
