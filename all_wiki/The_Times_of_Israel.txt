We're inviting those of our Arabic readers with something of value that they want to say to blog on our pages, respecting the parameters of legitimate debate, joining our marketplace of ideas."<ref name="From today"/> "[T]o avoid the kind of anonymous comments that can reduce discussion to toxic lows", comments on news articles and features in all of the site's editions can only be posted by readers identified through their [[Facebook]] profiles or equivalent.<ref name="From today"/>

Since 2016, ''The Times'' has hosted the websites of Jewish newspapers in several countries, known as "local partners". In March 2016, it began hosting New York's ''[[The Jewish Week]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/jewish-week-to-partner-with-times-of-israel/|title=Jewish Week To Partner With Times Of Israel|date=March 22, 2016}}</ref> It also hosts Britain's ''[[Jewish News]]'', the New Jersey ''[[Jewish Standard]]'', ''[[The Atlanta Jewish Times]]'', and ''[[The Jewish Chronicle of Pittsburgh]]''.<ref name="TurksHacked">{{cite news|url=https://www.jta.org/2017/11/02/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/times-of-israel-website-hacked-by-turkish-group|title=News Brief Times of Israel website hacked by Turkish group|date=2 November 2017|access-date=4 November 2017|publisher=JYA}}</ref><ref name="RosenbergTablet">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/248679/times-of-israel-hack-reveals-major-vulnerability-in-jewish-media-infrastructure-and-not-just-in-israel|title=Times of Israel Hack Reveals Major Vulnerability in Jewish Media Infrastructure—and Not Just in Israel|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Yair|date=3 November 2017|access-date=4 November 2017|magazine=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]}}</ref><ref name="The Jewish Week">{{cite news|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/jewish-week-to-partner-with-times-of-israel/|title=Jewish Week To Partner With Times Of Israel|date=22 March 2016|newspaper=The Jewish Week|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref> In October 2019, ''[[The Australian Jewish News]]'' became the seventh local partner.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/australian-jewish-news-becomes-times-of-israels-seventh-local-partner/|title=Australian Jewish News becomes Times of Israel’s seventh local partner|date=15 October 2019|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref>

On 2 November 2017, [[Hacker|hackers]] in [[Turkey]] took down the web site of ''The Times of Israel'' for three hours, replacing the homepage with anti-Israel propaganda.<ref name="RosenbergTablet"/> Responding to the attack, David Horovitz said: "We constantly work to improve security on the site, which is subjected to relentless attacks by hackers. How unfortunate, and how badly it reflects on them that the hackers seek to prevent people from reading responsible, independent journalism on Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish world."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/times-of-israel-hit-by-hack-attack/|title=Times of Israel hit by hack attack|last=TOI staff|date=2 November 2017|website=www.timesofisrael.com|access-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>

In 2020, [[Reuters]] reported that ''The Times of Israel'', along with ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Algemeiner]]'' and ''[[Arutz Sheva]]'', published op-eds sent to them by someone using a falsified identity.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-deepfake-activist-idUSKCN24G15E |title=Deepfake used to attack activist couple shows new disinformation frontier|date=15 July 2020 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date=26 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="JWeekly">{{cite web|url=https://www.jweekly.com/2020/07/17/news-outlets-covering-israel-found-again-to-have-run-fake-op-eds/ |title=News outlets covering Israel found, again, to have run fake op-eds|date=17 July 2020 |publisher=[[J. The Jewish News of Northern California]] |access-date=26 September 2020}}</ref> The op-eds were removed as soon as the problem was discovered. Opinion editor Miriam Herschlag said that she regretted the scam because it distorted the public discourse and might lead to "barriers that prevent new voices from being heard".<ref name="Reuters"/>

==Editorial orientation==
According to editor [[David Horovitz]], ''The Times of Israel'' is intended to be independent, without any political leanings."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/tycoons-turning-israeli-media-into-hasbara-tools-1.451335|title=Tycoons Turning Israeli Media into Hasbara Tools| work = [[Haaretz]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/israels-boom-in-media-outlets-is-a-sign-of-distrust-in-the-news/|title=More of the News That's Fit to Print!|first=Shmuel|last=Rosner|date=21 February 2012}}</ref> The paper's editorial board is composed of former ''[[Jerusalem Report]]'' editor Sharon Ashley, [[Irwin Cotler]], [[Efraim Halevy]], [[Saul Singer]], and [[Ehud Yaari]]. [[Yehuda Avner]] was a member of the editorial board until his death in March 2015.<ref name=AboutUs/> Horovitz said in 2012: "We are [[nonpartisan|independent]]; we're not attached or affiliated with any political party."<ref name="SoftspokenMan in Forward Feb-Mar 2012"/>

==Investigative journalism==
A series of investigative articles, starting with a March 2016 piece by Simona Weinglass titled "The wolves of Tel Aviv: Israel’s vast, amoral binary options scam exposed,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-wolves-of-tel-aviv-israels-vast-amoral-binary-options-scam-exposed/|title=The wolves of Tel Aviv: Israel’s vast, amoral binary options scam exposed|first=Simona|last=Weinglass|website=www.timesofisrael.com}}</ref> helped shed light on a multi-billion-dollar global scam in Israel. As a direct result of ''The Times of Israel''’s investigative reporting on the fraud, on 23 October 2017 the Israeli parliament, the [[Knesset]], unanimously passed a law banning Israel’s [[binary option]]s industry. The law gave binary options firms in Israel three months since the law was passed to cease operations. After that, anyone involved in binary options is punishable by up to two years in jail.

In a ''Times of Israel'' blog, Knesset member [[Karine Elharrar]] of [[Yesh Atid]] credited the paper for bringing the issue to the attention of Israeli lawmakers: "Over the past year ''The Times of Israel'' shone a spotlight on Israel’s ugly binary options industry. It was a case of investigative journalism at its best and ''The Times of Israel'' should be proud of its journalists and editors."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/defeating-binary-options-shows-the-system-can-work/|title=Defeating binary options shows the system can work|last=Elharrar|first=Karine|date=24 October 2017|website=Times of Israel|access-date=8 November 2017}}</ref>
