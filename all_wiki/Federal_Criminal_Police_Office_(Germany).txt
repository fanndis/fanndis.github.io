The '''Federal Criminal Police Office''' of Germany (in [[German language|German]]: ''{{Audio|De-Bundeskriminalamt.ogg|Bundeskriminalamt}}'', abbreviated ''{{Audio|De-BKA.ogg|BKA}}'') is the [[Federal republic|federal]] investigative [[police]] agency of [[Germany]], directly subordinated to the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17#Country_Profile_Section_213 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524060329/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17 |archive-date=2009-05-24 |title=Policing Profiles of Participating and Partner States: Germany |url-status=dead}}</ref> It is headquartered in [[Wiesbaden]], [[Hesse]], and maintains major branch offices in [[Berlin]] and [[Meckenheim (Rhineland)|Meckenheim]] near [[Bonn]]. It has been headed by [[Holger Münch]] since December 2014.

Primary jurisdiction of the agency includes coordinating cooperation between the federation and state police forces; investigating cases of [[organized crime|international organized crime]], [[terrorism]] and other cases related to [[national security]]; [[counterterrorism]]; the protection of members of the [[Constitution of Germany#Constitutional institutions|constitutional institutions]], and of federal witnesses. When requested by the respective state authorities or the federal minister of the interior, it also assumes responsibility for investigations in certain large-scale cases. Furthermore, the [[Attorney General of Germany]] can direct it to investigate cases of special public interest.<ref name="BKA_Law">{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bkag_1997/BJNR165010997.html|title=Law on the Federal Criminal Office and on the Cooperation of the Federation and the States in Criminal Police Matters, (German: Gesetz über das Bundeskriminalamt und die Zusammenarbeit des Bundes und der Länder in kriminalpolizeilichen Angelegenheiten)|access-date=2013-05-26|language=German|work=Federal Ministry of Justice website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817104357/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bkag_1997/BJNR165010997.html|archive-date=2014-08-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
The Federal Criminal Police Office was established in 1951, and Wiesbaden, in the State of Hesse, was designated as its seat.

The German police in general is – by definition of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] – organized at the level of the states of the federation (e.g. [[North Rhine-Westphalia Police]], [[Bavarian State Police]], [[Berlin Police]]). Exceptions are the [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]], the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and the [[German Parliament Police]]. Because of historic reasons all these federal police forces have a specific and limited legal jurisdiction. This is because after [[World War II]], it was decided that there should not be another all-powerful police force like the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (consisting of the [[Gestapo]], [[Sicherheitsdienst]], the [[Reichskriminalpolizeiamt]]).

==Missions==
The formation of the BKA is based on several articles of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]], which give the federal government the exclusive ability to pass laws on the coordination of criminal policing in Germany.

The jurisdictions of the BKA are defined in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180128120451/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bkag_1997/ Bundeskriminalamtgesetz] (BKAG): 
* Investigation and threat prevention in cases of national and international terrorism.
* Investigating the international trade with narcotics, arms, munitions, explosives and internationally organized money-laundering and counterfeiting.
* Investigating crimes when a state public prosecutor, a state police force or the state's interior minister, the federal public prosecutor or the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)]] task the BKA with a criminal investigation.
* Personal protection of the constitutional bodies of Germany and their foreign guests, e.g. the [[President of Germany]], [[Parliament of Germany]], [[Cabinet of Germany]], [[Federal Constitutional Court]] and other institutions), the BKA also investigates major crimes against these institutions.
* Protection of federal witnesses.
* Investigating crimes against critical infrastructures in Germany.
* Coordinating cooperation between the federal and state police forces (especially state criminal investigation authorities) and with foreign investigative authorities (in Germany the state police forces are mainly responsible for policing).
* Coordinating the cooperation with international law enforcement agencies like the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. The BKA is also the national central bureau for Europol and Interpol. Additionally, the BKA provides liaison officers for over 60 German embassies worldwide, who work with local law enforcement agencies.
* Collecting and analyzing criminal intelligence as a national crime office.
* Providing IT-Infrastructure for German law enforcement agencies, e.g. police databases {{Interlanguage link multi|INPOL|de}}, [[Schengen Information System]], [[Automated fingerprint identification|Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (AFIS), Anti-Terror-Database (ATD).
* Providing assistance to other national and international law enforcement agencies in forensic and criminological research matters.
* Acting as a [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] for identifying and cataloging images and information on victims of child [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]], similar to the [[National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]] in the [[United States]].<ref name="BKA_Law" />

== Organization ==

{{Prose|section|date=August 2018}}
Since its establishment in 1951, the BKA's number of staff has grown substantially. This has notably been driven by the fight against the left-wing terrorism in the 1970s and the internationalization of crime in the decades thererafter. Thus its structure has been undergoing constant reorganized. The last major reform was implemented in July 2016 and resulted in the structure described below.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/DE/DasBKA/OrganisationAufbau/Organigramm/organigramm_node.html|title=BKA – Organigramm|website=www.bka.de|language=de|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105042801/https://www.bka.de/DE/DasBKA/OrganisationAufbau/Organigramm/organigramm_node.html|archive-date=2019-01-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>

** The GTAZ was created in 2004 as a [[fusion center]] for 40 German law enforcement, intelligence and other public agencies who are tasked with combatting international jihadi terrorism. Its goal is to optimize and speed up communication between these agencies as a cooperation platform. The GTAZ is not an agency of its own. All participating agencies work under their own jurisdiction. It is located in [[Berlin]].
** All state police forces (16), state intelligence services (16), the Federal Criminal Police Office (through its Division ST), the uniformed [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]] (former border patrol), the [[Military Counterintelligence Service (Germany)|Military Counterintelligence Service]], the [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|Federal Intelligence Service]], the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]], the [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Public Prosecutor General]], the [[Zollkriminalamt|Customs Investigations Bureau]] and the [[Federal Office for Migration and Refugees]] are part of the GTAZ.
** The GTAZ has several working groups which focus on thread assessment, operational information exchange, case analysis, structural analysis and other topics.
* '''Joint Terrorism and Extremism Prevention Centre (GETZ)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/DE/UnsereAufgaben/Kooperationen/GETZ/getz_node.html|title=GETZ|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
** The GETZ is a similar fusion center established in 2012. It was structured after the model of and parallel to the GTAZ. It is located in [[Cologne]] and focuses on politically-motivated crime like right and left-wing extremism and terrorism, espionage, proliferation and international terrorism (not including jihadi terrorism). The GTAZ is not an agency of its own. All participating agencies work under their own jurisdiction.
** All state police forces (16), state intelligence services (16), the Federal Criminal Police Office (through its Division ST), the uniformed [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]] (former border patrol), the [[Military Counterintelligence Service (Germany)|Military Counterintelligence Service]], the [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|Federal Intelligence Service]], the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]], the [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Public Prosecutor General]], the [[Zollkriminalamt|Customs Investigations Bureau]] and the [[Federal Office for Migration and Refugees]] are part of the GTAZ.
** The GTAZ has several working groups which focus on thread assessment, operational information exchange and other topics.
* '''National Cyber Threat Prevention Centre (NCAZ)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/DE/UnsereAufgaben/Kooperationen/NCAZ/ncaz_node.html|title=NCAZ|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
** The NCAZ is a fusion center focusing on cyber threat, their assessment and possible countermeasures. Like the GTAZ it is just a platform and not an agency of its own. It has no own jurisdiction.
** The [[Federal Office for Information Security]], the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), the uniformed [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]] (former border patrol), the [[Military Counterintelligence Service (Germany)|Military Counterintelligence Service]], the [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|Federal Intelligence Service]] and the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] are part of the NCAZ.
* '''Joint Analysis and Strategy Centre Illegal Migration (GASIM)'''
** The GASIM is a federal information and communication center combatting illegal migration. It is administrated by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]] (former border patrol) and located at [[Potsdam]].
* '''Joint Financial Investigative Unit (GFG)'''
** The BKA Division SO has established a standing GFG (task force) with the [[Zollkriminalamt|Customs Investigations Bureau]] combatting financial crimes, especially [[money laundering]].
* '''Joint Internet Centre (GIZ)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/DE/UnsereAufgaben/Kooperationen/GIZ/giz_node.html|title=GIZ|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
** The GIZ is a cooperation platform for evaluating and analysing jihadi terrorist propaganda on websites and social media channels. It should bring together the professional and technical expertise of the participating agencies. It is administrated by the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]].
** The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), the [[Military Counterintelligence Service (Germany)|Military Counterintelligence Service]], the [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|Federal Intelligence Service]], the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] and the [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Public Prosecutor General]] are part of the GIZ. They all work under their own jurisdiction.
* '''Coordinated Internet Intelligence (KIA)'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/DE/UnsereAufgaben/Kooperationen/KIA/kia_node.html|title=KIA|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
** The KIA is another cooperation platform for evaluating and analysing extremist and terrorist internet propaganda. It was created in 2012 after the model of the GIZ. At first it brought together the professional and technical expertise of the participating agencies in the field of right-wing extremism. It was a direct reaction to the discovery of the [[National Socialist Underground murders|NSU murders]]. 
** Now and in contrast to the GIZ, KIA is divided into three platforms as further fields were added: KIA-R covers right-wing extremism and terrorism, KIA-L covers left-wing extremism and terrorism and KIA-A covers international politically-motivated crime (except jiadi terrorism).
** The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), the [[Military Counterintelligence Service (Germany)|Military Counterintelligence Service]] and the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] are part of the GIZ. They all work under their own jurisdiction.
For special cases the BKA creates task forces, which are called "Besondere Aufbauorganisation" (abbreviated: BAO). These task forces can integrate personnel from different divisions and state police forces as well. On some occasions international police forces participate too.

==Personnel==

=== General structure ===
[[File:Bundeskriminalamt Beschäftigte (Anzahl - rot) und Ausgaben (millionen Euro - schwarz) 1951-2016.png|alt=Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany) number of employees (red) and budget in million euro (black)|thumb|Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany) number of employees (red) and budget in million euro (black)]]The BKA currently employs more than 5,500 people. More than 2,600 are police officers of various ranks including upper management. Furthermore, the BKA has more than 600 civil servants (e.g. administrative or technical personnel). Another 2,000 employees work for the BKA as scientists (forensic and natural sciences) and academics (criminology and law enforcement research).

The BKA received more than 1,000 additional job positions in 2017 (which is not included in the above-mentioned 5,500).

=== Recruitment ===
The BKA recruits its personnel through different procedures: The civilian personnel (non civil servants, scientists, administrative personnel) is recruited similar to private companies.

Potential police officers are recruited in a longer process. They have to pass a written and oral exam (interview, group discussions, psychological test), a sport test (endurance, strength, reaction), a medical examination and security screening.

=== Police training ===
After the police officer applicants pass the mentioned exams, they study at the Federal University (Departmental Branch of the Federal Criminal Police) for three years at different locations. While studying (law, criminal proceedings, constitutional law, criminology, police tactics, ethics) they also receive traditional police training like martial arts (Krav Maga, Jiu Jiutsu, Judo), shooting, basic driving and crime scene investigation.

During their studies the police candidates complete an 8-month internship at a local state police office and an 8-month internship in several investigative, support and analysis units of the BKA.

=== Police ranks ===
[[File:Dima-rs1.jpg|thumb|Badge of a BKA police officer]]
The BKA has the same rank structure as the other police forces in Germany. As a criminal police branch, the different ranks are preceded by the description "Kriminal-". The uniformed police forces normally have the description "Polizei-" like "Polizeikommissar". The rank of police candidates or recruits is "Kriminalkommissaranwärter (KKA)". The entry level after finishing the three year studies is "Kriminalkommissar", meaning Detective Inspector. The criminal police ranks are divided into the "Gehobener Dienst" (upper service) and "Höherer Dienst" (higher service). The upper service is the investigative level of the BKA. The higher service could be described as the middle management of the BKA. To enter the higher service members of the upper service have to pass an additional exam. After passing the test and acception for the higher service, these recruits have to study an additional two years at police university in [[Münster]]. The higher service can also be entered by external, non-police personnel from selected academic fields.

=== Leadership ===
The BKA is headed by three top executives, a president (''Präsident des Bundeskriminalamtes'') and two vice-presidents (''Vizepräsidnet beim Bundeskriminalamt''), which in German BKA-lingo are referred to as ''"Amtsleitung"'', to be translated into 'management of the agency'.

The president of the BKA is a political civil servant, who is appointed by the [[President of Germany]] upon recommendation from the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Minister of the Interior]] and the cabinet. He or she can be provisionally retired by the federal president, as stipulated in §54 of the Law on Federal Civil Servants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bbg_2009/__54.html|title=§ 54 BBG - Einzelnorm|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de|accessdate=Oct 25, 2020}}</ref> The post is graded as B9 in the payscale for federal civil servants (which is the same as a lieutenant general or a vice admiral in the armed forces). 
His or her vice-presidents, who to this day have mostly been career officials from the ranks, are in the B6 paygrade.[https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bbesg/anlage_i.html Anlage I BBesG - Einzelnorm][[File:2013-09-14 BKA-Praesident Joerg Ziercke.jpg|thumb|Jörg Ziercke (2013)]]
