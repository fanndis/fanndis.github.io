{{Politics of New Zealand | expanded = Executive}}
The '''New Zealand Government''' ({{lang-mi|Te Kāwanatanga o Aotearoa}}) is the [[central government]] through which [[authority|governing authority]] is exercised in [[New Zealand]]. As in most [[parliamentary democracies]], the term "Government" refers chiefly to the [[executive branch]], and more specifically to the [[Ministry (collective executive)|collective ministry]] directing the executive.<ref>{{cite web|title=How government works|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/government-in-new-zealand/|website=New Zealand Government|accessdate=7 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415025335/https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/government-in-new-zealand/|archivedate=15 April 2017}}</ref> Based on the principle of [[responsible government]], it operates within the framework that "the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Queen]] reigns, but the government rules, so long as it has the support of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]".<ref name="cabinet_manual">Sir [[Kenneth Keith]], quoted in the [http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/cabinet/manual/intro.html Cabinet Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991009163331/http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/cabinet/manual/intro.html |date=9 October 1999 }}</ref> The ''[[Cabinet Manual (New Zealand)|Cabinet Manual]]'' describes the main laws, rules and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] affecting the conduct and operation of the Government.

Executive power is exercised by [[Ministers in the New Zealand Government|ministers]], all of whom are sworn into the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]] and accountable to the elected [[legislature]], the House of Representatives.<ref name="constitution act">{{cite web|title=Constitution Act 1986 No 114 (as at 17 May 2005), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0114/latest/whole.html#dlm94204|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate=7 December 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223071437/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0114/latest/whole.html#dlm94204|archivedate=23 December 2016}}</ref> Several senior ministers (usually 20) constitute a [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collective]] decision-making body known as the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], which is led by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] (currently [[Jacinda Ardern]]).<ref name="Dowding">{{cite book |last1=Dowding |first1=Keith |last2=Dumont |first2=Patrick |title=The Selection of Ministers around the World |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317634454 |pages=27–28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UStHBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|language=en}}</ref> A few more ministers (usually junior or supporting) are part of the Executive Council but are outside Cabinet. Most ministers have a [[wikt:portfolio|portfolio]] of specific responsibilities such as departments or [[public policy|policy]] areas, although ministers without portfolio can be appointed.

The position of prime minister belongs to the person who [[Motion of no confidence|commands the confidence]] of the majority of [[Member of parliament#New Zealand|members]] in the House of Representatives. The position is determined also by several other factors, such as support agreements between [[List of political parties in New Zealand|parties]] and internal leadership votes in the party that leads the Government. The prime minister and other ministers are formally appointed by the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]] (who is the Queen's representative in New Zealand).<ref name="constitution act" /> By convention, the governor-general acts on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the prime minister in appointing ministers.

==Terminology==
[[File:The Beehive in June 2012.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Beehive (New Zealand)|Beehive]], [[Wellington]], is the [[seat of government]] (the executive branch)]]

In New Zealand, the term ''Government'' can have a number of different meanings. At its widest, it can refer collectively to the three traditional branches of government—the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], [[Legislature|legislative branch]] (the [[Queen-in-Parliament]] and [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]) and [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] (the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts).<ref name="system_of_government">{{cite web|title=Our system of government|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/our-system-of-government/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=30 April 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308123708/https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/our-system-of-government/|archivedate=8 March 2017}}</ref> Each branch operates independently of the others in an arrangement described as "[[separation of powers]]".<ref name="glossary">{{cite web|title=Glossary of Constitutional Terms|url=http://www.ourconstitution.org.nz/Glossary|publisher=New Zealand Constitutional Advisory Panel|accessdate=1 May 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406042022/http://www.ourconstitution.org.nz/Glossary|archivedate=6 April 2017}}</ref>

==History==
New Zealand was granted [[self-governing colony|colonial self-government]] in 1853 following the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]], which was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Governments were set up at both central and [[Provinces of New Zealand|provincial]] level, with initially six provinces.<ref name="timeline">{{cite web|title=Political and constitutional timeline|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/milestones|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=1 May 2017|date=4 November 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408214941/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/milestones|archivedate=8 April 2017}}</ref> The provinces were abolished by the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876, during the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|premiership]] of [[Harry Atkinson]]. For the purposes of the Act, the provinces formally ceased to exist on 1 January 1877.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provinces 1848–77 |url= http://rulers.org/newzprov.html |publisher=rulers.org |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>

As per the [[constitutional convention (political custom)|conventional]] stipulations of [[constitutional monarchy]], the Queen and her representative rarely intervene directly in political affairs.<ref name="GG role"/> Just as the sovereign's choice of governor-general is on the prime minister's advice, the governor-general exercises the executive powers of state on the advice of ministers.<ref name="constitution act" /> For example, the governor-general's power to withhold the Royal Assent to [[Bill (law)|Bills]] has been rendered ineffective by convention.<ref name="Constitution" />

==Ministers==
{{Main|Ministers in the New Zealand Government}}

===Cabinet===
{{Main|Cabinet of New Zealand}}

Cabinet ({{lang-mi|Te Rūnanga}}) is the senior decision-making body of the Government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLeay|first1=Elizabeth|author-link=Elizabeth McLeay|title=The Cabinet and Political Power in New Zealand| volume=5|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195583120|page=11}}</ref><ref name="Cabinet1">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Eichbaum|first1=Chris|title=Cabinet government - What is cabinet?|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/cabinet-government/page-1|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=30 April 2017|language=en|date=20 June 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220070040/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/cabinet-government/page-1|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref> Constitutional law, such as the Constitution Act 1986, does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by constitutional convention.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Constitution of New Zealand: An Introduction to the Foundations of the Current Form of Government – Cabinet Manual|url=https://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/introduction|date=2008|accessdate=30 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406172343/https://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/introduction|archivedate=6 April 2017}}</ref> Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force.

The [[legislation|legislative agenda]] of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new parliamentary term, the governor-general gives [[Speech from the throne|an address]] prepared by the Cabinet that outlines the Government's policy and legislative proposals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speech from the Throne – Cabinet Manual|url=https://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/7.3|website=cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz|date=2008|accessdate=1 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407041930/https://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/7.3|archivedate=7 April 2017}}</ref>

===Ministers outside Cabinet===
A few other ministers serve outside of Cabinet. Since the introduction of MMP, governments have been formed following agreements between a major party and smaller support parties. Government ministers from the support parties are often ministers outside Cabinet.<ref name="Eichbaum"/> Non-Cabinet ministers may also be from the major governing party.<ref>{{cite news |title=The full list of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's new Cabinet |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300147743/the-full-list-of-prime-minister-jacinda-arderns-new-cabinet |access-date=4 December 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=2 November 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Ministers outside the Cabinet have the same overall duties and responsibilities as their senior colleagues inside Cabinet.<ref name="Cabinet1" /><ref name="Dowding"/>

==Relationship with local government==
{{Main|Local government in New Zealand}}
There are two main tiers of elected local authorities—[[regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] and [[territorial authorities]]—in some places merged into [[unitary authorities]]. While the [[central government]] deals with issues relevant to New Zealand and its people as a nation, local government exists "to enable democratic local decision-making and action by, and on behalf of, communities", and "to meet the current and future needs of communities for good-quality local infrastructure, local public services, and performance of regulatory functions in a way that is most cost-effective for households and businesses."<ref>{{cite web|title=Local Government Act 2002|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0084/latest/whole.html?search=sw_096be8ed8132e50b_50%2c000_25_se&p=1#DLM170873|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref>

==List of successive governments==
{{Main|List of New Zealand governments}}
There have been three distinctly different periods of New Zealand government—firstly, the period before responsible government; second, from 1856 to 1890, the period in which responsible government begins; and the third period starting with the formation of [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political parties]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Governments of New Zealand – The Grid – FInd Anything in New Zealand|url=http://thegrid.co.nz/list-of-governments-of-new-zealand/|website=The Grid|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=17 February 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512182102/http://thegrid.co.nz/list-of-governments-of-new-zealand/|archivedate=12 May 2018}}</ref>
