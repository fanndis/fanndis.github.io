The '''president-elect of the United States''' is the candidate who has won the [[United States presidential election]] and is awaiting [[inauguration]] to become the [[President of the United States|president]]. There is no explicit indication in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] when that person actually becomes president-elect.<ref name="prezelect" /> An unofficial term, ''president-elect'' has been used by the media for decades.

While [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] is held in early November, formal voting by the members of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] takes place in mid-December, and the [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]] (at which the  [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]] is taken) is then usually held on January 20.

[[Incumbent]] presidents who have won re-election for a second term are generally not referred to as presidents[[-elect]] as they are already in office and are not waiting to become president. Likewise, if a [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] succeeds to the presidency by way of the president's death, resignation, or removal, that person is not referred to as president-elect. On the other hand, an incumbent vice president who is elected president is referred to as president-elect.

==Presidential election law overview==
{{further|Electoral College|Electoral Count Act}}

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]], along with the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth]] and [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth]] Amendments directly address and govern the process for electing the nation's president. Presidential elections are further regulated by various [[Act of Congress|federal]] and [[State law (United States)|state]] laws.

Under the 1887 [[Electoral Count Act]], the presidential electors, the members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], the body that directly elects the president, must be "appointed, in each state, on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, in every fourth year". Thus, all states appoint their electors on the same date, in November, once every four years. However, the manner of appointment of the electors is determined by the law of each state, subject to the restrictions stipulated by the Constitution.

Currently, in every state, an [[Universal suffrage|election by the people]] is the method employed for the choice of the members of the Electoral College. The Constitution, however, does not specify any procedure that states must follow in choosing electors. A state could, for instance, prescribe that they be elected by the state legislature or even chosen by the state's governor. The latter was the norm in early presidential elections prior to the 1820s; no state has done so since the 1860s. Several states have [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact|enacted or proposed laws]] that would give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote regardless of the result of their statewide vote, but these laws will not come into force unless states with a majority of the electoral votes collectively enact such laws, which as of 2018 has yet to occur.

On the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, the electors of each state meet in their respective state capitals (and the electors of the District of Columbia meet in the federal capital), and in those meetings the electors cast their votes for president and vice president of the United States. At the conclusion of their meetings, the electors of each state and of the District of Columbia then execute a "certificate of vote" (in several original copies), declaring the vote count in each meeting. To each certificate of vote, a [[certificate of ascertainment]] is annexed. Each certificate of ascertainment is the official document (usually signed by the governor of the state and/or by the state's secretary of state) that declares the names of the electors, certifying their appointment as members of the Electoral College. Given that in all states the electors are currently chosen by popular vote, each certificate of ascertainment also declares the results of the popular vote that decided the appointment of the electors, although this information is not constitutionally required. The electors in each state and of the District of Columbia then send the certificates of vote, with the enclosed certificates of ascertainment, to the President of the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

The electoral votes are counted in a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] in early January (on January 6 as required by 3 U.S. Code, Chapter 1, or an alternative date set by statute), and if the ballots are accepted without objections, the presidential and vice-presidential candidates winning at least 270 electoral votes—a [[Supermajority#Majority of the fixed membership|majority of the total number]] of electoral votes—are certified as having won the election by the incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], in their capacity as president of the Senate. If no presidential candidate reaches the 270-vote threshold, the election for the president is decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in a run-off [[contingent election]]. Similarly, if no vice-presidential candidate reaches that threshold, the election for the vice president is decided by the Senate.<ref name=prezelect/>

===Electoral College role===
Although neither the Constitution nor any federal law requires electors to vote for the candidate who wins their state's popular vote, some states have enacted laws mandating that they vote for the state vote winner. In 2020, the constitutionality of these laws was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.<ref>''Chiafalo et al. v. Washington'', 591 U.S. ____ (July 6, 2020). https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/chiafalo-v-washington/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114173058/https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/chiafalo-v-washington/ |date=November 14, 2020 }}</ref> Historically, there have only been a few instances of "[[faithless elector]]s" casting their ballots for a candidate to whom they were not pledged, and such instances have never altered the final outcome of a presidential election.

According to legal experts, use of the title "president-elect" is often informal, indicating the candidate projected to win in the electoral college vote. However, the candidate does not officially become the president-elect until "after the General Services Administration initiates the transfer of power by 'ascertaining' the election results and Congress officially counts the electoral votes on Jan. 6."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/elections/2020/11/16/what-do-we-mean-when-we-call-joe-biden-the-president-elect-politifact|title=What do we mean when we call Joe Biden the president-elect?|author=Kim, Noah Y.|publisher=Tampa Bay Times/Politifact|date=16 November 2020|accessdate=18 November 2020}}</ref>

===Congressional reports===
Two congressional reports found that the president-elect is the eventual winner of the majority of electoral ballots cast in December. The [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) of the [[Library of Congress]], in its 2004 report "Presidential and Vice Presidential Succession: Overview and Current Legislation,"<ref>{{cite web |author=Thomas H. Neale |publisher=Congressional Research Service |title=Presidential and Vice Presidential Succession: Overview and Current Legislation |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31761.pdf |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114173057/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31761.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> discussed the question of when candidates who have received a majority of electoral votes become president-elect. The report notes that the constitutional status of the president-elect is disputed:{{quote|Some commentators doubt whether an official president- and vice president–elect exist prior to the electoral votes being counted and announced by Congress on January 6, maintaining that this is a problematic contingency lacking clear constitutional or statutory direction. Others assert that once a majority of electoral votes has been cast for one ticket, then the recipients of these votes become the president- and vice president–elect, notwithstanding the fact that the electoral votes are not counted and certified until the following January 6.}}

The CRS report quotes the 1933 U.S. House committee report accompanying the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] as endorsing the latter view:{{quote|It will be noted that the committee uses the term "president-elect" in its generally accepted sense, as meaning the person who has received the majority of electoral votes, or the person who has been chosen by the House of Representatives in the event that the election is thrown into the House. It is immaterial whether or not the votes have been counted, for the person becomes the president-elect as soon as the votes are cast.<ref>U.S. Congress, House, Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, report to accompany S.J. Res. 14, 72nd Cong., 1st sess., Rept. 345 (Washington, GPO:1932), p. 6.</ref>}}

===President-elect succession===
Scholars have noted that the national committees of the Democratic and Republican parties have adopted rules for selecting replacement candidates in the event of a nominee's death, either before or after the general election. If the apparent winner of the general election dies before the Electoral College votes in December the electors would likely be expected to endorse whatever new nominee their national party selects as a replacement. The rules of both major parties stipulate that if the apparent winner dies under such circumstances and his or her running mate is still able to assume the presidency, then the running mate is to become the President-elect with the electors being directed to vote for the former Vice Presidential nominee for President. The party's National Committee, in consultation with the new President-elect, would then select a replacement to receive the erstwhile Vice Presidential nominee's electoral votes for Vice President.

If the apparent winner dies between the College's December vote and its counting in Congress in January, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] stipulates that all electoral ballots cast shall be counted, presumably even those for a dead candidate. The U.S. House committee reporting on the proposed [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] said the "Congress would have 'no discretion' [and] 'would declare that the deceased candidate had received a majority of the votes.'"<ref name="Primer">{{cite book|last=Longley|first=Lawrence D.|author2=Neal R. Peirce|title=The Electoral College Primer 2000|url=https://archive.org/details/electoralcollege0000long|url-access=registration|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1999|page=130|isbn=0-300-08036-0}}</ref>

The Constitution did not originally include the term ''president-elect''. The term was introduced through the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], ratified in 1933, which contained a provision addressing the unavailability of the president-elect to take the oath of office on Inauguration Day.<ref name=prezelect/> Section 3 provides that if there is no president-elect on January 20, or the president-elect "fails to qualify", the vice president–elect would become [[Acting president of the United States|acting president]] on January 20 until there is a qualified president. The section also provides that if the president-elect dies before noon on January 20, the vice president–elect becomes president-elect. In cases where there is no president-elect or vice president–elect, the amendment also gives the Congress the authority to declare an acting president until such time as there is a president or vice president. At this point the [[Presidential Succession Act]] of 1947 would apply, with the office of the Presidency going to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], followed by the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]] and various Cabinet officers.<ref>{{cite web| title=Title 3—The President: Chapter 1—Presidential Elections and Vacancies| url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2017-title3/pdf/USCODE-2017-title3-chap1.pdf| year=2017| page=6| publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office| location=Washington, D.C.| access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref>

[[Horace Greeley]] is the only presidential candidate to win pledged electors in the general election and then die before the presidential inauguration; he secured 66 votes in 1872 and succumbed before the Electoral College met. Greeley had already clearly lost the election and most of his votes inconsequentially scattered to other candidates. 

The closest instance of there being no qualified person to take the presidential oath of office on Inauguration Day happened in 1877 when the disputed election between [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and [[Samuel J. Tilden]] was decided and certified in Hayes' favor just three days before the inauguration (then March 4). It might have been a possibility on several other occasions as well. In January 1853, President-elect [[Franklin Pierce]] survived a train accident that killed his 11-year-old son. Four years later, President-elect [[James Buchanan]] battled a serious [[National Hotel disease|illness contracted at the National Hotel]] in Washington, D.C., as he planned his inauguration. Additionally, on February 15, 1933, just 23 days after the Twentieth Amendment went into effect, President-elect [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] survived an assassination attempt in Miami, Florida. The amendment's provision moving inauguration day from March 4 to January 20, would not take effect until 1937, but its three provisions about a president-elect went into effect immediately.<ref name="prezelect" /> If the assassination attempt on Roosevelt had been successful then, pursuant to Section 3 of the amendment, Vice President–elect [[John Nance Garner]] would have been sworn in as president on Inauguration Day, and the vice presidency would have remained vacant for the entire 4-year term.

[[File:Biden transition logo.svg|200px|right|thumb|2020 logo used by the [[Presidential transition of Joe Biden|Biden transition team]]]]
Since the widespread adoption of the [[telegraph]] in the mid-19th century, the ''[[de facto]]'' president-elect has been known beyond a reasonable doubt, with only a few exceptions, within a few days (or even hours) of the polls closing on election day. As a result, incoming presidents gained valuable [[lead time|preparation time]] prior to assuming office.

Recent presidents-elect have assembled transition teams to prepare for a smooth transfer of power following the [[inauguration]]. Outgoing presidents have cooperated with the president-elect on important policy matters during the last two months of the president's term to ensure a smooth transition and continuity of operations that have significant national interests. Before the ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] in 1933, which moved the start of the presidential term to January, the president-elect did not assume office until March, four months after the popular election.

The president-elect and vice president–elect receive mandatory protection from the [[United States Secret Service]]. Since the 1968 [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]], major-party candidates also receive such protection during the election campaign.

==Vice president-elect==
[[File:Kamala Harris official photo (cropped2).jpg|thumb|upright=.95|[[Kamala Harris]] is the vice president–elect of the United States following the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election.]]]]
During the presidential transition period, the president-elect's [[running mate]] is known as the vice president–elect. 

If the vice president–elect dies or resigns ''before'' the meeting of the Electoral College in December, the national committee of the winning party would, in consultation with the president-elect, choose a replacement to receive the electoral votes of the vice presidential nominee in the same manner as would happen if the former vice presidential nominee had become president-elect due to the death of the apparent winner. Assuming the requisite number the electors agreed to vote for the replacement candidate, that person would then become the vice president–elect. If such a vacancy were to occur ''after'' the electoral votes had been cast in the states, most authorities maintain that no replacement would be chosen and the new president (after taking office) would nominate a vice president, per the provisions of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf|title=Presidential Elections in the United States: A Primer|last1=Coleman|first1=Kevin J.|last2=Cantor|first2=Joseph E.|last3=Neale|first3=Thomas H.|work=CRS Report for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service - Library of Congress|date=April 17, 2000|page=48|access-date=December 24, 2016|archive-date=March 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331071418/http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL30527.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Before [[ratification]] of the 25th Amendment in 1967, the Constitution contained no provision for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency. As a result, when one occurred (and did 16 times), the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing election and inauguration. Since 1967, the vice presidency has been vacant twice, and a successor was nominated each time to fill the vacancy in accordance with the 25th Amendment. The first instance was in 1973 when [[Gerald Ford]] was nominated by President [[Richard Nixon]] to succeed [[Spiro Agnew]], who had resigned. The second came in 1974, when Ford, who had succeeded to the presidency following Nixon's resignation, nominated [[Nelson Rockefeller]] to succeed him.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Profile of Vice President-Designate Gerald Ford |series=[[NBC Nightly News]] |date=October 13, 1973 |network=[[NBC]] |last1=Nessen, |first1=Ron (Reporter) |author-link1=Ron Nessen |last2=Jamieson |first2=Bob (Reporter) |author-link2=Bob Jamieson |last3=Brokaw |first3=Tom (Anchor) |author-link3=Tom Brokaw |url=http://www.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=34470 |access-date=December 22, 2016 |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114173117/https://www.youtube.com/nbclearn |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fordlibrarymuseum.tumblr.com/post/95281417942/nelson-rockefeller-vice-president-designate|title=Nelson Rockefeller, Vice President-Designate|publisher=Gerald R.
