'''Home Box Office''' ('''HBO''') is an American [[pay television]] [[television network|network]] owned by [[WarnerMedia|WarnerMedia Studios & Networks]] and the flagship property of parent subsidiary [[Home Box Office, Inc.]] Maintaining a [[generalist channel|general entertainment]] format, programming featured on the network consists primarily of [[Art release#Film|theatrically released]] [[feature film|motion pictures]] and [[Original programming|original]] [[television program]]s as well as [[television film|made-for-cable movies]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and occasional [[Stand-up comedy|comedy]] and [[concert]] [[television special|specials]].

HBO—also the oldest and longest continuously operating subscription television service (basic or [[A la carte pay television|a la carte premium]]) in the United States—pioneered modern pay television upon its launch on November 8, 1972: it was the first television service to be directly transmitted and distributed to individual [[cable television]] systems, and was the conceptual blueprint for the "premium channel," pay television services sold to subscribers for an extra monthly fee that do not accept [[television advertisement|traditional advertising]] and present their programming without [[expurgation|editing for objectionable material]]. It eventually became the first television channel in the world to begin transmitting via [[communications satellite|satellite]]—expanding the growing regional pay service into a national television network—in September 1975, and, alongside sister channel [[Cinemax]], was among the first two American pay television services to offer complimentary [[Multiplex (television)|multiplexed channels]] in August 1991.

The network operates seven 24-hour, linear multiplex channels as well as a traditional subscription [[video on demand]] platform (HBO On Demand) and an [[HBO Now|eponymous]] [[streaming media|streaming service]] (which launched as HBO Now in April 2015, and has over five&nbsp;million subscribers in the United States {{as of|2018|February|lc=y|df=}}),<ref name="bloombergfeb2018">{{cite news|title=HBO's Online Channel Surpasses 5 Million U.S. Subscribers|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/hbo-s-channel-for-cord-cutters-surpasses-5-million-subscribers|author=Jerry Smith|website=[[Bloomberg News]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg, L.P.]]|date=February 1, 2018|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> and its content is the centerpiece of [[HBO Max]], an expanded streaming platform operated separately from but sharing management with Home Box Office, Inc., which also includes original programming produced exclusively for the service and content from other WarnerMedia properties. The HBO linear channels are not presently accessible on either streaming service, but continue to be available to existing subscribers of traditional and virtual pay television providers, and as live streams to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and [[Roku]] customers through streaming partnerships with those companies.

The overall HBO business unit—based at WarnerMedia's corporate headquarters inside [[30 Hudson Yards]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] district—is one of WarnerMedia's most profitable assets (after [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]]), generating operating income of nearly $2&nbsp;billion each year as of 2017.<ref name=BusinessWire2017>{{cite web|title=Time Warner Inc.

==Overview==
{{As of|2018|September|}}, HBO's programming was available to approximately 35.656&nbsp;million U.S. households that had a subscription to a [[multichannel video programming distributor|multichannel television provider]] (34.939&nbsp;million of which receive HBO's primary channel at minimum),<ref name="Cable Subs">{{cite web|title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN (Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: September 2018)|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|author=Andrew Bucholtz|website=Awful Announcing|publisher=[[NESN|NESN Digital]]|date=September 10, 2018|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> giving it the largest subscriber total of any American premium channel. (From 2006 to 2018, this distinction was held by [[Starz Encore]]—currently owned by [[Lionsgate]] subsidiary [[Starz Inc.]]—which, according to February 2015 [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] estimates, had 40.54&nbsp;million pay subscribers vs. the 35.8&nbsp;million subscribers that HBO had at the time.)<ref>{{cite web|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of July 2015|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/21/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-july-2015/434373/|author=Robert Seidman|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=July 21, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724162303/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/21/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-july-2015/434373/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Company Overview|url=http://starz.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18|publisher=[[Starz Inc.]]|date=December 31, 2014|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> In addition to its U.S. subscriber base, HBO distributes its programming content in at least 151 countries worldwide to, {{as of|2018|lc=y||df=}}, an estimated 140&nbsp;million cumulative subscribers.<ref name="Time Warner">{{cite web|title=HBO: Home Box Office|url=http://www.timewarner.com/our-content/home-box-office/|website=[[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name=":0">AT&T 10-K for 2018</ref>

HBO subscribers through wireline, satellite and virtual pay television providers generally pay for the network as an [[a la carte pay television|a la carte]] service—though its seven-channel multiplex is usually priced as a single package—atop a basic programming tier that includes other cable- and satellite-originated channels. However, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requires cable providers to allow subscribers to just purchase "limited" basic cable (a base service tier including local, and in some areas, out-of-market [[terrestrial television|broadcast stations]] and [[public, educational, and government access]] channels) and premium services such as HBO without necessitating that customers subscribe to expanded service. ([[Comcast]]—which offered HBO as part of a [[Product bundling|bundled]] package of limited basic cable and Internet service from October 2013 until, depending on the market, July 2014 or January 2015—is the only major provider to have actively sold the network's multiplex tier under the regulation's exact structure.)<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC Consumer Facts|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/cablechannels.html|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cable Subscribers Need Not Order Expanded Packages to Get Premium Channels|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-94845278.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211729/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-94845278.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 11, 2011|agency=[[Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=December 1, 2002|accessdate=February 23, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Comcast Offers HBO Without Other Cable Channels in Bundle Aimed at Cord-Cutters and Cord-Nevers|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/comcast-becomes-first-pay-tv-distributor-to-offer-hbo-without-basic-cable-1200761863/|author=Todd Spangler|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> As a consequence of the primary HBO channel (as well as HBO2 and/or HBO Signature, depending on their local availability as add-ons to their basic service) being migrated to [[digital cable|digital]] packages on most systems during the early-to-mid 2000s, cable providers typically require the use of a digital [[Cable converter box|set-top converter box]], [[CableCARD]] or [[QAM (television)#QAM tuner|QAM tuner]] in order to receive HBO. (When offered on analog cable tiers, HBO subscribers had the option of receiving it through [[cable-ready]] tuners that were built into analog television sets.)

HBO also provides its content via [[over-the-top media services|direct-to-consumer]] web and [[mobile app|mobile]] platforms sold independently of an existing subscription to the linear HBO channel tier: through Home Box Office, Inc., it maintains [[HBO Now|HBO]], a [[video on demand|subscription video on demand]] (SVOD) streaming service that was launched as HBO Now in April 2015, and is available for Roku devices as well as select cable providers that continue to maintain agreements for the provider-default HBO streaming app.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Doesn't HBO Allow Non-Cable Subscribers To Subscribe To HBO Go à la Hulu?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/09/05/why-doesnt-hbo-allow-non-cable-subscribers-to-subscribe-to-hbo-go-a-la-hulu/|author=Jonathan Sherman-Presser|periodical=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Inc.|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name="gigaom-hbonow">{{cite web|title=HBO officially announces April launch of HBO Now at Apple event|url=https://gigaom.com/2015/03/09/hbo-officially-announces-launch-of-hbo-now-at-apple-event/|author=Janko Roettgers|website=[[Gigaom]]|date=March 9, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2020}}</ref> A secondary, co-branded streaming service, [[HBO Max]], launched on May 27, 2020 and operated under a sister subsidiary of the same name, is available on most digital platforms (notably excluding Roku devices) and to linear HBO subscribers of participating television providers. Both services provide an extensive library of HBO original programs (including current and past series, made-for-TV films, documentaries and specials), and theatrical movies from sister studio [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and other studios that distribute film content to the linear HBO television service; HBO Max, however, augments HBO linear content with a proprietary slate of original programming developed by in-house production unit WarnerMax, and library content sourced from other WarnerMedia units—including its broadcast and basic cable networks (primarily [[The CW]], [[CNN]], [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] and [[Cartoon Network]]/[[Adult Swim]]) and [[Warner Bros.

(Live feeds provided on the Apple and Roku services are solely of the primary HBO channel's [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] feeds; the Amazon service provides both the primary East and West feeds and the East Coast feeds of HBO's six thematic multiplex channels.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple unveils streaming TV services|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/apple-tv-channels-streaming-tv-service-announced.html|author=Todd Haselton|website=[[CNBC]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal Television Group#NBCUniversal News Group|NBCUniversal News Group]]|date=March 25, 2019|accessdate=March 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon Prime Video Channels: Everything you need to know|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-prime-video-channels-everything-you-need-to-know/|author=David Katzmaier|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=May 23, 2019|accessdate=May 9, 2020}}</ref> A [[TV Everywhere]] service, [[HBO Go]], was launched in February 2010 for subscribers of the linear television service; since HBO Go was relegated from wide distribution in July 2020, it has been available as a default service for providers that do not have agreements to offer HBO Max, which replaced HBO Go as the network's companion streaming platform on most pay television providers.

Home Box Office, Inc. maintains a marketing unit, HBO Bulk (originally HBO Direct from 1986 to 2007), which handles sales of HBO and [[Cinemax]]'s respective linear channel packages and streaming platforms as well as associated consumer marketing materials to hotels, apartments and dormitories. HBO has maintained near-ubiquitous distribution in [[hotel]]s and [[motel]]s across the United States through agreements with [[DirecTV]], [[Echostar]], [[SONIFI Solutions]], Satellite Management Services, Inc., [[Itochu|Telerent Leasing Corporation]], Total Media Concepts and World Cinema as well as cable providers that maintain hospitality service arrangements with individual hotels and local franchisees of national hotel/motel chains. (HBO Bulk licenses the network's logo to hotel coupon guide publishers, which, in most instances, use the [[wordmark|lettermark]] instead of text-only references in amenities summaries.) Although Home Box Office, Inc. does not keep counts of its national hotel distribution, content and connectivity solutions company LodgeNet (now SONIFI Solutions) estimated in 2008 that HBO was available to 98% of all hotels for which the company distributes cable or satellite service. Since June 2018, through a content partnership with Enseo, HBO Go is distributed to some [[Marriott International]] hotels around the U.S.; guests staying in Marriott hotels that have access to HBO Go on connected in-room TV sets are not required to sign into the system in order to access content.<ref>{{cite news|title=In a Hotel Deal, Showtime Fights HBO's Dominance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/business/media/18showtime.html|author=Brian Stelter|author-link=Brian Stelter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|issn=0362-4331|date=February 18, 2008|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Checks In With Marriott Deal|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/hbo-checks-marriott-deal|author=Jeff Baumgartner|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=June 18, 2018|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO GO is Now FREE At Hundreds of Hotels|url=https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/hbo-go-is-now-free-at-hundreds-of-hotels/|author=Luke Bouma|website=Cord Cutters News|date=April 19, 2018|accessdate=July 14, 2018}}</ref> HBO began service tests at around one dozen hotels beginning in 1978; it began authorizing cable affiliates to provide the service to local hotels and motels in April 1978, and signed its first wide hospitality distribution deal with [[Holiday Inn]] in July 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=Four-way venture aims at pay TV link-up for hotels, motels|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-04-24-BC-OCR-Page-0041.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=41|date=April 24, 1978|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=Four-way venture aims at pay TV link-up for hotels, motels|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-04-24-BC-OCR-Page-0083.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=44|date=April 24, 1978|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hooking up Holiday Inns|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/79-OCR/BC-1979-07-09-OCR-Page-0044.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=50|date=July 9, 1979|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref>

Many HBO programs have been [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to broadcast and ad-supported pay television services (usually with edits for running time and/or objectionable content that indecency regulations enforced by jurisdictional telecommunications agencies or self-imposed by network [[Standards and Practices]] departments may prohibit from being broadcast terrestrially or through ad-supported cable networks), and have been released on DVD and predecessor home video formats. Since HBO's more successful series (including among others ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and ''[[True Blood]]'') have been shown on terrestrial broadcasters in other countries (such as in [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and much of [[Europe]]—including the United Kingdom), HBO's programming has the potential of being exposed to a higher percentage of the population in foreign nations in comparison to the United States. Because of the cost of HBO (which is the most expensive of the U.S. premium services, costing a monthly fee {{as of|2015|lc=y}} between $15 and $20, depending on the provider and packaging with sister network Cinemax), many Americans only view HBO programs through DVDs or in basic cable or broadcast syndication—months or even years after these programs have first aired on the network—and with editing for both content and to allow advertising, although several series have filmed alternate "clean" scenes intended for syndication runs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable show producers shoot tamer versions.

{{For|a detailed history of the network|History of HBO}}

===Development and early expansion as a regional service (1971–1975)===
Cable television executive [[Charles Dolan]]—through his company, Sterling Information Services—founded Manhattan Cable TV Services  (renamed Sterling Manhattan Cable Television in January 1971), a cable system franchise serving the [[Lower Manhattan]] section of New York City (covering an area extending southward from [[79th Street (Manhattan)|79th Street]] on the [[Upper East Side]] to [[86th Street (Manhattan)|86th Street]] on the Upper West Side), which began limited service in September 1966.

With external expenses resulting in consistent financial losses, in the summer of 1971, while on a family vacation to [[France]] aboard the [[Queen Elizabeth 2]], a desperate Dolan—wanting to help Sterling Manhattan turn profitable and to prevent [[Time Life|Time-Life, Inc.]] (then the book publishing unit of [[Time Inc.]]) from pulling its investment in the system—developed a proposal for a cable-originated television channel. [[Code name#Project code name|Codenamed]] "'''The Green Channel'''", the conceptual subscription service would offer unedited theatrical movies licensed from the [[major film studio|major Hollywood film studios]] and live sporting events, all presented without interruptions by [[television advertisement|advertising]] and sold for a flat monthly fee to prospective subscribers. Dolan wanted to offset the service's start-up costs by having Sterling enter into carriage agreements with other cable television providers to transmit and sell the service to their customers, and draw revenue from fees charged to subscribers who added the channel onto their existing cable service (which then consisted exclusively of local and imported broadcast stations). Dolan later presented his idea to management at Time-Life, who, despite the potential benefit to the company's cable assets, were initially hesitant to consider the "Green Channel" proposal. Although attempts to launch pay television services dating to 1951 experienced minimal success, because of campaigns backed by movie theater chains and commercial broadcasters to convince television viewers that pay television would threaten the viability of the movie industry and free-to-air television access, limited user interest, and FCC restrictions on the types of programming offered to subscription services, Dolan managed to persuade Time-Life to assist him in backing the project. On September 10, 1971, the FCC gave preemptive authorization to Time-Life and Sterling Manhattan Cable to begin a pay television operation.<ref>{{cite news|title=F.C.C.

Time-Life and Sterling Communications soon proposed for the "'''Sterling Cable Network'''" to be the name of the new service. Discussions to change the service's name took place during a later meeting of Dolan and the executive staff he hired to assist in developing the project, who ultimately settled on calling it "'''[[Home|<u>H</u>ome]] [[Box office|<u>B</u>ox <u>O</u>ffice]]'''", which was meant to convey to potential customers that the service would be their "[[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]" to movies and events that they could see in their own home. The moniker was intended as a [[working title|placeholder name]] in order to meet deadlines to publish a memorandum and research brochures about the new service; management intended to come up with a permanent name as development continued, however, the "Home Box Office" name stuck.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profile: A young Philadelphian puts a big circle around Sept. 30 on HBO's calendar|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-09-08-BC-OCR-Page-0073.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=73|date=September 8, 1975|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Green Channel"/>

Multiple obstacles had to be overcome to get the service on the air. Because of a pay-television franchise agreement provision by the New York City Council that prohibited Sterling Manhattan and other local cable franchises from telecasting theatrical feature films directly to their customers, Dolan chose to scout another city with two competitive cable franchisees to serve as Home Box Office's inaugural distributor. Originally, he settled on the Teleservice Cable (now [[Service Electric]]) system in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]. However, management found out that the [[Allentown metropolitan area|city and its vicinity]] fell within the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]'s {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Blackout (broadcasting)|television blackout radius]], which the team enforced to protect ticket sales. Since HBO was planning to carry [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) regular-season and playoff games, any 76ers games that the service aired would have been prohibited from being shown within Allentown. Time-Life subsequently agreed to an offer by Teleservice president [[John Walson]] to launch HBO on the company's [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] system (located outside of the 76ers' blackout radius), fed from an [[AT&T]] microwave link at the [[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] in New York. (HBO, which elected to forego pursuing telecast rights to 76ers basketball games, would sign on to Teleservice's Allentown system as its second cable affiliate in February 1973.)<ref name="Green Channel"/><ref name="psu-hbo"/><ref name="b&c-paytvsurvey">{{cite web|title=Pay cable says it will pay in Pennsylvania|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/73-OCR/1973-02-12-BC-OCR-Page-0064.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=68|date=February 12, 1973|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=Pay cable says it will pay in Pennsylvania|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/73-OCR/1973-02-12-BC-OCR-Page-0065.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=69|date=February 12, 1973|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref>

HBO's launch came with very little fanfare in the press; other than print advertisements promoting the launch in the ''[[Times Leader|Wilkes-Barre Times Leader]]'', the service's debut lacked coverage from local or national media outlets. The [[city manager|city administrator]] of Wilkes-Barre declined an offer to attend the launch ceremony, while Time Inc. vice president J. Richard Munro became stranded in traffic on the [[George Washington Bridge]] en route from [[Manhattan]], and was not able to arrive in Wilkes-Barre for the ceremony. Further complicating preparations for the inaugural telecast, in [[Midtown Manhattan]], strong winds—produced by a [[storm system]] that brought areas of [[freezing rain]] over portions of the New York City area that evening—toppled the Pan Am Building reception dish being used to relay the Home Box Office signal to microwave towers linked to Teleservice's Wilkes-Barre headend. Time-Life representatives sent a technician to repair the antenna in time for the service's launch, completing maintenance about 25 minutes before the initial telecast.<ref name="Satellite">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Skies, Junior Birdmen!|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-skies-junior-birdmen/|author=Bill Mesce|publisher=Sound on Sight|date=August 17, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name="cablefax-hbo">{{cite web|title=It Takes a Village—Recounting HBO's Early Days|url=https://www.cablefax.com/programming/it-takes-a-village-mdash-recounting-hbo-rsquo-s-early-days|author=Larry Satkowiak|website=Cablefax|publisher=Access Intelligence LLC|date=October 5, 2012|accessdate=June 26, 2020}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite magazine|title=HBO Soundtrack: Home Box Office 5 Years|url=http://hboguides.com/guides/1977/1977-11.html|periodical=HBO on Air|publisher=Home Box Office, Inc.|via=The HBO Guide Archive|date=November 1977|accessdate=June 28, 2020|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602095411/http://hboguides.com/guides/1977/1977-11.html|archivedate=June 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Forsyth 2002">{{cite web|title=Delta, Satcom, and the Cable Boom|url=http://kevinforsyth.net/delta/satcom.htm|author=Kevin S.

On February 28, 1973, Sterling Communications announced it would spin-out HBO and associated assets into a new subsidiary, [[Home Box Office, Inc.]] Time Inc.'s controlling shares in HBO expanded to around 75% equity and Time committed a $3-million direct investment in the subsidiary. Sterling also purchased additional stock and a converted $6.4-million [[Convertible bond|note]] obligation to raise Time's equity in the company to 66.4% in exchange for the added HBO stake. Dolan—who reportedly had major disagreements with Time-Life management on policy issues, claims which the company denied—subsequently resigned as [[chief executive officer]] of Sterling Communications and HBO, accepting a $675,000 buyout of a portion of his stock while remaining on the [[board of directors]] at both companies in the interim; Dolan used portions of the sale's proceeds to repurchase Time's share of the Sterling Nassau systems and to start the Long Island Cable Community Development Co. (the forerunner to [[Cablevision|Cablevision Systems Corporation]], which would be combined with the Sterling/Cablevision systems on Long Island) as the system's parent company. [[Gerald M.

As Home Box Office's distribution expanded throughout the northern [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic United States]], Time/Sterling established a network of microwave receivers and connecting cables on utility landlines to feed HBO's programming from the New York relay antenna to the service's participating cable systems. Although HBO's base was steadily growing, Sterling Manhattan Cable's deficits continued because its subscriber base—totaling 20,000 customers—was still relatively small to generate revenue; HBO also faced financial issues, losing nearly $9,000 per month in part due to microwave link maintenance fees it paid to AT&T (averaging $11,000) that it could not make up for from the monthly fees—amounting to a share of $3.50 out of the $6.50 monthly fee paid by subscribers (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|6.5|fmt=eq|r=2|1972}} adjusted for [[inflation]]<ref name="usbs">As calculated by the US Bureau of Statistics' [http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl CPI Inflation Calculator]</ref>)—collected from its subscribers.<ref name="ap-hboat20"/><ref name="cablefax-hbo"/> In November 1974, HBO—then available to cable television and multipoint distribution systems (MDS) in Pennsylvania, New York State, New Jersey and [[Delaware]]—had reached around 40,000 subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Brief|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/74-OCR/1974-11-25-BC-OCR-Page-0006.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=8|date=November 8, 1974|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref> By April 1975, the service had around 100,000 subscribers within its four-state service area.<ref name="Satellite"/>

===National expansion, innovation and rise to prominence (1975–1993)===
On April 11, 1975, Levin and Time-Life unveiled plans to begin distributing the HBO signal via geostationary [[communications satellite]] and feed it directly to cable providers throughout the United States. Although television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about venturing into satellite transmissions because of concerns that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or jettison out of their orbit as well as the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes (which in 1974, were sold for as much as $75,000 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|75,000|fmt=eq|r=2|1974}} adjusted for inflation<ref name="usbs"/>), among the limited options available, HBO found satellite technology to be the only efficient method to expand it into a national pay television service, as developing a vast infrastructure of microwave and coaxial telephone relay towers in all 50 states and U.S. territories—including maintaining HBO's existing microwave network—would have been cost-prohibitive for Time/HBO due to limitations by time, expense and geography. The company announced a $7.5-million agreement with [[SES Americom|RCA Americom Communications]] to lease a [[Transponder#Satellite/broadcast communications|transponder]] on the then-under construction [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom I]]—which was expected to be launched at the end of 1975—for a five-year term. In addition, cable television equipment manufacturer [[Scientific Atlanta]]—per a proposal by company president Sid Topol—agreed to build [[ground station|earth-based satellite relay stations]] to beam the signal to and from HBO's Manhattan headquarters and client cable systems. HBO also signed an agreement to distribute the satellite feed on eight [[UA-Columbia Cablevision]] systems in [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], and have earth station receivers built at their headends to intercept and relay the signal.<ref name="Satellite"/><ref name="HBO 70s"/><ref name="b&c-hbomfl">{{cite web|title=Cablecastings: More for less|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-08-25-BC-OCR-Page-0058.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=60|date=August 25, 1975|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NATIONAL PAY TV PLANNED FOR 1976|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/15/archives/national-pay-tv-planned-for-1976-fcc-approval-is-sought-by-three.html|author=Les Brown|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 15, 1975|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top of the Week: Satellite networking of pay cable in works|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-04-14-BC-OCR-Page-0011.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=11|date=April 14, 1975|accessdate=June 28, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=Top of the Week: Satellite networking of pay cable in works|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-04-14-BC-OCR-Page-0012.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=12|date=April 14, 1975|accessdate=June 28, 2020}}</ref><ref name="b&c-levinstep">{{cite web|title=Mr. Levin's giant step for pay TV;

On March 4, 1989, Warner Communications—which, ironically, was part-owner of rival pay-cable service The Movie Channel from 1973 until [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]]'s sale of it and sister pay service Showtime to majority partner [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom]] in 1986—announced its intent to merge with HBO parent Time Inc. for $14.9&nbsp;billion in cash and stock. Following two failed attempts by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Paramount Communications]] to legally block the merger, as Paramount was seeking to acquire Time in a [[takeover|hostile takeover bid]], the merger was completed on January 10, 1990, resulting in the consolidated entity creating Time Warner (now known as WarnerMedia), which {{as of|2020|lc=on}}, remains the parent company of the network. (Manhattan Cable Television would be integrated into [[Time Warner Cable]], formed through a consolidation of the cable system assets of Time-owned American Television and Communications [ATC] and Warner Cable Communications; its successor entity, Time Warner Cable, would be spun-off by Time Warner as an independent company in 2009, and was later merged into [[Charter Communications]] in May 2016.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Time Inc. and Warner to Merge, Creating Largest Media Company|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/us/time-inc-and-warner-to-merge-creating-largest-media-company.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=March 5, 1989|accessdate=May 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Time Inc. + Warner Communications: Media giants strike merger deal|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/89-OCR/BC-1989-03-13-OCR-Page-0026.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=26|date=March 13, 1989|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=Time Inc. + Warner Communications: Media giants strike merger deal|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/89-OCR/BC-1989-03-13-OCR-Page-0027.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=27|date=March 13, 1989|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=Time Inc. + Warner Communications: Media giants strike merger deal|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/89-OCR/BC-1989-03-13-OCR-Page-0028.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=28|date=March 13, 1989|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Time Inc. gets more deeply into cable|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-01-02-BC-OCR-Page-0059.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=59|date=January 2, 1978|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Time Inc. – Our History|url=http://www.timeinc.com/aboutus/history.php|accessdate=October 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019121509/http://www.timeinc.com/aboutus/history.php|archivedate=October 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Charter Communications completes purchase of Time Warner Cable|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twc-m-a-idUSKCN0Y92BR|work=Reuters|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=June 5, 2019}}</ref> By the start of 1990, HBO served 17.3&nbsp;million subscribers out of a cumulative 23.7&nbsp;million subscribers covered between it and sister network Cinemax.<ref>{{cite web|title=Growth Slows for Pay Cable Services|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-11-26-OCR-Page-0042.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=144|date=November 26, 1990|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

===Rising prominence of original programming (1993–2016)===
During the 1990s, HBO began developing a reputation for high-quality and irreverent original programming; it was throughout this decade that the network experienced increasing success among audiences and acclaim from television critics for original series such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'', ''[[Tracey Takes On...]]'', ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'', and ''[[Arliss (TV series)|Arliss]]''. One of the scripted comedy programs that premiered early in the decade, ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', arguably became HBO's flagship series of the 1990s; the show enjoyed a cult status and critical acclaim, and received multiple nominations and wins for many major television awards, including three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, three [[Golden Globe Award]]s and two [[Peabody Award]]s.<ref name="imdbawards">{{cite web|title=Awards for 'The Larry Sanders Show'|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103466/awards|website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]]|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}</ref> The original programs that HBO has developed since the early 1990s have earned the channel numerous Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations and wins.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emmy Award Database|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}} {{Failed verification|date=December 2013}}</ref> HBO has been nominated in at least one category at the Emmys and Golden Globes since [[40th Primetime Emmy Awards|1988]] (when the network earned its first Emmy nomination for [[Danny Glover]]'s performance as [[Nelson Mandela]] in the 1987 original movie ''[[Mandela (1987 film)|Mandela]]''), and set a record for the most Primetime Emmy nominations for a television network in a single year (137) in [[2019 Primetime Emmy Awards|2019]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Sets New Single Season Emmy Nom Record With 137 & Beats Netflix|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/hbo-netflix-emmy-nomination-records-1202646946/|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=July 16, 2019|accessdate=May 12, 2020}}</ref>

In July 1997, HBO premiered its first one-hour dramatic narrative series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. While ''Oz'' was critically acclaimed throughout its six-season run, it was not until ''[[The Sopranos]]'' premiered in January 1999 that the network achieved widespread critical success with an hour-long drama series. ''The Sopranos'' received 111 Emmy nominations and 21 wins over the course of its six-season run, including two honors for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]]. The mob drama's first wins for Outstanding Drama and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] (for [[Drea de Matteo]]) in [[56th Primetime Emmy Awards|2004]], two of the four Emmys it won that year, marked the first time that a cable program won in either category over a program on one of the major broadcast networks. 1998 saw the debut of ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', costing $68&nbsp;million to produce and winning three Emmy Awards, including for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Miniseries]], and a Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Miniseries or Television Film]]. In June 1998, ''[[Sex and the City]]'' made its debut on the network. Over the course of its six-season run, the comedy series received 54 Emmy nominations and won seven, including one win for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]], and in 2004, the first wins for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] (for [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]] (for [[Cynthia Nixon]]) for HBO since the network first gained Emmy eligibility.

The 2000s opened with two series that maintained similar critical acclaim to ''The Sopranos'', further cementing HBO's reputation as a leading producer of quality television programming: ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]''. The former premiered in August 2001, won nine Emmys, three [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], three Golden Globe Awards and a Peabody Award, and other awards. It has since been regarded as one of television's best all-time series including under rankings by ''Time'',<ref>{{cite news|title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME: Six Feet Under|url=https://time.com/3103796/six-feet-under/|periodical=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=September 6, 2007|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 best TV shows of the 21st century|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/100-best-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=September 13, 2019|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref> and ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest TV Shows Of All Time|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-tv-shows-ever-2/|periodical=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|date=October 16, 2019|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref> ''The Wire'', premiering in June 2002, never won any major television awards, but earned wide critical acclaim for its writing and depictions of criminal and law enforcement issues.

HBO experienced additional viewer acclaim with the 2008 debut of ''[[True Blood]]'', a [[vampire]]-themed fantasy horror drama based on ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]'' gothic novel series by [[Charlaine Harris]]. While earning few major television awards throughout its run, ''True Blood''{{'}}s average viewership often rivaled that of ''The Sopranos'', peaking at an average of 12.4&nbsp;million per week (counting repeat and on-demand viewership) during its second season.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Blood averages 12.4 million per episode across platforms in second season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/09/19/true-blood-averages-12-4-million-per-episode-across-platforms-in-second-season/27753|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=September 19, 2009|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref> The network saw three more hit series premiere in the 2010s: ''[[Game of Thrones]],'' which earned both critical and viewer praise, and set a single-year record for Emmy wins by an individual program in [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards|2015]] with 12 awards;<ref>{{cite news|title=Emmys 2015: winners and performances – as it happened|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2015/sep/20/emmys-2015-live|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=September 20, 2015|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]''; and ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]''.<ref name="Fall and Rise">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: Fall and Rise|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-fall-and-rise/|author=Bill Mesce|publisher=Sound on Sight|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>

===Background===
In an effort to reduce subscriber [[churn rate|churn]] by offering extra programming choices to subscribers, on May 8, 1991, Home Box Office Inc. announced plans to launch two additional channels of HBO and Cinemax, becoming the first subscription television services to launch "[[multiplex (television)|multiplexed]]" companion channels (a term coined by then-CEO Michael Fuchs to equate the programming choices that would be provided to subscribers of the channel tier to that offered by [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multi-screen movie theaters]]), each available at no extra charge to subscribers of one or both networks. On August 1, 1991, through a test launch of the three channels over those systems, TeleCable customers in [[Overland Park, Kansas]], [[Racine, Wisconsin]] and suburban [[Dallas]] ([[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]] and [[Plano, Texas]]) that subscribed to either service began receiving two additional HBO channels and/or a secondary channel of Cinemax. HBO2, HBO3 and Cinemax 2 (now MoreMax) each offered distinct schedules of programs culled from HBO and Cinemax's movie and original programming libraries separate from offerings shown concurrently on their respective parent primary channels. (Cinemax was originally scheduled to launch an tertiary channel, Cinemax 3, on November 1, 1991, but these plans were shelved until 1996.)<ref>{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; HBO Planning to Add New Movie Channels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/09/business/the-media-business-hbo-planning-to-add-new-movie-channels.html|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|issn=0362-4331|date=May 9, 1991|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO, Cinemax to Split Services into Three Channels Each|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/91-OCR/BC-1991-05-13-OCR-Page-0035.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=33|date=May 13, 1991|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Releases Multiplex Schedule|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/91-OCR/BC-1991-08-05-OCR-Page-0040.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=40|date=August 5, 1991|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO: three channels are better than one|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-10807607.html|author=Jane Greenstein|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Fairchild Publications|via=HighBeam Research|date=May 13, 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211758/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-10807607.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 11, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=HBO TO PACK IN MORE PROGRAMMING|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-05-09-9102110030-story.html|author=Kenneth R.

At the time the multiplex test was announced, HBO's then-executive vice president of marketing, John K. Billock, cited internal research that indicated HBO and Cinemax subscribers were prone to cancelling their subscriptions because they either believed that neither tended to have "anything on worth watching" or, when presented with a full monthly schedule, felt that programs they wanted to watch did not air at preferable times. A November 1991 [[ACNielsen]] survey of 550 TeleCable subscribers in the three launch markets determined that HBO and Cinemax's multiplex offerings created positive impacts on subscriber usage and attitudes that factored into whether a subscriber elected to cancel their HBO and/or Cinemax service, with declines in negative opinions on pricing (from 30% to 22%) and the perception of too many repeat program showings each month (from 52% to 35%), and increases in overall usage (rising by 11%) and favorability ratings among home media (from 30% to 50%).<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Multiplex Test Off to a Good Start|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/91-OCR/BC-1991-11-25-OCR-Page-0036.pdf|author=Sharon Morshavi|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=36|date=November 25, 1991|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=TeleCable gives 'plex' good reviews|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11673371.html|author=Jane Greenstein|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Fairchild Publications|via=HighBeam Research|date=November 25, 1991|accessdate=March 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508044430/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11673371.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 8, 2013}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref>

In February 1996, in anticipation of the adoption of [[MPEG-2]] digital compression codecs that would allow cable providers to offer [[digital cable]] service, Home Box Office, Inc. announced plans to expand its multiplex services across HBO and Cinemax to twelve channels, encompassing a fourth HBO channel and two additional Cinemax channels, originally projected for a Spring 1997 launch.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO divides to conquer|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/96-OCR/BC-1996-02-05-OCR-Page-0046.pdf|author=Rich Brown|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=World Radio History|page=49|date=February 5, 1996|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=HBO divides to conquer|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/96-OCR/BC-1996-02-05-OCR-Page-0050.pdf|author=Rich Brown|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=World Radio History|page=50|date=February 5, 1996|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref> The HBO multiplex expanded to include a fourth channel on December 1, 1996, with the launch of HBO Family, focusing on family-oriented feature films and television series aimed at younger children.

Home Box Office, Inc. began marketing the HBO channel suite and related coastal feeds under the umbrella brand "MultiChannel HBO" in September 1994; the package was [[rebranding|rebranded]] as "HBO The Works," now exclusively classified to the four HBO multiplex channels (and later applied to the three thematic channels that were launched afterward), in April 1998. (The Cinemax tier was accordingly marketed as "MultiChannel Cinemax" and then "MultiMax" at the respective times.) Concurrent with the adoption of "The Works" package brand, two of the channels changed their names and formats: HBO2 was rebranded as HBO Plus, and HBO3 was relaunched as HBO Signature—incorporating content catering toward a female audience, alongside theatrical films aimed at broader audiences and content from HBO's original made-for-cable movie and documentary libraries. (HBO Plus would revert to the "HBO2" moniker in September 2002. The "HBO Plus" brand—modified in 2019 to "HBO+"—{{as of|2020|alt=remains in use}} on a multiplex channel of [[HBO Latin America]] featuring mainly theatrical movies previously carried on its parent feed; HBO Latin America also operates a separate channel sharing the "HBO2" name with the shared U.S. namesake of both services.)<ref name="HBO digital networks">{{cite web|title=HBO sets new digital networks|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/99-OCR/BC-1999-05-03-OCR-Page-0039.pdf|author=John M.

On May 6, 1999, the HBO multiplex expanded to include two new thematic channels: HBO Comedy—featuring comedic feature films, comedy series from HBO's original programming library, and recent and archived HBO comedy specials—and HBO Zone—aimed at young adults between the ages of 18 and 34, offering theatrical movies; comedy and alternative series, and documentaries from HBO's original programming library; and [[music video]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hooked Up: HBO courts Gen X with laughs|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/99-OCR/BC-1999-05-03-OCR-Page-0039.pdf|author=Nolan Marchand|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=World Radio History|page=39|date=May 3, 1999|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref> Rounding out the HBO multiplex expansion was HBO Latino, a Spanish language network launched on November 1, 2000, featuring a mix of dubbed simulcasts of programming from the primary HBO channel as well as exclusive Spanish-originated programs.<ref name="tw-hbolatinolaunch">{{cite press release|title=HBO to Launch New Spanish-Language Channel|url=https://www.warnermediagroup.com/newsroom/press-releases/2000/09/07/hbo-to-launch-new-spanish-language-channel|website=Time Warner|via=WarnerMedia Pressroom|date=September 7, 2000|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Latino Launch Is Pushed Back|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/hbo-latino-launch-pushed-back-159061|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=September 17, 2000|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref>

The multiplex tier continued to be marketed as "HBO The Works" until December 2004; the HBO linear channel suite did not have an "official" marketed name for fifteen years afterward, although HBO and Cinemax's respective multiplex packages were marketed collectively afterward (and beforehand) as the "HBO/MAX Pak".<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO: Digital to the Max|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72291713.html|author=Karen Anderson Prikios|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=March 19, 2001|accessdate=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211725/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72291713.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 11, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref> Since the streaming service launched in May 2020, providers that include HBO Max with subscriptions to the linear HBO channels and HBO On Demand have typically marketed the package under the streaming service's branding ([[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]], however, markets it as "HBO | HBO Max" to emphasize the inclusion of HBO Max <u>and</u> HBO's linear and SVOD services in the package). HBO Family (beginning in 1998) and HBO Latino (beginning in 2000) were the only HBO multiplex channels that maintained dedicated websites independent of—although managed in conjunction with—the main HBO website, to which the other five multiplex channels had their promotion limited; both channels had their online content merged into HBO.com in February 2010.

===List of channels===
Depending on the service provider, HBO provides up to seven 24-hour multiplex channels—all of which are simulcast in both [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]], and available as [[time zone]]-based regional feeds—as well as a [[video on demand|subscription video-on-demand]] service (HBO on Demand). Off-the-air maintenance periods of anywhere from a half-hour up to two hours occur at varied overnight/early morning time slots (usually preceding the 6:00&nbsp;a.m. ET/PT start of the defined broadcast day) once per month on each channel.

HBO transmits feeds of its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together, resulting in the [[Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting|difference in local airtimes]] for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most; the opposite-region feed (i.e., the Pacific Time feeds in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the Eastern Time feeds in the Pacific, Mountain and [[Alaska Time Zone]]s) serves as a [[timeshift channel]], allowing viewers who may have missed a particular program at its original local airtime to watch it three hours after its initial airing or allowing them to watch a program up to four hours, depending on the applicable time zone, in advance of their local airtime on their corresponding primary coastal feed. (Most cable, satellite and IPTV providers as well as its Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video and Roku OTT channels only offer the East and West Coast feeds of the main HBO channel; some conventional television providers may include coastal feeds of HBO2 in certain areas, while wider availability of coastal feeds for the other five multiplex channels is limited to subscribers of DirecTV, [[YouTube TV]] and the [[Hulu]] live TV service.)

HBO maintains a separate feed for the [[Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone]]—the only American cable-originated television network to offer a timeshift feed for [[Hawaii]] viewers—operating a three-hour-delayed version of the primary channel's Pacific Time feed for subscribers of [[Charter Spectrum|Oceanic Spectrum]], which otherwise transmits Pacific Time feeds for the six other HBO multiplex channels. (The state's other major cable provider, [[Hawaiian Telcom]], offers the Pacific Time Zone feed of all seven channels.)

====Cinemax====
{{main|Cinemax}}
[[File:Cinemax (Yellow).svg|thumb|Cinemax logo]]
'''Cinemax''' is an American pay television network owned by the Home Box Office, Inc. subsidiary of WarnerMedia Entertainment. Originally developed as a companion service to HBO, the channel's programming consists of recent and some older theatrically released feature films, original [[action fiction|action drama]] series, documentaries and special [[wikt:behind the scenes|behind-the-scenes]] featurettes. While Cinemax and HBO operate as separate premium services, their respective channel tiers are very frequently sold as a combined package by many multichannel television providers; however, customers have the option of subscribing to HBO and Cinemax's corresponding channel packages individually.

On August 1, 1980, HBO launched Cinemax, a companion movie-based premium channel created as a direct competitor to The Movie Channel, then a smaller, standalone pay movie service owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment (then part-owned by WarnerMedia predecessor Warner Communications).<ref>{{cite news|title=2d Cable Movie Service From Home Box Office|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/07/31/archives/2d-cable-movie-service-from-home-box-office.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|issn=0362-4331|date=July 31, 1980|accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref> Cinemax succeeded in its early years partly because of its reliance on classic movie releases from the 1950s to the 1970s—with some more recent films mixed into its schedule—that it presented uncut and without commercial interruption, at a time when limited [[cable television headend|headend]] channel capacity resulted in cable subscribers only being able to receive as many as three dozen channels (up to half of which were reserved for local and out-of-market broadcast stations, and public access channels). In most cases, cable operators tended to sell Cinemax and HBO as a singular premium bundle, usually offered at a discount for customers that decided to subscribe to both channels. Cinemax, unlike HBO, also maintained a 24-hour schedule from its launch, one of the first pay cable services to transmit around-the-clock.

Even early in its existence, Cinemax efforted to diversify its programming beyond movies. Beginning in 1984, it incorporated music specials and some limited original programming (among them, ''[[Second City Television|SCTV Channel]]'' and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'') into the channel's schedule. Around this time, Cinemax also began airing adult-oriented [[softcore pornography|softcore pornographic films and series]]—containing [[sexual intercourse|strong sexual content]] and nudity—in varying late night timeslots (usually no earlier than 11:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific); this programming block, originally airing under the "Friday After Dark" banner (renamed "Max After Dark" in 2008 to better reflect its prior expansion to a nightly block), would become strongly associated with the channel among its subscribers and in [[pop culture]]. The channel began gradually scaling back its adult programming offerings in 2011, in an effort to shift focus towards its mainstream films and original programs, culminating in the removal of "Max After Dark" content from its linear and on-demand platforms in 2018, as part of a broader exit from the genre across Home Box Office, Inc.'s platforms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little brother Cinemax gets extensive makeover|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13619333.html|author=Rod Granger|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Fairchild Publications|via=HighBeam Research|date=November 2, 1992|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105130753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13619333.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|url-status=dead|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name="Skinemax">{{cite news|title=HBO's stealth plan to kill off 'Skinemax'|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/guns_poses_05H3v5lnOgLrvPyjcJWoGL|author=Michael Shain|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|date=February 14, 2011}}</ref><ref name="wrap-hbodropsadultprog"/> In terms of mainstream programming, Cinemax began premiering original action series in the early 2010s, beginning with the August 2011 debut of ''[[Strike Back (TV series)|Strike Back]]'' (which has since become the channel's longest-running original program).

'''Take 2''' (informally referred to as "'''HBO Take 2'''") is a defunct American premium cable television network that was owned by Home Box Office, Inc., then a subsidiary of the Time-Life division of Time Inc., which operated from April 1979 to January 1981. Marketed at a family audience and the first attempt at a companion pay service by the corporate HBO entity, the channel's programming consisted of recent and older theatrically released motion pictures. Take 2 was the first of three efforts by HBO to maintain a family-oriented pay service, predating the similarly formatted and short-lived mini-pay service Festival (launched in 1986) and the present-day multiplex channel HBO Family (launched in 1996).

On September 21, 1978, Home Box Office Inc. announced it would launch a family-oriented companion "mini-pay" premium service (a channel marketed as a lower-priced pay add-on to cable operators, often sold in a tier with co-owned or competing premium services), which would be transmitted via a fourth Satcom I transponder leased to HBO.<ref name="b&c-take2">{{cite web|title=In Brief|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-09-25-BC-OCR-Page-0028.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=10|date=September 25, 1978|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref> Originally planned to launch around January 1, Take 2 launched on April 1, 1979; developed at the request of HBO's affiliate cable providers to meet consumer demand for an additional pay television offering, Take 2 was designed to cater to family audiences. The service's format was intended to cater to prospective customers who were reluctant to pay for an HBO subscription because of its cost and the potentially objectionable content in some of its programming.<ref name="b&c-take2"/>

Like HBO's later family programming services, Festival and HBO Family, Take 2 prohibited the broadcast of R-rated theatrical films on its schedule. G- and PG-rated movies shown on the service usually made their Take 2 debut no less than 60 days after their initial telecast on HBO, and were the centerpiece of its "''Movie of the Week''" premiere presentations. Other programming aired under distinct showcase blocks: "''Center Stage''" (featuring movies and specials with leading entertainers), "''Family Theater''" (a showcase of G-rated films for family viewing), "''Passport''" (an anthology block featuring programs ranging from "popular entertainment to cultural events") and "''Merry-Go-Round''" (a showcase of children's movies, specials and short films).<ref name="Movie Duels"/><ref name="b&c-take2"/> Slow subscriber growth and difficulties leveraging HBO's increasingly wide cable carriage to ensure supportable distribution forced the shutdown of Take 2 on January 31, 1981.<ref name="Movie Duels"/> HBO had already placed resources to grow its secondary, lower-cost "maxi-pay" service, Cinemax, which launched in August 1980. Cinemax, which experienced success with its mix of recent and older movies in its first four years of operation, replaced Take 2 as an add-on to HBO on many cable systems that carried the latter.

'''Festival''' is a defunct American premium cable television network that was owned by Home Box Office, Inc., then a subsidiary of Time Inc., which operated from 1986 to 1988.

====Selecciones en Español de HBO y Cinemax / HBO en Español====
'''Selecciones en Español de HBO y Cinemax''' (later renamed '''HBO en Español''' in September 1993) is a defunct American Spanish language premium cable television service that was owned by Home Box Office, Inc., then a subsidiary of Time Warner, which operated from 1989 to 2000. The service's programming consisted of Spanish-dubbed versions of recent and older theatrically released motion pictures, and select HBO original and event programming aimed at a Hispanic and Latino audience. The service is a predecessor to HBO Latino, which replaced HBO en Español in November 2000.

On January 2, 1989, Selecciones en Español de HBO y Cinemax ("''Spanish Selections from HBO and Cinemax''"), a Spanish-language audio feed transmitted through, depending on the cable system affiliate, either an auxiliary [[second audio program]] channel (accessible through built-in and external multichannel audio decoders) or [[Cable radio|audio simulcasts via FM radio]], launched.

'''HBO HD''' (originally called '''HBO HDTV''' from March 1999 until April 2006) is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of HBO that broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format.<ref name="hbohd">{{cite web|title=HBO: About: Frequently Asked Questions: HBO HD|url=http://www.hbo.com/about/faqs/products/hbo-hd.html|website=HBO|publisher=Home Box Office, Inc. (Time Warner)|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref> HBO maintains high definition simulcast feeds of its main channel and all six multiplex channels. HBO HD is available on all major cable television providers including, among others, Charter Communications (including systems once owned by former HBO sister company Time Warner Cable); Comcast Xfinity (which, in 2016, began downconverting HBO, Cinemax and other cable channels transmitting in 1080i to [[720p|720p60]]);<ref>{{cite web|title=1080i Channels are Being Changed to 720p60 Channels|url=http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Non-X1-Service/1080i-channels-are-being-changed-to-720p60-channels/m-p/2783308#M183323}}</ref> Cox Communications and [[Optimum]]; as well as [[DirecTV]]; [[AT&T U-verse]]; and [[Verizon FiOS]]. From the 2008 rollout of HD simulcasts for the HBO multiplex feeds until the mid-2010s, the majority of pay television providers that carried HBO HD generally offered only the main channel in high definition, with HD carriage of the multiplex channels varying by market. {{As of|2020}}, most providers transmit all seven HBO multiplex channels in HD, either on a dedicated HD channel tier separate from their SD assignments or as hybrid SD/HD feeds.

Home Box Office, Inc. announced plans to launch a high definition simulcast feed on June 12, 1997, with initial plans for a rollout to television providers as early as the Summer of 1998, when electronics manufacturers planned to begin retailing their initial line of HD-capable television sets.<ref name="vty-hbohdsetslaunch">{{cite web|title=HBO plans high-def startup by 1998|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/hbo-plans-high-def-startup-by-1998-1116680165/|author=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=June 12, 1997|accessdate=May 11, 2020}}</ref> HBO began transmitting a high definition simulcast feed on March 6, 1999, becoming the first American cable television network to begin simulcast their programming in the format. For the first 23 months of its existence, the HD feed only transmitted theatrical films from the network's programming suppliers (initially accounting for about 45% of its available feature film output, expanding to around 60% by early 2001) and HBO's in-house original movies in the format, as existing widescreen prints of those films were already scalable in the 16:9 widescreen [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] and could readily be upconverted to HD resolution.<ref name="vty-hbohdsetslaunch"/><ref name="HBO HD">{{cite web|title=HBO ready to go with HDTV|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53675563.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508063136/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53675563.html|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 25, 1999|accessdate=March 2, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 8, 2013}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref>

Original programming began to be made available in HD on January 14, 2001, when the network commenced a 13-week Sunday "encore" presentation of the second season of ''The Sopranos'' in remastered 1080i HD. (HBO had been requiring the producers of its original series to film their episodes in widescreen—subsequently downconverted for the standard definition feed—to fit [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 stamdard|4:3]] television screens since 1996, in order to future-proof them for remastering in HD.) The third-season premiere of the mob drama, "[[Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood]]," on March 4 was the first first-run episode of an HBO series to be transmitted in high-definition from its initial telecast, with all subsequent episodes being delivered to HBO exclusively on HD videotape (and downcoverted for the main standard-definition feed). Bob Zitter, then the network's Senior Vice President of Technology Operations, disclosed to ''[[Multichannel News]]'' in January 2001 that HBO elected to delay offering its original series in high definition until there was both sustainable consumer penetration of high-definition television sets and wide accessibility of HDTV equipment on the retail market.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sopranos Hit Hi-Def|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/sopranos-hit-hi-def-95869|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=January 7, 2001|accessdate=May 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBOs Sopranos Goes High-Definition|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/hbos-sopranos-goes-high-definition-133506|author=Monica Hogan|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=January 7, 2001|accessdate=May 11, 2020}}</ref> Sports telecasts were upgraded to HD on September 25, 2004, with an ''HBO World Championship Boxing'' fight card headlined by [[Roy Jones Jr.]] and [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glen Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Going All-HD for Boxing|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/hbo-going-all-hd-boxing-337708|author=R.

====HBO on Demand====
'''HBO on Demand''' is HBO's companion [[video on demand|subscription video-on-demand]] (SVOD) service that is available at no additional cost to subscribers of the linear television service, who regularly pay a premium fee to pay television providers to receive access to the channel. VOD content from the network is also available on select virtual MVPD services (including sister properties [[AT&T TV|AT&T TV, AT&T TV Now and AT&T WatchTV]], and [[Hulu]]) and through HBO's dedicated OTT video channels on Apple TV Channels, Amazon Video Channels, and [[Roku#The Roku Channel|The Roku Channel]]. HBO on Demand offers theatrical feature films from HBO's distribution partners and original programming previously seen on the network (including weekly series, documentaries, sports magazine and documentary programs, and concert and stand-up comedy specials). The service's rotating program selection incorporates newer film titles and episodes that are added to the platform following their debut on the linear feed, as well as library content (including complete seasons of the network's past and present original programs).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Television Will Be Revolutionized|author=Amanda D. Lotz|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City|page=132|year=2007|author-link=Amanda D. Lotz}}</ref>

HBO on Demand, the first SVOD service to be offered by an American premium service, launched on July 1, 2001 over then sister company Time Warner Cable's [[Columbia, South Carolina]], system.<ref name="HBO On Demand">{{cite news|title=Time Warner to Add HBO Video-On-Demand to Digital Cable in Columbia, South Carolina|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-75710982.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507135455/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-75710982.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 7, 2013|agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News|via=HighBeam Research|date=June 21, 2001|accessdate=March 4, 2013}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref> The service was developed to allow HBO subscribers access to the channel's programming at their choosing, thereby reducing the frequency in which viewers were unable to find a program they prefer to watch and limiting cancellations to the service because of that issue. On January 3, 2011, HBO became the first pay television network to offer VOD content in [[3DTV|3D]]; initially available to linear HBO subscribers signed with Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Verizon FiOS, 3D content consisted of theatrical feature films available in the format.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Pops Cork on 3D Video-On-Demand|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/cable-operators/hbo-pops-cork-3d-video-demand/328081|author=Todd Spangler|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=January 3, 2011}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, a domestic version of HBO on Demand was launched in 2015 to subscribers of [[IPTV]] provider [[TalkTalk TV]], which provide HBO's program offerings through the provider's [[YouView]] set-top boxes via a standalone VOD subscription.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

(HBO and Cinemax are the only American premium television services not to include live network feeds in their proprietary streaming VOD platforms.)

Based on the prototype HBO on Broadband service that was originally launched in January 2008 to linear HBO subscribers of Time Warner Cable's [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] systems, HBO Go launched nationwide on February 18, 2010, initially available to existing HBO subscribers signed with [[Verizon FiOS]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO GO heads to FiOS|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-go-heads-fios-20758|author=Georg Szalai|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> Initially carrying 1,000 hours of program content available for streaming in standard or high definition, the on-demand streaming service was conceived as a TV Everywhere platform marketed exclusively to existing subscribers of the linear HBO television service. (The HBO Go website and mobile apps, including its apps for streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and some [[video game console]]s, required a password accompanying a linear HBO subscription by a participating television provider in order to access content on the service.) On June 12, 2020, WarnerMedia announced that HBO Go's mobile and [[digital media player]] apps would be discontinued in the U.S. on July 31, as most traditional and virtual MVPDs have secured distribution deals for HBO Max. Those providers that have not yet made an HBO Max deal continue to allow customer access to HBO Go (mainly [[Altice USA]]'s brands, [[Mediacom]], smaller cable providers, and closed-circuit university television systems which had not had personnel available during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] to contractually transfer their credentials to HBO Max), though only through the HBO Go desktop website. The "HBO Go" moniker remains in use as the brand for HBO's streaming platforms in select European, Latin American and Asian markets.<ref name="cnet-hbogoending">{{cite web|title=HBO is getting rid of HBO Go, renaming HBO Now since HBO Max is live|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/hbo-max-is-getting-rid-of-hbo-go-renaming-hbo-now-since-hbo-max-is-live/|author=Joan E.

==Programming==
{{main|List of HBO original programming}}
HBO's programming schedule currently consists largely of theatrically released feature films and adult-oriented original series (including, {{As of|August 2020|lc=y}}, dramas such as ''[[Euphoria (American TV series)|Euphoria]]'', ''[[Lovecraft Country (TV series)|Lovecraft Country]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (2020 TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[My Brilliant Friend (TV series)|My Brilliant Friend]]'', ''[[Succession (TV series)|Succession]]'' and ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]''; comedies such as ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'', ''[[Barry (TV series)|Barry]]'', ''[[Los Espookys]]'' and ''[[High Maintenance]]''; and topical satires ''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'' and ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''). In addition, HBO also carries documentary films, sports-centric documentary and magazine series, occasional original made-for-TV movies and specials (the latter consisting of concert and stand-up comedy programs), original children's programming, and short-form behind-the-scenes specials centered mainly on theatrical films (either running in their initial theatrical or HBO/Cinemax broadcast window). Newer episodes of most HBO original programs usually air over its main channel after 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time; depending partly on the day's programming schedule, repeats of original series, made-for-cable movies and documentaries (typically excluding programs with graphic violent or sexual content) are shown during the daytime hours on the main channel, and at various times on HBO's themed channels. Four of the themed multiplex channels—HBO Signature, HBO Family, HBO Comedy and HBO Zone—also each carry archived HBO original series and specials dating to the 1990s. (Outside of HBO Family, which regularly airs archived family-oriented series and specials, this may vary on the channel's daily schedule.)

Beginning with its programming expansion to afternoons in 1974, the primary HBO channel had imposed a longstanding [[watershed (broadcasting)|watershed policy]] prohibiting films assigned with an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|“R“ rating]] from being broadcast before 8:00&nbsp;p.m. ET/PT. (At various points, HBO also prohibited showings of X-/NC-17-rated and foreign [[art film]]s.)<ref>{{cite news|title=The Insider; HBO's bleeping little secret; bleeped profanity in an airing of the retrospective "Six Feet Under: 2001–2005: In Memoriam|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-135518278.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211733/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-135518278.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 11, 2011|author=Michele Greppi|publisher=[[TelevisionWeek]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 22, 2005|accessdate=February 25, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Wall|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-wall/|author=Bill Mesce|publisher=Sound on Sight|date=September 16, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO: off the ground, but flying low|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/74-OCR/1974-02-04-BC-OCR-Page-0035.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=47|date=February 4, 1974|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref> The policy—which extended to films shown between 6:00&nbsp;a.m. and 8:00&nbsp;p.m. ET/PT, when HBO began offering 24-hour programming on weekends in September 1981—may have once stemmed from HBO's pre-mid-2000s availability on analog cable tiers (whereas its multiplex channels generally require a [[digital cable]] subscription or at least scrambling), and, because of controversy surrounding daytime showings of R-rated films that began being scheduled on competing premium services as early as 1980, remained in place well after the [[V-chip]] became standard in newer television sets.<ref name="b&c-hbo24hr"/> From April 1979 to April 1986, rating bumpers preceding HBO telecasts of R-rated films included a special disclaimer indicating to viewers that the movie would air exclusively during the designated watershed period (“Home Box Office/HBO will show this feature only at night”). The watershed policy was extended to cover TV-MA-rated programs when the [[TV Parental Guidelines]] were implemented industry-wide on January 1, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Schedule: Primary HBO channel|url=http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ScheduleServlet?ACTION_TODAY=TODAY|publisher=HBO|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> {{As of|2020}}, HBO has watered down its enforcement of this policy. Erosion of this policy began in January 2010, when the main HBO channel started allowing original series, movies and documentaries given a TV-MA rating for strong profanity and/or non-graphic violence during the daytime on Saturdays and Sundays; in January 2012, HBO included occasional Sunday daytime airings of R-rated films as early as 4:00&nbsp;p.m. ET/PT within its weekly repeat showing of the Saturday movie premiere (depending on the previous night's scheduled premiere film, said film's length, and HBO original series that may follow the Sunday rebroadcast), though by 2017, afternoon R-rated movie airings (which occasionally have been shown as early as 2:00&nbsp;p.m. ET/PT since then) were randomly scheduled on any day of the week. Most of the six HBO thematic multiplex channels—except for HBO Family, which prohibits programming containing either equivalent rating by effect of the channel's target audience<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Family schedule website|url=http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ScheduleServlet?ACTION_TODAY=TODAY|publisher=Home Box Office, Inc.|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>—air TV-MA and R-rated programming during morning and afternoon time periods. HBO also does not typically allow most NC-17 rated films to be aired on the primary channel or its multiplex channels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

HBO pioneered the [[free preview]] concept—now a standard promotional tool in the pay television industry—in 1973, as a marketing strategy allowing participating television providers to offer a sampling of HBO's programming for potential subscribers of the service.<ref>{{cite book|title=It's Not TV: Watching HBO in the Post-Television Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2SUAgAAQBAJ&q=HBO+free+preview+Lawrence,+Massachusetts&pg=PA3|author=Marc Leverette|author2=Brian L.

HBO offers between three and five preview events each year—normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film—to pay television providers for distribution on a voluntary participation basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: Title Fights: The King of Pay-TV|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-expanding-the-brand-part-2/|author=Bill Mesce|publisher=Sound on Sight|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2014}}</ref> (The total of participating providers that elected to offer a free preview event varies depending on the given preview period, and participating multiple-system cable operators may elect to carry the event only in certain regions where they provide service.)

HBO also produces short segments promoting newer movies with the cooperation of the film studios that hold distribution rights to the projects (almost universally by studios maintaining exclusive pay television contracts with HBO and Cinemax, and which have been rebroadcast on the former during a film's pay-cable distribution window), and have usually consisted of either interstitial "behind-the-scenes" and interview segments on an upcoming/recent theatrical release or [[red carpet]] coverage. Currently, these segments air under the ''HBO First Look'' series of 15-to-20-minute-long documentary-style interstitial specials, which debuted in 1992 and has no set airing schedule. (Since 2010, the "making of" specials, for which HBO officially no longer uses the ''First Look'' name, are only identified under the banner for program listing identification.) The network previously produced three-to-five-minute-long feature segments that aired during longer-duration between-program promotional breaks, ''HBO News'' (1988–2011; formerly titled ''HBO Entertainment News'' from 1988 to 2007) and ''HBO Behind the Scenes'' (1982–1992). The interstitials—particularly those aired as episodes of ''First Look''—have also frequently been included as bonus features on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] releases of the profiled films. Since 2011, HBO no longer airs "behind-the-scenes" interstitials during promotional breaks, and has reduced airings of ''First Look'' to a few episodes per year as the network has honed its focus on higher-profile original programs and studios have increasingly limited their self-produced "making of" featurettes for exclusive physical and digital media release.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

During the network's early years, HBO aired other interstitials in-between programs. Originally billed as ''Something Short and Special'', around 1980, ''InterMissions'' (as the interstitials were began to be called in September 1978) were bannered in two groupings: ''[[Video Jukebox (TV series)|Video Jukebox]]'', a showcase of music videos from various artists (eventually separated from the other intermission shorts and given various longform spinoffs, also titled as ''Video Jukebox'' or variants thereof), and ''Special'', showcasing [[short film]]s. By 1984, the short segments had mainly been limited to comedic film shorts (originally branded as ''HBO Comedy Shorts'' and then as ''HBO Short Takes'', which used a set of differing animated intros) and youth-targeted live action and animated short films seen largely before and during family-oriented programming (branded as ''HBO Shorts for Kids''). Intermission shorts had largely vanished from the channel by 1988.

===Original programming===
{{Further|List of HBO original programming}}
HBO innovated [[original programming|original entertainment programming]] for cable television networks, in which a television series (both dramatic and comedic), made-for-television movie or entertainment special is developed for and production is primarily, if not exclusively, handled by the channel of its originating broadcast. Since 1973, the network has produced a variety of original programs alongside its slate of theatrical motion pictures. Most of these programs cater to adult viewers (and, with limited exceptions, are typically assigned [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA ratings]]), often featuring—with such content varying by program—high amounts of profanity, violence, sexual themes and/or nudity that [[basic cable]] or over-the-air broadcast channels would be reticent to air, because of objections from sponsors and the risk of them pulling or refusing to sell their advertising, depending on the objectionable material that a sponsor is comfortable placing their advertising. (Incidentally since the early 2000s, some ad-supported basic cable channels—like [[FX (TV network)|FX]] and [[Comedy Central]]—have incorporated stronger profanity, somewhat more pervasive violence and sexual themes and/or occasional nudity in their original programs, similar to content featured in original programs shown on HBO and other premium services, with relatively limited advertiser issues.)

Mainly because it is not beholden to the preferences of advertisers, HBO has long been regarded in the entertainment industry for letting program creators maintain full [[artistic freedom|creative autonomy]] over their projects, allowing them to depict gritty subject matter that—prior to basic cable channels and streaming services deciding to follow the model set by HBO and other pay cable services—had not usually been shown on other television platforms. During the "Executive Actions" symposium held by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[George Washington University]] in April 2015 (shortly after the launch of the HBO Now streaming service), then-HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he does not want the network to be akin to [[Netflix]] in which users "[[binge watching|binge watch]]" its television shows and film content, saying "I don't think it would have been a great thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week[...] I think it was very exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out for an extended period of time." Pleper cited that he felt that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Here's Why HBO's CEO Doesn't Want You To Binge-Watch Shows|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/28/hbo-slams-binge-watching_n_7160496.html|author=Chris Morran|work=HuffPost|date=April 28, 2015}}</ref>

Some of its original programs, however, have been aimed at families or children, primarily those produced before 2001 (through its original programming division and third-party producers) and from 2016 to 2020 (under its agreement with Sesame Workshop); children's programs that have aired on HBO have included ''Sesame Street'', ''Fraggle Rock'', ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', ''[[Babar (TV series)|Babar]]'', ''[[HBO Storybook Musicals]]'', ''[[Lifestories: Families in Crisis]]'', ''[[Dear America]]'' and ''[[The Little Lulu Show]]'' as well as acquisitions including ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1986 TV series)|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[The Legend of White Fang]]'', ''[[Shakespeare: The Animated Tales]]'', ''[[Animated Hero Classics]]'' and ''[[The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures]]''. Beginning in 2001, most of the family- or kid-oriented programs had migrated to HBO Family, with only a limited amount of newer family-oriented series being produced for either the primary channel or HBO Family since. (HBO Family continued to maintain a limited slate of original children's programming until 2003.)

HBO ventured back into children's programming with its acquisition of first-run broadcast and streaming rights to ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a long-running children's television series that had previously aired on the program's longtime broadcaster, [[PBS]], for the vast majority of its run, in a five-year programming and development deal with [[Sesame Workshop]] that was announced in August 2015. Although struck with the intent to having the show remain on PBS in some fashion, the nonprofit [[production company]] reached the deal due to cutbacks resulting from declines in public and private donations, distribution fees paid by PBS member stations and licensing for merchandise sales. Through the agreement, HBO obtained first-run television rights to ''Sesame Street'', beginning with the January 2016 debut of its 46th season (with episodes being distributed to PBS, following a nine-month exclusivity window at no charge to its member stations); Sesame Workshop also produced original children's programming content for the channel, which also gained exclusive streaming rights to the company's programming library for HBO Go and HBO Now (assuming those rights from [[Prime Video|Amazon Video]], [[Netflix]] and Sesame Workshop's in-house subscription streaming service, Sesame Go, the latter of which will cease to operate as a standalone offering).<ref name="cnnmoney-sesamestreet">{{cite web|title='Sesame Street' is heading to HBO|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/08/13/media/sesame-street-hbo/index.html|author=Frank Pallotta|author2=Brian Stelter|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2015|author2-link=Brian Stelter}}</ref><ref name="sw-hbomax">{{cite press release|title=HBO Max and Sesame Workshop Announce New Content Partnership Cementing a Shared Commitment to Kids and Families|url=https://www.sesameworkshop.org/press-room/press-releases/hbo-max-and-sesame-workshop-announce-new-content-partnership-cementing|website=[[Sesame Workshop]]|date=October 3, 2019|accessdate=May 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sesame Street is killing off its subscription streaming service, Sesame Go|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/08/14/sesame-street-is-killing-off-its-subscription-streaming-service-sesame-go/|author=Brian Fung|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Sesame Street' to Air First on HBO for Next 5 Seasons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/business/media/sesame-street-heading-to-hbo-in-fall.html|author=Emily Steel|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2015|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=HBO Picks Up 'Sesame Street' As Kids' Viewing Habits Change|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/hbo-picks-up-sesame-street-in-five-year-pact-with-sesame-workshop-1201569335/|author=Brian Steinberg|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> With the debut of HBO Max in May 2020, under contract renewal terms agreed upon between the studio and WarnerMedia in October 2019, ''Sesame Street'' and other Sesame Workshop content will shift from the linear television service to the streaming-based HBO Max later in the year.<ref name="sw-hbomax"/>

===Movie library===
{{See also|List of HBO Films films}}
On average, movies occupy between 14 and 18 hours of the daily schedule on HBO and HBO2 (or as little as 12 hours on the latter, depending upon if HBO2 is scheduled to carry an extended "catch-up" marathon of an HBO original series), and up to 20 hours per day—depending on channel format—on its five thematic multiplex channels.

Since June 6, 1992, HBO has offered weekly pay television premieres of recent theatrical and original made-for-cable movies on Saturdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. ET/PT. (Event presentations that have followed the movie—such as boxing coverage or concerts—have caused rare variances in the preceding film's start time; if a live event was scheduled, prior to the December 2018 discontinuation of HBO's boxing telecasts, the premiered film would air after the event—in reverse order from the Eastern feed scheduling—on the Pacific Time Zone feed.) From June 1996 until May 2006, the presentations were marketed as the "Saturday Night Guarantee" to denote a promise of "a new movie [premiering] every Saturday night" all 52 weeks of the year. (HBO had highlighted said "guarantee" in promotions for the Saturday premiere night dating to January 1994.) Before settling on having Saturday serve as its anchor premiere night, the scheduling of HBO's prime time film premieres varied between Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday, depending on competition from broadcast fare during the traditional network television season. First-run theatrical films debut on average from ten months to one year after a film's initial theatrical run has concluded, and no more than six months after their DVD or digital VOD download release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Mavericks Collection: David Baldwin|url=https://www.cablecenter.org/media-room/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=157|website=The Cable Center|date=December 6, 2007|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hooray for Hollywood|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/hooray-for-hollywood-2-1117891251/|author=Jack Egan|website=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=August 24, 2003|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO trumpets Saturday night at the movies|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/94-OCR/BC-1994-08-08-Page-0024.pdf|author=Rich Brown|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=World Radio History|page=24|date=August 8, 1994|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref> In September 2020, HBO began incorporating gap weeks into the monthly premiere schedule or aired newer films outside the network's designated premiere timeslot to showcase new original specials in the Saturday 8:00 slot at least once per month, having sometimes done so to ration films scheduled for a pay-cable debut because of [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]]-related [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema|postponements of newer theatrical releases]] from HBO's film distribution partners.

HBO also produces made-for-cable television movies through sister production unit [[HBO Films]], which traces its origins to the 1983 founding of HBO Premiere Films. Originally developed to produce original television movies and miniseries with higher budgets and production values than other telefilms, the film unit's first original movie project was the 1983 biopic ''The Terry Fox Story''. Differing from other direct-to-cable television films, most of HBO's original movies have been helmed by major film actors (such as [[James Stewart]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Halle Berry]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]]). The unit—which would be rechristened HBO Pictures in 1985—expanded beyond its telefilm slate, which was scaled back to focus on independent film production in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cablecastings: Pleased with 'Fox'|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Broadcasting-IDX/1983-Broadcasting/1983-08-22-Broadcasting-Page-0009.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=9|date=August 22, 1983|accessdate=May 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=HBO SETS A TREND IN CABLE MOVIES|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1985-07-28-8501310963-story.html|author=Bill Kelley|newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=July 28, 1985|accessdate=May 18, 2020}}</ref> The current HBO Films unit was formed in October 1999 through the consolidation of HBO Pictures and HBO NYC Productions (originally created as HBO Showcase in 1986, and following its June 1996 restructuring, had also occasionally produced drama series for the network).<ref>{{cite news|title=TV VIEW; HBO'S NEW 'SHOWCASE' DISPLAYS PROMISE|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/20/arts/tv-view-hbo-s-new-showcase-displays-promise.html|author=John J.

Entertainment.

Films to which HBO maintains traditional telecast and streaming rights will usually also be shown on the Cinemax television and streaming platforms during their licensing agreement period (either after a film title completes its HBO window or transfers between services over certain months during the contractual period). Feature films from the aforementioned studios that maintain joint licensing contracts encompassing both services will typically make their premium television debut on HBO approximately two to three months before their premiere on Cinemax and vice versa.

====Background====
HBO's relationship with Warner Bros. began with a five-year distribution agreement signed in June 1986, encompassing films released between January 1987 and December 1992; the estimated cost of the initial pay-cable rights were between $300&nbsp;million and $600&nbsp;million, depending on the overall performance of Warner's films and HBO/Cinemax's respective subscriber counts. Although the Warner deal was initially non-exclusive, a preemptive strategy in the event that its co-owned rivals Showtime and The Movie Channel (which elected not to pick up any spare Warner titles) sought full exclusivity over movie rights, the terms gave Warner an option to require HBO to acquire exclusive rights to titles covered under the remainder of the deal for $60&nbsp;million per year (in addition to a guaranteed $65-million fee for each year of the contract).<ref name="latimes-hbowarnerdeal"/><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO signs pact with Warner.|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/86-OCR/BC-1986-06-09-OCR-Page-0160.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=160|date=June 9, 1986|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> As a result of the 1989 Time-Warner merger, HBO and Cinemax hold pay-cable exclusivity over all newer Warner Bros. films for the duration of their joint ownership. 20th Century Fox first signed a non-exclusive deal with HBO in January 1986, covering Fox films released between 1985 and 1988, along with a production co-financing agreement involving HBO original programs; the pact transitioned to an exclusivity arrangement with the 1988 renewal.<ref name="nyt-foxhbo"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Cablecastings: Change of heart|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/86-OCR/BC-1986-01-27-OCR-Page-0010.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=10|date=January 27, 1986|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref name="b&c-hbofoxexclusive"/> The first-run film output agreement with Fox was renewed by HBO for ten years on August 15, 2012 (with a provision allowing the studio to release its films through digital platforms such as [[iTunes]] and [[Prime Video|Amazon Video]] during the channel's term of license of an acquired film for the first time).<ref name="HBO Fox">{{cite news|title=HBO and 20th Century Fox renew output deal|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-hbo20th-20120815,0,5442974.story|author=Joe Flint|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=August 15, 2012}}</ref> While [[The Walt Disney Company]] completed its acquisition of 20th Century Fox in March 2019, Disney maintains an output deal with its in-house streaming services [[Disney+]] and [[Hulu]] for films produced and/or distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and its subsidiaries (which have not distributed their films over a traditional pay-cable service since the studio's agreement with HBO rival [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] ended in 2015), whereas any decision affecting the future of Fox's contractual agreement with HBO has yet to be formally announced {{as of|2020|05|lc=y}}.<ref name="HBO Fox"/>

HBO's relationship with Universal first began in March 1984, when it signed a six-year non-exclusivity deal with the studio; in April 1990, Universal elected to sign a deal with CBS for the licensing rights to a package of the studio's ten 1989 releases, bypassing the traditional pay-cable window.<ref name="b&c-hbouni84"/><ref>{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; CBS Is Said to Get 10 Films To Show Before Cable TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/09/business/the-media-business-cbs-is-said-to-get-10-films-to-show-before-cable-tv.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 9, 1990|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS takes Universal films passed on by cable|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-04-16-OCR-Page-0057.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=57|date=April 16, 1990|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> The current Universal output deal—which began as an eight-year agreement that originally lasted through December 2010, assuming the studio's pay-cable rights from Starz—was renewed for ten years on January 6, 2013; the current deal gives HBO [[right of first refusal]] over select Universal titles, allowing the studio to exercise an option to license co-distributed live-action films to Showtime and animated films to Netflix if HBO elects not to obtain pay television rights to a particular film.

====Former first-run contracts====
Being the first pay-cable service to go national, for many years, HBO was advantageous in acquiring film licensing rights from major and independent studios; until Showtime, The Movie Channel and other premium channels started beefing up their movie product to compete with HBO in the early 1980s, HBO's dominance in the pay-cable led to complaints from many motion picture companies of the network holding monopoly power in the pay cable industry and a disproportionate advantage in film acquisition negotiations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movie makers complain of HBO 'monopoly'|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/77-OCR/BC-1977-12-05-OCR-Page-0051.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=51|date=December 5, 1977|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> During the early years of premium cable, the major American movie studios often sold the pay television rights to an individual theatrical film title to multiple "maxi-pay" and "mini-pay" services—often including HBO and later, Cinemax—resulting in frequent same-month scheduling duplication amongst the competing services. From its launch as a regional service, HBO purchased broadcast rights to theatrical movies on a per-title basis. The network pioneered the pay television industry practice, known as a "pre-buy," of buying the pay-cable rights to a movie from its releasing studio before it started filming, in exchange for agreeing to pay a specified share of a film's production costs; this allowed HBO to maintain exclusivity over film output arrangements and to save money allocated for film acquisitions.<ref>{{cite news|title=HOME BOX OFFICE MOVES INTO HOLLYWOOD|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/magazine/home-box-office-moves-into-hollywood.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 12, 1983|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> In June 1976, it signed a four-year exclusive deal with [[Columbia Pictures]] for a package of 20 films released between January 1977 and January 1981, in exchange for then-parent company Time, Inc. committing a $5-million production financing investment with Columbia over a period of between 12 and 18 months.<ref name="b&c-hbodeals76">{{cite web|title=HBO makes deals for movies, cable system|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/76-OCR/1976-06-28-BC-OCR-Page-0055.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=55|date=June 28, 1976|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=HBO makes deals for movies, cable system|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/76-OCR/1976-06-28-BC-OCR-Page-0056.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=56|date=June 28, 1976|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Movie Duels">{{cite web|title=It's Not TV: HBO, The Company That Changed Television: The Movie Duels|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/its-not-tv-hbo-the-company-that-changed-television-the-movie-duels/|author=Bill Mesce|publisher=Sound on Sight|date=September 2, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref>

Although HBO executives were reluctant at first to strike such arrangements, by the mid-1980s, the channel had transitioned to exclusive film output deals (now the standard among North American premium channels), in which a film studio licenses all or a proportion of their upcoming productions to a partner service over a multi-year contract. In 1983, HBO entered into three exclusive licensing agreements tied to production financing arrangements involving Tri-Star Pictures (formed as a co-production venture between Time, Inc./HBO, Columbia and CBS Inc.), Columbia Pictures (an exclusivity-based contract extension initially covering 50% of the studio's pre-June 1986 releases with a non-compete option to purchase additional Columbia titles) and [[Orion Pictures]] (encompassing a package of 30 films, in return for financial participation and a $10-million securities investment; the deal was indirectly associated with Orion's buyout of [[Filmways]] the year prior, in which HBO bought pay television rights to the studio's films). All three deals were approved under a [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] review greenlighting the Tri-Star venture in June of that year. (The Tri-Star deal became non-exclusive in January 1988, although Showtime elected not to acquire titles from HBO's film rights lessees.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Tri-Star gets go-ahead from Justice|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/83-OCR/BC-1983-09-19-OCR-Page-0035.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=35|date=June 28, 1983|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, Time Inc.

In February 1983, HBO signed an agreement with [[Silver Screen Partners]] (a now-defunct joint venture between HBO, Silver Screen Management, [[Thorn EMI]] and [[The Cannon Group]]), in which HBO had right of first refusal in the film selection and received 5% of all profits derived from non-pay-cable distribution of the studio's films; the Silver Screen agreement concluded upon the studio's cessation in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Brief.|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/83-OCR/BC-1983-02-28-OCR-Page-0120.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=120|date=February 28, 1983|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> In early 1984, HBO abandoned the exclusivity practice, citing internal research that concluded that subscribers showed indifference to efforts by premium channels to secure rights to studios' full slate of recently released films from to distinguish their programming due to [[VHS]] availability preceding pay-cable distribution in the release window. This change came after the firing of then-HBO Chairman [[Frank Biondi]], reportedly for having "overextended the network in pre-buy and exclusive movie deals" as subscribership of pay-cable services declined. Biondi's replacement, Michael J. Fuchs, structured some of the subsequent deals as non-exclusive to allow HBO to divert more funding toward co-producing made-for-cable movies, other original programming and theatrical joint ventures (via Tri-Star and Silver Screen Partners).<ref>{{cite web|title=Cablecastings: All in the Family|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/83-OCR/BC-1983-11-14-OCR-Page-0010.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=10|date=November 14, 1983|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cablecastings: Face-lift|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/84-OCR/BC-1984-03-12-OCR-Page-0010.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=10|date=March 12, 1984|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref name="nyt-festival"/>

HBO maintains an in-house documentary production and distribution unit, HBO Documentary Films, which releases between 10 and 15 documentaries per year (averaging about two premieres per month) for the network and provides limited theatrical distribution of certain films prior to their initial broadcast on HBO's linear television and streaming services. The unit's longtime chief was [[Sheila Nevins]], who initially served as Director of Documentary Programming from 1979 to 1982; upon returning in 1986, she headed HBO's documentary unit under various executive capacities (as Vice President of Documentary Programming, as Senior [later, Executive] Vice President of Original Programming and, beginning in 2004, as President of HBO Documentary Films) and served as [[executive producer]] of most of its documentary productions until she left the network in March 2018. Under Nevins, HBO's documentaries have won 35 [[News and Documentary Emmy Award]]s, 42 Peabody Awards, and 26 [[Academy Awards]] as well as 31 individual Primetime Emmy Awards honored to Nevins.<ref>{{cite news|title=Executive Producer Sheila Nevins Shares Five Career And Life Lessons|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickisalemi/2017/09/16/executive-producer-sheila-nevins-shares-five-career-life-lessons/#4c6167a56fc9|author=Vicki Salemi|periodical=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes LLC|date=September 16, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Announces Winners at the 38th Annual News & Documentary Emmy® Awards|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/news_38th_winners.pdf|website=[[National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]|date=October 5, 2017|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

The network's first successful documentary was the six-part 1979 miniseries ''[[Time Was]]'', a [[Dick Cavett]]-hosted retrospective that took a historical look at an individual decade in the [[20th century]]—from the 1920s up to the 1970s—over the course of each episode. 1981's ''She's Nobody's Baby''—produced in conjunction with ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine—traced the evolution of the societal role of American women during the 20th Century; the special earned HBO its first Peabody Award, the first to be won by a pay television service and the first of many HBO documentaries to receive the prestigious award.<ref>{{cite web|title=41st Annual Peabody Awards|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/shes-nobodys-baby-the-history-of-american-women-in-the-20th-century|publisher=[[Henry W.

In February 2015, HBO premiered a six-part documentary from [[Andrew Jarecki]], ''[[The Jinx (miniseries)|The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst]]'', chronicling the mystery surrounding the [[Robert Durst|New York real estate heir]]'s alleged involvement in the unsolved 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathie Durst; the 2000 [[execution-style]] killing of writer [[Susan Berman]]; and the 2001 death and [[dismemberment]] of Durst's neighbor, Morris Black.

Alongside feature-length movies and other types of original programming, HBO has produced original [[television special|entertainment specials]] throughout its existence.

The network has also cultivated a reputation for its stand-up comedy specials, which have helped raise the profile of established comedians (including [[George Carlin]], [[Alan King]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Robin Williams]]) and served as the launchpad for emerging comic stars (such as [[Dennis Miller]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Margaret Cho]] and [[Dave Chappelle]]), many of whom have gone on to television and film careers. HBO premieres between five and seven comedy specials per year on average, usually making their initial broadcast in late Saturday prime time, following its weekly movie premiere presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Regular comedy specials on HBO began on December 31, 1975, with the premiere of ''An Evening with [[Robert Klein]]'', the first of nine HBO stand-up specials that the comic headlined over 35 years. Positive viewer response to the special led to the creation of ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'', a monthly anthology series that presented a stand-up comedian's nightclub performance in its entirety and uncut; it premiered on March 20, 1976, with a performance by [[David Steinberg]].<ref name="b&c-hbodeals76"/><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO begins to roll its own entertainment for pay cable|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/76-OCR/1976-03-08-BC-OCR-Page-0025.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=25|date=March 8, 1976|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=HBO begins to roll its own entertainment for pay cable|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/76-OCR/1976-03-08-BC-OCR-Page-0026.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=26|date=March 8, 1976|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref> HBO's stand-up comedy offerings would eventually expand with the ''HBO Comedy Hour'', which debuted on August 15, 1987 with ''[[Martin Mull]]: Live from [[North Ridgeville, Ohio|North Ridgeville]]'', a variety-comedy special headlined by Mull that featured a mix of on-stage and pre-filmed sketches.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mario Puzo's novel "The Fortunate Pilgrim" is...|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-08-02-tv-469-story.html|author=Lee Margulies|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=August 2, 1987|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref> Outside of the Townsend specials, the ''Comedy Hour'' maintained a virtually identical concept as ''On Location'', taking that program's place as HBO's flagship stand-up series and ultimately resulting in ''On Location''{{'}}s phase-out after a 13-year run, ending with the premiere of ''Billy Crystal: Midnight Train to Moscow'' on October 21, 1989. A spin-off, the ''[[HBO Comedy Half-Hour]]'', airing from June 16, 1994 (with the inaugural special ''Chris Rock: Big Ass Jokes'') until January 23, 1998, maintained a short-form format in which the special's featured comedian presented their routine—usually recorded live at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco—only for 30 minutes.

George Carlin headlined the most comedy specials for the network, making 12 appearances between 1977 and 2008; his first, ''[[George Carlin at USC|On Location: George Carlin at USC]]'' (aired on September 1, 1977), featured Carlin's first televised performance of his classic routine, "[[Seven dirty words|The Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]".<ref name="An Original Voice"/> As other cable channels incorporated comedy specials due to their inexpensive format, HBO began to model its strategy with its comedy specials after its music programming, focusing on a few specials each year featuring popular comedians. (HBO stopped billing its comedy specials under the ''Comedy Hour'' banner after the February 6, 1999, premiere of the Carlin-headlined ''You Are All Diseased''.)<ref name="An Original Voice"/> The network's library of comedy specials would become part of the initial programming inventories of two comedy-focused basic cable networks started by HBO through Time Inc./Time Warner, [[The Comedy Channel (United States)|The Comedy Channel]] (launched on November 15, 1989) and its successor, [[Comedy Central]] (launched on April 1, 1991 as a consolidation of The Comedy Channel and Viacom-owned [[Ha! (TV network)|Ha!]]).

At irregular intervals between 1986 and 2010, HBO served as the primary broadcaster of ''[[Comic Relief USA]]''{{'s}} fundraising specials to help health and welfare assistance programs focused on [[Homelessness in the United States|America's homeless population]]. Developed by Comic Relief founder [[Bob Zmuda]] in conjunction with former HBO executive [[Chris Albrecht]], all eleven HBO editions of the fundraisers aired between the aforementioned years (out of the 15 produced by the charity over its 24-year existence) were hosted by Williams, Crystal and Goldberg, featuring performances by stand-up comedians, [[improvisational comedy|improvisational comics]] and [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]], and appearances by celebrities and politicians as well as documentary segments showing issues affecting the homeless. HBO and other sponsors handled all or most of the incurred costs of the Comic Relief events to ensure that money raised or contributed is distributed to the charity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Comic Relief: The Best of Comedy for the Best of Causes|author=Todd Gold|publisher=[[Avon Books]]|isbn=0-380-97391-X|year=1996}}</ref>

Concert-based music specials are occasionally produced for the channel, featuring major recording artists performing in front of a live audience. One of HBO's first successful specials was ''[[The Bette Midler Show|The Fabulous Bette Midler Show]]'',{{refn|group="note"|name=TBMS|While ''The Bette Midler Show'' is the program's official title, the June 1976 edition of the ''HBO Guide'' also refers to the special as ''The Fabulous Bette Midler Show'', using both titles interchangeably.}} a stage special featuring [[Bette Midler|Midler]] performing music and comedy routines, which debuted on June 19, 1976. It served as the linchpin for the creation of ''[[Standing Room Only (TV series)|Standing Room Only]]'', a monthly series featuring concerts and various stage "spectaculars" (including among others, [[burlesque]] shows, [[Vaudeville]] routines, [[ventriloquism]] and magic performances) taped live in front of an audience; ''SRO'' premiered on April 17, 1977 (with ''[[Ann Corio]]'s 'This Was Burlesque''' as inaugural broadcast).<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Briefs: Pay for play|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/77-OCR/BC-1977-03-28-OCR-Page-0094.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=94|date=March 28, 1977|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=Cable Briefs: Pay for play|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/77-OCR/BC-1977-03-28-OCR-Page-0095.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=95|date=March 28, 1977|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref> For a time in the early 1980s, HBO produced a concert special almost every other month, featuring major music stars such as [[Boy George]] and [[The Who]]. After [[MTV]]'s successful rollout in 1981, the ''Standing Room Only'' series began to produce fewer concerts, eventually ending on May 24, 1987 (with the premiere of the [[Liza Minnelli]] concert special ''Liza in [[London]]''); HBO's concert telecasts also began to focus more on "world class" music events featuring artists such as [[Elton John]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], as well as fundraisers such as [[Farm Aid]].<ref name="An Original Voice"/> ''[[Michael Jackson]]: Live in [[Bucharest]]'', recorded on the first leg of his 1992–93 [[Dangerous World Tour]], holds the record as HBO's highest-rated special with 3.7&nbsp;million viewers (21.4 rating/34 share) watching the October 10, 1992, premiere telecast.

===Sports programming===
[[File:HBO Sports logo.svg|275px|right]]
HBO broadcasts sports-related magazine and documentary series produced by HBO Sports, an in-house production division managed by WarnerMedia News & Sports (previously through Time Warner Sports from 1990 to 2018) that also produced selected sports event telecasts for the channel from its November 1972 launch until December 2018. HBO Sports has been headed by several well-known television executives over the years, including its founder Steve Powell (later head of programming at [[ESPN]]), Dave Meister (later head of the [[Tennis Channel]]), Seth Abraham (later head of [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]]),<ref name="An Original Voice"/> and [[Ross Greenburg]].

====Professional and tournament sports====
As HBO was being developed, the Time Inc./Sterling Communications partnership elected for a local origination channel operated by Sterling Manhattan Cable Television (which served as the progenitor of the [[MSG Network]]) to handle production responsibities for home game broadcasts involving the [[New York Knicks]] and [[New York Islanders]]—both based at [[Madison Square Garden]]—that would be televised on HBO throughout its initial Mid-Atlantic U.S. service area. (HBO founder Charles Dolan, through Cablevision, would purchase the arena and its headlining sports teams in a $1.075-billion joint bid with the [[ITT Corporation]] in August 1994; his son, [[James L. Dolan]], has owned the Knicks and Islanders through [[The Madison Square Garden Company]] since 2015, and Madison Square Garden through [[Madison Square Garden Entertainment]] by way of the former company's 2020 spin-off of its non-sports entertainment assets.) The contracts related to this arrangement dated to May 1969, when Manhattan Cable Television first signed a one-year, $300,000 contract with Madison Square Garden to broadcast 125 sports events held at the arena, and was extended for five additional years in November 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=N.Y.

The first game under this arrangement was the New York Rangers-Vancouver Canucks NHL game that launched Home Box Office on November 8, 1972, and served as its inaugural sports broadcast. For the 1974–75 Rangers and Islanders seasons, HBO contracted MSG announcers for play-by-play and color commentating duties; this created a burden on announcers to fill what otherwise would be [[dead air]] over the HBO feed of the games, since the service does not accept advertising, during the MSG Network's commercial airtime. [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) coverage expanded with HBO's transition into a national satellite service, covering non-New York-based teams in both leagues (including the NBA's [[Milwaukee Bucks]], [[Boston Celtics]], [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Golden State Warriors]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]]; and the NHL's [[Los Angeles Kings]]) under individual agreements as well as select playoff games.<ref name="b&c-hbograbssports">{{cite web|title=HBO grabs more sports|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-11-24-BC-OCR-Page-0041.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=49|date=November 24, 1975|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Program Briefs: Partners.|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/76-OCR/1976-02-16-BC-OCR-Page-0068.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=68|date=February 16, 1976|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref> (The NBA and NHL discontinued their HBO telecasts after their respective 1976–77 seasons.

[[NCAA Division I|NCAA Division I college basketball]] games held at Madison Square Garden and, after becoming a national service, other venues (including the [[National Invitational Tournament]] and the Holiday Basketball Festival) were also carried by the network until the 1978–79 season.<ref name="hboguide1970s">{{cite magazine|title=Various editions of ''HBO On Air''/''HBO Guide''|publisher=Home Box Office Inc.|year=1976–1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Trotters for a price|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/73-OCR/1973-05-28-BC-OCR-Page-0050.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=50|date=May 28, 1973|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref>

HBO representatives contended that regulatory interference over the game broadcasts was prohibited under the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and that it offered only weekday games as WPIX held rights to selected Yankees weekend games; it also contended the anti-siphoning rules did not apply as there was not a per-program charge for the broadcasts.

(That year saw [[Arthur Ashe]] defeat defending champion [[Jimmy Connors]], 6–1, 6–1, 5–7, 6–4, in the [[1975 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Gentlemen's Singles final]], becoming the first Black male to win a Wimbledon singles title.<ref>{{cite news|title=1975: Ashe's Wimbledon win makes history|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/5/newsid_2798000/2798971.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref>) Initially, the HBO telecasts of the tournament mainly consisted of replays culled from other video sources (including the [[BBC]]); HBO Sports began to employ an in-house team of commentators starting with the [[1978 Wimbledon Championships|1978 tournament]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LIVE, FROM WIMBLEDON, HBO SET TO SERVE|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-06-20-9406200170-story.html|author=Steve Nidetz|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 20, 1994|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> Throughout its tenure on the channel, Wimbledon coverage on HBO, which was the first to offer weekday tennis coverage on network television, consisted of singles and doubles events from the early rounds of the tournament; [[Tennis on NBC#Wimbledon coverage|NBC]] (which had the over-the-air broadcast rights to Wimbledon since [[1969 Wimbledon Championships|1969]]) maintained rights to the quarterfinal, semifinal and final rounds as well as weekend early-round matches. (Prior to the arrival of Wimbledon, HBO also carried the men's and women's rounds of the [[U.S. National Indoor Championships]] from 1972 to 1976. Select [[WTA Tour]] events also aired on the network from 1977 to 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable briefs: Net gain for HBO.|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/77-OCR/BC-1977-02-21-OCR-Page-0075.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=79|date=February 21, 1977|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref>)

On June 25, 1999, HBO Sports announced it would not renew its share of the Wimbledon television contract after the conclusion of [[1999 Wimbledon Championships|that year]]'s tournament, ending its 25-year broadcast relationship with the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] event. Seth Abraham, then-president of HBO Sports parent unit Time Warner Sports, said at the time that the decision was guided by a need to "refresh" its programming slate rather than because of issues with financial terms or stagnant viewership. (At the time of the announcement, HBO paid $8&nbsp;million annually—under a $40-million deal over five years—to air the tournament.)<ref>{{cite news|title=TENNIS: WIMBLEDON; HBO Won't Renew Wimbledon Deal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/26/sports/tennis-wimbledon-hbo-won-t-renew-wimbledon-deal.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 26, 1999|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Bids Adieu to Wimbledon|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/hbo-bids-adieu-wimbledon-154866|author=R.

====Boxing====
{{Main|HBO World Championship Boxing}}
HBO was long known for its telecasts of boxing matches (which usually aired on Saturday nights every two to three weeks on average), including those shown on its flagship sports program, ''HBO World Championship Boxing''. Its first boxing telecast, on January 22, 1973, was "[[Joe Frazier vs. George Foreman|The Sunshine Showdown]]", the world [[heavyweight]] championship bout from [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in which [[George Foreman]] defeated [[Joe Frazier]] in two rounds. Outside of high-profile matches held at exotic locales, most of the boxing events shown during HBO's early existence as a regional service were bouts held at Madison Square Garden; once HBO became a national service, boxing coverage began to regularly cover fights held at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] (as part of its television contract with the Los Angeles Lakers and Kings<ref name="b&c-hbograbssports"/>) and other arenas. On September 30, 1975, the "Thrilla in Manila" boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier aired on HBO (under a licensing agreement with television program distributor Video Techniques) and was the first program on the pay cable network to be broadcast via satellite.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Brief|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-08-18-BC-OCR-Page-0018.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=18|date=August 18, 1975|accessdate=July 18, 2020}}</ref> (HBO also provided the first interconnected satellite demonstration broadcast on June 18, 1973, in which a heavyweight championship match between [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] and [[Earnie Shavers]] was relayed via [[Anik (satellite)|Anik A]] to a closed-circuit system at the [[Anaheim Convention Center]] in [[Anaheim, California]] and to a Teleprompter Cable system in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]].)<ref>{{cite web|title=Domsat shows for Anaheim.|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/73-OCR/1973-06-18-BC-OCR-Page-0058.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=60|date=June 18, 1973|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref> Boxing telecasts aired on various scheduled nights through 1979, and mainly aired thereafter on Fridays; boxing telecasts moved to Saturdays full-time in 1987. Through 1979, HBO also carried various [[Golden Gloves|National Golden Gloves]] competitions, and from 1978 to 1979, carried the [[National Collegiate Boxing Association]] championships.

HBO expanded its boxing content to [[pay-per-view]] in December 1990, when it created a production arm to distribute and organize marquee boxing matches in conjunction with participating promoters, TVKO (rebranded HBO PPV in 2001 and HBO Boxing Pay-Per-View in 2013); the first TVKO-produced boxing event was the April 19, 1991 [[Evander Holyfield vs. George Foreman|"Battle of the Ages" bout]] between [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[George Foreman]]. (TVKO signed Holyfield away from Showtime, which had been carrying his matches since its ''[[Showtime Championship Boxing]]'' telecast premiered in 1986, under an agreement with promoter [[Dan Duva]] during Holyfield's reign as cruiserweight champion.)<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO and Showtime Climb Into the PPV Ring|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-12-24-OCR-Page-0028.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=28|date=December 24, 1990|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}<br>{{cite web|title=HBO and Showtime Climb Into the PPV Ring|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-12-24-OCR-Page-0029.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=29|date=December 24, 1990|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref>

HBO expanded its boxing slate on February 3, 1996, when ''[[HBO Boxing After Dark]]'' (titled ''HBO Late Night Fights'' for its inaugural edition) premiered with title fights involving contenders in the [[super bantamweight|junior featherweight]] ([[Marco Antonio Barrera]] vs. [[Kennedy McKinney]]) and [[super flyweight|junior bantamweight]] ([[Johnny Tapia]] vs. Giovanni Andrade) classes. The program typically featured fight cards involving well-known contenders (generally those not designated as "championship" or "title" bouts), and up-and-coming boxing talents that had previously been featured mainly on basic cable boxing showcases (such as ESPN's ''[[Friday Night Fights]]''). A second franchise extension, ''[[KO Nation]]'' (which ran from May 6, 2000 to August 11, 2001), attempted to incorporate [[hip-hop]] music performances between matches involving up-and-coming boxers to attract the show's target audience of males 18 to 24 (later broadened to ages 18 to 34) to the sport; former ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] [[Ed Lover]] was the "face" of the show and acted as its ring announcer. (Internal research stated that males aged 18–34 accounted for 3% of boxing viewership, while men 50 and older made up 60% of the sport's audience.)<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO seeks younger auds with 'KO'|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/hbo-seeks-younger-auds-with-ko-1117778808/|author=R.

On September 27, 2018, HBO announced it would discontinue its boxing telecasts after 45 years, following its last televised match on October 27, marking the end of live sports on the network. (Two additional ''World Championship Boxing''/''Boxing After Dark'' cards would follow that originally scheduled final broadcast, airing respectively on November 24 and December 8, 2018.) HBO's decision to bow out of boxing telecasts was due to factors that included the influx of sports-based streaming services (such as [[DAZN]] and [[ESPN+]]) and issues with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoters]] that hampered its ability to acquire high-profile fight cards, and resulting declining ratings and loss of interest in the sport among HBO's subscribers. Also factoring into the move was HBO parent WarnerMedia's then-recent ownership transfer to AT&T, and the network's efforts to focus around its scripted programming; network executives were of the opinion that "HBO [was] not a sports network."<ref>{{cite news|title=HBO Says It Is Leaving the Boxing Business|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/sports/hbo-boxing.html|author=Wallace Matthews|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=September 27, 2018|accessdate=September 27, 2018}}</ref> Since then, although it no longer produces sporting event telecasts, HBO Sports has continued to exist as a production unit for the network's sports magazine shows and documentaries.

====Magazine and documentary series====
Since 1977, HBO has offered other sports programming in the form of documentary- and interview-based weekly series. On September 22, 1977, HBO premiered the channel's first weekly original series, and its first sports-related documentary and analysis series, ''Inside the NFL'', a program that featured post-game highlights and analysis of the previous week's marquee [[National Football League]] games (using footage provided by [[NFL Films]]) as well as interviews with players, coaches and team management. The program was one of the first studio shows on cable television to offer weekly NFL game reviews, predating the launches of similar football review shows on ESPN and other sports-centered cable networks. ''Inside the NFL'' would go on to become the network's longest-running program, airing for 30 seasons until it ended its HBO run in February 2008. (After HBO canceled the program, ''Inside the NFL'' was subsequently acquired by Showtime, under arrangement with [[CBS Sports]], formally moving to the rival premium channel in September 2008.)<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO fills in its hand for fall|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/77-OCR/BC-1977-09-12-OCR-Page-0064.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=63|date=September 12, 1977|accessdate=July 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Inside the NFL' ending 31-year run on HBO|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/2008-02-06-3063546697_x.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, Showtime go 'Inside the NFL'|url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/news/cbs-showtime-go-inside-the-nfl-1117986847/|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=June 3, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> The network would build upon ''Inside the NFL'' with debut of additional sports talk and documentary programs: the [[Major League Baseball]]-focused ''[[Race for the Pennant]]'' (1978–1992), ''HBO Sports Magazine'' (1981–1982), ''[[On the Record with Bob Costas]]'' (2001–2005) and its revamped iteration ''[[Costas Now]]'' (2005–2009), and ''[[Joe Buck Live]]'' (2009).

Another program built on similar groundwork, ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]''—which eventually became the network's flagship sports [[newsmagazine]]—premiered on April 2, 1995. The hour-long monthly series (originally airing quarterly until 1999), hosted by veteran television journalist and sportscaster [[Bryant Gumbel]], has regularly received positive reviews for its groundbreaking journalism and typically features four stories centering on societal and athletic issues associated with the sports world, investigative reports, and interviews with famous athletes and other sports figures. {{As of|2020}}, ''Real Sports'' has received 33 [[Sports Emmy Awards]] (including 19 for Outstanding Sports Journalism) throughout its run, as well as two Peabody Awards (in 2012 and 2016) and three [[Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=A REALLY GOOD SHOW CELEBRATES 10 YEARS|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/os-xpm-2005-04-08-0504080218-story.html|author=Scott Andera|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=April 8, 2005|accessdate=July 7, 2020}}</ref> Of note, the show's 2004 Sports Emmy win for "Outstanding Sports Journalism" and 2006 duPont–Columbia University Award win for "Outstanding Broadcast Journalism" was for a half-hour hidden camera investigative report—guided by human rights activist [[Ansar Burney]]—into slavery and torture in secret desert camps in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), where boys younger than age 5 were trained in [[camel racing]]. The segment uncovered a carefully hidden [[child slavery]] ring that bought or [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] hundreds of young boys in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], who were then forced to become camel jockeys in the UAE, and questioned the sincerity of U.S. diplomatic pressure on the UAE, an ally to the United States, to comply with the country's ban on children under age 15 from participating in camel racing. The documentary brought worldwide attention to the plight of child camel jockeys in the Middle East and helped the Ansar Burney Trust convince the governments of [[Qatar]] and the UAE to end the use of children in the sport.

In 2001, HBO and [[NFL Films]] began to jointly produce the documentary series ''[[Hard Knocks (TV series)|Hard Knocks]]'', which follows an individual [[National Football League|NFL]] team each season during [[training camp]] and their preparations for the upcoming football season.<ref name="An Original Voice"/><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Hard Knocks|url=http://www.hbo.com/hardknocks/|publisher=Home Box Office, Inc.|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

==Branding==
The original HBO logo—used from the channel's November 8, 1972 launch until February 28, 1975—consisted of a minimalist [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] light array surrounding a left-adjusted "Home Box Office" nameplate, rendered in [[Capitalization|mixed-caps]], accompanied by a ticket stub image (the former and latter signifying the channel's initial film and event programming focus).

The first iteration of the current HBO [[wordmark|lettermark]], designed by then Time-Life [[art director]] Betty E. Brugger,<ref>{{cite news|title=Betty E. Brugger, 86|url=https://www.easthamptonstar.com/archive/betty-e-brugger-86|newspaper=The East Hampton Star|publisher=East Hampton Star Inc.|date=May 18, 2017|accessdate=October 10, 2020}}</ref> was introduced on March 1, 1975; it consisted of bold, uppercase "HBO" text incorporating a [[Bullseye (target)|bullseye]] mark—derived from the [[Tuner (radio)#Television|tuning knobs]] found on then-current television set and cable converter box models—inside the cylindrical "O". Because of inadvertent consumer impressions of the name appearing as “HEO,” as the 1975 design had the "O" obscure the "B"{{'}}s double-curve, marketing firm Bemis Balkind modified it into the current trimmer form; introduced in April 1980, it shifted the "O"—now attached to the “B”{{‘}}s full double-curve—“an eighth of an inch” rightward and widened the letter and bullseye mark's spacing.<ref name="cablevision">{{cite web|title=New Network Look: Hairy, Fat|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/9252967/New-Network-Look-Hairy-Fat|periodical=CableVision|publisher=New York-Group|via=Scribd|pages=7, 10|date=June 7, 1982|accessdate=September 28, 2020}}</ref> (The 1975 and 1980 versions were used concurrently in on-air identifications and certain network promos until the former was fully discontinued in June 1981.) The simplicity of the logo makes it fairly easy to duplicate, of which HBO has taken advantage over the years within its own imaging; a proprietary typeface adapted from [[ITC Avant Garde]] (which, like the similar [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]], had previously been used in some on-air and print marketing dating to 1978) that featured bullseye-like glyphs within the 'D' and 'O' capitals was developed internally in 2008 as a logotype for HBO Sports (including the unit's boxing productions and, by 2012, ''Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel''), the linear HBO high-definition and VOD services, and was later used for HBO Go.

[[File:HBO_Feature_Presentation_(1983).jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Rotating logo segment from the “HBO in Space” feature presentation sequence, used from September 20, 1982 to October 31, 1997.]]
The logo would become widely recognized through a program opening sequence, often nicknamed "HBO in Space," produced in late 1981 by New York City-based production firm [[Liberty Studios]] and used in some capacity from September 20, 1982 to October 31, 1997. (It replaced a series of six CG-animated "HBO Feature Movie" intros used since April 1979, which Canadian pay service [[Crave (TV network)|First Choice Superchannel]] later reused for its 1984–87 movie intros.)<ref>{{cite AV media|title=HBO Intro – Behind the Scenes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agS6ZXBrcng|via=YouTube|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> The original 70-second version begins inside an apartment, where a man tunes a television set's converter box and sits down with his wife to watch HBO. (A variant that begins with a dark cloudscape fading into the city sequence replaced the early version in December 1983.) As the camera pans out of the apartment window, a continuous [[stop motion]] flight (filmed on a computer-controlled camera) occurs over a custom-built model cityscape and countryside set against a painted [[twilight]] [[cyclorama]]. After the camera pans skyward at flight's end, a bursting "stargate" effect (made using two die-cut film slides) occurs, unveiling a [[Chrome plating|chrome-plated]], [[brass]] HBO logo that flies through a [[outer space|starfield]]. As the HBO "[[space station]]" rotates toward the “O", [[ROYGBIV|rainbow-hued]] light rays (created using a [[optical fiber|fiber optic]] lighting rig) encircle that letter's top side—sparkling to reveal its interior wall and a center axis in the bullseye mark area—and streak counter-clockwise inside the "O"{{'}}s inner wall, fading in a slide displaying the program presentation type in three-dimensional, partially [[underline]]d [[Block letters|block text]]—usually the "HBO Feature Presentation" card for theatrical movies, though varied title cards set mainly to custom end signatures of the accompanying theme music (including, among others, "''Standing Room Only''", "HBO Premiere Presentation", "HBO Special", "''On Location''" and "HBO Family Showcase") were used for original programs and weekend prime time films—before more light streaks sweep and shine across the text and create a sparkling fadeout. (An abbreviated version—shown during most non-prime-time programming until October 31, 1986, and thereafter for early-prime-time movie telecasts, aside from premieres and most weekend presentations—commenced from the starburst and the flight of the HBO "space station".)<ref name="yt-hbofp">{{cite AV media|title=HBO 1983 Intro (HBO)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1NKoMNy5bY|via=YouTube|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

Most variants of this sequence—except for the feature presentation, "Saturday Night Movie" and "Sunday Night Movie" versions—were discontinued on November 1, 1986. (In September 1993, the latter two versions were discontinued and the "Feature Presentation" variant was extended to all films aired in early prime time.) Variants of the intro are available on YouTube, including one—a previously unaired version including two children sitting with the aforementioned couple—uploaded to HBO's official YouTube channel; the sequence is also used as a movie introduction at the annual HBO [[Bryant Park]] Summer Film Festival (held since 1992, near HBO's now-former New York City headquarters), and a seldom-used "World Premiere Presentation" variant was featured in the intro of the 2019 HBO stand-up comedy special ''[[Dan Soder]]: Son of a Gary''.<ref name="yt-hbofp"/><ref name="medium-hbofp">{{cite web|title= HBO CELEBRATES STANDING AS THE Best Destination for Theatrical Films by Giving Beloved Saturday Night Feature Intro an Update|url=https://medium.com/warnermediaent/hbo-gives-beloved-saturday-night-feature-intro-an-update-e74822a28e3f|author=Time Warner|website=Medium|date=March 3, 2017|accessdate=June 22, 2020}}</ref> The twelve-note musical signature of the sequence's orchestral fanfare—originally composed for [[Score Productions]] by [[Ferdinand Jay Smith III]] of [[Jay Advertising]], who adapted the theme from the Scherzo movement of [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Ninth Symphony]]—eventually became the network's [[sound trademark|audio logo]] in November 1997, being styled in various arrangements (including [[French horn|horns]], guitar and piano, and sometimes arranged as an abridged nine-note variant) within HBO's programming bumpers and network IDs since then.

Another well-known HBO program opener, designed by [[Pacific Data Images]] and commonly nicknamed "Neon Lights", began non-prime-time movie presentations from November 1, 1986, to October 31, 1997. The sequence, set to a synth and electric guitar theme, begins with a rotation shot of a [[Heliotrope (color)|heliotrope]] HBO logo on a film strip as blue, green and pink light rays penetrate it and four radiating CGI slots; one ray then reaches a field of varied-color spheres that zoom outward to reveal a light purple HBO logo, which is overlaid by a cursive magenta "Movie" script against a black and purple sphere-dotted background.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=HBO Movie Intro (1986-1997) [1080p60 VHS]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZeZ5ralwP0|via=YouTube|date=September 6, 2018|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cablecastings: Face lift|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/86-OCR/BC-1986-09-29-OCR-Page-0014.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=World Radio History|page=14|date=September 29, 1986|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}</ref>

A [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] feature presentation bumper (designed by Pittard Sullivan) harkening the 1982 sequence was used from November 5, 1999 to April 1, 2011. (The sequence replaced a series of six-second feature presentation bumpers designed by Telezign—also used in some capacity as ID bumpers until May 2002—for an accompanying imaging package introduced on November 1, 1997, which showed the HBO logo in different situations/settings—such as appearing as a fish in water, as a celebrity arriving at a film premiere in a [[limousine]], and as a large neon sign outlining the roof of a skycraper.) It commenced outside a movie theater facade (displaying "HBO Feature Presentation" on the marquee), leading into a trek across countryside road, snowy mountain cliffside, and desert settings—respectively passing under an [[Electric power transmission|electrical transmission tower]] and an above-ground [[tunnel]], and through a [[Tank truck|tank trailer cylinder]] shaped in each letter of the HBO lettermark; a metropolitan neighborhood follows, culminating in a flying leap above a bridge between two skyscrapers, and a slower-speed panning shot above an HBO-lettermark-shaped lake outlined by spotlights before a 3D animation of the "Feature Presentation" text forms. (An abbreviated variant that preceded movies aired outside of weekend prime time excerpts the footage following the skyscraper leap.)<ref>{{cite AV media|title=HBO Feature Presentation: 1999 version|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgdnknJuB74|via=YouTube|date=February 2, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

Bylines appearing beneath the logo differ by channel and daypart: "Movie Premiere" (for Saturday film premieres on the main channel), "Movie Presentation" (used by most HBO channels, except HBO Family, as a generic movie bumper) and "Presentaćion de Pelicula" (for movies shown on HBO Latino).]]
Another sequence paying homage to the 1982 opening—designed by Imaginary Forces, and accompanied by a Smith-derived theme arranged by Man Made Music—debuted on March 4, 2017. (It replaced a shorter, minimalist intro based around cascading screenshots from theatrical films then in HBO's program library that was introduced in April 2014—one of two brief sequences by Viewpoint Creative used between April 2, 2011 and March 3, 2017, that were modeled on the network's graphical imaging, preceded by a 2011–14 sequence designed by Viewpoint contractor Jesse Vartanian that centered on a [[letterboxing (filming)|4:1]] [[aurora]] landscape.)<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO Feature Presentation|url=http://www.jvarta.com/hbo-feature-presentation/|website=Jesse Vartanian|accessdate=October 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803085507/http://www.jvarta.com/hbo-feature-presentation/|archivedate=August 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO BRANDING & PROMOTION MOTION GRAPHICS|url=https://kielydesign.com/portfolio/hbo-branding-promotion-graphics/|website=Kiely Design|accessdate=June 30, 2020}}</ref> The live-action/CGI sequence, set inside a [[metropolis]] within the HBO letterforms, features groups of people (respectively a married couple, a pair of teenage siblings watching via [[tablet computer|tablet]] in their bedroom, a family with four children, and a group of adult friends) gathering in their homes to watch an HBO movie; the sequence's second and third living room segments include brief glimpses of the HBO “space station” segment from the 1982 intro. (The full 49-second version is used only for Saturday movie premieres; an eight-second variant—beginning at the reveal of the HBO metropolis letterform—has been used for most film presentations since September 2018. HBO Max has used a four-second variant to open films on its main HBO content portal since it launched in May 2020.)<ref>{{cite web|title=HBO 2017 Feature Presentation Open|url=https://www.imaginaryforces.com/work/hbo-2017-feature-presentation-open|author=Imaginary Forces|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The World of Man Made: HBO Feature Presentation|url=https://www.manmademusic.com/work/hbo-feature-presentations|website=Man Made Music|accessdate=June 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name="medium-hbofp"/><ref>{{cite web|title=HBO updates Feature Presentation intro with a nostalgic twist|url=https://ew.com/tv/2017/03/03/hbo-feature-presentation-intro-update/|author=Rachel DeSantis|periodical=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Time Inc.|date=March 3, 2017|accessdate=June 22, 2020}}</ref>

Unlike other pay television networks (including the multiplex channels of sister channel Cinemax), HBO does not feature in-program [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen logo bugs]] on its main feed and multiplex channels; however, until their respective "The Works"-era logos were discontinued in April 2014, channel-specific on-screen bugs were previously shown during promotional breaks between programs on the six thematic HBO multiplex channels.<ref>HBO on-air programming</ref>
