The '''Kingdom of Hanover''' ({{lang-de|Königreich Hannover}}) was established in October 1814 by the [[Congress of Vienna]], with the restoration of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] to his Hanoverian territories after the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic era]]. It succeeded the former [[Electorate of Hanover]] (known formally as the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg), and joined 38 other sovereign states in the [[German Confederation]] in June 1815. The kingdom was ruled by the [[House of Hanover]], a cadet branch of the [[House of Welf]], in [[personal union]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] since 1814. Since its monarch resided in London, a [[viceroy]], usually a younger member of the [[British Royal Family]], handled the administration of the Kingdom of Hanover.

The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 upon the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] because [[semi-Salic law]] prevented females from inheriting the Hanoverian throne while a dynastic male was still alive. Her uncle thus became the ruler of Hanover, which backed the losing side in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and was conquered by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1866. It then became a [[Province of Hanover|Prussian province]]. Along with the rest of Prussia, Hanover became part of the [[German Empire]] upon the [[unification of Germany]] in January 1871. Briefly revived as the [[State of Hanover]] in 1946, the state was later merged with some smaller states to form the current state of [[Lower Saxony]] in [[West Germany]].

==History==
{{main|History of Hanover (region)}}
The territory of Hanover had earlier been a principality within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] before being elevated into an [[prince-elector|electorate]] in 1708, when Hanover was formed by union of the dynastic divisions of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, excepting the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

After his accession in 1714, George Louis of the House of Hanover ascended the throne of Great Britain as [[George I of the United Kingdom|George I]], and Hanover was joined in a [[personal union]] with Great Britain. Descendants of Hanoverians who fought alongside the British in the [[War of 1812]] remain in Canada. In 1803, Hanover was conquered by the French and Prussian armies in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in 1807 joined it to territories from Prussia and created the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], ruled by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s youngest brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte]]. French control lasted until October 1813 when the territory was overrun by Russian [[Cossacks]]. The [[Battle of Leipzig]] shortly thereafter spelled the definitive end of the Napoleonic [[client state]]s, and the electorate was restored to the [[House of Hanover]].

The terms of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814 not only restored Hanover, but elevated it to an independent kingdom with its Prince-Elector, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III of Great Britain]], as [[King of Hanover]]. The new kingdom was also greatly expanded, becoming the fourth-largest state in the German Confederation (behind Prussia, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]) and the second-largest in north Germany.

Under George III's six-year reign, he never visited the Kingdom. Having succumbed to [[dementia]] prior to the elevation of Hanover, it is unlikely he ever understood that he had gained an additional kingship nor did he take any role in its governance. Functional administration of Hanover was usually handled by a [[viceroy]], which during the [[British Regency|later years of George III's reign]] and the reigns of kings [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] from 1816 to 1837, was [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|Adolph Frederick]], George III's youngest surviving son. When [[Queen Victoria]] succeeded to the British throne in 1837, the 123-year personal union of Great Britain and Hanover ended. Unlike in Britain, [[Semi-Salic law]] operated in Hanover, which excluded the accession to the throne by a female while any male of the dynasty survived. [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]], now the eldest surviving son of George III, succeeded to the throne as King of Hanover; Adolph Frederick the younger brother, and long-time Viceroy, returned to Britain.

During the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (1866), Hanover attempted to maintain a neutral position, along with some other member states of the [[German Confederation]]. Hanover's vote in favor of the mobilisation of Confederation troops against Prussia on 14 June 1866 prompted  Prussia to declare war. The outcome of the war led to the dissolution of Hanover as an independent kingdom and it was [[annexation|annexed]] by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], becoming the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]]. Along with the rest of Prussia, it became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871.

After [[George V of Hanover|George V]] fled Hanover in 1866, he raised forces loyal to him in the [[Netherlands]], called the [[Guelphic Legion]]. They were eventually disbanded in 1870. Nevertheless, George refused to accept the Prussian takeover of his realm and claimed he was still the legitimate king of Hanover. His only son, [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover]], inherited this claim upon George's death in 1878.  Ernest Augustus was also first in line to the throne of the [[Duchy of Brunswick]], whose rulers had been a junior branch of the House of Hanover.  In 1884, that branch became extinct with the death of [[William, Duke of Brunswick|William]], a distant cousin of Ernest Augustus.  However, since Ernest Augustus refused to renounce his claim to annexed Hanover, the [[Bundesrat (German Empire)|Bundesrat]] of the German Empire ruled that he would disturb the peace of the empire if he ascended the throne of Brunswick. As a result, Brunswick was ruled by a regency until 1913, when his son, also named [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus]], married the German Emperor's daughter, [[Viktoria Luise of Prussia|Princess Viktoria Luise]] and swore allegiance to the German Empire.  The Duke then renounced his claim to Brunswick in favor of his son, and the Bundesrat allowed the younger Ernest Augustus to take possession of Brunswick as a kind of [[dowry]] compensation for Hanover.

The [[German-Hanoverian Party]], which at times supported [[secession]] from the [[Reich]], demanded a separate status for the province in the Reichstag. The party existed until banned by the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] government.

===Revival and modern history===
[[File:KrkHannover.png|thumb|260px|Map of the Kingdom of Hanover (until 1866), recreated in 1946 as the State of Hanover]] With Prussia in agony{{dubious|date=August 2020}} and on the verge of official dissolution (1947), in 1946 Hanoverian politicians took advantage of the opportunity and advocated that the [[Control Commission for Germany (British Element)]] (CCG/BE) revive Hanoverian statehood, reconstituting the Prussian Province of Hanover as the [[State of Hanover]]. The state saw itself in the tradition of the kingdom. Its Prime Minister, [[Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf]], played a central role when the state of [[Lower Saxony]] was founded just a few months later by merging Hanover with several smaller states, with the city of Hanover as its capital. The former territory of Hanover makes up 85 percent of Lower Saxony's territory, and the state continues to use the old Hanover coat of arms.

==Reorganisation of religious bodies in Hanover==
{{See also|Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover}}
The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church was the [[state church]] of the Kingdom of Hanover with the King being {{lang|la|{{Interlanguage link multi|summus episcopus|de}}}} (Supreme Governor of the Lutheran Church). Regional [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistories]] supervised church and clergy. These were in [[Aurich]], a simultaneously Lutheran and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] consistory dominated by Lutherans (for [[East Frisia]]) and the Lutheran consistories in [[Hanover]] (for the former [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] proper), in [[Ilfeld]] (for the [[County of Hohenstein]], a Hanoverian [[exclave]] in the Eastern [[Harz]] mountains), in [[Osnabrück]] (for the former [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück]]), in [[Otterndorf]] (existed 1535–1885 for the [[Land of Hadeln]]) as well as in [[Stade]] (existed 1650–1903, until 1885 for the former [[Bremen-Verden]] proper without Hadeln, then including the complete [[Stade (region)|Stade region]]). A [[superintendent (ecclesiastical)|general superintendent]] chaired each consistory.

In 1848, the Lutheran parishes were democratised by the introduction of [[presbytery (church polity)|presbyteries]] ({{lang-de|Kirchenvorstände}}, singular {{lang|de|Kirchenvorstand}}; literally: ''church boards''), elected by all major male parishioners and chairing each congregation in co-operation with the [[pastor]], being before the sole chairman. This introduction of presbyteries was somewhat revolutionary in the rather hierarchically structured Lutheran church. In 1864, [[:de:Carl Lichtenberg|Carl Lichtenberg]], Hanoverian minister of education, cultural and religious affairs (1862–65), persuaded the ''Ständeversammlung'' (lit. ''Estates Assembly'', the Hanoverian parliament) to pass a new law as to the constitution of the Lutheran church. The constitution provided a state [[synod]] (parishioners' parliament, {{lang-de|Landessynode}}). But its first session only materialised in 1869 when, after the 1866 [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover, the Hanoverian Lutherans desired a representative body separate from Prussian rule, though it was restricted to Lutheran matters only.

After the Prussian conquest in 1866, on 19 September 1866, the day before the official Prussian annexation took place and with the last {{lang|la|summus episcopus}}, King [[George V of Hanover]], in exile, the Kingdom's six consistories joined to form today's still-existing church body ([[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover|Lutheran State Church of Hanover]]). An all-Hanoverian consistory, the {{lang|de|Landeskonsistorium}} (state consistory), was formed with representatives from the regional consistories.

While the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] congregations in formerly-Prussian East Frisia had a common roof organisation with the Lutherans there ("Coetus") and the [[Reformed churches|Reformed Church]] in the former [[County of Bentheim]], then being the state church, had fully established church bodies for Bentheim only ({{lang-de|Königlich-Großbrittanisch-Hannoverscher Ober-Kirchenrath}}, {{lang-en|Royal British-Hanoverian Supreme Church Council}}), the Calvinist congregations elsewhere in Hanover were in a somewhat sorry state. Though some Calvinist congregations of [[Huguenot]] origin were organised in the ''Lower Saxon Confederation'' ({{lang-de|Niedersächsische Konföderation}}). The Lutheran church being the state church of Hanover also supervised the Calvinist [[diaspora]] parishes outside East Frisia and Bentheim. In 1848 the new Hanoverian law also provided for presbyteries in these Calvinist parishes, which exactly fit the presbyterian structure of Calvinism.<ref>But only in 1882&nbsp;— long after the Prussian annexation of Hanover&nbsp;— the inappropriate supervision by Lutheran consistorials ended, when the [[Evangelical Reformed Church&nbsp;– Synod of Reformed Churches in Bavaria and Northwestern Germany|Evangelical Reformed Church of the Province of Hanover]] emerged, comprising all the Calvinist congregations in the prevailingly Lutheran [[Province of Hanover]]. The simultaneously Lutheran and Calvinist consistory in Aurich was made the consistory of that church body, becoming an exclusively Calvinist body only in 1922, following the constitutional reorganisation of the church bodies after the [[Weimar Constitution]] had decreed the separation of church and state in 1919.</ref>

[[Catholic]]s formed an overall minority in Hanover, but regionally majorities in the former prince-bishoprics. By the annexations in 1803 and 1814 Hanover had become a state of three Christian denominations. In 1824 Hanover and the [[Holy See]] thus agreed to integrate diaspora parishes which were located in prevailingly Protestant areas, until then supervised by the Roman Catholic [[Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Germany|Vicariate Apostolic of the Nordic Missions]], into the existing dioceses of the former prince-bishoprics, whose diocesan territories were thus extended into the diaspora areas.

[[Jews]] lived all over Hanover in [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. Until 1806, they were not allowed to reside in some areas. By the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalian]] and [[First French Empire|French]] annexations in 1807 and 1810 all-male inhabitants in later restituted Hanover became Westphalian or French citizens of equal rights, though on 17 March 1808 [[Napoleon I|Napoléon Bonaparte]] restricted the rights of Jews in the French-annexed territory by his so-called {{lang|fr|[[Infamous Decree|décret infâme]]}}. The Jewish congregations became subject to French regional [[Consistory (Judaism)|Jewish consistories]] or the {{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Westphalian Consistory of the Israelites|he|3=הקונסיסטוריה היהודית של וסטפליה}}, respectively. When Hanover resumed independence and sovereignty in 1813 its government deprived the Jews their legal equality. Arguing it was the French or Westphalian state and not Hanover, which had [[Jewish emancipation|emancipated the Jews]], the government took the decisions of the [[German Confederation]] on the rights of the Jews, in [[Johann Smidt]]'s manipulated formulation, as the legal grounds.<ref>In the final revision of the decisions of the [[Congress of Vienna]] on the rights of the Jews, Smidt&nbsp;— unauthorised and unconsented by the other parties&nbsp;— had changed the text from "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them "in" the confederal states", by replacing a single word, which ensued serious consequences, into: "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them "by" the confederal states." cf. [[Heinrich Graetz]], ''Geschichte der Juden von den ältesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart'': 11 vols., Leipzig: Leiner, 1900, vol. 11: 'Geschichte der Juden vom Beginn der Mendelssohnschen Zeit (1750) bis in die neueste Zeit (1848)', p. 317. Emphasis not in the original. Reprint of the edition last time revised by the author himself: Berlin: arani, 1998, {{ISBN|3-7605-8673-2}}. In the German original: "Es werden den Bekennern des jüdischen Glaubens die denselben "in" ["von", respectively] den einzelnen Bundesstaaten bereits eingeräumten Rechte erhalten."</ref>

In 1842, Hanover finally granted equal rights to Jews and promoted to build up Jewish congregations, where this did not already happen earlier, and a superstructure of four regional land-rabbinates. These were the [[Emden Land-Rabbinate]] (ambit: [[Aurich (region)|Aurich]] and [[Osnabrück (region)|Osnabrück regions]]), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Hanover Land-Rabbinate|de|3=Landrabbinat Hannover}} (ambit: [[Hanover (region)|Hanover]] and [[Lüneburg (region)|Lüneburg regions]]), the [[Hildesheim Land-Rabbinate]] (ambit: [[Hildesheim (region)|Hildesheim region]] and [[Berghauptmannschaft Clausthal|Clausthal Mountain Captaincy]]), and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Stade Land-Rabbinate|nds|3=Landrabbinat Stood}} (ambit: [[Stade (region)|Stade region]]).<ref>Jörg Schneider, ''Die jüdische Gemeinde in Hildesheim: 1871—1942'', Hildesheim: Stadtarchiv, 2003, (=Schriftenreihe des Stadtarchivs und der Stadtbibliothek Hildesheim / Stadtarchiv und Stadtbibliothek Hildesheim; vol. 31), p. 3; simultaneously: Göttingen, Univ., Diss., 1999. {{ISBN|3-931987-11-6}}.</ref>

In many diaspora areas Jews regarded this a progress and a burden alike, because of the implied financial burden for [[rabbi]]s and religion teacher, [[synagogue]]s or [[cheder|schools]]. The local authorities now requested that the Jewish congregations establish synagogues and Jewish education for the pupils. The [[rabbi#The role of the rabbi in the last 200 years|land-rabbins]], chairing the land-rabbinates, simultaneously fulfilled religious and state functions, like supervising Jewish elementary schools and the teaching of Jewish religion in all schools. The Kingdom of Hanover was thus one of the few states within the [[German Confederation]], where rabbins held a similar semi-state authoritative position as to Jews as did, e.g., Lutheran clergy towards Lutherans.<ref>After the Prussian annexation the constitution of Hanover's four land-rabbinates came under threat to be abolished, because in Prussia proper the government hindered as much as possible the establishment of nationwide Jewish organisations, let alone such which it would grant official recognition. In the end, Prussia respected the existing Hanoverian land-rabbinate constitution, which continued to exist&nbsp;— modified according to the separation of state and religion in 1919 by the [[Weimar constitution]]&nbsp;— until the Nazi Reich's government ''de facto'' abolished the constitution in 1938.</ref>

==Kings of Hanover==
{{See also|King of Hanover|House of Hanover}}
In 1813, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] was restored to his Hanoverian territories, and in October 1814 they were constituted as the independent '''Kingdom of Hanover''' at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. The [[personal union]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] ended in 1837 on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] because the succession laws in Hanover, based on [[Salic law]], prevented a female inheriting the title if there was any surviving male heir (in the United Kingdom, a male took precedence only over his own sisters). In the  [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, Hanover was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and became the [[Province of Hanover]].

==Pretenders to the Throne of Hanover (1866–present)==
{{main|Line of succession to the former Hanoverian throne}}

* [[George V of Hanover|George V]] (20 September 1866&nbsp;– 12 June 1878)
* [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]] (12 June 1878&nbsp;– 14 November 1923)
* [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus]] (14 November 1923&nbsp;– 30 January 1953)
* [[Ernest Augustus, Prince of Hanover (1914–1987)|Ernest Augustus]] (30 January 1953&nbsp;– 9 December 1987)
* [[Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 1954)|Ernest Augustus]] (9 December 1987&nbsp;– present)

==Territory and administrative subdivisions==
[[File:BadIburgGrenzsteinKgrHannoverundPreußen.JPG|thumb|right|Border marker of Hanover]]
The Congress of Vienna instituted a territorial adjustment between Hanover and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] to form more contiguous borders. Hanover increased its area substantially, gaining the [[Bishopric of Hildesheim|Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim]], [[East Frisia]], the Lower [[County of Lingen]] and the northern part of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Münster]]. Hanover also annexed territories that had previously been ruled in personal union by its Elector, such as the Duchies of [[Bremen-Verden]] and the [[County of Bentheim]]. It lost those parts of [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] to the northeast of the [[Elbe]], which was assigned in personal union to [[Denmark]], except the [[Amt Neuhaus]]. Further small [[exclave]]s in the east were lost.

Hanover thus comprised a number of territories, which had been [[Imperial Estate]]s within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Their respective governments, now called provincial governments, were organised according to partially very old traditions, including different levels of [[estates of the realm|estate]] participation in rule. In 1823, the kingdom was reorganised into ''high-bailiwicks'' ({{lang-de|Landdrosteien}}, singular: {{lang|de|Landdrostei}}), each led by a ''high-bailiff'' ({{lang-de|[[Landdrost#In 19th century Hanover|Landdrost]]}}) according to unitary standards, thus doing away with the inherited provincial peculiarities.

The high-bailiwicks were subdivided into bailiwicks ({{lang-de|Ämter}}, singular {{lang|de|Amt}}), presided by a bailiff (''[[Amtmann]]'', plural ''[[Amtleute]]'').<ref>This translation follows Jakob Heinrich Kaltschmidt, ''Neues vollständiges Wörterbuch der englischen und deutschen Sprache nebst einem kurzen Abrisse der englischen und der deutschen Sprachlehre'' ({{lang-en|A new and complete Dictionary of the English and German Languages with two Sketches of Grammar}}, 6th, rev. and enriched ed., Leipsic: Otto Holtze, 1890, p. 283. No ISBN</ref> The high-bailiwicks, named after their capitals, were the following:

* [[Aurich (region)|Aurich]], comprising former East Frisia
* [[Hanover (region)|Hanover]], comprising about the former [[Principality of Calenberg]] in the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]
* [[Hildesheim (region)|Hildesheim]], comprising the former Brunswick-Lüneburg [[Principality of Grubenhagen]] and the former [[Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim]]
* [[Lüneburg (region)|Lüneburg]], comprising the former Brunswick-Lüneburg [[Principality of Lüneburg]] and the remainder of Saxe-Lauenburg areas
* [[Osnabrück (region)|Osnabrück]], comprising the former County of Bentheim, the former Lower County of Lingen, and the former [[Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück]]
* [[Stade (region)|Stade]], comprising the former Duchies of Bremen-Verden

The Hanoverian subdivisions into high-bailiwicks and bailiwicks remained unchanged until 1 April 1885, when they were replaced by Prussian-style provinces ({{lang|de|[[Regierungsbezirk]]e}}) and districts (''[[Districts of Prussia|Kreis]]e'').

==Army==
The Kingdom of Hanover maintained an army after the Napoleonic Wars. In 1832, King William IV of Hanover issued his troops with [[British Army]] uniforms, but they differed slightly from their original British versions. When the personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 and Ernst August ascended to the crown of Hanover, he replaced their uniforms with [[Prussian Army]]-style ones, which included the [[pickelhaube]] spiked helmet for his Guard Corps. By 1866 they wore a more Austrian style of uniform, with only the guard corps keeping the Prussian one. During the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the Hanoverian Army fought and defeated the Prussians during its march south towards Austria, at the [[Battle of Langensalza (1866)|Battle of Langensalza]]. However it was later surrounded and forced to surrender to Prussia.<ref>König, Lutz (1999). [http://www.koenigreich-hannover.de/ukindex2.html Kingdom of Hanover - German Civil War 1866]. Retrieved 3 April 2017.</ref>

==Standard, ensign and coat of arms==
After the [[personal union]] with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] ended in 1837 with the accession of [[Queen Victoria]], Hanover kept the [[Coat of arms of the United Kingdom|British royal arms]] and [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|standard]]{{Citation needed|reason=The flag charts by Colter and Johnson suggest the Royal Standard only displayed the Saxon Steed after 1837|date=May 2014}}, only introducing a new Crown (after the British model). The centre of this coat of arms and royal standard included the original arms of Hanover, which consisted of the two lions of the [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]], the rampant lion with hearts of [[Lüneburg]] and the horse of Hanover itself, surmounted by the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] for the Holy Roman office of Archbannerbearer/Archtreasurer). As Hanover no longer was ruled by the British monarchs, the arms of Hanover was simultaneously removed from the British coat of arms and royal standard, so it was no longer identical with that of the Kingdom of Hanover.
