==History==
[[File:Martin-Mitchell Mansion - Naper Settlement - Naperville Illinois.jpg|thumb|right|The Martin-Mitchell Mansion, within the [[Naper Settlement]] outdoor museum, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in DuPage County, Illinois|National Register of Historic Places]]]]

In July 1831, [[Joseph Naper]] arrived at the west bank of the [[DuPage River]] with his family and friends to found what would be known as Naper's Settlement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/872352/kanedupage_county_il_toponym_origins/|title=Several Towns Named After Founders and Heroes|date=December 28, 1999|newspaper=The Daily Herald|page=220|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|access-date=August 17, 2014}} {{Open access}}</ref> Among those original settlers were Naper's wife Almeda Landon, his brother John with wife Betsy Goff, his sister Amy with husband [[John Murray (Naperville founder)|John Murray]], and his mother Sarah. Their arrival followed a nearly two-month voyage across three Great Lakes in the Naper brothers' [[schooner]], the ''Telegraph''. Also on the journey were several families who remained in the settlement that would become [[Chicago]], including that of Dexter Graves<ref name="WhyEverybodyLovesNaperville">{{cite web|url=http://chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/March-2006/Why-Everybody-Loves-Naperville/ |title=Why Everybody Loves Naperville |author=Rodkin, Dennis |work=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]] |date=March 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref> who is memorialized in [[Graceland Cemetery]] by the well-known [[Lorado Taft]] statue "[[Eternal Silence (sculpture)|Eternal Silence]]" (also known as "the Dexter Graves Monument").

By 1832, over one hundred settlers had arrived at Naper's Settlement. Following the news of the [[Indian Creek massacre]] during the [[Black Hawk War]], these settlers were temporarily displaced to [[Fort Dearborn]] for protection from an anticipated attack by the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] tribe. [[Fort Payne (Illinois)|Fort Payne]] was built at Naper's Settlement, the settlers returned and the attack never materialized. The [[Pre-Emption House]] was constructed in 1834, as the Settlement became a stage-coach stop on the road from Chicago to [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]]. Reconstructions of Fort Payne and the Pre-Emption House stand as part of [[Naper Settlement]] [[List of open-air and living history museums in the United States|outdoor museum village]], which was established by the [[Naperville Heritage Society]] and the [[Naperville Park District]] in 1969 to preserve some of the community's oldest buildings.<ref name="WhyEverybodyLovesNaperville" />

In 1855, Sybil Dunbar came to Naperville as its first recorded black female resident; she died in 1868 and was buried in Naperville Cemetery on Washington Street.<ref name="dailyherald1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150528/news/150528633/ |title=Naperville honors its first female black resident with grave marker |publisher=DailyHerald.com |date= May 28, 2015|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref> A commemorative marker honoring her was placed in the cemetery in 2015.<ref name="dailyherald1"/>

After DuPage County was split from [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] in 1839, Naper's Settlement became the DuPage [[county seat]], a distinction it held until 1868. Naper's Settlement was incorporated as the Village of Naperville in 1857, at which time it had a population of 2,000. Reincorporation as a city occurred in 1890.

In 1887, Peter Edward Kroehler established the Kroehler Manufacturing Company's factory in Naperville along the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy tracks.  Kroehler Manufacturing became the world's largest furniture manufacturer, and a major employer in Naperville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.napersettlement.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/313|title=313|website=Naper Settlement}}</ref>  The company closed the Naperville factory in 1978.  In 1987, the site was redeveloped into upscale commercial and apartment properties, as Fifth Avenue Station.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-06-04/features/9506040147_1_kroehler-manufacturing-furniture-manufacturing-business-north-central-college|title=Kroehler Made His Mark In Naperville|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=September 2, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

On April 26, 1946, Naperville was the site of one of the worst [[Naperville train disaster|train disasters]] in Chicago history. Two [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] trains, the ''[[Advance Flyer]]'' and the ''[[Exposition Flyer]]'', collided 'head to tail' on a single track just west of the Loomis Street grade crossing. The accident killed 45 and injured approximately 127 passengers and/or crew members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/April-2013/Naperville-Crash/|title=This Is the 67th Anniversary of the Horrible Naperville Train Crash You've Never Heard Of|last=Doster|first=Adam|date=April 26, 2013|website=chicagomag.com|publisher=Chicago Magazine|access-date=August 23, 2013}}</ref> This event is commemorated in a metal inlay map of Naperville on the southeast corner of the [[Nichols Library]]'s sidewalk area.<ref>{{Flickr-inline2|photos/mss2400/541678584/in/pool-naperville|Nichols Library Map – Naperville Illinois}}</ref> In 2012, author Chuck Spinner published ''The Tragedy at the Loomis Street Crossing'' which details the tragedy and gives the stories of the 45 persons who perished.<ref name = Spinner>''The Tragedy at the Loomis Street Crossing'' 2012 By Chuck Spinner {{ISBN|978-1-4685-5594-3|978-1-4685-5593-6}} {{LCCN|2012904250}}</ref>  On April 26, 2014, a memorial entitled Tragedy to Triumph was dedicated at the train station.

A predominantly rural community for most of its existence, Naperville experienced a population explosion beginning in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s and 1990s, following the construction of the East-West Tollway (now known as the [[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]]) and [[Interstate 355]] (originally known as the North–South Tollway, now the Veterans Memorial Tollway). It has nearly quadrupled in size as the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]'s [[urban sprawl]] brought [[corporation]]s, [[employment|jobs]], and [[wealth]] to the area.<ref name="WhyEverybodyLovesNaperville"/>

The March 2006 issue of ''[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]'' magazine cites a mid-1970s decision to make and keep all parking in downtown Naperville free to keep downtown Naperville "alive" in the face of competition with [[Westfield Fox Valley|Fox Valley Mall]] in Aurora and the subsequent sprawl of strip shopping malls. Parking meters were taken down, parking in garages built in the 1980s and 1990s is free, and parking is still available on major [[thoroughfare]]s during non-peak hours.<ref name="WhyEverybodyLovesNaperville"/>

Naperville marked the 175th anniversary of its 1831 founding in 2006. The anniversary events included celebrations, concerts and a balloon parade.<ref name="Naper175">{{cite web|title=Naper Settlement Annual Report|url=http://www.napersettlement.museum/history/Annual%20Report%202006.pdf|publisher=Naperville Heritage Society|access-date=December 23, 2010|year=2006}}</ref>

Portions of the city of Naperville drain to the West Branch of the [[DuPage River]] within [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]].<ref name="watershed"/> Specifically, in the flood of 1996, downtown businesses in the City of Naperville incurred significant damage.

===Moser Tower and Millennium Carillon===
{{main|Moser Tower and Millennium Carillon}}
In 1999, Naperville was designated a White House Millennium Community, due to the construction of the Moser Tower and Millennium Carillon. The 158-foot-tall Moser tower is just on north of Aurora Avenue and at the base of Rotary Hill within the Riverwalk Park complex. The tower's design won an award for "Best Custom Solution" from the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pci.org/view_file.cfm?file=AS-02FA-2.PDF|title=Millennium Carillon – Naperville, Ill.|date=Fall 2002|work=Ascent Magazine|publisher=Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute|page=26|access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>

The Millennium [[Carillon]] is designated as one of the four largest carillons in the world, with 72 bronze bells weighing from 10 pounds to the 6-ton "Captain Joseph Naper Bell".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Naperville 175 Years of Success|last=Stephanie|first=Penick|publisher=CommunityLink Publication|year=2005|isbn=0-9770027-0-5|pages=41}}</ref> It is one of only four in the world that span six octaves. It was dedicated in an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] event on June 29, 2000, with a reception attended by over 15,000, and a performance by the Naperville Municipal Band and the Naperville Men's Glee Club and Festival Chorus. The Carillon is both manually and also computer-playable, with most performances done by hand, but with half the bells played by a computer-controlled system at set times during the day. At present, the Carillon is operational and tours are available after concerts. Disputes over funding the completion of the tower were debated before the Naperville City Council during the fall of 2005 (and are still not resolved).{{Update after|2011|08|7|reason=needs to have date when resolved or not}}

===Transportation===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

====Roads====
{{see also|Roads and freeways in Chicago}}
As a typical American suburb, Naperville uses automobiles as its main mode of transportation. The [[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]] (the tolled portion of [[Interstate 88 (west)|Interstate 88]]) runs near the north edge of Naperville with 3 exits serving the city at IL 59, Winfield Rd. (in Warrenville), and Naperville Rd. [[Interstate 55]] runs about 5 miles south of the city, through [[Bolingbrook, Illinois|Bolingbrook]] and [[Romeoville, Illinois|Romeoville]]. People wishing to reach Naperville from I-55 exit at Weber Road and head north.

[[US Route 34]] Ogden Avenue enters Naperville in the west at [[Illinois Route 59]] coming from [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]] and [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]] at an east-northeast/west-southwest angle. At Rickert Drive, US 34 Ogden Ave curves to the north and goes under the BNSF Railroad bridge before turning east at North Aurora Road/Raymond Dr. US 34 Ogden Ave exits the east side of the city at Naper Blvd and continues into [[Lisle, Illinois|Lisle]] and [[Downers Grove, Illinois|Downers Grove]].

[[Illinois Route 59]] travels north and south coming into town from [[Plainfield, Illinois|Plainfield]] on the south (just south of 111th Street) and [[Warrenville, Illinois|Warrenville]] on the north (at I-88). Route 59 is also the west border with Aurora from US 34 Ogden Ave to the BNSF Railroad bridge. A Diverging Diamond Interchange, the first in Northeast Illinois, was completed in 2015 at the junction of IL Route 59 and Interstate 88.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/news/ct-abn-route59-diamond-st-0922-20150921-story.html|title=Opening of Route 59, I-88 interchange goes smoothly|last=Lord|first=Steve|newspaper=Aurora Beacon-News|language=en-US|access-date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>

Main east–west streets include:
111th St. (Hassert Blvd.), 95th St., 87th St., 75th St., Aurora Ave., North Aurora Rd., Ogden Ave. (US Route 34), Diehl Rd., Rickert Dr., Royce Rd., Bailey Rd., Hobson Rd., and Chicago Ave.

Main north–south streets include:
IL Route 59, Raymond Dr., Book Rd., River Rd., West St., Naperville-Plainfield Rd., Modaff Rd., Washington St., Naper Blvd.(Naperville Rd.), and Wehrli Rd.

From 75th Street south Naperville numbered east–west streets roughly follow the same grid layout as the City of Chicago. In other words, if 75th Street continued east past its terminus at Illinois Route 83, in [[Willowbrook, DuPage County, Illinois|Willowbrook]], it would eventually be the same 75th Street as found in Chicago city limits. However, the older part of Naperville has a second numerical grid, starting downtown at Main and Benton, with 4th and 5th Avenues just north of the BNSF tracks, and continuing through 15th Avenue. The difference is that the numbers in the older system go up from downtown, traveling south to north, and the other grid's numbers go up as you travel north to south. There is also a geographical-based naming system, with West Street and North Street defining the older boundaries of the city. Along with these are streets named after the city they lead to, i.e., Naper/Plainfield Road heads towards Plainfield, while Aurora Avenue leads to Aurora and Chicago Avenue to Chicago (it becomes Maple Ave. in neighboring [[Lisle, Illinois|Lisle]] before becoming 55th Street in [[Downers Grove, Illinois|Downers Grove]]).

====Train service====

[[File:Pace 2692.jpg|thumb|[[Pace (transit)|Pace]] bus at the [[Naperville (Amtrak station)|Naperville Amtrak/Metra station]]]]
The first rail link to Chicago dates to 1864, established by the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]]. Naperville currently has three tracks belonging to the [[BNSF Railway]] that run through the north end of town, with passenger rail service provided by [[Metra]] and [[Amtrak]]. Amtrak's four daily trains through Naperville are the ''[[Illinois Zephyr]]'' and ''[[Carl Sandburg (train)|Carl Sandburg]]'' (both destined for [[Quincy, Illinois]]), the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' (destined for [[Emeryville, California]]), and the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' (destined for Los Angeles). A third Metra station was planned on the [[Suburban Transit Access Route|Suburban Transit Access Route ("STAR")]] at Wolf's Crossing. The project is no longer active since 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120118/news/701189697/|title=Do fast buses on I-90 mean falling STAR line?|last=Pyke|first=Marni|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

====Bus service====
[[Pace (transit)|Pace]] provides rush hour bus service to the Metra stations, and previously, through 2008, had provided for local midday service. Both services have always been operated under contract; First Student, a national transportation management firm, is the current contract operator. In addition, Pace directly operates bus route 530 from Naperville to [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]] (which serves Aurora's [[Fox Valley Mall]]) and bus route 714 from Naperville to [[Wheaton, Illinois|Wheaton]] (which serves the [[College of DuPage]]), both through its Fox Valley division. Pace also directly operates route 888, a rush hour express route named the "Tri-State Flyer", from [[Homewood, Illinois|Homewood]] and [[South Holland, Illinois|South Holland]] to corporate employment sites in the western suburbs, including those in the northern part of Naperville; this route is operated by Pace through its South division. Intercity bus service in Naperville consists of a route from Chicago and Naperville to [[Davenport, Iowa]], and points further west, operated by both [[Burlington Trailways]] and [[Greyhound Lines]]. The Burlington Trailways buses stop at the [[Naperville (Amtrak station)|Naperville]] Metra and Amtrak station, downtown on Fourth Avenue; the Greyhound Lines buses stop at the [[Route 59 (Metra station)|Route 59]] Metra station.

====Airport====
[[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Midway International Airport]] are approx. {{convert|28|and|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} away from Naperville, respectively.

The [[DuPage Airport]], a general aviation airport serving private and charter jets, is 14 miles from downtown Naperville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcr1.com/5010web/airport.cfm?Site=DPA|title=AirportIQ 5010|website=www.gcr1.com|access-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref>

There is also one private airport, the Naper Aero Club field, designation LL-10, on the western edge of town. The field is notable for being the home of the [[Lima Lima Flight Team]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-08-06/entertainment/9203100951_1_flying-planes-t-34|title=Naperville-based Flight Team Believes In Military Precision|last=McKuen|first=Pamela|date=August 6, 1992|access-date=January 1, 2017|via=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>
