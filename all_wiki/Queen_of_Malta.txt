From 1964 to 1974, [[Elizabeth II]] was '''Queen of Malta''' ({{lang-mt|Reġina ta' Malta}}). The [[State of Malta]] was an independent [[sovereign state]], sharing a monarch with other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the [[United Kingdom]]. The Queen's constitutional roles in Malta were mostly delegated to a [[List of Governors-General of Malta|Governor-General]].

[[Malta]] became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth]] in 1974, and the Queen was replaced as [[head of state]] by the [[President of Malta]].

==History==
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II visiting RAF Hal Far 1954.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Elizabeth II reviewing British naval personnel in Malta, 1954]]
[[Elizabeth II]] became Queen of Malta with the passage of the ''Malta Independence Act 1964''. The Act transformed the British [[Crown Colony of Malta]] into the independent [[State of Malta]]. The Queen's executive powers were delegated to and exercised by the [[List of Governors-General of Malta|Governor-General of Malta]].

Elizabeth II remained the head of state of Malta until the amendment of the [[Constitution of Malta]] on 13 December 1974, which abolished the monarchy and established the [[Malta|Republic of Malta]] and the office of [[President of Malta]].

Elizabeth II officially visited the Crown Colony of Malta in 1954 (3–7 May) and the State of Malta in 1967 (14–17 November).<ref name=visits>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/QueenandCommonwealth/Commonwealthvisitssince19521.aspx|title=Commonwealth visits since 1952|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref> She referenced her 1967 visit in her [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas Broadcast]] that year, saying: "Today Malta is independent, with the Crown occupying the same position as it does in the other self-governing countries of which I am Queen. This is the opening of a new and challenging chapter for the people of Malta and they are entering it with determination and enthusiasm."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/christmas-broadcast-1967|title=Christmas Broadcast 1967|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>

Prior to becoming queen she stayed on the islands four times between 1949 and 1951 to visit her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was stationed in Malta as a serving officer in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/hmthequeen/accessioncoronation/accessionandcoronation.aspx|title=Accession and Coronation|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/DiamondAnniversary/60facts.aspx |title=60 facts |publisher=Royal Household |work=Official website of the British monarchy |accessdate=10 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008194238/http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/DiamondAnniversary/60facts.aspx |archivedate=October 8, 2015 }}</ref>
