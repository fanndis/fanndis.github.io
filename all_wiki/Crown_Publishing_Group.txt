==History==

===Outlet Book Company===
The company was founded in 1933 as the Outlet Book Company by Nat Wartels and Bob Simon.<ref name="Wartels" /><ref name="History" /> Outlet Book Company began by featuring overstock and [[remaindered book]]s, but soon moved into reprints of [[backlist]], out-of-print, largely non-fiction titles, then into reprints of best-selling fiction and non-fiction, and eventually into original titles. It was under the Crown name that they began to publish original content in 1936.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/08/obituaries/nat-wartels-88-the-chairman-of-the-crown-publishing-empire.html|title=Nat Wartels, 88, the Chairman Of the Crown Publishing Empire|last=McDowell|first=Edwin|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en}}</ref>
