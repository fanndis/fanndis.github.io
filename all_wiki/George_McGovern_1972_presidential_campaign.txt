The '''George McGovern presidential campaign of 1972''' began when [[United States Senator]] [[George McGovern]] from [[South Dakota]] launched his second candidacy for the [[President of the United States|Presidency of the United States]] in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to win the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], winning only in the [[District of Columbia]] and the state of [[Massachusetts]]. McGovern vied to become the first South Dakota native to become president.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weinger|first=Mackenzie|title=Former Sen.

==Leading up to the announcement==
McGovern had run [[George McGovern#1968 presidential and Senate campaigns|a short presidential campaign in 1968]], acting as a stand-in for the assassinated [[Robert F. Kennedy]] leading up to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. McGovern then spent the remainder of the general election campaign ensuring [[George McGovern#1968 presidential and Senate campaigns|his own re-election to the Senate]].

But following the 1968 convention, he had planned on running for president again, a decision he solidified in January 1969.<ref name="anson-243">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 243–244.</ref> He began hiring legislative aides who could double as campaign policy staff, press secretaries, and the like.<ref name="anson-243" /> McGovern hired an agent to book speaking engagements, and beginning in early 1969 began doing an average of three appearances a week.<ref name="anson-243" />

During 1969, McGovern headed the [[Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection]], later often referred to as the "McGovern commission," which was chartered to redesign the Democratic nomination system after the messy and confused nomination struggle and convention of the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]].<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972,'' pp. 17–20.</ref> Due to the influence of former [[Eugene McCarthy]] and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of [[caucus]]es and [[primary election|primaries]], and mandated quotas for proportional black, women, and youth delegate representation.<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972,'' pp. 24–33.</ref>

[[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Whip]] [[Ted Kennedy]], the younger brother of both assassinated Kennedys, had been the early favorite to win the 1972 nomination, but his hopes were derailed by his role in the July 1969 [[Chappaquiddick incident]].<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972,'' pp. 74–75.</ref>

McGovern's early efforts were beset by organizational problems and much activity without plan or result in polls.<ref name="anson-259">Anson, ''McGovern,'' pp. 259–264.</ref>  He began replacing most of the campaign staff.  In March 1970, he met [[Gary Hart]] in [[Denver]], and soon hired him to be his Western political affairs coordinator; a couple of months later, he became McGovern's national campaign director.<ref name="anson-259"/> Shortly thereafter he opened a New York office and hired the first woman as Executive Director, Phyllis Holtzer, a former Robert Kennedy staffer.  At a July 25, 1970, get-together at McGovern's farm in [[St. Michael's, Maryland]], the McGovern campaign was restarted.<ref name="anson-259"/>

The favorite for the Democratic nomination by then was [[Edmund Muskie]],<ref name="'70s 298">Frum, ''How We Got Here,'' p. 298.</ref><ref name="anson-267"/> the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 vice-presidential nominee]], who had especially benefited from a speech on the eve of the Congressional elections in November 1970 that made a calm but effective response to statements by President [[Richard Nixon]] and Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] impugning the patriotism of Democrats.<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972,'' p.76.</ref>

==Announcement==
McGovern announced his candidacy on January 18, 1971, in the form of a televised speech from the studios of [[KELO-TV]] in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]],<ref name="anson-267">Anson, ''McGovern'', pp. 267–268.</ref> and in letters sent to many a newspaper editorial board and potential backer.<ref name="nyt011971">{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30C11F7345C107B93CBA8178AD85F458785F9 | title=McGovern Enters '72 Race, Pledging Troop Withdrawal | author=Apple Jr., R.

Apple, Jr }}</ref>  The early entry, nearly two years before the election date, was designed to give him time to overcome Muskie's large lead.<ref name="nyt011971"/>

In his announcement speech, McGovern promised to withdraw every American soldier from Indochina if elected.<ref name="nyt011971"/>  He said economic conditions would also be improved by an end to the war and reduced military spending.<ref name="nyt011971"/>  McGovern declared some themes of his campaign:
<blockquote>
I seek the presidency because I believe deeply in the American promise and can no longer accept the diminishing of that promise. ... I make one pledge above all others—to seek and speak the truth with all the resources of mind and spirit I command. ... I seek to call America home to those principles that gave us birth.<ref name="anson-267"/><ref name="nyt011971"/></blockquote>

At the time of his announcement, McGovern ranked fifth among Democrats in a presidential preference [[Gallup Poll]].<ref name="weil-33"/>

==Campaign staff and policy team==
Future Senator [[Gary Hart]] (who subsequently sought the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination and emerged as the frontrunner for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination before his campaign was prematurely thwarted by an extramarital liaison) was McGovern's campaign manager. Future President [[Bill Clinton]] (with assistance from his wife and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham]]) managed the McGovern campaign's operations in Texas.

Taking their cue from the McGovern–Fraser Commission, Hart and future [[United States District Judge]] [[Rick Stearns]] (an expert on the new system) devised a strategy to focus on the 28 states holding caucuses instead of primary elections. They felt the nature of the caucuses made them easier (and less costly) to win if they targeted their efforts.<ref name="purdum">{{cite web|last1=Purdum|first1=Todd|title=Indulging Iowa|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/11/purdum-iowa-201111|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=January 21, 2013}}</ref> Recruited as a [[Harvard University]] senior by Hart, 22-year-old pollster [[Pat Caddell]] also played an integral role in paving McGovern's route to the nomination by encouraging him "to increase his populist rhetoric and tour factories instead of obsessing about the Vietnam War."

[[MIT Sloan School of Management]] professor [[Edwin Kuh]] headed McGovern's economic advisory panel, for which he recruited [[Lester Thurow]] and other academic economists.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/obituaries/prof-edwin-kuh-is-dead-at-61-pioneer-in-econometrics-at-mit.html |title=Prof. Edwin Kuh is dead; Pioneer in Econometrics at M.I.T. |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 10, 1986 }}</ref>

Abner "Abby" Levine served as Vice Chairman of Finance. Levine and former Robert Kennedy staffer Phyllis Holtzer established the New York office, helped to organize at least five big events, and met regularly with the senator. They assisted [[Warren Beatty]] with his production of [[Together for McGovern]] which filled [[Madison Square Garden]] and reunited [[Nichols and May]], [[Simon and Garfunkel]], and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]. Singer [[Dionne Warwicke]] also performed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/15/archives/rock-n-rhetoric-rally-in-the-garden-aids-mcgovern.html |last=Phillips |first=McCandlish |author-link=McCandlish Phillips |date=June 15, 1972 |title=Rock 'n' Rhetoric Rally in the Garden Aids McGovern |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Political positions==
In the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]], McGovern ran on a [[political platform|platform]] that advocated withdrawal from the Vietnam War in exchange for the return of American [[prisoners of war]]<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 122.</ref> and amnesty for draft evaders who had left the country,<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 360.</ref> an anti-war platform that was anticipated by McGovern's sponsorship of the 1970 [[McGovern-Hatfield amendment]] that sought to end U.S. participation in the war by Congressional action. However, during a meeting with Democratic Governors conference, [[Mike O'Callaghan|Nevada Governor Mike O'Callaghan]] asked McGovern what he would do if the North Vietnamese refused to release American POW's after a withdrawal. McGovern responded, "Under such circumstances, we'd have to take action," although he did not say what action.<ref name=Front>{{cite news|date= June 19, 1972 |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,877739,00.html |title=McGovern Moves Front, Maybe Center |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=2011-01-21}}</ref>

McGovern's platform also included an across-the-board, 37% reduction in defense spending over three years;<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 123.</ref> and a "demogrant" program that would replace the personal income tax exemption with a $1,000 tax credit as a minimum-income floor for every citizen in America,<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 125.</ref> to replace the welfare bureaucracy and complicated maze of existing public-assistance programs. Its concept was similar to the [[negative income tax]] long advocated by economist [[Milton Friedman]], and by the Nixon administration in the form of [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]'s [[Family Assistance Plan]], which called for a minimum family grant of $1,600 per year, later raised to $2,400. The personal income tax exemption later became $1,000 under President Reagan. (As Senator, McGovern had previously sponsored a bill, submitted by the National Welfare Rights Organization, for $6,500 [[guaranteed minimum income]] per year to families, based on need.)<ref>White, ''The Making of the President 1972'', p. 190.</ref> In addition, McGovern supported ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].

==Campaign developments 1971==
The establishment favorite for the Democratic nomination was [[Ed Muskie]],<ref name="'70s 298"/> the moderate who acquitted himself well as the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] Democratic vice-presidential candidate. In August 1971 Harris polling amid a growing economic crisis, Muskie came out on top of incumbent Nixon if the election had been held that day.<ref name="'70s 298"/>

Established Washington press figures such as [[Walter Lippman]] and [[Jack Germond]] did not think McGovern had a chance of winning, proclaiming him "too decent" a man, not strong enough for a combative campaign, and too reflexively liberal.<ref>Dougherty, ''Goodbye, Mr. Christian'', pp. 15–16.</ref>  [[Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder]] gave 200–1 odds against McGovern winning.<ref name="weil-33">Weil, ''The Long Shot'', p. 33.</ref>

==Primary campaign 1972==
{{see also|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1972}}
In the initial event of the campaign season, McGovern placed a strong third in the Iowa caucuses. How much attention and momentum this actually generated for his campaign is still debated.<ref name="purdum" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Squire|first1=Peverill|title=The Iowa Caucuses, 1972-2008: A Eulogy|journal=The Forum: Politics of Presidential Selection|date=2005|volume=4|issue=4}}</ref>

Prior to the [[New Hampshire primary]], the "[[Canuck letter]]" was published in the ''[[Manchester Union-Leader]]''. The letter, whose authenticity was later brought into question, claimed that Muskie had made disparaging remarks about [[French Canadian|French-Canadians]]. Subsequently, the paper published an attack on the character of Muskie's wife Jane, reporting that she drank and used off-color language. Muskie made an emotional defense of his wife in a speech outside the newspaper's offices during a snowstorm. Though Muskie later stated that what had appeared to the press as tears were actually melted snowflakes, the press reported that Muskie broke down and cried.<ref>"[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/remember/muskie_3-26.html Remembering Ed Muskie]", ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Online NewsHour]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], March 26, 1996</ref>  Muskie did worse than expected in the primary, while McGovern came in a surprisingly close second. While Muskie's campaign funding and support dried up, McGovern picked up valuable momentum in the following months.

McGovern did attract some celebrity supporters, McGovern recalled that "[[Carole King]] helped me; [[Lauren Bacall]]; [[James Taylor]]; [[Paul Newman]]; [[Goldie Hawn]]; [[Linda Ronstadt]]; [[Burt Lancaster]]; [[Jack Nicholson]]; [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]. [[Shirley MacLaine]] appeared with me. [[Warren Beatty]] came out, too, and did a lot of fundraising for me.

They were with me from the beginning to the end."<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2005/02/20/what-might-have-been/26244db0-14e5-48e1-a982-983bd626496f/| work=The Washington Post | first=Michael | last=Leahy | date=February 20, 2005 }}</ref> On April 15, 1972, Beatty produced [[Four for McGovern]], a fundraising concert for McGovern at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] in [[Greater Los Angeles]] in front of an audience of 18,000 people.<ref name="spada-legend">{{cite book |title=Streisand: The Woman and the Legend |last1=Spada |first1=James |last2=Nickens |first2=Christopher |year=1981 |publisher=Dolphin Books, an imprint of [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=[[Garden City, New York]] |isbn=0-385-17567-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/streisandwoman00spad/page/149 149] |url=https://archive.org/details/streisandwoman00spad/page/149 }}</ref> Carole King, James Taylor, [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] performed.

After McGovern had won the Massachusetts primary on April 25, 1972, journalist [[Robert Novak]] phoned Democratic politicians around the country, who agreed with his assessment that blue-collar workers voting for McGovern did not understand what he really stood for.<ref name=PCOLMeetthepress/> On April 27, Novak reported in a column that an unnamed Democratic senator had talked to him about McGovern and said:<ref name=PCOLKansascitystar/> "The people don’t know McGovern is for amnesty, abortion and legalization of pot. Once middle America - Catholic middle America, in particular - finds this out, he’s dead."<ref name=PCOLKansascitystar/> Although McGovern only supported the [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalization of marijuana]] and maintained that legalized abortion fell under the purview of [[states' rights]], he became known as the candidate of "amnesty, abortion and acid."<ref name=PCOLMeetthepress>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19694666 |work=[[Meet the Press]] | title=Interview with Robert Novak |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=2007-07-15 |access-date=2011-01-21}}</ref><ref name=PCOLColumbiatribune>{{cite news | url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2007/aug/20070819Feat004.asp | newspaper=[[Columbia Tribune]] | title=A slice of history: Biographers of the late U.S. Sen.

[[File:GeorgeStanleyMcGovern.jpg|thumb|right|200px|McGovern speaking during the campaign. June 30, 1972]]
Feminist leader [[Gloria Steinem]] was reluctant to join the McGovern campaign. Though she had brought in McGovern's single largest campaign contributor in 1968, she "''still'' had been treated like a frivolous pariah by much of McGovern's campaign staff."  And in April 1972, Steinem remarked that he "still doesn't understand the women's movement."<ref>Steinem, Gloria. ''Outrageous Acts''. p. 114.</ref>

Despite concerns from moderate and conservative Democrats, paradigmatic [[Cold War liberal]] and early [[neoconservative]] [[Henry M. Jackson]] failed to gain traction against McGovern and only made real news later in the campaign as part of the "Anybody but McGovern" coalition.

A lighter incident occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign.  The state's former governor, [[Frank B. Morrison|Frank Morrison]], who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought to counter the [[Henry M. Jackson|Jackson]] and [[Hubert Humphrey|Humphrey]] campaigns' effective use of the accusation.  During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say --"  At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana."  This produced cries of disappointment in the audience.  He continued, "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, but I tell you--"  Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: "But I say to you that George McGovern is ''against'' tampering with our state laws on abortion."  Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation.  I'll get the oldsters for you, and you take care of the young ones as you think best."  McGovern won the Nebraska primary.<ref>Boller, ''Presidential Campaigns'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fq8pY-vThDUC&pg=PA339&lpg=PA339 339].</ref>

McGovern lost several primaries, including Florida to [[George Wallace]]. In the South, Wallace drew support based on a long history as an ardent segregationist and was well known in the region, indeed nationally, for his actions to prevent racial integration of the University of Alabama. He did well in the South (he won every single county in the [[Florida]] primary) and among Democrats  who were alienated and dissatisfied with more liberal positions opposing the [[Vietnam War]] and greater inclusion of African-Americans and women in the Democratic Party. What might have become a forceful campaign was cut short when Wallace was shot and left paralyzed in an assassination attempt while campaigning. Wallace did win the [[Maryland]] primary, but his near assassination effectively ended his campaign.

But in the end, McGovern succeeded in winning the nomination by winning primaries through [[grassroots]] support in spite of establishment opposition.

==Democratic National Convention==
{{see also|1972 Democratic National Convention}}
The new rules for choosing and seating delegates created an unusual number of rules and credentials challenges. Many traditional Democratic groups such as organized labor and urban constituents had small representation at the convention.  Their supporters challenged the seating of relative political novices, but for the most part were turned back by the supporters of McGovern, who during the [[United States presidential primary|presidential primaries]] had amassed the most delegates to the convention by using a [[grassroots]] campaign that was powered by [[opposition to the Vietnam War]]. Many traditional Democratic leaders and politicians felt that McGovern's delegate count did not reflect the wishes of most Democratic voters. [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia Governor]] [[Jimmy Carter]] helped to spearhead a "Stop McGovern" campaign.

The stop-McGovern forces tried unsuccessfully to alter the delegate composition of the [[California]] delegation. The California primary was "winner-take-all," which was contrary to the delegate selection rules; while McGovern only won the California primary by a 5% electoral margin, he took all 273 of their delegates to the convention. Although the anti-McGovern group argued for a proportional distribution of the delegates, the McGovern campaign stressed that the rules for the delegate selection had been set and the Stop McGovern alliance was trying to change the rules after the game. Maneuvering by the McGovern campaign ensued during the convention as they sought to ensure the Democratic nomination despite attempts by the Humphrey campaign and other candidates to block McGovern. As with the credential fight, McGovern's army carried the day, effectively handing the nomination to McGovern.

The [[Illinois]] primary required voters to select individual delegates, not presidential candidates. Most Illinois delegation members were uncommitted and were controlled or influenced by [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] and [[Cook County Democratic Party]] chairman [[Richard J. Daley]]. The delegation was challenged by McGovern supporters arguing that the results of the primary did not create a diverse enough delegation in terms of women and minorities. The credentials committee, headed by [[Patricia Roberts Harris]], rejected the entire elected delegation, including elected women and minorities, and seated an unelected delegation led by Chicago Alderman William S. Singer and civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] that pledged to McGovern.

McGovern thus secured enough delegates to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] to win the party's nomination.

Most polls showed McGovern running well behind incumbent President [[Richard Nixon]], except when McGovern was paired with [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. McGovern and his campaign brain trust lobbied Senator Kennedy heavily to accept the bid to be McGovern's [[running mate]]. Much to their surprise, he continually refused their advances, and instead suggested such figures as [[House Ways and Means Committee]] chairman [[Wilbur Mills]] of [[Arkansas]] and [[Mayor of Boston|Boston Mayor]] [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]].<ref name="time">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906135-7,00.html|title=Introducing... the McGovern Machine|date= July 24, 1972 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=2008-09-07}}</ref>

Thereafter, a number of high-profile Democrats, including Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], Senator [[Walter Mondale]], former Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]], Senator [[Edmund Muskie]], Senator [[Abe Ribicoff]]<ref name=help>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/opinion/29mcgovern.html "George McGovern, Help Wanted"], The New York Times, August 29, 2008</ref> and Senator [[Birch Bayh]] turned down offers to run on the ticket. The [[National Women's Political Caucus]] urged the selection of a woman such as [[Shirley Chisholm]] or, after Chisholm expressed disinterest in the vice presidency, [[Sissy Farenthold]], but McGovern did not seriously consider choosing a female running mate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.utexas.edu/farenthold/national/vice-presidential-nomination/|title=Frances Tarlton "Sissy" Farenthold {{!}} Vice Presidential Nomination|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Assignment America; 124; Sissy Farenthold: A Texas Maverick|url=http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_75-257d807m|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>

Nevertheless, McGovern and his staff felt that a Kennedy-style figure was needed to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]]: an urban Catholic leader with strong ties to organized labor and other working-to-lower middle class constituencies. McGovern informed Kennedy that he was seriously considering Kevin White, who had informed McGovern he was available. Belying his previous support, Kennedy vetoed White when the Massachusetts delegation threatened to boycott the convention due to White's previous endorsement of Muskie.<ref name="time" />

Once it became apparent that White's candidacy was infeasible, McGovern asked Senator [[Gaylord Nelson]] to be his running mate. Nelson declined but suggested Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]] of Missouri, whom McGovern ultimately chose. McGovern's team only conducted minimal vetting of Eagleton as the senator had been previously recommended by many of the prospective running mates.<ref name=help />

Eagleton was relatively unknown to many of the delegates. This, along with the inexperience of many of the delegates who were wary after the protracted infighting, caused the vice presidential balloting to become almost a farce. In addition to Eagleton, the delegates insisted on nominating seven other candidates for vice president, including Senator [[Mike Gravel]] of [[Alaska]], former Massachusetts Governor [[Endicott Peabody]] and [[Frances Farenthold|Frances "Sissy" Farenthold]] of the [[Texas House of Representatives]]. By the time the roll call finally began, the delegates were in a prankish mood, casting ballots for the [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[Archie Bunker]], [[Martha Beall Mitchell]], New Mexico Lt. Governor Roberto Mondragon, and CBS-TV's [[Roger Mudd]].

With hundreds of [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s either actively supporting Nixon or angry at McGovern for one reason or another, the vote was thus chaotic, with votes scattered over 70 candidates. The eventual winner was Eagleton, who accepted the nomination despite not personally knowing McGovern very well, and privately disagreeing with many of McGovern's policies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/weird.facts/votes.shtml |title=All The Votes...Really |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=2011-01-21}}</ref>

Eventually, Eagleton secured the nomination but the last-day-of-school atmosphere of the proceedings dragged out the process. When Eagleton was at last confirmed, it was 1:40&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="time" /> This delay forced the acceptance speeches of the candidates to be given well past the television [[prime time]] hours; McGovern and Eagleton delivered their acceptance speeches at around 3 a.m. This probably hurt the McGovern campaign by not creating the so-called "convention bounce."

==General election campaign 1972==
{{see also| United States presidential election, 1972}}

===Party disunity===
The [[McGovern Commission]] changes to the convention rules marginalized the influence of establishment Democratic figures (some of whom had lost the nomination to McGovern). Many refused to support him, with some switching their support to the incumbent President [[Richard Nixon]] through a campaign effort called "[[Democrats for Nixon]]". This also had the effect of leaving the McGovern campaign at a significant disadvantage in funding compared to Nixon.

In addition, McGovern was repeatedly attacked by associates of Nixon, including the infamous [[Watergate burglaries|Watergate break-in]], which eventually led to Nixon's resignation in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|author=Julian Borger |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1165126,00.html |title=Who is Karl Rove? &#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= March 9, 2004|access-date=2011-01-21 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ridgeway, James |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0529,ridgeway,66005,6.html |title=Mondo Washington: Grime Pays |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |date=2005-07-12 |access-date=2011-01-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704082212/http://villagevoice.com/news/0529,ridgeway,66005,6.html |archive-date=2008-07-04 |author-link=James Ridgeway }}</ref>

===Eagleton controversy===
Just over two weeks after his nomination, it was reported that Thomas Eagleton had received [[electroshock therapy]] for [[clinical depression]] during the 1960s. Eagleton had made no mention of his earlier hospitalizations to McGovern or McGovern's staff, and in fact decided with his wife to keep them secret from McGovern while he was flying to his first meeting with the Presidential nominee.

Eagleton had promised to bring his medical records for McGovern's review, but he did not. He initially concealed the fact that he was on [[Chlorpromazine|Thorazine]], a powerful antipsychotic; when he did disclose his use of the medication, he noted that it couldn't be discovered by the press because it was issued under his wife's name. McGovern spoke to two of Eagleton's doctors, both of whom expressed grave concerns about Eagleton's mental health.  Ultimately, a portion of Eagleton's medical records was leaked to McGovern, at which point McGovern saw a reference to "manic depression" and "suicidal tendencies."

McGovern had failed to act quickly when he learned of the mental health problems (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed and he wondered what effect dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.

Though many people still supported Eagleton's candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and columnists questioned his ability to handle the office of Vice President. McGovern said he would back Eagleton “1000%”,<ref name=yearinreview>[http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1972/1972-Election/12305688736666-2/ Year in Review: 1972 Election] UPI Radio</ref> and a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine poll taken at the time found that 77 percent of the respondents said Eagleton's medical record would not affect their vote. Nonetheless, the press made frequent references to his 'shock therapy', and McGovern feared that this would detract from his campaign platform.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/26/MN9NVQGO2.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Obama bounces back - speech seemed to help | first=Joe | last=Garofoli | date=March 26, 2008}}</ref> The episode had placed McGovern in a "no-win" situation.  If he kept Eagleton, the selection did not look good for the decision-making ability of the McGovern team, while if he removed Eagleton, he appeared to be weak and vacillating.

McGovern subsequently consulted confidentially with preeminent psychiatrists, including Eagleton's own doctors, who advised him that a recurrence of Eagleton's depression was possible and could endanger the country should Eagleton become president.<ref>McGovern, George S., ''Grassroots: The Autobiography of George McGovern'', New York: Random House, 1977, pp. 214-215</ref><ref>McGovern, George S., ''Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism'', New York: Random House, 1996, pp. 97</ref><ref>Marano, Richard Michael, ''Vote Your Conscience: The Last Campaign of George McGovern'', Praeger Publishers, 2003, pp. 7</ref><ref>''The Washington Post'', "George McGovern & the Coldest Plunge", [[Paul Hendrickson]], September 28, 1983</ref><ref>''The New York Times'', "'Trashing' Candidates" (op-ed), George McGovern, May 11, 1983</ref> On August 1, Eagleton withdrew at McGovern's request. This perceived indecisiveness was disastrous for the McGovern campaign.

A new search was begun by McGovern. Kennedy, Muskie, Humphrey and Ribicoff again declined the nomination, as did recent [[Democratic National Committee]] Chair and former [[Postmaster General]] [[Larry O'Brien]] and [[Florida Governor]] [[Reubin Askew]]. McGovern ultimately chose former [[United States Ambassador to France]] and former [[Peace Corps#Directors|Peace Corps Director]] [[Sargent Shriver]], a brother-in-law of [[John F. Kennedy]] and Ted Kennedy.<ref name=yearinreview /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Liebovich|first1=Louis|title=Richard Nixon, Watergate, and the Press: A Historical Retrospective|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275979157|page=[https://archive.org/details/richardnixonwate00lieb/page/53 53]|url=https://archive.org/details/richardnixonwate00lieb/page/53}}</ref> He was officially nominated by a special session of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. By this time, McGovern's poll ratings had plunged from 41 to 24 percent.

McGovern's handling of the controversy was an opening for the Republican campaign to raise serious questions about his judgment. The Eagleton controversy also put the McGovern campaign off message and was speculated at the time to perhaps be a harbinger of what would become McGovern's subsequent landslide loss.<ref>See, for example, ''[[Time Magazine]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s August 7, 1972, cover story, for a contemporaneous view of the McGovern campaign's handling of this issue.</ref>

===Watergate===
Nixon ran a campaign with an aggressive policy of keeping tabs on perceived enemies, and his campaign aides committed the [[Watergate burglaries|Watergate]] burglary to steal [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] information during the election.

Nixon's level of personal involvement with the burglary was never clear, but his tactics during the later coverup would eventually destroy his public support after the election and lead to his resignation.

===Issues and strategies===
[[Image:George McGovern UH.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|200px|McGovern speaking at a rally at the [[Miller Outdoor Theatre]] in [[Houston, Texas]], on October 16, 1972, during the final weeks of the campaign. The sign behind him says "Houston is McGovern Country". ]]
McGovern ran on a platform of ending the Vietnam War and instituting guaranteed minimum incomes for the nation's poor.  The Vietnam issue, which remained the one McGovern was most passionate about, did not work for him overall; a majority of the electorate thought that Nixon was a strong leader who would secure "peace with honor".<ref name="mann-705">Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 705.</ref>  McGovern, in contrast, was seen as too strident and too tied to radical elements of the anti-war movement.<ref name="mann-705"/>  By 1972, Nixon's strategy of [[Vietnamization]] had resulted in the withdrawal of most U.S. troops, without appearing to have given in to the Communists, and thus popular dissatisfaction with the war did not accrue to McGovern's benefit.<ref name="mann-705"/>

Nixon's so-called "[[southern strategy]]" of reducing the pressure for school desegregation and otherwise restricting federal efforts on behalf of blacks had a powerful attraction to northern blue-collar workers as well as southerners.<ref>[[Richard Nixon presidential campaign, 1968]]</ref> McGovern called the Watergate burglaries "the kind of thing you expect under a person like Hitler."<ref name="'70s 46">Frum, ''How We Got Here'', p. 46.</ref>

===Final days===
An infamous incident took place late in the campaign. McGovern was giving a speech and was heckled by a Nixon supporter, to whom he said "Kiss my ass."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/the-gallant-idealism-of-george-mcgovern/263909/ | title=The Gallant Idealism of George McGovern | publisher=The Atlantic | date=October 21, 2012 | access-date=November 14, 2020}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, "KMA" buttons were being worn by people in the crowds at McGovern rallies.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-senator-george-mcgovern-72-democratic-presidential-nominee-dies-at-90 | title=Former Senator George McGovern, '72 Democratic presidential nominee, dies at 90 | publisher=Fox News | date=October 21, 2012 | access-date=November 14, 2020}}</ref> Several years later, McGovern observed [[Mississippi]] Senator [[James Eastland]] looking at him from across the Senate floor and chuckling to himself. He subsequently approached McGovern and asked, "Did you really tell that guy in '72 to kiss your ass?" When McGovern smiled and nodded, Eastland replied, "That was the best line in the campaign."<ref>Boller, ''Presidential Campaigns'', p. 340.</ref>

In the last week of the campaign, [[Henry Kissinger]] spoke of the ongoing [[Paris Peace Talks]] and said that "We believe that peace is at hand."<ref name="mann-709">Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 709.</ref>  McGovern angrily responded that Nixon had no plan for ending the war and that U.S. bombers would keep flying.<ref name="mann-709"/>

===Results===
The [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|general election]] was held on November 7. This election had the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since 1948, with only 55 percent of the electorate voting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |first1=History.com |title=Nixon re-elected president |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nixon-re-elected-president |website=HISTORY.com |access-date=20 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

In the election, the McGovern/Shriver ticket suffered a 60.7 percent to 37.5 percent defeat to Nixon and Agnew.<ref name="mann-710">Mann, ''A Grand Delusion'', p. 710.</ref> At the time, it was the second biggest landslide in American history, with [[U.S. Electoral College|Electoral College]] totals of 520 to 17. McGovern's two electoral vote victories came in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]; McGovern failed to win his home state of South Dakota, a state that had delivered for the Democrats in only three of the previous 18 presidential elections in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Leip |url=http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/index.html |title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |access-date=2011-01-21}}</ref>  The 1972 election was the first in American history in which a Republican candidate carried every Southern state. Nixon's percentage of the popular vote was only slightly less than [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s record in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964 election]], and his margin of victory was slightly larger. [[Barry Goldwater]], who was defeated by Johnson in 1964, sent McGovern a newspaper political cartoon depicting the two of them together "like Grandpa and Granny [patterned after the painting ''[[American Gothic]]''] linked by our defeats", with a note scribbled "George -- If you must lose, lose big."<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/>

In his [[telegram]] to Nixon conceding defeat, McGovern wrote, "I hope that in the next four years you will lead us to a time of peace abroad and justice at home. You have my full support in such efforts."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,712179,00.html |title=After the Landslide: Nixon's Mandate  |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 20, 1972 |access-date=2011-01-21}}</ref>

During the campaign, actress [[Shirley MacLaine]] authored the book ''McGovern: The Man and His Beliefs''.<ref>MacLaine, Shirley, ''McGovern: The Man and His Beliefs'', New York: W.W. Norton & Company Limited, 1972</ref>  McGovern later wrote that MacLaine "campaigned virtually nonstop for two years", and that actor [[Warren Beatty]] (MacLaine's brother) "broke new ground" in organizing and producing the campaign's benefit concerts.<ref>McGovern,''Grassroots'', pp. 172, 178.</ref>

Beatty produced the all-star concert [[Four for McGovern]] featuring [[Barbra Streisand]] at the [[Los Angeles Forum]], which grossed $300,000.<ref>McGovern, ''Grassroots'', p. 178.</ref> Other Beatty concerts were held in San Francisco, Lincoln, and Cleveland. In June, Beatty produced the concert [[Together for McGovern]] which reunited [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].

==Legacy==
After the resignation of Nixon following the [[Watergate scandal]], a bumper sticker became popular: "Don't blame me - I'm from Massachusetts".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/11/04/bay_staters_grappling_with_legacy_of_rejection/ |title=Bay Staters grappling with legacy of rejection - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=2004-11-04 |access-date=2011-01-21 |first=Don |last=Aucoin}}</ref>

McGovern recognized the mixed results of the changes that he made to the Democratic nominating convention, saying, "I opened the doors of the Democratic Party and 20 million people walked out."<ref>Jonah Goldberg, [http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzViZWNhOTk2ZTY3YzRmYjU3NjU4YWY0ODg1M2FjNjY= "Nedrenaline Rush"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111135344/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzViZWNhOTk2ZTY3YzRmYjU3NjU4YWY0ODg1M2FjNjY%3D |date=2008-01-11 }} August 11, 2006 ''[[National Review]]''</ref> Despite McGovern's landslide defeat, the Democratic Party did have a more socially and culturally liberal voter base than in the past due in large part to the efforts of McGovern's campaign.

Robert Novak was accused of manufacturing the quote that led to the "amnesty, abortion and acid" label.<ref name=PCOLKansascitystar/> To rebut the criticism, Novak took Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]] to lunch after the campaign and asked whether he could identify Eagleton as the source.<ref name=PCOLKansascitystar/> The senator said he would not allow his identity to be revealed.<ref name=PCOLKansascitystar>Kansas City Star. "With another disclosure, Novak bedevils the dead" by Steve Kraske. July 28, 2007. The [http://www.kansascity.com/news/columnists/steve_kraske/story/209499.html original story] is a dead link. An archival copy is [http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/2204062.html available here].</ref> "Oh, he had to run for re-election... the McGovernites would kill him if they knew he had said that," Novak said.<ref name=PCOLMeetthepress/>
On July 15, 2007, after the source's death, Novak said on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' that the unnamed senator was Thomas Eagleton.<ref name=PCOLMeetthepress/> Political analyst [[Bob Shrum]] says that Eagleton would never have been selected as McGovern's running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote:<ref name=PCOLMeetthepress/> "Boy, do I wish he would have let you publish his name. Then he never would have been picked as vice president.<ref name=PCOLMeetthepress/> Because the two things, the two things that happened to George McGovern—two of the things that happened to him— were the label you put on him, number one, and number two, the Eagleton disaster. We had a messy convention, but he could have, I think in the end, carried eight or 10 states, remained politically viable. And Eagleton was one of the great train wrecks of all time."<ref name=PCOLMeetthepress/>
