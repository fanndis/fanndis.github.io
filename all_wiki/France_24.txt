'''France 24''' ({{lang|fr|France vingt-quatre}} in French and Arabic channels, {{lang|es|France veinticuatro}} in Spanish channel) is a [[France|French]] [[State media|state-owned]] international [[News broadcasting|news]] [[television network]] based in Paris.<ref name="France24">{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/france24-spanish-channel-2017 |date=25 February 2016 |title=France 24 to launch its Spanish channel in 2017 |work=France 24 |access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> Its channels broadcast in French, English, Arabic, and Spanish and are aimed at the overseas market, similar to [[BBC World]], [[Deutsche Welle|DW]], [[TRT World]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]], and [[Voice of America|VOA]].

Based in the Paris suburb of [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], the service started on 6 December 2006. It is aimed at a worldwide market and is generally broadcast by pay television providers around the world, but additionally, in 2010, France 24 began broadcasting online through its own iPhone and Android apps. It is a provider of [[live streaming world news]] which can be viewed via its website, [[YouTube]], and various [[mobile devices]] and [[digital media players]]. The stated mission of the channels is to "provide a global public service and a common editorial stance".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/about-france-24|title=France 24, the company|work=France 24|access-date=3 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203050635/http://www.france24.com/en/about-france-24|archive-date=3 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since 2008 the channel has been wholly owned by the French government, via its holding company [[France Médias Monde]], having bought out the minority share of the former partners: [[TF1 Group|Groupe TF1]] and [[France Télévisions]]. The budget is approximately €100&nbsp;million per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aefmonde.com/page/presentation-faits-chiffres.html |title=Faits et chiffres |publisher=Audiovisuel Exterieur de France |access-date=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230034300/http://www.aefmonde.com/page/presentation-faits-chiffres.html |archivedate=30 December 2011|language=fr }} Branchville that big around}</ref>

== Programming ==
{{Stack|[[Image:F24 newstitle.png|thumb|"The News" title card from 9 January 2011 to 11 December 2013]]}}
France 24 is broadcast on four channels: in Arabic, in English, in French<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20101012-france-24-arabic-channel-goes-24-hours-north-africa-middle-east-news-television|title=France 24's Arabic channel goes to 24 hours|date=12 October 2010|work=France 24|access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> and in Spanish.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20170926-media-france-24-now-spanish-join-us-live-launch-inaugural-broadcast-bogota|title=France 24, now in Spanish!|date=26 September 2017|work=France 24|access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref>

France 24's programming is divided more or less equally between news coverage and news magazines or special reports.

Along with 260 journalists of its own, France 24 can call on the resources of the two main French broadcasters ([[TF1 Group|Groupe TF1]] and [[France Télévisions]]) as well as partners such as [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]]. The CEO of France 24 is [[Alain de Pouzilhac]]. From 19 May 2010 and the Director of France 24 since 2012 is [[Marc Saikali]], France 24 unveiled a new schedule that prioritizes the morning and evening slots, anchored live by the network's editorial staff. More programming space than ever before goes to business, sport, culture, and studio discussion.

In 2016, France 24 started sharing its French-language night-time programming with the France-based [[France Info]]. According to Marie-Christine Saragosse, president and CEO of France Médias Monde, "part of the value added of this public channel" would be the fact that "[France 24 journalists] will be wide awake while others would be sleeping".<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqz5INe_4GM |date=23 April 2016 |title=Projet de chaîne info |trans-title=Information channel project|publisher=[[France Télévisions]] |access-date=16 August 2019|language=fr|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

==History==

===Channel inception===
The channel was created with the backing of president [[Jacques Chirac]], with the aim of providing a French perspective of the news, which was dominated ny English language media outlets.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6215170.stm |title=France launches world TV channel |publisher= BBC News |date=6 December 2006}}</ref>

===First project (1987–1997)===
In 1987, then French Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] expressed his desire for an international television news channel in French and had requested a report into the activities of current international broadcasts from France ([[Radio France Internationale]], [[TV5Monde|TV5]], and to a certain extent [[Outre-Mer 1ère|Réseau France Outre-Mer]]) and noted the collective offering was ''"fragmented, disorganised and ineffective."''

With the arrival of [[François Mitterrand]] as president in 1981 and the naming of [[Michel Rocard]] as Prime Minister in 1988, the government launched a new project, {{lang|fr|Canal France International}} (CFI), a package of programmes aimed at making programmes in French for foreign audiences, particularly in Africa, to be developed in parallel as a television channel.

The First [[Gulf War]] of 1990, relayed across the world by [[CNN International]] in particular, revealed the power of international news channels and their role in the formation of opinion. A parliamentary minister, [[Philippe Séguin]], wished to create a French-language equivalent.

In 1996, after nineteen governmental reports in ten years, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] asked [[Radio France Internationale]] president [[Jean-Paul Cluzel]] (who was also [[General Inspection of Finances (France)|General Inspector of Finances]]) to create a French international news channel. Cluzel proposed in 1997 to group TV5, RFI, and CFI within a corporation entitled Téléfi. The [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]-led government decided to follow that recommendation but, with the return of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to government and the nomination of [[Hubert Védrine]], the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV5, which started to produce its own programming, notably its news bulletins, which in turn created its own news team.

Additionally with the creation of [[EuroNews]] in 1993 (with French-language commentary), the media presence of France overseas became more complex, more fragmented, and costlier, without being able to rely on a true round-the-clock international news channel.

===Relaunched project (2002–2003)===
In 2002, President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel:

{{quote|Is it understandable that year after year we are still lamenting our persistent failure with news and the French-language media on the international scene? Admittedly, we have with [[Agence France-Presse]] a remarkable information tool that we must continue to reinforce, notably in its international mission. Indeed, everyone here recognises the recent progress made by RFI, by TV5, by CFI, thanks to the efforts of their teams and to the determination of the public bodies. But everybody notices that we are still far from having a large international news channel in French, capable of competing with the BBC or CNN.|author=President Jacques Chirac|source=Address given at an [[Élysée Palace]] reception on 12 February 2002, in honour of the High Council of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]].<ref>{{Cite speech|author=President Jacques Chirac|author-link=Jacques Chirac|title=Allocution du Président de la République lors de la réception en l'honneur du Haut conseil de la Francophonie|trans-title=Address by the President of the Republic at the reception in honour of the High Council of the Francophonie|location=[[Élysée Palace]]|date=12 February 2002|access-date=30 September 2007|url=http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210853/http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html |archive-date=30 September 2007|language=fr}}</ref>}}

{{quote|The recent crises have shown the handicap that a country suffers, a cultural area, which doesn't possess a sufficient weight in the battle of the images and the airwaves. Let us question, in the time of terrestrial television networks, of satellite, of the internet, on our organisation in this domain, and notably in the dissipation of public funds which are reserved to them.}}

On 7 March, speaking in the French Senate in front of foreign delegates to France, and as part of his presidential campaign, Chirac said:

''"We must have the ambition of a big, round-the-clock news channel in French, equal to the BBC or CNN for the English-speaking world. It is essential for the influence of our country. For our expatriates, it would be a live and an immediate link to the mainland"''<ref>[http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/mars/discours_de_m_jacques_chirac_devant_les_representants_des_francais_de_l_etranger-campagne_electorale_pour_l_election_presidentielle.426.html Speech given by Jacques Chirac in front of foreign representatives of the French state] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222601/http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/mars/discours_de_m_jacques_chirac_devant_les_representants_des_francais_de_l_etranger-campagne_electorale_pour_l_election_presidentielle.426.html |date=30 September 2007 }}, (French), 7 March 2002.</ref>

After his reelection, the first reflections were engaged at the [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], headed by [[Dominique de Villepin]]. Various technical options were examined at the time, in an unreleased report:

* '''Purchase of EuroNews''' by the French State
* '''Creation of an external channel''', proposed by then-[[France Télévisions]] President Marc Tessier, approved by the previous government.
* An '''international version of [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]]''', proposed by [[Groupe TF1]], which asked for a state subvention for the service.
* '''Strengthening of TV5's news service''', as suggested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The subsequent wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]] reassured the authorities about the project, especially in February 2003, when the American broadcasters CNN, [[FOX News]], and [[MSNBC]] opted not to broadcast the long applause given by the members of the United Nations Security Council after Dominique de Villepin gave his address on the Iraq conflict.<ref>[http://www.foreignpolicy.org.tr/documents/villepin_140203_p.htm Statement by Dominique de Villepin to the United Nations Security Council]. ''Foreign Policy''. 14 February 2003. Retrieved 5 November 2010.</ref>

On 19 March 2003, [[Prime Minister of France|Matignon]] opened offers to:
<blockquote>Elicit the development of an international news channel. Broadcasting primarily in the French language, this service will assure a more important and more visible presence of France in the worldwide battle of images, and to contribute to the pluralism of international information by offering to our viewers the choice of a different viewpoint on the news, marked by a singular point of view of our country on world affairs, by its culture and by its own ideas, and to value its historical links and its privileged geography. The international news channel must contribute to a long-lasting strategy of influence of France in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022113155/http://www.ddm.gouv.fr/article.php3?id_article=615 Consultation guide, Direction and Developemt of Media (Archive)] (French)</ref></blockquote>

By the application deadline on 22 April 2003, three candidates replied:
* '''France Télévisions''' & '''RFI''': to operate a channel entirely run by the public service sector;
* '''Groupe TF1''' : proposed an international version of its '''LCI''' channel;
* '''Groupe Canal+''' : proposed a news "factory" to reinforce its '''[[i-Télé|i>Télé]]''' channel, already seen in 47 countries but running at a financial loss.

One month later, a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion, voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly, to form a '''public-owned corporation''' ''(groupement d'intérêt public)'' grouping all of the public broadcasters (France Télévisions, RFO, RFI, TV5 and AFP) with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004.

Ignoring the work of the parliamentary commission, the government asked a member of the assembly, Bernard Brochand, to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel, something which the parliamentary commission did not demand. Brochard attempted to group both '''Groupe TF1''' and '''Groupe Canal+''', with no success. He then proposed a 50/50 partnership between '''France Télévisions''' and '''Groupe TF1''' (whilst at the same time rejecting '''RFI'''), both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally: TF1 with its LCI channel and France Télévisions' editorial teams at [[France 2]] and [[France 3]].

===Preparing for launch (2004–2006)===

====Defying parliament====
After a press conference in January 2004, President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year. However, various disputes began to surface. The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework. Unionised journalists working for France Télévisions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector, calling it ''"the marriage of the snake and the rabbit"''; [[Radio France International]] was angry that it would not be associated with the project. A headline published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' described the partnership having a ''"public channel, private owner"'',<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2006/01/BENILDE/13103 |title=Parrain privé, chaîne publique |work=Le Monde diplomatique|location =Paris |date=January 2006 |language=French}}</ref> while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro (compared with 600 million euro for [[BBC World News|BBC World]]). Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as [[TV5Monde|TV5]].

Facing discontentment, the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] delayed all discussion of the project in 2004. Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on 21 July that the channel would not be funded before 2007, which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill.

However, the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the [[Élysée]]; a press conference by Raffarin on 9 December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005.

''"I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France Télévisions and TF1. As desired by the President, the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies, and will promote the expression of a French vision, more necessary than ever in the world today. The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel, to a total of 30 million euro."''<ref>Press conference, 9 December 2005.</ref>
The amendment was carried the same day in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].

====Public-private angst====
The start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the [[European Union]] and the relevant competition commissions. Trade union members working for France Télévisions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March 2005. The newly elected president of the public corporation, [[Patrick de Carolis]], who assumed his position in the summer (and who had been accused of being too close to the President), expressed doubts about an alliance with TF1:

''"To be effective, you need a single driver in a car".''<ref>Delesalle, Nicolas (11 January 2006). "La voix de la France, en léger différé…", ''[[Télérama]]'', n°2922.</ref>

He insisted that the channel be made available within France, which the members of parliament required, and which [[TF1]], wanting to protect its own news channel [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]], could object to. Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties, and eventually a Supervisory Board devolved to France Télévisions. These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities, obtained this time round without difficulty.

===Birth (2006–2008)===
The launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the [[Minister of Culture (France)#Names of the Ministry of Culture|Ministry of Culture and Communication]], headed by [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]] on 30 November 2005:

''" The project of the International French News Channel (abbreviated in French to '''CFII''')[...] will allow us to propose our own country's vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_du_conseil_des_ministres/2005/novembre/communique_du_conseil_des_ministres_du_30_11_2005.33186.html&title=communiqu%C3%A9%20officiel%20du%20Conseil%20des%20ministres|title=Statement by the Ministry of Culture and Communication (Archive)}}</ref>

Alain de Pouzilhac, former CEO of Havas, was named president, along with two deputies, one each from group partners TF1 and France Télévisions.

Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII, against the wishes of TF1, would be broadcast within mainland France.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/071/article_39709.asp "Financée par l'argent public, il est légitime qu'elle soit diffusée en France"]. Radio France International. 9 November 2005. (French)</ref> However, TF1 wished to launch its news channel LCI onto the digital terrestrial platform. In order to placate TF1, CFII was due to be broadcast via satellite and cable.

On 22 April 2006, ''Le Monde'' announced that the managers of the forthcoming channel found its initial name difficult to pronounce ('''CFII''', in French pronounced as ''C-F-I-I'' or ''C-F-2-I'').<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0%2C1-0%2C36-764014%2C0.html Article published online, ''Le Monde'' (Paris). (Paid article) (Archive)]{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (French), 23 February 2008</ref> A new name was announced on 30 June 2006;  '''France 24''' (pronounced ''France vingt-quatre''). This decision was taken by the Supervisory Board, chaired by France Télévision president Patrick de Carolis, who made the choice from a list of five potential names.

'''France 24''' launched on 6 December 2006, initially available online as a web stream, followed by satellite distribution a day later, covering France and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States (specifically airing in [[New York State]] and the [[District of Columbia]] using two channels: one in English and the other in French).  Since April 2007 the channel increased its reach, airing programmes in Arabic for viewers in the [[Maghreb]], North Africa and the Middle East. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Two months after launch, a survey conducted by [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS Sofres]] indicated that 75% of respondents in France questioned thought France 24 was ''"useful and essential"'',<ref>Survey published in ''[[Metro International#Europe|Métro]]'', 16 February 2007.</ref> but questions have arisen concerning the France 24 name being too Franco-centric for an international news channel.<ref>[http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://agora.qc.ca/francophonie.nsf/Dossiers/Television&title=commentaire%20du%20politologue%20Marc%20Chevrier "France24, ou le splendide isolement audiovisuel de la France"], Marc Chevrier, Professor of Political Science, [[Université du Québec à Montréal]]. ''Encyclopédie de la Francophonie''. Retrieved 16 October 2007.</ref>

====State takes over====
In 2008 [[Groupe TF1]] ceded its share in the channel to a government-owned holding company, '''Société de l'audiovisuel extérieur de la France''' '''(AEF)''', whilst conversely committing to producing programmes for the channel until 2015.

Despite the launch of France 24, the fragmentation of public broadcasting overseas continues. The total budget for external broadcasting from France totalled 300 million euro each year. Following the election of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as president in May 2007, a "steering committee" of twenty members was called in with view to reform in June 2007. President Sarkozy called on [[Bernard Kouchner]] and [[Christine Albanel]], respectively [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|Foreign Minister]] and [[Minister of Culture (France)|Culture Minister]] to reform the current system. The proposition of reform was met with concern from Belgium, Switzerland and Canada/[[Québec]], as the public broadcasters involved in '''[[TV5Monde|TV5]]''' (of which the French government holds a 49% share whilst the three aforementioned countries hold 11% each) consider TV5 to be a promoter of the wider French-language world.<ref>"Audiovisuel extérieur. Une réforme au forceps", Daniel Psenny, ''Le Monde'' (Paris). 11 October 2007, p. 23.</ref> Just one month after France 24's launch, TV5 renamed itself [[TV5Monde]].

As published in the ''Journal Officiel de la République Française'' of 23 January 2009, a Decree for 23 January 2009 appeared, ''authorising the company '''France Télévisions''' to cede its share in the capital of the France 24 company''.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020166732&dateTexte=&categorieLien=id Legifrance.gouv.fr]. 9 April 2009.</ref> The same Decree transferred its share to the ''Société de l'audiovisuel extérieur de la France'' '''(AEF)''', which made AEF sole shareholder of France 24, for the sum of 4 million euro.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020166734&dateTexte=&categorieLien=id Legifrance.gouv.fr]. 9 April 2009.</ref>

===Under one ''maison'' (2008–present)===
President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] announced on 8 January 2008 that he was in favour of reducing France 24's programming to French only.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3236,36-999167@51-999278,0.html "La chaîne France 24 dans l'incertitude"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117134734/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3236,36-999167@51-999278,0.html |date=17 January 2008 }}. ''Le Monde'' (Paris).</ref>

In January 2012 '''AEF''' announced a merger between '''France 24''' and '''Radio France International''', a procedure finalised on 13 February 2012. It is expected that staff from Radio France International (which includes Arabic sister station '''Monte Carlo Doualiya''') will move to premises currently home to France 24. Alain de Pouzilhac, president of AEF stated in ''Le Monde'':

{{quote|"We have just created a French audiovisual group of international dimensions, that aspires to be powerful and ambitious; [the merger] is irreversible and is definitive"}}

102 posts, of which 85 from RFI, were cut preceding the official merger. Editorial teams, technical and distribution, financial and human resources departments of both France 24 and RFI were involved. On 13 February 2012 the merger of France 24 and RFI was made official.

===Long-term goals===
France 24 aims to compete with leading English-language international news channels [[BBC World News]] and [[CNN International]]. Its intention is to put more emphasis on debate, dialogue and the role of cultural differences. It also competes with [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Al Jazeera English]], and [[NHK World]] news channels. The Arabic programming competes with [[Al Jazeera]]'s Arabic service, [[RT Arabic]], [[BBC Arabic Television|BBC Arabic]] and [[Sky News Arabia]]. The new Spanish channel for the Latin American market is expected to start in September 2017. It will compete with [[CNN en Español]], [[DW (Latinoamérica)]], [[NTN24]], [[TeleSUR]], [[RT Spanish|RT en español]] and [[CCTV-E]]

The French government allocated around €100&nbsp;million for the project. The [[European Commission]] gave the green light to France 24 in June 2006, saying it did not breach [[European Union]] state aid rules.

=== Overnight simulcast ===
From 2 September 2016, France's new news channel, [[France Info (TV channel)|France Info]], started simulcasting France 24 from midnight to 6{{nbsp}}am daily, when the channel doesn't broadcast live except for newscasts every half-hour.

However, from 20 March 2017, on weekdays, France Info started simulcasting France 24 until 6:30 am, due to the main presenter Laurent Bignolas anchoring the early newscast on France 2 ''Le 6h Info'', which isn't simulcast on France Info.

==Organisation==
From its creation in 2006 to 2008, France 24 is managed by a management board and a supervisory board. In 2008, the French State bought the shares of the two shareholders for an amount of 2 million euros each. Since then, France 24 has been a chain of the national program company [[France Médias Monde]] (formerly Exterior Audiovisual of France), 100% owned by the French State through the State Participation Agency (APE).

France 24 has two main sources of [[funding]] : the audiovisual license fee, paid by each household equipped with a television, and the state subsidy.
