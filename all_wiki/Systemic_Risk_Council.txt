The '''Systemic Risk Council''' was formed in 2012 by [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] and [[CFA Institute]] to help ensure the effective implementation of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and related measures related to mitigating [[systemic risk]].

==Charter==
''“This new council is composed of experts with a thorough understanding of the issues, and we are pleased to support their efforts to find nonpartisan and independent recommendations. The reforms to our nation’s financial system enacted by Congress and signed by the president in 2010 were an important first step. The task now is to implement these reforms, especially those related to systemic risk.”'' '''Rebecca W. Rimel, president and CEO of The Pew Charitable Trusts'''<ref>{{cite web|last=Rimel|first=Rebecca|title=Press Release|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=85899396370|work=Press Release|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> 
* ''“Despite the magnitude of the financial crisis, prospects for major reform of regulatory systems are inadequate and vague ”''<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=John|title=Web Site Article|url=http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/marketintegrity/2012/06/06/cfa-institute-co-sponsors-systemic-risk-council-led-by-former-bank-regulator-sheila-bair/|work=CFA Institute|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>  '''John D. Rogers, president of the CFA Institute''' 
*''“The great challenge is to devise a system to identify risks that threaten market stability before they become a danger to the general public. As evidenced by the 2008 crisis and even recent headlines, we need a more effective and efficient early-warning system to detect issues that jeopardize the functioning of U.S. financial markets before they disrupt credit flows to the real economy. And two of the most critical tasks are how to impose greater market discipline on excess risk taking and effectively end the doctrine [[too-big-to-fail]].”'' '''[[Sheila Bair]], chair of the Systemic Risk Council.''' 
* *''“nothing has been finalized. [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] is M.I.A. [[Office of Financial Research]] is barely functional. The [[Volcker Rule]] is mired in controversy. [[Securitization]] reform is stalled. They haven’t even proposed new bank capital rules. The public is becoming cynical about whether the regulators can do anything right, which is undermining support for reforms.”'' '''[[Sheila Bair]], chair of the Systemic Risk Council.''' <ref>{{cite news|title=Group Forms to Urge Strict Oversight of Wall Street|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/business/new-systemic-risk-council-to-press-for-stricter-financial-regulations.html?_r=2|newspaper=NYT|date=June 5, 2012}}</ref>

==Plans==
The council issued a call to action on June 18, 2012 at The Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington, D.C., detailing the objectives and future plans for the Systemic Risk Council.<ref>{{cite web |title=Systemic Risk Council is a 'Strong, Independent Voice' to Help Implement Financial Reforms |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/analysis/2012/06/18/systemic-risk-council-is-a-strong-independent-voice-to-help-implement-financial-reforms |work=The Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>
*"Our overriding concern stems from the lack of progress made by the members of the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC) and the [[Office of Financial Research]] (OFR) to address several critical issues as mandated by the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (Dodd-Frank), enacted in 2010. That concern increases each day that the implementation of systemic risk reform languishes. A sense of complacency has made reforms for effective oversight seem less urgent despite escalating problems elsewhere in the global financial system. In many ways, the financial system faces larger potential challenges today than it did in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, given the troubled state of the [[European Union]] and uncertainties at home related to fiscal and monetary policy.  It is essential that the FSOC show leadership in coordinating the rule-writing process to promote the development of cohesive, consistent regulations and provide clear and transparent explanations of the reforms in a way that is understandable to the general public. We have created this Council to assist in that effort."<ref>{{cite web |title=Systemic Risk Council: A Call to Action |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2012/06/18/src_call_to_action_061812.pdf |work=Systemic Risk Council |format=PDF |accessdate= 11 March 2018}}</ref>
