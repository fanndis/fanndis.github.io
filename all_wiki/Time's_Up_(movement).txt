'''Time's Up''' is a movement against [[sexual harassment]], founded on January 1, 2018, by [[Hollywood]] celebrities<ref>{{cite magazine |date=January 2, 2018 |title=Reese Witherspoon, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Aniston: See Who's Given $500k, More to Fight Harassment |url=http://people.com/movies/reese-witherspoon-taylor-swift-jennifer-aniston-see-whos-given-500k-more-to-fight-harassment/ |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref> in response to the [[Weinstein effect]] and [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]]. {{As of|December 2018}}, it has raised more than $22 million for its legal defense fund, and gathered nearly 800 volunteer lawyers.<ref>{{Cite report |url=https://nwlc.org/resources/times-up-legal-defense-fund-annual-report-2018/ |title=TIME’S UP Legal Defense Fund Annual Report 2018 |page=8 |publisher=National Women's Law Center |date=December 17, 2018 |access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>

==History==

In November 2017, the Alianza Nacional de Campesinas wrote a letter of solidarity to the Hollywood women involved in exposing the [[sexual abuse]] allegations against [[Harvey Weinstein]]. The letter, published in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', described experiences of [[assault]] and [[harassment]] among female farmworkers. The letter stated that it was written on behalf of the approximately 700,000 female farmworkers in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=November 10, 2017 |title=700,000 Female Farmworkers Say They Stand with Hollywood Actors against Sexual Assault |url=http://time.com/5018813/farmworkers-solidarity-hollywood-sexual-assault/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=January 2, 2018}}</ref>
 
Partly in response, Time's Up was announced in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 1, 2018. The announcement cited the letter of support from the Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and the desire to support women, men, people of color, and the LGBT community who have less access to media platforms and funds to speak up about harassment.<ref name="NYT Launch"/> At its founding, the following initiatives were announced:

* A $13-million legal defense fund, administered by the [[National Women's Law Center]], to support lower-income women seeking justice for [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault|assault]] in the workplace
* Advocating for legislation to punish companies that tolerate persistent harassment
* A movement toward gender parity in studio and talent agencies
* Calling for women and men on the [[red carpet]] at the [[75th Golden Globe Awards]] to wear black and speak out about sexual harassment and assault.
[[Mark Wahlberg]] and [[William Morris Endeavor]], his talent agency, donated more than $2 million to Time's Up in early January 2018 in the name of Wahlberg's co-star [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] from ''[[All the Money in the World]]''. This occurred after it was revealed that Williams (who is represented by the same agency) received $800 for 10 days to redo certain scenes in the movie, while Wahlberg received $1.5 million for the same 10 days of work.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/arts/mark-wahlberg-michelle-williams.html?referer= |title=Mark Wahlberg and Agency Will Donate $2 Million to Time's Up After Outcry Over Pay|access-date=January 26, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Attendees of the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|2018 Grammys]]  including [[Lady Gaga]], [[Lana Del Rey]], [[Kesha]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] wore white roses or all-black outfits to express solidarity with the Time's Up movement.<ref name="latimes1">{{cite web |author=Lesley McKenzie |url=http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-grammys-lorde-jenny-holzer-20180130-htmlstory.html |title=Jenny Holzer, the feminist artist behind Lorde's Grammys gown message, isn't a stranger to the fashion world |publisher=Latimes.com |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2018}}</ref> [[Lorde]] wore an excerpt from a work by [[Jenny Holzer]], printed on a card stitched onto the back of her dress; the excerpt read, "Rejoice!

==Website==
The Time's Up movement website states, "The clock has run out on sexual assault, harassment, and inequality in the workplace. It's time to do something about it." Under this statement is a letter of solidarity, donations to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund are asked for and if donation is given, signing of the letter of solidarity is permitted. Located a little further down is some statistical information about sexual assault and harassment against women as well as inequalities in the workplace. What follows is information about the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund which money raised from this fund will assist in covering legal and public relations expenses in some cases where individuals have experienced instances of sexual harassment or retaliation in the workplace relating to such issues. The Time's Up Legal Defense fund is administered by the [[National Women's Law Center]] which is a national women's rights legal organization. This organization connects sexual harassment victims with attorneys who can provide legal assistance. The last thing listed on the website is other resources such as BetterBrave, [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC), and [[Equal Rights Advocates]] all of which are equipped to handle issues regarding sexual harassment or inequalities of women in the workplace.

== Criticism ==
As a movement focused on combatting sexual harassment in the workplace across many industries,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sexual harassment in the workplace: law and practice |last=Alba. |first=Conte |date=2010 |publisher=Aspen Publishers |isbn=9780735597655 |edition=4th |location=New York |oclc=595739050}}</ref> the Time's Up movement has received external criticism from a variety of sources. These critiques largely focus on the hypocrisy of the movement and its spokespeople, as well as the general response of [[Hollywood]] elites. Many writers have criticized Hollywood for espousing the messages of the movement without making the necessary changes in the industry that the movement is calling for. During [[2017–18 film awards season|awards season]], writers called out the industry for "leaning hardest on the very women it has exploited" in order to convert their critiques and testimonies into "inspirational messages and digestible branding exercises".<ref name="Hess 2018">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/arts/can-hollywood-fix-its-harassment-problem-while-celebrating-itself.html |title=Hollywood Uses the Very Women It Exploited to Change the Subject |last=Hess |first=Amanda |date=January 24, 2018 |work=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref> Others criticize the movement for a lack of diversity in its spokespeople. The majority of Time's Up representatives are notably wealthy and of celebrity status. Many progressive commentators criticize the movement for its entrenchment in [[celebrity culture]]. They claim celebrities are not committed to the cause beyond their superficial involvement in the Time's Up organization and that these (mostly) women do not represent the interests of women in real communities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-lefty-critique-of-timesup-is-tired-and-self-defeating/ |title=The Lefty Critique of #TimesUp Is Tired and Self-Defeating |last=Sen |first=Rinku |date=January 9, 2018 |work=The Nation|access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref>

As a movement intended to combat sexual harassment across many industries, critics fear that its focus on Hollywood detracts from other industries. As a counterpoint, many bring attention to the fact that the Movement allies itself with Alianza Nacional de Campesinas.<ref>[https://www.alianzanacionaldecampesinas.org/ Alianza Nacional de Campesinas]</ref> Additionally, many cite that Time's Up draws inspiration from the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]], a campaign started and organized by activists of color like [[Tarana Burke]]. Similar critiques came to light during the [[75th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]] in January 2018, when many actresses and signatories of the movement dressed in black brought prominent activists as their dates; for example, Burke arrived with [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], and [[Meryl Streep]] brought [[Ai-jen Poo]], director of the [[National Domestic Workers Alliance]], as her date. Other activists in attendance included [[Rosa Clemente]], [[Saru Jayaraman]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Marai Larasi]], [[Calina Lawrence]], and [[Mónica Ramírez (activist)|Mónica Ramírez]], co-founder of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/5091772/golden-globes-red-carpet-activists/ |title=Meet the Activists Who Accompanied Celebrities on the Golden Globes Red Carpet |last=Berman |first=Eliza |date=January 8, 2018 |work=Time Magazine|access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref> Though many praised this choice as an opportunity to lend voices to prominent activists in the field, others heavily criticized these and other actresses for showcasing activists of color as moral accessories.<ref name="Hess 2018" /> In an interview with ''Variety'', however, Burke herself commented that once she received an invitation from Michelle Williams to attend the awards, she thought this choice was "brilliant".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/tarana-burke-times-up-me-too-backlash-1202748822/ |title=Tarana Burke on Hollywood, Time's Up, and Me Too Backlash |last=Wagmeister |first=Elizabeth |date=April 10, 2018 |work=Variety|access-date=April 26, 2018}}</ref>
