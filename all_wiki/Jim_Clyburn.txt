'''James Enos Clyburn''' (born July 21, 1940) is an American politician and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from South Carolina.  He has served as [[House Majority Whip]] since 2019.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/11/17/103928/a-new-era-for-sc-clyburn-scott.html A new era for SC: Clyburn, Scott get top House posts], James Rosen, ''[[McClatchy Newspapers]]'', November 17, 2010.</ref> He is a two-time Majority Whip, having previously served in the post from 2007 to 2011, and served as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Assistant Minority Leader]] from 2011 to 2019. 

Currently in his 14th term as a congressman, Clyburn has served as [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|SC|6}} since 1993. His congressional district includes most of the majority-black precincts in and around [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], as well as nearly all of a mostly rural region within [[South Carolina]]. Clyburn is the current dean of the South Carolina congressional delegation.

Clyburn has been the third-ranking Democrat in the House behind [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Steny Hoyer]] since 2007, serving as Majority Whip behind [[United States Speaker of the House|House Speaker]] Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer during periods of Democratic House control, and as Assistant Minority Leader behind [[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]] Pelosi and [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Whip]] Hoyer during periods of Republican House control.  After the Democrats took control of the House following the [[2018 midterm elections]], Clyburn was re-elected Majority Whip in January 2019 on the opening of the [[116th United States Congress|116th Congress]], alongside the re-elected Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer, marking the second time the trio has served in these roles together.

Clyburn played a pivotal role in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]] by endorsing [[Joe Biden]] three days before the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina Democratic primary]]. Clyburn's endorsement came at a time when Biden's campaign was suffering from three disappointing finishes in the [[2020 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses|Iowa]] and [[2020 Nevada Democratic presidential caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] and the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary|New Hampshire primary]]. The South Carolina win for Biden days before [[Super Tuesday]] instantly transformed his campaign; the momentum led him to capture the Democratic nomination and later the presidency.

== Early life and education ==
Clyburn was born in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], the son of Enos Lloyd Clyburn, a [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], and his wife, Almeta (née Dizzley), a beautician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/463/story/67142.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912105201/http://www.thestate.com/463/story/67142.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 12, 2012 |title=Chapter 12 &#124; The parable of the talents – Crossing a Great Divide |publisher=TheState.com |date=May 17, 2007 |access-date=August 29, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blackcommentator.com/44/44_guest.html|title=Dad's Diploma: Overcoming Injustice|last=Clyburn |first=Jim|date=May 29, 2003|work=The Black Commentator|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726193521/http://www.blackcommentator.com/44/44_guest.html|archive-date=July 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A distant relative of his was [[George W. Murray]], an organizer for the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers Alliance]] (CFA), who was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] South Carolina Congressman in the 53rd and 54th U.S. Congresses in the late nineteenth century.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} He and other black politicians had strongly opposed the 1895 state constitution, which essentially [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most African-American citizens, a situation that the state maintained for more than half a century until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.

Clyburn graduated from Mather Academy (later named [[Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy]]) in [[Camden, South Carolina]], then attended South Carolina State College (now [[South Carolina State University]]), a [[historically black college]] in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]]. He was initiated into the [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity and graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in history.

For his first full-time position after college, Clyburn taught at C.A. Brown High School in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].

==Early political career==
Clyburn became involved in politics during the [[1969 Charleston hospital strike]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/charleston_hospital_workers_mo/aftermath|title=Aftermath · The Charleston Hospital Workers Movement, 1968-1969 · Lowcountry Digital History Initiative|website=ldhi.library.cofc.edu|access-date=June 5, 2019}}</ref> After assisting the settlement of the protests at the [[Medical University of South Carolina]], Clyburn became involved in [[St. Julian Devine]]'s campaign for a seat on the Charleston city council in 1969. Clyburn came up with the campaign's slogan "Devine for Ward Nine." When Devine won the race, he became the first African American to hold a seat on the city council since [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. Clyburn later credited that campaign as the reason he got into electoral politics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blessed experiences : genuinely southern, proudly black|last=Clyburn |first=James |isbn=978-1611175592|oclc=893457675|year = 2015}}</ref>

After an unsuccessful run for the [[South Carolina General Assembly]], he moved to [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] to join the staff of [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[John C. West]] in 1971. West called Clyburn and offered him a job as his advisor after reading Clyburn's response to his loss in the newspaper. After West appointed Clyburn as his advisor, Clyburn became the first minority advisor to a governor in the history of South Carolina.

In the aftermath of the [[Orangeburg massacre]] of 1968, when three protesting students at South Carolina State were killed by police, West appointed Clyburn as the state's human affairs commissioner.<ref>

</ref> He served in this position until 1992, when he stepped down to run for Congress.
The Orangeburg massacre and civil-rights protest pre-dated the 1970 Kent State shootings and Jackson State killings, in which the National Guard at Kent State, and police and state highway patrol at Jackson State, killed student protesters demonstrating against the United States invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.<ref name="morrill">{{cite web|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article198943934.html|title=50 years after 3 students died in SC civil rights protest, survivors still ask 'Why?'|first=Jim|last=Morrill|date=8 February 2018|website=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
{{See also|2008 United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina#District 6|2010 United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina#District 6}}
Following the 1990 census South Carolina's district lines were redrawn. Due to prior racial discrimination before the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] required the 6th district, which had previously included the northeastern portion of the state, to be redrawn as a [[black-majority district]]. Five-term incumbent [[Robin Tallon]]'s home in [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] was in the district, but he chose to retire. Five candidates, all of whom were African American, ran for the Democratic nomination for the seat. Clyburn's campaign was led by NAACP activist [[Isaac W. Williams]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/life/2015/02/01/isaac-williams-civil-rights/22673483/|title=Williams a leader for African-Americans in the South|work=The Greenville News|access-date=January 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Clyburn secured 55% of the vote in the primary, eliminating the need for an expected run-off. As expected, he won the general [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|election in November]] handily, becoming the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Columbia since 1965 and the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Charleston since 1981. He has been reelected 15 times with no substantive [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition.

Clyburn has beaten every Republican candidate he has faced in a congressional election. In 2008, Clyburn defeated Nancy Harrelson by 68% to 32%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enr-scvotes.org/SC/8562/13981/en/summary.html |title=South Carolina 2008 General Election Results |date=November 21, 2008 |access-date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref> The next election in 2010, he defeated Jim Pratt, 65% to 34%.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Democrat Clyburn wins 10th term in 6th District|url=https://www.wmbfnews.com/story/13432987/democrat-clyburn-wins-10th-term-in-6th-district|access-date=2020-08-07|website=WMBF News|language=en-US}}</ref> And in 2012, Clyburn defeated Anthony Culler, 73% to 25%.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lavender|first=Paige|date=2014-11-04|title=Jim Clyburn Wins Midterm Election Race Against Anthony Culler In South Carolina|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jim-clyburn-midterm-election-results_n_5967638|access-date=2020-08-07|website=HuffPost|language=en}}</ref>

===Tenure===

====Party leadership====
[[File:Barack Obama meets with House leaders in Williamsburg, VA 2-5-09.jpg|thumb|Clyburn with President [[Barack Obama]] as he meets with House leaders]]
Clyburn was elected as [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|vice-chairman of the House Democratic Caucus]] in 2003, the third-ranking post in the caucus.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} He became the [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|chairman]] of the Democratic Caucus in the House in early 2006 after the caucus chairman [[Bob Menendez]] was appointed to the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. After the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], Clyburn was unanimously elected as Majority Whip in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Clyburn would have faced a challenge from [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] Chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]], but Speaker-elect [[Nancy Pelosi]] persuaded Emanuel to run for [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus Chairman]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110901764.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Charles | last1=Babington | first2=Jonathan | last2=Weisman | title=Reid, Pelosi Expected to Keep Tight Rein in Both Chambers | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> Clyburn was interviewed by [[National Public Radio]]'s ''Morning Edition'' on January 12, 2007, and acknowledged the difficulty of counting votes and rallying the fractious Democratic caucus, while his party held the majority in the House.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

After the [[United States general elections, 2010|2010 elections]], the Democrats lost their majority in the House. The departing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran for the Minority Leader position in order to remain the House party leader, while Clyburn announced that he would challenge [[Steny Hoyer]], the second-ranking Democrat in the House and the outgoing Majority Leader, for the Minority Whip post. Clyburn had the support of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], which wanted to keep an African-American in the House leadership, while Hoyer had 35 public endorsements, including three standing committee chairs. On November 13, Pelosi announced a deal whereby Hoyer would stand as Minority Whip, while a "number three" leadership position styled ''Assistant Leader'' would be created for Clyburn.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/11/13/democratic.leadership.battle/index.html?eref=edition|title = Deal ends Democratic leadership fight|author=Dana Bash|publisher=CNN|date = November 13, 2010 |author-link = Dana Bash}}</ref> The exact responsibilities of Clyburn's assistant leader office were unclear, though it was said to replace the ''Assistant to the Leader'' post previously held by [[Chris Van Hollen]]. He had attended all leadership meetings but was not in the leadership hierarchy.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/112congress/index.html | work=The Washington Post | first=David A. | last=Fahrenthold | title=Alexis Covey-Brandt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/07/AR2010110704606.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=House Democrats could retain leadership team | date=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

;Ideology
Clyburn is regarded as liberal in his political stances, actions and votes. A 2007 ranking by the ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked him as the 77th most liberal of all 435 US congressional representatives at the time, and with a score of 81, indicating that the conductors of this study found his voting record to be more liberal than 81 percent of other members of the [[US House of Representatives]] based on their recent voting records.<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/house/lib.htm#results 2007 Vote Ratings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910143851/http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/house/lib.htm#results |date=September 10, 2015 }}</ref>

Clyburn has an established liberal stance on health care, education, [[organized labor]] and environmental conservation issues, based on his legislative actions as well as evaluations and ratings by pertinent interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=May 14, 2010 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Healthcare

In 2009, Clyburn introduced the Access for All Americans Act. The $26&nbsp;billion sought by this Act would provide funding to quadruple the number of community health centers in the US that provide medical care to uninsured and low-income citizens.<ref>[http://www.thestate.com/politics/story/698176.html Clyburn bill would extend healthcare] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430022204/http://www.thestate.com/politics/story/698176.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], The Children’s Health Fund, and other health care interest groups rate Clyburn highly based on his voting record on pertinent issues. Other groups in this field, such as the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], gave Clyburn a rating of zero in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=38&go.x=15&go.y=14 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Health Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Despite his opposition to [[partial-birth abortion]], Clyburn is regarded to be [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-abortion rights]] on the issue of abortion, as shown by his high ratings from [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], and low rating from the [[National Right to Life Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=2&go.x=11&go.y=15 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Abortion Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Education
Clyburn has continuously sought new and additional funding for education. He has gained additional funding for special education<ref>[http://clyburn.house.gov/statements/cc011220education.html Education Advocates Give Funding a Boost December 20, 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203082648/http://clyburn.house.gov/statements/cc011220education.html |date=February 3, 2011 }}</ref> and lower interest rates on federal student loans.<ref>[http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2008/04/17/ The Daily WhipLine April 17, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226053045/http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2008/04/17/ |date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref> In many sessions has Clyburn sought, sponsored and/or voted for improvements in [[Pell Grant]] funding for college loans.<ref>[http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2007/07/18/ ''The Daily WhipLine'', July 18, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226092321/http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2007/07/18/ |date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[National Education Association]] and the National Association of Elementary School Principals rate Clyburn very high, as do other education interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=27&go.x=18&go.y=12 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Education |publisher=Votesmart.org |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Ports
Although he was criticized for a previous expenditure of 160 million dollars to expand South Carolina's ports, he stated he would continue to make funding available for further expansions.  The plan is to deepen the ports to allow for larger commercial ships to arrive from the Panama Canal which is currently being expanded to allow for larger ships to pass through. This is due primarily because of larger commercial ships coming from China, and also China's extremely high demand of soy beans, which are produced in South Carolina, but must be sent to larger ports for exporting.  This measure will benefit South Carolina business and farmers and is thus heavily backed by these groups.<ref>{{cite news |title= Clyburn says ports worth the investment|author= Gene Zaleski|url= http://thetandd.com/news/local/clyburn-says-ports-worth-the-investment/article_3cceeb36-e10e-11e1-817a-0019bb2963f4.html?comment_form=true|newspaper= The Times and Democrat|date= August 8, 2012|access-date=August 16, 2012}}</ref>

;Labor
Clyburn has consistently voted for increases in [[minimum wage]] income and to restrict employer interference with labor union organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/James_Clyburn_Jobs.htm |title=Jim Clyburn on Jobs |publisher=Ontheissues.org |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Many national labor unions, including the [[AFL-CIO]], the [[United Auto Workers]], the Communication Workers Association, and the
[[International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers|International Brotherhood of Boilermakers]], give Clyburn outstanding ratings based on his voting record on issues that pertain to labor and employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=43&go.x=6&go.y=7 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Labor |publisher=Votesmart.org |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Environment
[[File:Bono-pelosi-clyburn.jpg|thumb|Clyburn with Nancy Pelosi and U2 lead singer [[Bono]] in 2006]]
Clyburn has opposed legislation to increase [[offshore drilling]] for [[Oil well|oil]] or natural gas. Instead, he has promoted use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] as an alternative to [[fossil fuels]], cheaper than [[wind energy|wind]] and [[solar energy]].

Clyburn has been viewed favorably by organizations such as the [[League of Conservation Voters]] and [[Defenders of Wildlife]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=30&go.x=13&go.y=13 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Environmental Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> However, he did anger environmentalists when he proposed building a $150 million bridge across a swampy area of Lake Marion in Calhoun county.

;War in Iraq
On July 31, 2007, Clyburn said in a broadcast interview that it would be a "real big problem" for the Democratic Party if General [[David Petraeus]] issued a positive report in September, as it would split the Democratic caucus on whether to continue to fund the [[Iraq War]].  While this soundbite caused some controversy, the full quote was, in reference to 47 member [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog caucus]], "I think there would be enough support in that group to want to stay the course and if the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] were to stay united as they have been, then it would be a problem for us."<ref>{{cite news

;Bill Clinton comments
Clyburn was officially neutral during the primary battle between [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]], but former President [[Bill Clinton]] blamed Clyburn for Hillary's 29-point defeat in the South Carolina primary and the two of them had a heated telephone conversation. Clyburn himself had voted for Obama, saying "How could I ever look in the faces of our children and grandchildren had I not voted for Barack Obama?"<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/bill-clintons-2-am-phone-call-to-jim-clyburn]</ref> Clyburn negatively viewed [[Bill Clinton]]'s remarks regarding Obama winning the South Carolina primary. Clinton had compared Obama's victory to Rev.

"Black people are incensed all over this," said Clyburn. Clinton responded that the campaign "played the [[race card]] on me," denying any racial tone in the comment.<ref>Phillips, Kate (April 24, 2008), [http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/bill-clinton-irritated-by-race-card-questions/ "Bill Clinton Irritated by Race-Card Questions"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>  Speaking with the ''[[New York Times]]'', Clyburn said such actions could lead to a longtime division between the former president and his once most reliable constituency.
"When he was going through his [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment problems]], it was the black community that bellied up to the bar," Clyburn said. "I think black folks feel strongly that this is a strange way for President Clinton to show his appreciation."<ref name=NYT2008-4-24/>

During the [[2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2004 Democratic presidential primaries]], Clyburn supported former House Minority Leader [[Dick Gephardt]] until he dropped out of the race and afterwards supported [[John Kerry]]. Clyburn was one of the 31 who voted in the House not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] from [[Ohio]] in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] amid a [[2004 United States election voting controversies|dispute]] over irregularities.<ref>{{cite web

Like other Democratic congressional leaders, Clyburn remained publicly uncommitted throughout most of the 2008 presidential primary elections. Despite being officially neutral Clyburn personally voted for Obama in the South Carolina primary. Former President [[Bill Clinton]] accused Clyburn of being responsible for Hillary's heavy 29-point defeat in South Carolina, while Clyburn criticized Bill Clinton's comments on race comparing Obama's win to that of Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]].<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/bill-clintons-2-am-phone-call-to-jim-clyburn]</ref><ref>[https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/04/25/clinton.clyburn/index.html]</ref> Clyburn eventually endorsed Obama on June 3 immediately before the [[Montana Democratic primary, 2008|Montana]] and [[2008 South Dakota Democratic primary|South Dakota]] primaries. At this time, Obama's lead in pledged delegates was substantial enough that the final two primaries would not have been able to reverse it.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.superdelegates/index.html Steady Stream of superdelegates pushed Obama over top] [[CNN]] June 3, 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wilgoren|first=Debbi|title=Clyburn Endorses Obama|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/06/clyburn-endorses-obama.html|access-date=May 31, 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 3, 2008}}</ref>

Clyburn endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|title = South Carolina Rep.

Clyburn's endorsement of former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] on February 26, 2020, three days before the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], was considered pivotal in the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic Presidential nomination contest]]. Several analyses have determined the endorsement changed the trajectory of the race, due to Clyburn's influence over the state's African-Americans, who make up the majority of its Democratic electorate. Prior to Clyburn's endorsement, Biden had not won a single primary and had placed fourth, fifth, and a distant second in the [[2020 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses|Iowa]], [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary|New Hampshire]], and [[2020 Nevada Democratic presidential caucuses|Nevada]] caucuses and primaries respectively.  Biden utilized momentum from his win in South Carolina to take a delegate lead on [[Super Tuesday]] and clinch the nomination a month later, and eventually win the presidency in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/clyburn-endorsement-carries-considerable-weight-in-sc-exit-poll-79722053629|title=Clyburn endorsement carries considerable weight in SC: exit poll|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 29, 2020|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/04/joe-biden-jim-clyburn-endorsement-super-tuesday|title='A chain reaction': how one endorsement set Joe Biden's surge in motion|first=Daniel|last=Strauss|publisher=The Guardian|date=March 4, 2020|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2020|title=Jim Clyburn changed everything for Joe Biden's campaign.

=== Israel ===
In January 2017, Clyburn voted against a House resolution condemning the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334|UN Security Council Resolution 2334]], which called [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlement building]] in the occupied [[Israeli-occupied territories|Palestinian territories]] in the [[West Bank]] a "flagrant violation" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.<ref>{{cite news |title=House votes to rebuke UN on Israeli settlement resolution |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/312956-house-votes-to-rebuke-un-vote-on-israel |work=The Hill |date=January 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=AAI Thanks 80 Representatives For Standing Against Illegal Israeli Settlements |url=http://www.aaiusa.org/aai_thanks_80_representatives_for_standing_against_illegal_israeli_settlements |publisher=Arab American Institute}}</ref>
