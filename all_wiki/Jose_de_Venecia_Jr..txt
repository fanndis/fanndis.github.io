'''Jose Claveria de Venecia Jr.''' ({{IPA-tl|vɛˈnɛʃa}}), also known as '''JDV''', '''Joe De V''' or '''Mikey-Mikey''' (born December 26, 1936), is a former [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], serving from 1992 to 1998 and from 2001 to 2008. As Speaker, he was the fourth highest-ranking official of the [[Philippines]].  He was the former president of the [[Philippines|Philippines']] dominant party, [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas-CMD]]. He ran for [[President of the Philippines|president]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 election]], but lost to [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Joseph Estrada]], finishing second among 11 candidates.

Beginning in 1987, De Venecia has been elected to six terms as a Representative of the [[Congressional districts of Pangasinan#4th District|4th District]] of [[Pangasinan]]. He served as [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives]] throughout the [[9th Congress of the Philippines|Ninth]], [[10th Congress of the Philippines|Tenth]], [[12th Congress of the Philippines|Twelfth]] and [[13th Congress of the Philippines|Thirteenth]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Congresses of the Philippines]]. He had served for more than a year as the House Speaker of the [[14th Congress of the Philippines|Fourteenth Congress]] when on February 5, 2008, 174 representatives, or a considerable majority of members of the House, voted to remove de Venecia as Speaker. He is the first Filipino who has held the Speakership five times in separate terms. He was conferred an Honorary Doctorate in International Relations from the [[University of Cambodia]] in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uc.edu.kh/ucb/List%20of%20Honorary%20Doctorates%20%282004%20-%202014%29/2015-07-22%2006:43:17/1889/|title=List of Honorary Doctorates}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
De Venecia was born in [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]] to Judge Jose R. de Venecia Sr. and Casimira Villamil Clavería. In 1947, he finished his elementary studies at the Dagupan Elementary School where he was accelerated by one year. Then in 1951, he completed his secondary education at the [[De La Salle University|De La Salle College]] High School.

As an entrepreneur, de Venecia pioneered overseas contract work for Filipinos where he was one of the first Philippine prime contractors in the Middle East and North Africa in the mid-1970s. He hired 51,000 Filipinos for his companies and engaged in port operations in [[Saudi Arabia]], agriculture in Africa, and mass housing and oil exploration in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. His Middle East initiative was followed and later led to the employment of millions of Filipinos. In the 1970s, he was initiated an [[oil exploration|oil and gas exploration]] program that led to the first oil and gas strikes in offshore [[Palawan]]. He was elected president of the Petroleum Association of the Philippines.

De Venecia was a diplomat as Minister-Economic Counselor from 1966 to 1969. He conceived and implemented the historic dollar-remittance program for overseas Filipino workers worldwide. He was one of the Ten Outstanding Congressmen before [[martial law in the Philippines]].

De Venecia came from an influential political family. His grandfather, Guillermo de Venecia was the  municipal president (now known as mayor) from 1916 to 1918 and from 1925 to 1926. He ran and won as congressman of the second district of [[Pangasinan]] from 1969 to 1972. After the restoration of the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1987, he ran and won as congressman of the fourth district of Pangasinan.

==Speaker of the House (1992-1998)==
He was reelected in 1992 and joined the newly created party, [[Lakas Tao]], of President [[Fidel Ramos]]. He initiated the move to unite the [[National Union of Christian Democrats]], a cluster of the [[Progressive Party of the Philippines]], the [[Union of Muslim Democrats]], and the [[Lakas Tao]] to make it a dominant party. That same year, he was elected [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]] of the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Since Ramos got a low plurality in the election, De Venecia created a ''Rainbow Coalition'', converging political parties that include the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino|LDP]], [[Nationalist People's Coalition|NPC]], [[Lakas NUCD]], and other minor parties to make a solid majority in the House. He was reelected as congressman and speaker in 1995.

===Peace envoy===
As Ramos' peace envoy, Speaker De Venecia reached out to insurgent groups [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) secessionists in Mindanao, the RAM-SFP-YOU military rebels, and the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] which operates the [[New People's Army]] (NPA). He crossed Africa's [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]] twice to meet the [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and [[Moro National Liberation Front (Misuari faction)|MNLF]] Chairman [[Nur Misuari]] and assisted in forging a peace agreement at [[Tripoli]] in 1976. His persuasion to Misuari to accept autonomy led to the signing of the peace pact on September 2, 1996.

In 1992, De Venecia began secret talks with leaders of the military rebels, led by Commodore Calajate, Gen. Abenina, and Col. Honasan, which led to a ceasefire in December of that year and a final peace agreement in 1995. In April 1997, De Venecia journeyed to the Netherlands to meet with self-exiled leaders of the [[National Democratic Front (Philippines)|National Democratic Front]] and [[New People's Army]] led by [[Jose Maria Sison]] and Luis Jalandoni. He was the first Christian leader to enter Mindanao's Camp Abubakar mountains in November 1997 and open breakthrough peace negotiations with [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|Hashim Salamat]], Chairman of the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF), and military Commander Murad.

===1998 presidential election===
{{See also|1998 Philippine general election}}
In 1998, the dominant party [[Lakas-NUCD-UMDP]] held a convention to select Ramos' successor as titular president and candidate for the May 11 election. A long list of candidates was trimmed and led to a choice between De Venecia and then National Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]]. Though De Villa was seen as the frontrunner, De Venecia won the convention vote and De Villa bolted the party to form a new one called ''[[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma-Lapiang Manggagawa|Partido Reporma]]''.

De Venecia garnered the second highest number of votes in a field of 11 candidates, though he was far behind the winner, [[Joseph Estrada]]. After he lost his bid, he departed from media attention and political limelight. In one of his interviews, De Venecia said that he was depressed and took several months to recover.

==Reentry to the politics==
De Venecia reemerged on [[New Year's Day]] of 2001 calling for a ''smooth transition of power'' to the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Vice President]]. [[Joseph Estrada|Estrada]] belittled de Venecia's  statements, however, the former was ousted January 20 of that year.

==Speaker of the House (2001-2008)==
In the [[2001 Philippine general election|2001 election]], he won without opposition as congressman of the 4th District of [[Pangasinan]]. He was reelected overwhelmingly by the House, and was voted by some critical left-wing partylist representatives. In 2003, he received an unexpected high commendation from the public when he accepted the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ruling that junked the petition for the [[impeachment]] of the [[Chief Justice]]. [http://www.inq7.net/nat/2003/nov/16/nat_12-1.htm] In the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 election]], he became instrumental for [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]'s victory as [[President of the Philippines|president]]. He also won by a landslide as congressman and was reelected as speaker for the fourth time.

===NBN-ZTE scandal===
On July 10, 2007, De Venecia's supporters opposed secret balloting by the majority coalition to select the speaker of the House of Representatives in the Fourteenth Congress. Rep. Eduardo Zialcita of Parañaque, said the House is not a "secret society." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070714065230/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/july/11/yehey/top_stories/20070711top8.html] Meanwhile, Sorsogon Rep. Jose Solis accused De Venecia's son, Jose de Venecia III, for questioning a $330 million broadband connection deal between the Philippine government and Chinese firm ZTE.
Solis hit De Venecia III for desiring to have his Amsterdam Holdings, Inc. (AHI) get the deal (which will connect national government agencies to local government units through the Internet and save government up to P3 billion in telephone expenses every year). Solis further claimed  that AHI is a "veritable mom's-and-pop's enterprise with a reported paid-up capital of only P650,000. How can AHI possibly undertake this project when it may not even have enough funds to run a mini grocery?"

===Re-election as Speaker===
On July 23, 2007, 159 lawmakers picked De Venecia House Speaker for 5th time—after the House commenced at 2:17 pm, a roll-call vote for the position. De Venecia was the lone nominee, while his opponent, Cebu Rep. Pablo Garcia, was not nominated. Iloilo Rep. Arthur Defensor was elected Majority Leader while San Juan Rep. [[Ronaldo Zamora]] was elected minority leader. The 14th Congress of the House of Representatives is composed of 240 lawmakers, 21 of whom are party-list representatives.

===Ousted as Speaker===
On January 31, 2008, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) announced that 134 congressmen signed a [[manifesto]] of "loss of confidence" versus Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr. [[Camarines Sur]] 2nd District Rep. [[Luis Villafuerte]], KAMPI president, said the successor should be [[Davao City]] [[Legislative districts of Davao City#1st District|1st District]] representative [[Prospero Nograles]].<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=107520  Abs-Cbn Interactive, KAMPI expecting new speaker by Monday]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

During the regular session on February 4, 2008, [[Palawan]] Representative Abraham Kahlil Mitra moved that the position of [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|House Speaker]] be declared vacant.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/121-votes-to-declare-Speakership-vacant-reached |title=121 votes to declare Speakership vacant reached |access-date=2008-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207003735/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/121-votes-to-declare-Speakership-vacant-reached |archive-date=2008-02-07 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Before the motion was submitted to a vote, De Venecia delivered a speech before the House where he criticized President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] and alleged that her government was behind the move to oust him from the speakership.<ref>{{cite news |title=JDV: Palace behind ouster plot against me |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=107973 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=107973 |url-status = dead|archive-date=2007-07-09 |publisher=ABS-CBN News Online |date= 2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-04 }}</ref> He recounted the times he had stood to defend President Arroyo, and said, ''"It pains me grievously to hurt the President and to hurt the First Family because I have invested so much more than any of you in this chamber to help the President become Vice President, become President…."'' Shortly after his remarks, de Venecia acknowledged to reporters: "I will join the opposition to denounce corruption in this administration. I will join the battle against corruption."
<ref>{{cite news|title=De Venecia declares ‘war’ against Arroyo |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116644/De-Venecia-declares-war-against-Arroyo |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2008-02-04 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207003602/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116644/De-Venecia-declares-war-against-Arroyo |archive-date=2008-02-07 }}</ref>

During his speech at the House plenary, De Venecia said that three military generals visited his house. They were accompanied by [[Raul Lambino]].

{{cquote|''General Santos, commanding general of the Philippine Army, commander of the United Nations Forces in East Timor, came to my house accompanied by Attorney Raul Lambino, who is his friend, and who is also my friend, and he said, 'Mr. Speaker you and your son [should] keep quiet because they want to kill you and I know they can kill you and I know they have killed other people.''}}

De Venecia's son reported the incident to the Makati City police. The Speaker, meanwhile, wrote a letter to President Arroyo to ask her to do something about the threat on their lives.

{{cquote|''My son reported this to the Makati Police and in the same day following, General Santos, such a respected general of the Armed Forces, changed his tune and said he never said such a thing. How could he say that he never said such a thing when he came to my house to ask me to listen to his story, accompanied by Raul Lambino in the presence of my son Joey, in the presence of my wife [[Gina de Venecia|Gina]].''}}

The Speaker said he asked Mrs. Arroyo in a letter to "please do something."

{{cquote|''So I wrote a letter to President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. Dear Madam President, I write to you because General Santos came to see me and said to me, and confessed to me that they wanted to kill myself and my son and that they have killed other people. I asked you because these three generals belonged to your government, please do something. That was late October of last year. Do you think up to know Malacanang has lifted a finger to arrest or to investigate these attempts on my life and of my son?''}}

"''It's simple arrogance. Just plain arrogance that Malacañang and the people of the Palace are above the law. Someday this can happen to you''," he said. The speech was delivered hours after Palawan 2nd District Rep. [[Abraham Kahlil Mitra]], an ally of Davao City Rep. [[Prospero Nograles]], moved the speaker's position be declared vacant.

==Post-speakership==
Shortly after midnight, February 5, 2008, 174 members of the House voted in favor of the motion to declare the position of House Speaker as vacant, removing de Venecia from his position. 35 members voted against the motion while 16 members abstained.<ref>{{cite news |title=De Venecia ousted as House speaker |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/De-Venecia-ousted-as-House-speaker |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207003740/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080204-116757/De-Venecia-ousted-as-House-speaker |archive-date=2008-02-07 |url-status = dead}}</ref> [[Prospero Nograles|Nograles]] was elected as the new House Speaker.

On March 10, 2008, Mr. De Venecia resigned his post as president of [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas-CMD]].  Since then he has remained active. In 2010 he travelled to the United States to speak to Filipino people who were living and working there. He mentioned that overseas workers sent over $18 billion home every year and said about this: "This is your contribution. You must be aware of it, you should be proud of it. This is why we call you the heroes and heroines of the Filipino people." <ref>[http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com/?pid=19&id=9099 Philippines political leader visits Kodiak], ''Kodiak Mirror'', September 14, 2010</ref>

In April 2017, De Venecia was appointed by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] as Special Envoy for Inter-Cultural Dialogue. The [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] said that as special envoy, De Venecia will serve to advise the administration on policies regarding cultural diversity and citizen participation under the [[UNESCO]] declaration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/09/1698259/duterte-appoints-de-venecia-special-envoy |title=Duterte appoints De Venecia as special envoy |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Viray, P.L. |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>

==Performance rating==
