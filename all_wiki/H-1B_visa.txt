{{short description|Visa category applies to people who wish to perform services in a specialty occupation, services of exceptional merit and ability}}
The '''H-1B''' is a [[United States visa|visa in the United States]] under the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]], section 101(a)(15)(H) that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ [[foreign worker]]s in specialty occupations. A specialty occupation requires the application of specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or the equivalent of work experience. The duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years; after which the visa holder may need to reapply. Laws limit the number of H-1B visas that are issued each year: 188,100 new and initial H-1B visas were issued in 2019.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|title=Worldwide NIV Workload by Visa Category FY 2019|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Non-Immigrant-Statistics/NIVWorkload/FY2019NIVWorkloadbyVisaCategory.pdf|access-date=22 June 2020|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}</ref> Employers must generally withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from the wages paid to employees in H-1B status.

The H-1B visa has its roots in the H1 visa of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]]; the split between H-1A (for nurses) and H-1B was created by the [[Immigration Act of 1990]]. 65,000 H-1B visas were made available each fiscal year, out of which employers could apply through [[Labor Condition Application]]s. Additional modifications to H1-B rules were made by legislation in [[American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act|1998]], [[American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act|2000]], in 2003 for [[Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement|Singapore]] and [[Chile–United States Free Trade Agreement|Chile]], in the [[H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004]], [[Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008|2008]], and [[Employ American Workers Act|2009]]. [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] has modified the rules in the years since then.

==Structure of the program==
An H-1B visa allows an individual to enter the United States to temporarily work at an employer in a specialty occupation. The regulations define a specialty occupation as requiring theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in a field of human endeavor<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/08/1184-|title=8 U.S. Code § 1184 - Admission of non immigrants|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> including but not limited to biotechnology, chemistry, computing, architecture, engineering, statistics, physical sciences, journalism, medicine and health: doctor, dentists, nurses, physiotherapists, etc., economics, education, research, law, accounting, business specialties, technical writing, theology, and the arts, and requiring the attainment of a bachelor's degree or its equivalent as a minimum<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/08/1184-|title=8 U.S. Code § 1184 - Admission of non-immigrants|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> (with the exception of fashion models, who must be "of distinguished merit and ability").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/08/1101-|title=8 U.S. Code § 1101 - Definitions|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> Likewise, the foreign worker must possess at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent and state licensure, if required to practice in that field. H-1B work-authorization is strictly limited to employment by the sponsoring employer.

A person in H-1B status must continue to be employed by their employer in order to stay in H-1B status. If the person's employment ends for any reason, the person must leave the United States, unless the person applies for and is granted a change of status or finds another employer compatible with the H-1B status. Effective January 17, 2017, the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] allows grace period of up to 60 days to stay in the United States after the person's end of employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-publishes-final-rule-certain-employment-based-immigrant-and-nonimmigrant-visa-programs|title=USCIS Publishes Final Rule For Certain Employment-Based Immigrant and Nonimmigrant Visa Programs|publisher=USCIS|access-date=2017-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053145/https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-publishes-final-rule-certain-employment-based-immigrant-and-nonimmigrant-visa-programs|archive-date=2017-03-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled|title=Retention of EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 Immigrant Workers and Program Improvements Affecting High-Skilled Nonimmigrant Workers|publisher=Federal Register|access-date=2017-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053918/https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27540/retention-of-eb-1-eb-2-and-eb-3-immigrant-workers-and-program-improvements-affecting-high-skilled|archive-date=2017-03-23|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Duration of stay===
The duration of stay is three years, extendable to six years. An exception to maximum length of stay applies in certain circumstances:
* If a visa holder has submitted an [[United States Permanent Resident Card#Application process for employment-based visa|I-140 immigrant petition]] or a labor certification prior to their fifth anniversary of having the H-1B visa, they are entitled to renew their H-1B visa in one-year increments until a decision has been rendered on their application for permanent residence.  This is backed up by the Immigration and Nationality Act 106(a).<ref name="thevisabulletin.com">{{cite web|url=http://thevisabulletin.com/2008/01/7th-year-h-1b-extensions-under-ac21-104c-and-106a-statutes-and-uscis-guidance/|title=7th Year H-1B Extensions Under AC21 104(c) and 106(a) – Statutes and USCIS Guidance - The Visa Bulletin|access-date=2016-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206233919/http://thevisabulletin.com/2008/01/7th-year-h-1b-extensions-under-ac21-104c-and-106a-statutes-and-uscis-guidance/|archive-date=2016-02-06|url-status=live}}</ref>
* If the visa holder has an ''approved'' I-140 immigrant petition, but is unable to initiate the final step of the [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] process due to their [[priority date]] not being current, they may be entitled to a three-year extension of their H-1B visa until their adjustment of status can finish. This exception originated with the [[American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act]] of 2000 section 104a (AC21 104a).<ref name="thevisabulletin.com"/>
* The maximum duration of the H-1B visa is ten years for exceptional [[United States Department of Defense]] project related work.

A time increment of less than three years has sometimes applied to citizens of specific countries.  For example, during [[Melania Trump]]'s time as a H-1B visa holder, she was limited to one year increments, which was the maximum time allowed then per H-1B visa for citizens of [[Slovenia]]. Melania Trump became a citizen in 2006.<ref name="slovenia-one-year">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/09/14/melania_trump_vindicated_with_immigration_story.html|title=Looks Like the Melania Trump Immigration Story Was a Case of Bad Reporting|last=Stahl|first=Jeremy|date=September 14, 2016|access-date=November 4, 2016|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106063533/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/09/14/melania_trump_vindicated_with_immigration_story.html|archive-date=November 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

H-1B holders who want to continue to work in the U.S. after six years, but who have not obtained permanent residency status, must remain outside of the U.S. for one year before reapplying for another H-1B visa if they do not qualify for one of the exceptions noted above allowing for extensions beyond six years.<ref name="harvard-six-years">{{cite web|url=http://www.hio.harvard.edu/h-1b-visa|title=H-1B Visa|access-date=November 28, 2016|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129083224/http://www.hio.harvard.edu/h-1b-visa|archive-date=November 29, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite a limit on length of stay, no requirement exists that the individual remain for any period in the job the visa was originally issued for. This is known as H-1B portability or transfer, provided the new employer sponsors another H-1B visa, which may or may not be subjected to the quota.

===Congressional yearly numerical cap and exemptions===
The [[Immigration Act of 1990]] established a limit of 65,000 foreign nationals who may be issued a visa or otherwise provided H-1B status each [[U.S. fiscal year|fiscal year]]; the annual limit is often called a quota or a cap. An additional 20,000 H-1Bs are available to foreign nationals holding a master's or higher degree from U.S. universities. In addition, excluded from the ceiling are all H-1B non-immigrants who work at (but not necessarily for) universities, non-profit research facilities associated with universities, and government research facilities.<ref>American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, Pub. L.No.106-313, 114 Stat.1251, 2000 S. 2045; Pub. L. No. 106-311, 114 Stat. 1247 (2000 Oct 17), 2000 HR5362; 146 Cong. Rec. H9004-06 (2000 October 5)</ref>

Institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations that are related or affiliated to institutions of higher education, nonprofit research organizations, and governmental-research organizations are exempt from H-1B annual quotas. Contractors working at, but not directly employed by, these institutions may be exempt from the annual quotas as well. However, employers must show that, first, the majority of the worker's duties will be performed at the qualifying institution, organization or entity and, second, the job duties directly and predominantly further the essential purpose, mission objectives or functions of the qualifying institution, organization, or entity.

The Chile–United States Free Trade Agreement and the Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement created a separate quota of 1,400 H-1B1 visas for Chilean nationals and 5,400 H-1B1 visas for Singapore nationals. If these reserved visas are not used, however, then they added to the following fiscal year's H-1B annual quota.

Due to these exemptions and rollovers, the number of H-1B visas issued each year is often greater than 65,000, such as when 117,828 H-1B visas were issued in fiscal year 2010, 129,552 in fiscal year 2011, and 135,991 in fiscal year 2012.<ref name="FY2011AnnualReport">{{Cite web |url=http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/statistics/statistics_5641.html |title=FY2011 |access-date=2012-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119150225/http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/statistics/statistics_5641.html |archive-date=2013-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="FY2012AnnualReport">{{Cite web |url=http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/statistics/statistics_5861.html |title=FY2012 |access-date=2013-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512035926/http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/statistics/statistics_5861.html |archive-date=2013-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In some years, the cap was not reached. For example, in fiscal year 1996, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (now known as USCIS) announced on August 20, 1996, that a preliminary report indicated that the quota had been exceeded, and processing of H-1B applications was temporarily halted.  However, when more accurate numbers became available on September 6, it became apparent the quota had not been reached after all, and processing resumed for the remainder of the fiscal year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aila.org/infonet/ins-statement-on-h-1b-visa-cap|title=INS Statement on H-1B Visa Cap|date=September 16, 1996|access-date=November 4, 2016|publisher=[[American Immigration Lawyers Association]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106062540/http://www.aila.org/infonet/ins-statement-on-h-1b-visa-cap|archive-date=November 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] starts accepting applications on the first business day of April for visas that count against the fiscal year starting in October. For instance, H-1B visa applications that count against the fiscal year 2013 cap were submitted starting Monday, 2012 April 2. USCIS accepts H-1B visa applications no more than 6 months in advance of the requested start date.<ref name="Filing Details">{{cite web|title=H-1B Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 Cap Season|url=http://www.uscis.gov/h-1b_count|publisher=[[USCIS]]|access-date=2012-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/612crusvx?url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=bf309b5d82420210VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=68439c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD|archive-date=2011-08-18|quote=H-1B petitions can be filed no more than six months in advance of the requested start date. Therefore, petitions seeking an FY2010 H-1B Cap number with an 2009 Oct. 1 start date can be filed no sooner than 2009 April 1.}}</ref> Beneficiaries not subject to the annual cap are those who currently hold cap-subject H-1B status or have held cap-subject H-1B status at some point in the past six years.

=== Lottery ===

Each year, generally on April 1, the H-1B season commences for the following federal fiscal year; employment authorizations are granted on October 1. Due to a pre-employment application limit window of six months, the first weekday in April is the earliest that an applicant may legally apply for the next year's allotment of cap-subject H-1B.<ref name="Filing Details"/> H-1B "cap cases" are delineated on the envelope's label, preferably in red ink, with "Regular Cap" for the bachelor's degree, "C/S Cap" for H-1B1 treaty cases and "U.S. Master'"s for the U.S. master's degrees or higher exemption.<ref name="2015 Cap Instructions"/> USCIS publishes a memo when enough cap-subject applications have been received, indicating the closure of cap-subject application season,<ref name="Cap Reached FY2015"/> the associated random selection process is often referred to as the H-1B lottery.<ref name="ComputerWorld Lottery"/>  Those who have the U.S. master's exemption have two chances to be selected in the lottery:  first, a lottery is held to award the 20,000 visas available to master's degree holders, and those not selected are then entered in the regular lottery for the other 65,000 visas.  Those without a U.S. master's are entered only in the second, regular, lottery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/archive/uscis-reaches-fy-2017-h-1b-cap|title=USCIS Reaches FY 2017 H-1B Cap|date=April 7, 2016|access-date=November 4, 2016|publisher=[[USCIS]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106063856/https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-reaches-fy-2017-h-1b-cap|archive-date=November 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Pro-H-1B pundits claim that the early closure, and number of applications received (172,500 in Fiscal Year 2015), are indications of employment demand and advocate increasing the 65,000 bachelor's degree cap.<ref name="FWD Increase cap 2015"/>  David North, of the Center for Immigration Studies, claimed that unlike other immigration categories, H-1B filing fees, for applications which are not randomly selected, are refunded to the intending employer. However, applications that are not selected are simply returned unopened to the petitioner, with no money changing hands or refunded.

''[[Computerworld]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' have reported on the inordinate share of H-1B visas received by firms that specialize in offshore-outsourcing,<ref name="ComputerWorld Lottery"/> the subsequent inability of employers to hire foreign professionals with legitimate technical and language skill combinations,<ref name="NYT Gaming System"/> and the outright replacement of American professionals already performing their job functions and being coerced to train their foreign replacements.<ref name="Computerworld Muzzled"/><ref name="Disney NYTimes"/>

===Tax status of an individual with H-1B status===
The taxation of income for an individual with H-1B status depends on whether they are categorized as either ''nonresident aliens'' or ''resident aliens'' for tax purposes.<ref>"[https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/employers-must-withhold-fica-taxes-for-aliens-who-change-visa-status-to-h1b Employers Must Withhold FICA Taxes for Aliens who Change Visa Status to H-1B] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030104/https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/employers-must-withhold-fica-taxes-for-aliens-who-change-visa-status-to-h1b |date=2018-01-01 }}."

''Internal Revenue Service''. November 29, 2017.</ref>

The classification is determined based on the [[substantial presence test]].<ref>"[https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test Substantial Presence Test] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030420/https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test |date=2018-01-01 }}." ''Internal Revenue Service''. August 3, 2017.</ref> If the substantial presence test indicates that the individual is a resident, then income taxation is like any other U.S. person and may be filed using [[Form 1040]] and the necessary schedules. Otherwise, the individual must file as a non-resident alien using Form 1040NR or Form 1040NR-EZ; the individual may claim a benefit from [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] that exist between the United States and the individual's country of citizenship.

An individual in the first year in the U.S. may choose to be considered a resident for taxation purposes for the entire year, and must pay taxes on their worldwide income for that year. This first-year choice can only be made once in an individual's lifetime. A spouse, regardless of visa status, must include a valid [[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]] or [[Social Security number]] on a joint tax return with the individual in H-1B status.<ref>"[https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-spouse-treated-as-a-resident Nonresident Spouse Treated as a Resident] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030526/https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-spouse-treated-as-a-resident |date=2018-01-01 }}."

Tax filing rules for an individual in H-1B status may be complex, depending on the individual situation. A tax professional who is knowledgeable about the rules for foreigners may be consulted.

====Social Security tax and Medicare tax====
Employers must generally withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from the wages paid to employees in H-1B status.<ref>"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf Publication 15: (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029152116/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf |date=2018-10-29 }}."

=== H-1B and intent to immigrate permanently ===

Even though the H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa, it is one of the few temporary visa categories recognized as ''[[dual intent]]'', meaning an H-1B holder could legally have an immigration intent (apply for and obtain the [[Lawful permanent residents (United States)|green card]]) while still being a holder of the H-1B visa.<ref name= henrychang>Chang, Henry L.

H-1B visa holders can bring immediate family members (spouse and children under 21) to the United States under the [[H-4 visa]] category as [[Dependent (law)|dependents]].<ref>Rosenow, Manfred (May 20, 1991). "How Foreigners Can Work Temporarily in This Country." ''The Miami Herald''. p. 13B.</ref>

An H-4 visa holder may remain in the U.S. as long as the H-1B visa holder retains legal status. An H-4 visa holder is allowed to attend school, apply for a driver's license, and open a bank account in the United States.

Effective May 26, 2015, [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] allows some spouses of H-1B visa holders to apply for eligibility to work in the United States.<ref name= highlyskilled>Iyengar, Rishi.

===Administrative processing===
When an H-1B worker travels outside the U.S. for any reason (other than to Canada or Mexico), he or she must have a valid visa stamped on his or her passport for re-entry in the United States. If the worker has an expired stamp but an unexpired i-797 petition, he or she will need to appear in a U.S. Embassy to get a new stamp. In some cases, H-1B workers can be required to undergo "[[Security Advisory Opinion|administrative processing]]," involving extra background checks of different types.  Under current rules, these checks are supposed to take ten days or less, but in some cases, have lasted years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alden|first=Edward|title=America's 'National Suicide'|journal=Newsweek|date=10 April 2011|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/04/10/america-s-national-suicide.html|access-date=5 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704155013/http://www.newsweek.com/2011/04/10/america-s-national-suicide.html|archive-date=4 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Complications for entrepreneurs and consultants===

The United States immigration system's EB-5 visa program permits foreign entrepreneurs to apply for a green card if they make a sufficient investment in a commercial enterprise and intend to create 10 or more jobs in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.uscis.gov/eb-5 |title=EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program |access-date=2017-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120013738/https://www.uscis.gov/eb-5 |archive-date=2017-11-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Dissatisfied with this mechanism, and taking advantage of the lack of a cap for H-1B visa issued to educational institutions, the [[University of Massachusetts]] began a program in 2014 that allows entrepreneurs to found U.S. companies while fulfilling visa requirements by teaching and mentoring on campus, with the university as sponsoring employer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2017/05/01/massachusetts-entrepreneur-visa-alternative |title=How A Mass.

==Application process==
The process of getting a H-1B visa has three stages:

* The employer files with the [[United States Department of Labor]] a [[Labor Condition Application]] (LCA) for the employee, making relevant attestations, including attestations about wages (showing that the wage is at least equal to the prevailing wage and wages paid to others in the company in similar positions) and working conditions.<ref>Tai, Wendy S. (September 29, 1991). "'Prevailing wage' has high-tech companies on edge." ''Star Tribune'' (Minneapolis, Minnesota). p. 19A.</ref>
* With an approved Labor Condition Application, the employer files a [[Form I-129]] (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker) requesting H-1B classification for the worker. This must be accompanied by necessary supporting documents and fees.<ref>Seguritan, Reuben S, Esq. (March 25, 2016). "USCIS Issues H-1B Filing Instructions". ''The Filipino Express'' (Jersey City, New Jersey). p. 10, 12.</ref>
* Once the Form I-129 is approved, the worker may begin working with the H-1B classification on or after the indicated start date of the job, if already physically present in the United States in valid status at the time. If the employee is outside the United States, he/she may use the approved Form I-129 and supporting documents to apply for the H-1B visa. With a H-1B visa, the worker may present himself or herself at a United States port of entry seeking admission to the United States, and get a [[Form I-94]] to enter the United States. (Employees who started a job on H-1B status without a H-1B visa because they were already in the United States still need to get a H-1B visa if they ever leave and wish to reenter the United States while on H-1B status.)

==History==
===Creation===
On June 27, 1952, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality Act]] after overriding a veto by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]. For the first time, the Immigration and Nationality Act codified United States' immigration, naturalization, and nationality law into permanent statutes, and it introduced a system of selective immigration by giving special preference to foreigners possessing skills that are urgently needed by the country.<ref>Trussell, C.P. (June 27, 1952). "Immigration Bill Repassed by House Over Truman Veto: McCarran Measure to Codify Alien Laws Wins 17 Votes Over Two-thirds Majority". ''The New York Times''. p. 1.</ref> Several different types of visas were established, including a H-1 visa for "an alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning who is of distinguished merit and ability and who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services of an exceptional nature requiring such merit and ability."<ref name= ina1952>"[https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-66/pdf/STATUTE-66-Pg163.pdf Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129175216/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-66/pdf/STATUTE-66-Pg163.pdf |date=2019-01-29 }}". ''United States Congress''. via Government Printing Office. June 27, 1952.</ref> The term "distinguished merit and ability" was not new to United States immigration law; it had previously been used as a qualification for musicians and artists who had wanted to enter the United States.<ref>"Equity to Support the Dickstein Bill". ''The New York Times''. March 5, 1932. p. 11.</ref><ref>"Foreign Musicians Face Rigid Tests: 'Distinguished Merit and Ability' May Enter America, Washington Rules". ''The New York Times''. October 28, 1934. p. N1.</ref> The visa was called an H-1 visa because it had been made into law by section 101(15)(H)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<ref name= ina1952/>

===Immigration Act of 1990===
The [[Immigration Act of 1990]] was signed into law by President [[George H. W. Bush]] on November 20, 1990. The H-1 visa was replaced by two different visas. An H-1A visa was created for nurses, and the H-1B visa was established for workers in a "specialty occupation". The Immigration Act defined a specialty occupation as "an occupation that requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States". In order to qualify, a visa applicant needed any applicable state license for the particular occupation and either a educational degree related to the occupation or an equivalent amount of professional experience. For the first time, there was established a quota of 65,000 H-1B visas available each fiscal year, rather than an unlimited amount before. An employer was required by law to pay such employees at least the prevailing wage for the position, and employers were required to make certain attestations by way of a [[Labor Condition Application]].<ref>"Hiring skilled non-citizens OK if done properly." ''The Telegraph'' (Nashua, New Hampshire). March 16, 1999.</ref><ref>Rosenow, Manfred (February 10, 1991). "Professional Visas Now Tough to Obtain." ''The Miami Herald''. p. 14B.</ref>

===American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998===
President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act]] into law on October 21, 1998. The law required that each application for an H-1B must include an additional $500 payment, which would be used for retraining U.S. workers in order to reduce the need for H-1B visas in the future. The quota of H-1B visas was increased from 65,000 to 115,000 for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 only. For an [[H-1B-dependent employer|employer with a large number of employees in H-1B status]] or who had committed a willful misrepresentation in the recent past, the employer [[H-1B-dependent employer#Attestations needed|attest]] that the additional H-1B worker would not displace any U.S. workers.<ref name="GAO Report 2000">"[http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/he00157.pdf H-1B Foreign Workers – Better Controls Needed to Help Employers and Protect Workers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924020849/http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/he00157.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}".

===American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act of 2000===
On October 17, 2000, the [[American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act]] was signed by President Bill Clinton.<ref>Ingber, Jerome B. (November 30, 2000). "Immigration News": American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (ACT21)". ''Asian Pages'' (St. Paul, Minnesota). p. 12.</ref> Under the law, the required retraining fee was increased from $500 to $1,000. The quota was increased to 195,000 H-1B visas in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003 only. Nonprofit research institutions sponsoring workers for H-1B visas became exempt from the H-1B visa quotas.<ref>Kaye, Allen E; Danilov, Dan P. (July 20, 2000). "Immigration Update: Major provisions of H-1B law from 1998 presented". ''Filipino Reporter'' (New York, New York). p. 22.</ref>

Under the law, a worker in H-1B status who had already been subject to a visa quota would not be subject to quotas if requesting a transfer to a new employer or if applying for a three-year extension.<ref name="Senate Passed $600 Million Border Security Bill and Increases H-1B and L-1 Visa Application Fees">"[http://www.katiraeilaw.com/newsletter/125.html?task=view Changes to the H-1B and L-1 Visa Application Fees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819085029/http://www.katiraeilaw.com/newsletter/125.html?task=view |date=2010-08-19 }}".

===Singapore–United States and Chile–United States Free Trade Agreements in 2003===
Congress ratified the [[Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement]] in 2003. It ratified the [[Chile–United States Free Trade Agreement]] later that year. With these free trade agreements, a new H-1B1 visa was established as being available solely for people from either [[Singapore]] or [[Chile]]. Unlike H-1B visas that had a limited renewal time, H-1B1 visas can be renewed indefinitely. H-1B1 visas are subject to a separate quota of 6,000 per fiscal year. Unlike H-1B visas, an H-1B1 visa is not a [[dual-intent visa]], and an H-1B1 applicant must convince the visa officer that they have not intention of permanently immigrating to the United States.

===H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004===
The [[H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004]] was a part of the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005]], which President [[George W. Bush]] signed on December 6, 2004. For employers with 26 or more employees, the required retraining fee was increased from $1,000 to $1,500, and it was reduced to $750 for all other employers. A new $500 "anti-fraud fee" was established that was required to be paid by the employer with the visa application.<ref name= 62H>"[https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/FactSheet62/whdfs62H.pdf Fact Sheet #62H: What are the rules concerning deductions from an H-1B worker’s pay?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207182434/https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/FactSheet62/whdfs62H.pdf |date=2017-12-07 }}" ''Wage and Hour Division''. [[United States Department of Labor]]. August 2009.</ref> While the H-1B quota returned to 65,000 per year, the law added 20,000 visas for applicants with [[J-1 visa|J-1]] status with either a [[master's degree]] or a [[doctorate degree]] from a U.S. graduate school. Governmental entities became exempt from H-1B visa quotas. According to the law, H-1B visas that were revoked due to either fraud or willful misrepresentation would be added to the H-1B visa quota for the following fiscal year. The law also allowed one-year extensions of H-1B for H-1B visa holders who were applying for [[U.S. permanent residency|permanent residency]] and whose petitions had been pending for a long time. The United States Department of Labor had more investigative authority, but an employer could defend against misdeeds by using either the Good Faith Compliance Defense or the Recognized Industry Standards Defense.

===Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008===
The [[Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008]] federalized immigration in the U.S. territory of the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], and it stipulated that, during a transition period, numerical limitations would not apply to otherwise qualified workers in the H visa category in the U.S. territories of [[Guam]] and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.<ref>"[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ229.110 Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327035051/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ229.110 |date=2009-03-27 }}". via United States Government Printing Office. 2008.</ref> The exemption does not apply to any employment to be performed outside of Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.<ref>"Immigration Q & A: Details on H1-B, H-2B Cap Exemptions for Guam, CNMI".

===2010 memorandum about employee-employer relationship===
On January 8, 2010, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a memorandum stating that there must be a clear employee-employer relationship between the petitioner (employer) and the beneficiary (prospective visa holder). The memorandum outlines what the employer must do to be considered in compliance as well as putting forth the documentation requirements to back up the employer's assertion that a valid relationship exists.<ref name= memo-2010-01-08>Neufield, Donald (January 8, 2010).

A valid employee-employer relationship typically includes many of the following: supervising the worker on- and off-site; maintaining such supervision through calls, reports, or visits; having a right to control the work on a day-to-day basis if such control is required; providing the worker with the tools and equipment needed for the job; having the ability to hire, pay, and terminate the worker's job; evaluating the worker's products, progress, and performance; provision of some type of employee benefits; allowing the worker to use the employer's proprietary information when performing work; assigning work to the worker that produces an end-product related to the employer's business; and having the ability to control the manner and means in which the worker accomplishes tasks. The memorandum further states that "common law is flexible about how these factors are to be weighed".<ref name= memo-2010-01-08/>

In 2015, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services issued final guidance stating that an H-1B worker whose work site location of changes to a different metropolitan area, the change is considered a material change that requires the employer to certify a new [[Labor Condition Application]] to the Department of Homeland Security. Temporary changes of work site do not require a new Labor Condition Application, such as when the H-1B worker attends a training session, a seminar, or a conference of a short duration or when the H-1B worker is temporarily moved to a short-term placements of less than 30 days. If the amended H-1B petition is disapproved but the original petition remains valid, then the H-1B worker retains their H-1B status as long as they return to work at the original work site.<ref>Phulwani, Michael, Esq; Nachman, David H, Esq; Singh, Rabindra K, Esq.

===2017 memorandum on computer-programming positions===
A memorandum from December 22, 2000, stated that, because most computer-programming positions required a bachelor's degree, computer programming was considered a specialty occupation that qualified for an H-1B visa.<ref>Wolfsdorf, Bernard; Aguirre, Josune; Blanco, Robert.

===Proposed reform in 2017 and 2018===
In 2017, the U.S. Congress considered more than doubling the minimum wage required for an H-1B holder from the $60,000 (USD) established in 1989 and unchanged since then. The High Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act, introduced by U.S. Rep. [[Zoe Lofgren]] of [[California]], would raise H-1B holders' minimum salaries to $130,000.<ref>{{citation|publisher=[[Press Trust of India]]|via=[[Hindustan Times]]|title=H-1B visa bill tabled: It's difficult to replace Americans with Indian I-T workers|date=January 31, 2017|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h-1b-reform-bill-tabled-in-us-house-of-representatives-calls-for-doubling-minimum-salary/story-e39yDrVVuHXDbwVafPSPhK.html|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123716/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h-1b-reform-bill-tabled-in-us-house-of-representatives-calls-for-doubling-minimum-salary/story-e39yDrVVuHXDbwVafPSPhK.html|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The action was criticized in the Indian press for confirming "the worst fears of [Indian] IT companies" in the wake of the [[#2016 presidential election and the H-1B visa|reforms discussed during the 2016 Presidential election]] by both major candidates, and for causing a 5% drop in the [[BSE SENSEX]] index.<ref>{{citation|title=H1-B (sic) visas: Shock and awe begins for Indian IT companies|author=Sutanu Guru|work=[[Businessworld]]|location=New Delhi|date=January 31, 2017|url=http://www.businessworld.in/article/H1-B-Visas-Shock-And-Awe-Begins-For-Indian-IT-Companies/31-01-2017-112172/|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203161449/http://www.businessworld.in/article/H1-B-Visas-Shock-And-Awe-Begins-For-Indian-IT-Companies/31-01-2017-112172/|archive-date=February 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Though, India in general has been welcoming this change and requirement since 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/PM-Narendra-Modi-to-Indian-Diaspora-India-is-waiting-for-you/articleshow/49133237.cms |title=PM Narendra Modi to Indian Diaspora: 'India is waiting for you' |access-date=2019-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608173413/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/PM-Narendra-Modi-to-Indian-Diaspora-India-is-waiting-for-you/articleshow/49133237.cms |archive-date=2016-06-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> Lofgren's office described it as a measure to "curb [[outsourcing]] abuse" citing unfair tech hiring practices by employers including Disney and [[University of California San Francisco]].<ref>{{citation|title=Lofgren introduces bill to curb job outsourcing|date=January 24, 2017|work=Official website|publisher=United States Congress|author=Lofgren staff|url=https://lofgren.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398125|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202201201/https://lofgren.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398125|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Protections for U.S. workers==

===Labor Condition Application===

{{further|Labor Condition Application}}

The [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] (DOL) is responsible for ensuring that foreign workers do not displace or adversely affect wages or working conditions of U.S. workers. For every H-1B petition filed with the USCIS, there must be included a Labor Condition Application (LCA) (not to be confused with the [[labor certification]]), certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. The LCA is designed to ensure that the wage offered to the non-immigrant worker meets or exceeds the "prevailing wage" in the area of employment.  ("Immigration law has a number of highly technical terms that may not mean the same thing to the average reader."<ref name="USCISglossary">{{cite web| url = http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=b328194d3e88d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD&vgnextchannel=b328194d3e88d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD| title = glossary| publisher = USCIS| access-date = 18 March 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130923175331/http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=b328194d3e88d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD&vgnextchannel=b328194d3e88d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD| archive-date = 23 September 2013| url-status = live}}</ref>) The LCA also contains an attestation section designed to prevent the program from being used to import foreign workers to break a [[labor strike|strike]] or replace U.S. citizen workers.

While an employer is not required to advertise the position before hiring an H-1B non-immigrant pursuant to the H-1B visa approval, the employer must notify the employee representative about the Labor Condition Application (LCA)—or if there is no such representation, the employer must publish the LCA at the workplace and the employer's office. Under the regulations, LCAs are a matter of public record. Corporations hiring H-1B workers are required to make these records available to any member of the public who requests to look at them. Copies of the relevant records are also available from various web sites, including the Department of Labor.

====History of the Labor Condition Application form====
The LCA must be filed electronically using Form ETA 9035E.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/preh1bform.cfm|title=Important Foreign Labor Certification H-1B Information|access-date=2012-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816020650/http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/preh1bform.cfm|archive-date=2012-08-16|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the years, the complexity of the form increased from one page in 1997<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6A88twC5c?url=http://www.doleta.gov/regions/reg05/Documents/eta-9035.pdf|archive-date=August 23, 2012|date=Nov 30, 1997|title=Labor Condition Application for H-1B Nonimmigrants|publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]]|url=http://www.doleta.gov/regions/reg05/Documents/eta-9035.pdf|access-date=May 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> to three pages in 2008, to five pages as of August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/ETA_Form_9035.pdf|title=Labor Condition Application for Nonimmigrant Workers ETA Form 9035 & 9035E|publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]]|archive-date=August 23, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6A89PULJv?url=http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/ETA_Form_9035.pdf|access-date=August 23, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Employer attestations===
By signing the LCA, the employer attests that:<ref>{{cite web|work=ETA-9035|title=Labor Condition Application for H-1B Nonimmigrants|url=http://www.doleta.gov/regions/reg05/Documents/eta-9035.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2012-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6A88twC5c?url=http://www.doleta.gov/regions/reg05/Documents/eta-9035.pdf|archive-date=2012-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* The employer pays H-1B non-immigrants the same wage level paid to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications for that specific employment, or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of employment, whichever is higher.
* The employment of H-1B non-immigrants does not adversely affect working conditions of workers similarly employed.
* On the date the application is signed and submitted, there is not a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute in the occupation in which H-1B non-immigrants will be employed at the place of employment. If such a strike or lockout occurs after this application is submitted, the employer must notify the DOL's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) within three days, and the application is not used to support petition filings with USCIS (formerly known as INS) for H-1B non-immigrants to work in the same occupation at the place of employment until ETA determines the strike or lockout is over.
* A copy of this application has been, or will be, provided to each H-1B non-immigrant employed pursuant to this application, and, as of the application date, notice of this application has been provided to workers employed in the occupation in which H-1B non-immigrants will be employed:
** Notice of this filing has been provided to bargaining representative of workers in the occupation in which H-1B non-immigrants will be employed; or
** There is no such bargaining representative; therefore, a notice of this filing has been posted and was, or will remain, posted for 10 days in at least two conspicuous locations where H-1B non-immigrants will be employed.

The law requires H-1B workers to be paid the higher of the prevailing wage for the same occupation and geographic location, or the same as the employer pays to similarly situated employees. Other factors, such as age and skill were not permitted to be taken into account for the prevailing wage. Congress changed the program in 2004 to require the Department of Labor to provide four skill-based prevailing wage levels for employers to use. This is the only prevailing wage mechanism the law permits that incorporates factors other than occupation and location.

The approval process for these applications are based on employer attestations and documentary evidence submitted. The employer is advised of their liability if they are replacing a U.S. worker.

===Limits on employment authorization===
USCIS clearly states the following concerning H-1B nonimmigrants' employment authorization.

{{quote|H-1B nonimmigrants may only work for the petitioning U.S. employer and only in the H-1B activities described in the petition. The petitioning U.S. employer may place the H-1B worker on the worksite of another employer if all applicable rules (e.g., Department of Labor rules) are followed. Generally, a nonimmigrant employee may work for more than one employer at the same time. However, each employer must follow the process for initially applying for a nonimmigrant employee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/About%20Us/Electronic%20Reading%20Room/Customer%20Service%20Reference%20Guide/Nonimmigrant_Empl.pdf|title=Nonimmigrant-Based Employment|date=27 Jun 2012|access-date=6 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002154234/http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/About%20Us/Electronic%20Reading%20Room/Customer%20Service%20Reference%20Guide/Nonimmigrant_Empl.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

When a H-1B nonimmigrant works with multiple employers, if any of employers fail to file the petition, it is considered as an unauthorized employment and the nonimmigrant fails to maintain the status.

===H-1B fees earmarked for U.S. worker education and training===
In 2007, the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (ETA), reported on two programs, the High Growth Training Initiative and Workforce Innovation Regional Economic Development (WIRED), which have received or will receive $284 million and $260 million, respectively, from H-1B training fees to educate and train U.S. workers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
According to the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' $1 billion from H-1B fees have been distributed by the [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Department]] to further train the U.S. workforce since 2001.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2018709561_h1b18.html | work=The Seattle Times | first=Sanjay | last=Bhatt | title=Seattle ranks high in skilled foreign workers on H-1B visas | date=July 18, 2012 | access-date=July 21, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721054820/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2018709561_h1b18.html | archive-date=July 21, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Criticisms of the program==

The H-1B program has been criticized on many grounds. It was the subject of a hearing, "Immigration Reforms Needed to Protect Skilled American Workers," by the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] on March 17, 2015.<ref name="judiciary.senate.gov03">{{cite web|title=Immigration Reforms Needed to Protect Skilled American Workers|url=http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/immigration-reforms-needed-to-protect-skilled-american-workers|website=judiciary.senate.gov|publisher=United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|access-date=June 7, 2015|date=March 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601091334/http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/immigration-reforms-needed-to-protect-skilled-american-workers|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=cspan031715>{{cite web|title=Immigration Reforms Needed to Protect Skilled American Workers|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?104517-1/immigration-reforms-needed-protect-skilled-american-workers|website=c-span.org|publisher=C-Span|access-date=June 7, 2015|format=video|date=March 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623024808/http://www.c-span.org/video/?104517-1%2Fimmigration-reforms-needed-protect-skilled-american-workers|archive-date=June 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] of Iowa, chairman of the committee:

{{quote|The program was intended to serve employers who could not find the skilled workers they needed in the United States. Most people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet, under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first. And, if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over – rather than complement – the U.S. workforce.<ref name=SJCGrassley>{{cite web|author1=Chuck Grassley|title=Prepared Statement by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee At a hearing entitled: "Immigration Reforms Needed to Protect Skilled American Workers"|url=http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/03-17-15%20Grassley%20Statement1.pdf|website=judiciary.senate.gov|publisher=Senate Judiciary Committee|access-date=June 7, 2015|date=March 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623025446/http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/03-17-15%20Grassley%20Statement1.pdf|archive-date=June 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

According to the [[editorial board]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', speaking in June 2015, loopholes and lax enforcement of the H-1B visa program has resulted in exploitation of both visa holders and American workers.<ref name=NYT61515>{{cite news|author1=The Editorial Board of The New York Times|title=Workers Betrayed by Visa Loopholes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/opinion/workers-betrayed-by-visa-loopholes.html|access-date=June 16, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=June 15, 2015|format=editorial|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615174827/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/opinion/workers-betrayed-by-visa-loopholes.html|archive-date=June 15, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Use for outsourcing===
In some cases, rather than being used to hire talented workers not available in the American labor market, the program is being used for [[outsourcing]].<ref name = MJ022213 /> Senators [[Dick Durbin]] of Illinois and Charles Grassley of Iowa began introducing "The H-1B and L-1 Visa Fraud & Prevention Act" in 2007. According to Durbin, speaking in 2009, "The H-1B visa program should complement the U.S. workforce, not replace it;" "The…program is plagued with fraud and abuse and is now a vehicle for outsourcing that deprives qualified American workers of their jobs." The proposed legislation has been opposed by [[Compete America]], a tech industry lobbying group,<ref name=BW42409>Herbst, Moira (April 24, 2009).

The [[H-1B visa#Labor Condition Application|Labor Condition Application]] (LCA) included in the H-1B petition is supposed to ensure that H-1B workers are paid the prevailing wage in the labor market, or the employer's actual average wage (whichever is higher), but evidence exists that some employers do not abide by these provisions and avoid paying the actual prevailing wage despite stiff penalties for abusers.<ref>[http://www.millerjohnson.com/pubs/xprPubDetail.aspx?xpST=PubDetail&pub=1406 "H-1B Prevailing Wage Enforcement On The Rise – Millions In Back Wages And Fines Ordered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627231251/http://www.millerjohnson.com/pubs/xprPubDetail.aspx?xpST=PubDetail&pub=1406 |date=2011-06-27 }}, ''millerjohnson.com''.</ref>

Theoretically, the LCA process appears to offer protection to both U.S. and H-1B workers. However, according to the U.S. General Accounting Office, enforcement limitations and procedural problems render these protections ineffective.<ref name="GAO Report 2000" /> Ultimately, the employer, not the Department of Labor, determines what sources determine the prevailing wage for an offered position, and it may choose among a variety of competing surveys, including its own wage surveys, provided that such surveys follow certain defined rules and regulations.

The law specifically restricts the Department of Labor's approval process of LCAs to checking for "completeness and obvious inaccuracies."<ref>8 USC 1182 (n)</ref> In FY 2005, only about 800 LCAs were rejected out of over 300,000 submitted. [[Hire Americans First]] has posted several hundred first hand accounts of individuals negatively impacted by the program.<ref name="harm-report"/>

According to attorney John Miano, the H-1B prevailing wage requirement is "rife" with loopholes.<ref name="laplante"/>  Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, compiled the median wage in 2005 for new H-1B information technology (IT), these wages were found to $50,000, lower than starting wages for IT graduates with a B.S. degree.

In 2002, the U.S. government began an investigation into Sun Microsystems' hiring practices after an ex-employee, Guy Santiglia, filed complaints with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and [[U.S. Department of Labor]] alleging that the [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] firm discriminates against American citizens in favor of foreign workers on H-1B visas. Santiglia accused the company of bias against U.S. citizens when it laid off 3,900 workers in late 2001 and at the same time applied for thousands of visas.

===2016 presidential election and the H-1B visa===
{{further|#Proposed reform in 2017 and 2018}}
The H-1B visa became an issue in the 2016 United States presidential election. According to ''Computerworld'', candidate [[Donald Trump]] took a stance to "pause" and re-write the H-1B system.<ref name=CW2016>{{cite news | url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3096103/it-careers/the-h-1b-positions-of-clinton-and-trump.html | work=Computerworld | author=Patrick Thibodeau | title=The H-1B positions of Clinton and Trump: Where the two candidates stand on tech-related immigration | date=July 17, 2016 | access-date=August 18, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820021949/http://www.computerworld.com/article/3096103/it-careers/the-h-1b-positions-of-clinton-and-trump.html | archive-date=August 20, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> Additionally, during some of his rallies he invited guest speakers to raise awareness of the hundreds of IT workers who were displaced by H-1B guest workers. Candidate Hillary Clinton spoke negatively of H-1B workers being hired because they are less expensive and since they are reliant on the employer, more likely to be compliant during abuse. Clinton said that she was unlikely to consider the H-1B system individually and only would look towards reforms as part of a comprehensive immigration reform.<ref name=CW2016/>

===Risks for employees===
Historically, H-1B holders have sometimes been described as [[indentured servants]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Skilled Workers – or Indentured Servants? |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |first=Brian |last=Grow |date=June 6, 2003 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2003/ca20030610_2638_ca014.htm |access-date=January 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008041446/http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2003/ca20030610_2638_ca014.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> and while the comparison is no longer as compelling, it had more validity prior to the passage of American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000. Indeed, guest workers on H-1B visas in the IT sector have a significant degree of inter-firm mobility.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Depew|first1=Briggs|last2=Norlander|first2=Peter|last3=Sørensen|first3=Todd A.|date=2017-04-01|title=Inter-firm mobility and return migration patterns of skilled guest workers|journal=Journal of Population Economics|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=681–721|doi=10.1007/s00148-016-0607-y|s2cid=157117882|issn=1432-1475|url=http://bus.lsu.edu/McMillin/Working_Papers/pap14_06.pdf}}</ref> Although immigration generally requires short- and long-term visitors to disavow any ambition to seek the [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] (permanent residency), H-1B visa holders are an important exception, in that the H-1B is legally acknowledged as a possible step towards a green card under what is called the doctrine of [[dual intent]].

H-1B visa holders may be sponsored for their green cards by their employers through an Application for Alien Labor Certification, filed with the U.S. Department of Labor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the past, the sponsorship process has taken several years, and for much of that time the H-1B visa holder was unable to change jobs without losing their place in line for the green card. This created an element of enforced loyalty to an employer by an H-1B visa holder. Critics{{Who|date=November 2009}} alleged that employers benefit from this enforced loyalty because it reduced the risk that the H-1B employee might leave the job and go work for a competitor, and that it put citizen workers at a disadvantage in the job market, since the employer has less assurance that the citizen will stay at the job for an extended period of time, especially if the work conditions are tough, wages are lower or the work is difficult or complex. It has been argued that this makes the H-1B program extremely attractive to employers, and that labor legislation in this regard has been influenced by corporations seeking and benefiting from such advantages.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Some recent news reports suggest that the recession that started in 2008 will exacerbate the H-1B visa situation, both for supporters of the program and for those who oppose it.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE51I60N20090219 | work=Reuters | title=Foreign tech workers touchy subject in U.S. downturn | date=February 19, 2009}}</ref> The process to obtain the green card has become so long that during these recession years it has not been unusual that sponsoring companies fail and disappear, thus forcing the H-1B employee to find another sponsor, and lose their place in line for the green card. An H-1B employee could be just one month from obtaining their green card, but if the employee is laid off, he or she may have to leave the country, or go to the end of the line and start over the process to get the green card, and wait as much as 15 more years, depending on the nationality and visa category.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_4597.html |title=U.S. Department of State visa bulletin |access-date=2010-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204172247/http://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_4597.html |archive-date=2010-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 provides some relief for people waiting for a long time for a green card, by allowing H-1B extensions past the normal 6 years, as well as by making it easier to change the sponsoring employer.

===The out-sourcing/off-shoring visa===
{{Further|Body shopping}}
In his floor statement on H-1B visa reform, Senator Dick Durbin stated "The H-1B job visa lasts for three years and can be renewed for three years. What happens to those workers after that? Well, they could stay. It is possible. But these new companies have a much better idea for making money. They send the engineers to America to fill spots—and get money to do it—and then after the three to six years, they bring them back to work for the companies that are competing with American companies. They call it their outsourcing visa. They are sending their talented engineers to learn how Americans do business and then bring them back and compete with those American companies."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://durbin.senate.gov/showRelease.cfm?releaseId=280890 |title= Floor Statement: H-1B Visa Reform |access-date=August 3, 2010 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108195825/http://durbin.senate.gov/showRelease.cfm?releaseId=280890 |archive-date=January 8, 2011 }}</ref> Critics of H-1B use for outsourcing have also noted that more H-1B visas are granted to companies headquartered in India than companies headquartered in the United States.<ref name="2009CW"/>

Of all computer [[systems analyst]]s and [[programmers]] on H-1B visas in the U.S., 74 percent were from Asia. This large scale migration of Asian IT professionals to the United States has been cited as a central cause for the quick emergence of the [[offshore outsourcing]] industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yeoh |title=State/Nation/transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-30279-1 |page=167 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In FY 2009, due to the worldwide recession, applications for H-1B visas by offshore outsourcing firms were significantly lower than in previous years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infotech.indiatimes.com/news/software-services/25-H-1B-visas-still-left/articleshow/5080566.cms|title=Technology|access-date=2009-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006013921/http://infotech.indiatimes.com/news/software-services/25-H-1B-visas-still-left/articleshow/5080566.cms|archive-date=2009-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> yet 110,367 H-1B visas were issued, and 117,409 were issued in FY2010.

===Departure requirement on job loss===
If an employer lays off an H-1B worker, the employer is required to pay for the laid-off worker's transportation outside the United States.

If an H-1B worker is laid off or quits, the worker has a grace period of 60 days or until the I-94 expiration date, whichever is shorter, to find a new employer or leave the country.

There also is a 10-day grace period for an H-1B worker to depart the United States at the end of his/her authorized period of stay. This grace period only applies if the worker works until the H-1B expiration date listed on his/her I-797 approval notice, or I-94 card.<ref>"[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/214.2 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(i)(A)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009052746/https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/214.2 |date=2018-10-09 }}". via Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School.

=== U.S. Imperialism ===
From a perspective of globalization and a system of neo-liberalism, some would consider the H-1B program as an extension of [[American imperialism]], one which demands high-skilled labor and global top talent as a right of the U.S. market to maintain its competitiveness in the knowledge sector. This applies to both sides of the H-1B argument - pro and against. On the pro side, the demand for foreign talent is yet another resource that the U.S. demands access to - no different than oil or cheap, outsourced labor. On the side against the program, which sides with American employees in the labor market for skilled positions, the rhetoric around a 'right' of American workers to these high-paying, skilled positions is reflective of the post-industrial society of the U.S.. Under this system, workers pushed out of manufacturing by the rise of outsourcing were promised lucrative knowledge sector jobs that could be secured through higher education, and lay claim to these positions solely through way of citizenship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tannock|first=Stuart|date=September 2009|title=White-collar imperialisms: the H-1B debate in America|journal=Social Semiotics|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=311–327|doi=10.1080/10350330903072672|s2cid=144963201|issn=1035-0330}}</ref>

In addition to H-1B visas, there are a variety of other visa categories that allow foreign workers to come into the U.S. to work for some period of time.

[[L-1 visa]]s are issued to foreign employees of a corporation.  Under recent rules, the foreign worker must have worked for the corporation for at least one year in the preceding three years prior to getting the visa.  An L-1B visa is appropriate for non-immigrant workers who are being temporarily transferred to the United States based on their specialized knowledge of the company's techniques and methodologies.  An L-1A visa is for managers or executives who either manage people or an essential function of the company. There is no requirement to pay prevailing wages for the L-1 visa holders.  For Canadian residents, a special L visa category is available.

[[TN status|TN-1 visas]] are part of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), and are issued to Canadian and Mexican citizens.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1274.html |title=Mexican and Canadian NAFTA Professional Worker |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102223138/http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1274.html |archive-date=2013-11-02 |url-status=live }}</ref>  TN visas are only available to workers who fall into one of a preset list of occupations determined by the NAFTA treaty. There are specific [https://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1274.html eligibility requirements] for the TN Visa.

[[E-3 visa]]s are issued to citizens of [[Australia]] under the Australia free-trade treaty.

H-1B1 visas are a sub-set of H-1B issued to residents of [[Chile]] and [[Singapore]]. H-1B1 visas for residents of Chile was part of the [[Chile–United States Free Trade Agreement]]; PL 108-77 Section 402(a)(2)(B), 117 Stat. 909, 940; S 1416, HR 2738, which was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on July 24, 2003. H-1B1 visas for residents of Singapore was part of the [[Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement]], PL 108-78 Section 402(2), 117 Stat. 948, 970-971; S 1417, HR 2739, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on July 24, 2003, passed the [[U.S. Senate]] on July 31, 2003, and signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on May 6, 2003. According to [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]], if there are any unused H-1B1 visas during a particular year, that number is added to the following year's H-1B base quota.

One recent trend in work visas is that various countries attempt to get special preference for their nationals as part of treaty negotiations.  Another trend is for changes in immigration law to be embedded in large Authorization or Omnibus bills to avoid the controversy that might accompany a separate vote.

[[H-2B visa]]: The H-2B non-immigrant program permits employers to hire foreign workers to come to the U.S. and perform temporary non-agricultural work, which may be one-time, seasonal, peak load or intermittent. There is a 66,000 per year limit on the number of foreign workers who may receive H-2B status.
