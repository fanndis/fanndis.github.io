However, he was removed from his post by Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and jailed in April 1999. Following his release in 2004, Anwar became the leading figure in the opposition and helped coalesce the opposition parties into the [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR), which contested the [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008]] and [[2013 Malaysian general election|2013]] general elections.

==Early years (1968–1982)==
[[File:Anwar Ibrahim speaking.jpg|thumb|Anwar Ibrahim speaking in 2005]]
From 1968 to 1971, as a student, Anwar was the president of the National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students. Around the same time, he was also the president of the University of Malaya Malay Language Society ({{lang-ms |[[:ms:Persatuan Bahasa Melayu Universiti Malaya|Persatuan Bahasa Melayu Universiti Malaya]]}} (PBMUM)). In 1971, he was a member of the pro tem committee of [[Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia]] (ABIM) or Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia which he co-founded. At the same time, he was elected as the 2nd President of the Malaysian Youth Council or Majlis Belia Malaysia (MBM). In 1974, Anwar was arrested during student protests against rural poverty and hunger. This came as a report surfaced stating that a family died from starvation in a village in [[Baling]], in the state of Kedah, which was later demonstrated to be false. However, the rubber tappers in Baling were experiencing severe hardship as the price of rubber dropped in 1974. He was imprisoned under the [[Internal Security Act of Malaysia|Internal Security Act]] (ISA), which allows for detention without trial, and spent 20 months in the [[Kamunting Detention Centre]]. From 1975 till 1982 he served as a representative for Asia Pacific of [[World Assembly of Muslim Youth]] (WAMY).<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e964|title=Ibrahim, Anwar – Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> Anwar Ibrahim is also the co-founder of the [[International Institute of Islamic Thought]] (IIIT) in the USA (founded 1981).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=6180 |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012739/http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=6180 |archive-date=26 January 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Anwar has been one of 4 acting directors, a board member of IIIT<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iiit.org/news/iiit-vice-president-visits-iium-and-attends-world-conference|title=IIIT Vice President Visits IIUM and Attends World Conference|website=International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT)|accessdate=16 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226061057/http://www.iiit.org/news/iiit-vice-president-visits-iium-and-attends-world-conference|archive-date=26 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and a trustee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iiit.org/news/anwar-ibrahim-reflects-on-the-aftermath-of-the-arab-spring|title=Anwar Ibrahim Reflects on the Aftermath of the Arab Spring|website=International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT)|accessdate=16 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001044638/http://www.iiit.org/news/anwar-ibrahim-reflects-on-the-aftermath-of-the-arab-spring|archive-date=1 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iiit.org/news/time-chooses-anwar-ibrahim-among-the-top-100|title=TIME Chooses Anwar Ibrahim Among the Top 100|website=International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT)|accessdate=16 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001045434/http://www.iiit.org/news/time-chooses-anwar-ibrahim-among-the-top-100|archive-date=1 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  He was also a chancellor of International Islamic University Kuala Lumpur between 1983 and 1988.<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/>

==Governmental career (1982–1998)==
In 1982, Anwar, who was the founding leader and second president of an Islamic youth organisation called [[Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia]] (ABIM), shocked his liberal supporters by joining the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), led by [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who had become prime minister in 1981. He moved up the political ranks quickly: his first ministerial office was that of Minister of Culture, Youth and Sports in 1983; after that, he headed the agriculture ministry in 1984 before becoming Minister of Education in 1986. By then, speculation was rife about Anwar's ascent to the Deputy Prime Minister's position as it was a commonly-occurring phenomenon in Malaysia for the Education Minister to assume the position of Deputy PM in the near future.

During his tenure as Education Minister, Anwar introduced numerous policies in the national school curriculum. One of his major changes was to rename the national language from ''Bahasa Malaysia'' to ''[[Bahasa Melayu]]''.  Non-Malays criticised this move as it would cause the younger generation to be detached from the national language, since they would attribute it to being something that belongs to the Malays and not to Malaysians. As the minister of education, Anwar was elected as the 25th President of [[UNESCO#General Conference|UNESCO's General Conference]]. In 1988, Anwar Ibrahim became the second President of [[International Islamic University of Malaysia]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.iium.edu.my/rector/resource-centre-2 |title = International Islamic University Malaysia |accessdate = 10 February 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141012125533/http://www.iium.edu.my/rector/resource-centre-2 |archive-date = 12 October 2014 |url-status = dead |df = dmy-all }}</ref> According to former Law Minister [[Zaid Ibrahim]], Anwar is an Islamist who "helped Islamicise the whole government system" and played a major role in the Islamicisation of the education system when he was Education Minister in the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1753788/growing-popularity-conservative-islam-malaysia-can-be-linked-experiences Growing popularity of conservative Islam in Malaysia linked to overseas students] South China Morning Post, 2 April 2015</ref>

In 1991, Anwar was appointed Minister of Finance. During his tenure as Finance Minister his impact was immediate; Malaysia enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and economic growth. Shortly after becoming Finance Minister, [[Euromoney]] named him as a top four finance minister and in 1996 [[Asiamoney]] named him ''Finance Minister of the Year''. In the midst of the Asian Financial Crises of 1997, Anwar was hailed for guiding Malaysia through the period of instability.{{who|date= May 2014}}  He backed free market principles and highlighted the issue of the proximity of business and politics in Malaysia. He advocated greater accountability, refused to offer government bail-outs and instituted widespread spending cuts. As a deputy prime minister and finance minister, in March 1998, Anwar Ibrahim was selected as the Chairman of the Development Committee of [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) from March 1998 until September 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DEVCOMMEXT/0,,contentMDK:23158522~menuPK:7347977~pagePK:7347738~piPK:7347796~theSitePK:277473,00.html |title=Development Committee – Former Chairmen of the Development Committee|publisher= The World bank | accessdate =10 February 2015}}</ref>

In 1993, he became Mahathir's Deputy Prime Minister after winning the Deputy Presidency of UMNO against [[Ghafar Baba]] planned to succeed Mahathir as prime minister, and frequently alluded in public to his "son-father" relationship with Mahathir; in May 1997, Mahathir appointed Anwar to be acting Prime Minister while he took a two-month holiday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lib.perdana.org.my/PLF/Digital_Content/Prominent_Leaders/Mahathir/News_1968-2004/1996-1998/1997ko/mahathir%20returing%20holiday.pdf |title=Mahathir Returns After Two Months Holiday|publisher= [[Bernama]] |date =22 July 1997 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/97/0801/eye1.html |title=A Day In The Life|author=Roger Mitton|publisher=[[Asiaweek]]  |date =November 30, 2000}}</ref>

Towards the end of the 1990s, however, the relationship with Mahathir had begun to deteriorate, triggered by their conflicting views on governance. In Mahathir's absence, Anwar had independently taken radical steps, which were in direct conflict with Mahathir's policies, to change the country's governing mechanisms. Issues such as how Malaysia would respond to a financial crisis were often at the forefront of this conflict.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Anwar's frontal attack against what he described as the widespread culture of [[nepotism]] and [[cronyism]] within UMNO (and the ruling coalition as a whole) angered Mahathir, as did his attempts to dismantle the [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies that Mahathir had set up. "Cronyism" was identified by Anwar as a major cause of corruption and misappropriation of funds in the country.

===Financial crisis===
During the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], Anwar, as a finance minister, supported the IMF plan. He also instituted an [[austerity]] package that cut government spending by 18%, cut ministerial salaries and deferred major projects. "Mega projects", despite being a cornerstone of Mahathir's development strategy, were greatly curtailed.

Although many Malaysian companies faced bankruptcy, Anwar declared: "There is no question of any bailout. The banks will be allowed to protect themselves and the government will not interfere."  Anwar advocated a free-market approach to the crisis, including foreign investment and trade liberalisation. Mahathir blamed currency speculators like [[George Soros]] for the crisis, and supported currency controls and tighter regulation of foreign investment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/06/business/he-s-seen-the-enemy-it-looks-like-him.html?scp=5&sq=george |title=soros public enemy&st=cse&pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times |date=6 December 1998 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |first=Timothy L. |last=O'Brien}}</ref>

===Fall from power and first sodomy conviction===
{{main|Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials}}
In 1998 ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine named Anwar the "Asian of the Year". However, in that year, matters between Anwar and Mahathir came to a head around the time of the quadrennial UMNO General Assembly. The Youth wing of UMNO, headed by Anwar's associate [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], gave notice that it would initiate a debate on "cronyism and nepotism".  At the General Assembly, a book, ''"50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM"'' ("50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister") was circulated containing graphic allegations of homosexuality, as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar. The book was written by Khalid Jafri, an ex-editor of the government-controlled newspaper ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' and former editor-in-chief of a failed magazine, ''Harian National''. Anwar obtained a court injunction to prevent further distribution of the book and filed a lawsuit against the author for defamation. Police charged the author of the book with malicious publishing of false news.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Judge gives reasons for ruling in favour of Anwar |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=32237 |work=Daily Express |location=UK |date=26 January 2005 |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621232024/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=32237 |archive-date=21 June 2011 }}</ref>  The police were instructed to investigate the veracity of the claims.

On 2 September 1998, Anwar was fired from the Cabinet and reports state that he was under investigation for sodomy, an act that is illegal in Malaysia. The following day, he was expelled from UMNO. In what the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' termed a "blatantly political fix-up",<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/outdated-political-thuggery-embarrasses-malaysia-20100222-ornl.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Outdated political thuggery embarrasses Malaysia | first=Peter | last=Hartcher | date=23 February 2010}}</ref> Anwar was arrested on 20 September 1998 and detained without trial under the country's controversial Internal Security Act (ISA). The Home Minister at the time was also the Prime Minister, Mahathir. Weeks later, Anwar was charged with corruption for allegedly interfering with the police investigation of him. While he was in police custody in 1998, Anwar was beaten by the then Inspector General of Police, [[:ms:Abdul Rahim bin Mohd. Noor|Rahim Noor]]. The public and the media only witnessed his black eye after he was brought to Court for the first time, and Mahathir remarked that it could have been a self-inflicted injury to garner public sympathy. Rahim was subsequently found guilty of assault and jailed for two months in 2000. He made a public apology to Anwar and paid undisclosed damages.<ref>{{cite news|title=Apology ends Anwar's suit over beating|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/world/asia/03iht-malaysia.html|accessdate=11 January 2012|newspaper=nytimes.com|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> During the trial, a mattress supposedly stained with Anwar's semen was presented to the court as [[DNA evidence]] of Anwar's sexual acts.

The High Court eventually handed down its decision in April 1999, sentencing Anwar to six years' imprisonment for corruption and sodomy. Two months later, he was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for sodomy, which he was ordered to serve after he completed his six-year sentence for corruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/humanrights/Cases/CHR_068423.htm|title=Anwar Ibrahim|date=6 June 2014|accessdate=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213034949/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/humanrights/Cases/CHR_068423.htm|archive-date=13 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> His trial and conviction were widely discredited by the international community.

==''Reformasi'' and formation of KEADILAN==
{{main|Reformasi (Malaysia)}}
Shortly after Anwar was dismissed as deputy prime minister by the then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar and his supporters initiated the [[Reformasi (Malaysia)|Reformasi]] movement. It consisted of several mass demonstrations and rallies against the long-standing Barisan Nasional coalition government. At the 1998 [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] Summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Vice-President of the United States, [[Al Gore]], gave a speech supporting Anwar and the reformasi movement in front of the Prime Minister of Malaysia and other Asia-Pacific premiers.

Reformasi led to the formation of a new multiracial-based party named ''[[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)#Foundation|Parti Keadilan Nasional]]'' or National Justice Party (KEADILAN). In 1999, a general election was held. The new KEADILAN, [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS), and [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) formed a ''[[Barisan Alternatif]]'' or Alternative Front (BA), in a combined initiative to replace the standing Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition government. In August 2003, KEADILAN merged with ''[[Parti Rakyat Malaysia]]'' or Malaysian's People Party (PRM) to form ''[[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|Parti Keadilan Rakyat]]'' or People's Justice Party (PKR) headed by Wan Azizah as president. PKR made huge gains in the 2008 general election, winning 31 seats and becoming the largest opposition party in parliament. In April 2008, PKR, PAS and DAP formed a new alliance named [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/1/nation/20080401134152&sec=nation|title=Archives|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

==Interim years (1999–2007)==
===First sodomy conviction===
In 1999, Anwar brought suit against Prime Minister Mahathir for defamation for allegedly uttering accusations of immoral acts and calling Anwar a homosexual at a news conference in Malaysia.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Anwar vs Dr M: Two of three judges recuse themselves (Updated) | url= http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/3/1/nation/20100301133142&sec=nation | work = The Star| date = 1 March 2010 | accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref>

The sodomy verdict was partially overturned in 2004, resulting in Anwar's release from prison as he had already served his sentence for the corruption offence.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3633336.stm |title = Court to allow Anwar appeal | date = 7 September 2004|work= [[BBC News]]|accessdate= 14 January 2012}}</ref> Anwar successfully sued Khalid Jafri for his ''"50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM"'' book, but Khalid died in 2005 of complications from diabetes before the High Court found that he had committed [[libel]] and awarded Anwar millions of ringgit in compensation.<ref>{{Cite news|title=What is RM100&nbsp;million? |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/opinion/jameschin/27869-what-is-rm100-million |work=Malaysian Insider |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715084833/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/opinion/jameschin/27869-what-is-rm100-million |archive-date=15 July 2009 }}</ref>  The Federal Court on 8 March 2010 ruled that the 1998 dismissal of Anwar from his Cabinet posts by Mahathir was constitutional and valid, meaning Anwar had failed in his bid to challenge his sacking.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Court: Anwar's sacking from cabinet posts is valid | url = http://www.mmail.com.my/content/29538-court-anwars-sacking-cabinet-posts-valid | work = The Malay Mail | date = 8 March 2010 | accessdate = 8 March 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100309110250/http://www.mmail.com.my/content/29538-court-anwars-sacking-cabinet-posts-valid | archive-date = 9 March 2010 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = Anwar's Sacking From Cabinet Posts In 1998 Is Valid, Federal Court Rules | url = http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=480510 | work = Bernama |date=8 March 2010| accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Update Anwar's sacking was lawful, rules Federal Court |url=http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/political-news/161024-anwars-sacking-was-lawful-rules-federal-court-.html |work=TheEdge |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426113552/http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/political-news/161024-anwars-sacking-was-lawful-rules-federal-court-.html |archive-date=26 April 2010 }}</ref>

Although the point was by now moot, an appeal on the corruption charges was heard on 6 September 2004. Under Malaysian law, a person is banned from political activities for five years after the end of his sentence. Success in this appeal would have allowed him to return to politics immediately. On 7 September, the court agreed to hear Anwar's appeal. However, on 15 September, the Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that its previous decision to uphold a High Court ruling that found Anwar guilty was in order, relegating Anwar to the sidelines of Malaysian politics until 14 April 2008. The only way for Anwar to be freed from this stricture would have been for him to receive a pardon from the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]].

===Teaching and non-profit work===
After his release from prison, Anwar held teaching positions at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]], where he was a visiting fellow and senior associate member, at Johns Hopkins University's [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|School of Advanced International Studies]] in Washington DC as a Distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow, and in 2005–2006 as a visiting professor at the [[Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding]] in the [[Edmund A.

In July 2006, Anwar was elected Chair of the Washington-based [[Foundation For the Future]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationforfuture.org/press_releases/july15.html |title=Foundation for the Future Holds its First Board Meeting in Doha, Qatar |accessdate=2008-10-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616074130/http://www.foundationforfuture.org/press_releases/july15.html |archive-date=16 June 2007 |df=dmy }}.

===Return to politics===
In November 2006, Anwar announced he planned to run for Parliament in 2008 after his disqualification expired. Anwar was critical of government policies after his release from prison, most notably the controversial [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which provided [[affirmative action]] for the Bumiputras. The policy set a number of quotas, such as for units of housing and [[initial public offering]]s, that must be met.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aAjtL0wmitME&refer=home Malaysia's Anwar Says He Plans to Run for Parliament]. 30 November 2006, ''Bloomberg''.</ref>

Before he became re-entitled to run for Parliament in 2008, he acted as an "advisor" of [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]], the party of which his wife Dr. Wan Azizah was president. He was in the forefront in organising a November 2007 mass rally, called the [[2007 Bersih Rally]], which took place at [[Dataran Merdeka]], Kuala Lumpur, to demand clean and fair elections. The gathering was organised by [[Bersih]], a coalition comprising political parties and civil society groups, and drew supporters from all over the country.

The [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008 general election]] date was set for 8 March 2008, before Anwar's disqualification from politics expired, sparking criticisms that Barisan Nasional called for early elections in a bid to deny Anwar's plans for a return to Parliament. In response, Anwar's wife, [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]], declared that she would step down should she retain her Permatang Pauh parliamentary seat to force a by-election in which Anwar himself would contest.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/specialreport/view/1457/1/.html Wan Azizah declares she is Anwar proxy]. 25 February 2008. ''Channel NewsAsia''</ref>

When asked about the possibility of Anwar becoming the next Prime Minister, former leader Tun Dr. Mahathir reacted by saying, "He would make a good Prime Minister of Israel".<ref>[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/mni/when-mahathir-lashes-at-anwar-who-is-he-really-after.html "When Mahathir lashes out at Anwar, will it catch fire?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525104747/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/mni/when-mahathir-lashes-at-anwar-who-is-he-really-after.html |date=25 May 2008 }} 31 March 2008, ''The Malaysian Insider. ''</ref>

On 14 April 2008, Anwar celebrated his official return to the political stage, as his ban from public office expired a decade after he was fired as Deputy Prime Minister. The opposition seized a third of parliamentary seats and five states in the worst ever showing for the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for half a century, with Anwar at the helm.<ref>[http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/inquirerpolitics/view.php?db=1&article=20080413-130108 "Malaysian opposition leader Anwar marks end of political ban"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525213520/http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/inquirerpolitics/view.php?db=1&article=20080413-130108 |date=25 May 2014 }}, AFP, 14 April 2008.</ref> A gathering of more than 40,000 supporters greeted Anwar in a rally welcoming his return to politics.

In the [[2013 Malaysian general election|2013 general election]] (GE13), Anwar Ibrahim, as the Leader of the Opposition, led his [[Pakatan Rakyat]] coalition (comprising the three parties [[Democratic Action Party|DAP]], [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]], and [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|PKR]]) to contest in the election. On 25 February 2013, Pakatan Rakyat launched their [[2013 Malaysian general election#PR manifesto|manifesto]] titled ''The People’s Manifesto: Pakatan the hope of the people'', pledging to reduce their financial burden, among other promises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/222236|title=Manifesto to curb monopolies, spur economy|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dapmalaysia.org/repository/ENG-Manifesto-LEAFLET.pdf|title=Manifesto Pakatan Harapan Rakyat 2013 Summary|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> Anwar said that he would step down from politics if his team did not win the election.

Pakatan Rakyat did not achieve the regime change target in the election despite obtaining 50.9% of the popular vote compared to the 47.4% gained by Barisan Nasional. This was attributed to the heavy malapportionment of the electoral districts.<ref>[http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/guest-columnists/56609-pakatan-lost-but-not-defeated Pakatan lost, but not defeated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510213028/http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/guest-columnists/56609-pakatan-lost-but-not-defeated |date=10 May 2013 }}</ref> Pakatan Rakyat also gained 7 more parliamentary seats compared to the [[2008 Malaysian general election|12th general election]].

Anwar did not concede defeat, alleging widespread electoral fraud.

He also reaffirmed his innocence and cited evidence in the form of medical reports.<ref name=the-diplomat.com/> In July 2008, he was arrested over allegations of sodomy again, but was acquitted of the charge in January 2012 by [[High Courts of Malaysia|The High Court]].<ref name="aljazeera.com">*{{cite news|title=Anwar Ibrahim found not guilty of sodomy|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/01/201219295952572.html|accessdate=9 January 2012|work=Aljazeera|date=9 January 2012}}</ref> The presiding judge ruled that DNA evidence used in the case had been compromised and was unreliable.<ref>{{cite news|title=Malaysia court finds Anwar Ibrahim not guilty of sodomy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16463989|publisher=BBC News Asia|date=9 January 2011|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> The prosecution filed an appeal against the acquittal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/prosecution-appeals-anwar-sodomy-acquittal/ |title=Prosecution appeals Anwar sodomy acquittal |last=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |date=20 January 2012 |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |accessdate=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122223637/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/prosecution-appeals-anwar-sodomy-acquittal |archive-date=22 January 2012 }}</ref> In March 2014 the appeal court over-ruled the high Court reinstating the conviction.

==Pakatan Harapan backbencher==
===Royal pardon and release===
After the dissolution of the Pakatan Rakyat during his imprisonment, a new opposition coalition named the Pakatan Harapan was formed with Anwar as the de facto leader [[in absentia]]. The coalition had come into power by over-throwing Barisan Nasional in the [[2018 Malaysian general election|2018 general election]] (GE14). Following the formation of the new ruling government, Anwar was given a full royal pardon and was released from prison on 16 May 2018. He is designated to take over{{When|date=January 2020}} the reins from interim Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] as planned and agreed by the coalition before GE14.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/anwar-ibrahim-freed-from-prison-royal-pardon-malaysia-10237840|title=Anwar Ibrahim freed from prison after royal pardon from Malaysian king|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/new-dawn-malaysia-anwar-ibrahim-no-malice-mahathir-10238874|title=Anwar hails 'new dawn for Malaysia' following release from prison|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> In an interview, he justified his reluctance to immediately step into power on the basis that Mahathir has appeared committed to the reform agenda, and doing a good job tackling a "disintegrating" political system.

===Return to politics and ''PD Move''===

Anwar contested in the [[2018 Port Dickson by-election|Port Dickson by-election]], dubbed as ''PD Move'' which was set to allow him to return to Parliament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/anwar-ibrahim-to-contest-vacated-port-dickson-seat-10708210|title=Anwar Ibrahim to contest vacated Port Dickson seat|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-US}}</ref> He won with an increased majority, albeit with a lower turnout, and returned to parliament again after 3 years of absence.

===Sheraton Move and return to opposition===
In late February 2020, the Pakatan Harapan government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad [[2020 Malaysian political crisis|collapsed]] following defections by Anwar's deputy, [[Azmin Ali]], and several PKR MP's aligned to him, along with the withdrawal of [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party|Bersatu]] from Pakatan Harapan. Mahathir promptly resigned from the premiership, as well as from his party, Bersatu.  The political maneuvering has been labelled the "Sheraton Move", for the hotel in [[Petaling Jaya]] at which defecting MP's gathered with the opposition to show support for a new government.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ratcliffe |first1=Rebecca |title=Malaysia's political turmoil: everything you need to know |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/malaysias-political-turmoil-everything-you-need-to-know |accessdate=24 September 2020 |agency=Guardian |date=25 February 2020}}</ref> Following the resignation of Mahathir, Anwar attempted to gather support for his appointment as Prime Minister.

==Return to the Opposition (2020-)==
While Muhyiddin formed a government under the auspices of a new coalition known as [[Perikatan Nasional]], Mahathir attempted to regain his post with the help of his Pakatan allies. However, under Anwar's leadership, Keadilan refused to endorse Mahathir's bid for a third term as premier, claiming the nonagenarian had reneged on his repeated pledge to handover the office to Anwar.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Razak |first1=Radzi |title=Anwar: Pakatan won't make same 'mistake' when choosing next PM |url=https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/05/29/anwar-pakatan-wont-make-same-mistake-when-choosing-next-pm/1870494 |accessdate=24 September 2020 |agency=Malay Mail |date=29 May 2020}}</ref> Mahathir, in turn, refused to lend support to Anwar's candidacy, and instead nominated [[Sabah]] Chief Minister, [[Shafie Apdal]], for the Prime Minister's post instead. Despite the support of allies DAP and Amanah for this compromise, Keadilan again rejected the proposal, and continued to propose Anwar as the coalition candidate.<ref>{{cite news |title=Reject deceitful politics, Anwar posts after Shafie for PM announcement |url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/532071 |accessdate=24 September 2020 |agency=Malaysiakini |date=27 June 2020}}</ref>

==Views and comments on various issues==
===External influence and interference through APCO in 1Malaysia claims===
Anwar has made numerous remarks about a supposed conspiracy among the Malaysian government, [[APCO Worldwide|APCO]] (a public relations firm retained by the Malaysian government), Israel, and the United States. Anwar has condemned the Malaysian government for seeking advice from APCO. He claims that the firm is linked to the "murder of Muslims in Palestine." He further claims to have given proof to a disciplinary committee of the Malaysian parliament, investigating his comments, that APCO is a front for the Israeli government. On another occasion, Anwar, speaking from the parliament, claimed that the firm was controlled by Jews and working on behalf of the American government to influence Malaysian foreign policy. He further implied that changes in Malaysian foreign policy could only be explained if Jews were manipulating Malaysia for the United States.<ref>[http://newledger.com/2010/04/the-reversal-of-anwar-ibrahim The reversal of Anwar Ibrahim] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506061816/http://newledger.com/2010/04/the-reversal-of-anwar-ibrahim |date=6 May 2010 }}, The New Ledger, 10 April 2010</ref>

During the press conference, Anwar claimed to have documents linking [[1Malaysia]] with [[One Israel]] and the public relations firm APCO but refused to allow access to the documents when challenged.<ref name="thestar.com.my">{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/3/30/nation/20100330150110&sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402222745/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2010%2F3%2F30%2Fnation%2F20100330150110&sec=nation |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 April 2010 |title=Parliament: Anwar claims Apco was in M'sia before 1Malaysia concept was announced, The Star, 30 March 2010 |publisher=Thestar.com.my |accessdate=9 January 2012 }}</ref> The Malaysian government and APCO have both strongly denied Anwar's allegations.

===Comments about Jewish people===
In a press conference at the [[London School of Economics]] in March 2010, Anwar made comments [[Anti-Zionism|about Zionists]] and "nasty Jews". In the press conference he also stated that, "There are good Jews, there are bad Jews, there are good Muslims and bad Muslims."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YYqnEn2bAE |title=Press Conference at the London School of Economics (LSE) 18 March 2010 |work=Youtube |accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref>

In May 2010, [[B'nai B'rith International]], a prominent Jewish human rights organisation, condemned Anwar in a letter to the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], claiming that Anwar was a "purveyor of [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish hatred]]" and asked the American government to suspend all contact with Anwar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnaibrith.org/letter52610.cfm |title=B'nai B'rith International – The Global Voice of the Jewish Community |publisher=Bnaibrith.org |date=25 May 2010 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065055/http://www.bnaibrith.org/letter52610.cfm |archive-date=7 January 2012 }}</ref>

===2012 Israeli-Palestinian Security comments===
In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Anwar Ibrahim stated, "I think our policy should be clear—protect the security [of Israel] but you must be as firm in protecting the legitimate interests of the [[Palestinians]]."<ref>{{Citation|newspaper=Malaysia today |url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/archives/archives-2012/46946-war-of-words-between-malaysian-opposition-leader-and-ministers-over-israel |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703063718/http://www.malaysia-today.net/archives/archives-2012/46946-war-of-words-between-malaysian-opposition-leader-and-ministers-over-israel |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-07-03 |year=2012 |title=War of words between Malaysian opposition leader and ministers over Israel }}.</ref>

This comment sparked an array of criticism from UMNO, one of the ruling party then. UMNO's MP [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] stated that Anwar's comments "show a blanket support for anything Israel does" and that "The issue of Palestine is a top foreign policy priority for my party, it would be an issue during the election year or otherwise… timing doesn’t matter.".<ref name = "WSJ 2012">{{cite news |last = Mahtani| first = Shibani | title = Israel Dominates the Debate in Malaysia – Again| work = The Wall Street Journal|date=31 January 2012|url= https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2012/01/31/israel-dominates-the-debate-in-malaysia-%E2%80%93-again/ | accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>

Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad then said he was not surprised by Anwar's comments, and stated with regard to Ibrahim's relationship with the [[Jewish community]], "You can't be friendly with them and against them".<ref name="welfare">{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/local/politics/dr-m-anwar-does-not-think-of-the-welfare-of-palestinians-1.39616|title=Dr. M: Anwar does not think of the welfare of Palestinians|date=31 January 2012|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|accessdate=1 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201092724/http://www.nst.com.my/local/politics/dr-m-anwar-does-not-think-of-the-welfare-of-palestinians-1.39616|archive-date=1 February 2012}}</ref>

Later, Anwar clarified his stand; he said that the remarks were consistent with the two-state solution adopted by the United Nations that is accepted by the Arab world, as well as Malaysia and [[Hamas]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Anwar | last = Ibrahim | url = http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2012/01/31/hamas-leader-calls-for-two-state-solution-but-refuses-to-renounce-violence/ | title = Hamas Leader Calls for Two-State Solution, But Refuses to Renounce Violence | work = Blog | accessdate = 10 February 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150211022555/http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2012/01/31/hamas-leader-calls-for-two-state-solution-but-refuses-to-renounce-violence/ | archive-date = 11 February 2015 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

"I am issuing a stern warning to anyone trying to twist my statement just so that they can say that I have betrayed the aspirations of the Palestinian people", he said, continuing with stating that his party's stance "is to defend the rights of whoever it is that has been victimized".<ref name = "WSJ 2012" />

===Views on gay marriage and homosexuality===
In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Anwar stated that while he opposes gay marriage and upholds the sanctity of marriage between men and women, laws on sodomy in Malaysia must be changed as they are "archaic".<ref>Mahtani, Shibani. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203363504577184631682335306 "Malaysia's Anwar Presses On Despite Appeal"], "[[The Wall Street Journal]]", New York, 26 January 2013, Retrieved on 29 January 2013.</ref>

In an interview with ''[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]'', Anwar reaffirmed his belief that marriage should remain between men and women. Clarifying his comments to ''The Wall Street Journal'', Anwar maintained that he does not advocate [[Legality of homosexuality|legalising homosexuality]] or making gay marriage permissible—only that the laws should be amended to ensure private affairs are not penalised. "It is not my business to attack people or arrest people based on their sexual orientation," he said.  "Morality is in the public sphere, not beyond that."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2012/01/28/anwar-clarifies-his-views-on-malaysia%E2%80%99s-sodomy-laws/|title=Anwar Clarifies His Views on Malaysia's Sodomy Laws|author=Shibani Mahtani|work=WSJ|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Anwar was born in [[Cherok Tok Kun]], [[Penang]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} His father, Ibrahim Abdul Rahman, started his career as a hospital porter, later to join politics as the UMNO Member of Parliament for [[Central Seberang Perai|Seberang Perai Central]] between 1959 and 1969 and also as the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Health from 1964 to 1969 until his defeat in the 1969 General Election by a candidate from Gerakan.
