The term '''religion of peace''' has been applied to different religions including [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] to describe their allegedly peaceful nature. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], it was prominently used as a [[political neologism]] for Islam in an effort of some politicians to differentiate between [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]], [[Islamism]], and non-violent [[Muslim]]s.<ref name=MALAY/> Subsequently, some [[Criticism of Islam|critics of Islam]] have adopted the phrase, using the term "Religion of Peace" in a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] manner as a pejorative [[synonym]] for Islam.<ref name=POD>e.g [[Craig Winn]] when [http://www.prophetofdoom.net/Jalal_Abualrub_Craig_Winn_Debate.Islam writing about] a debate with Jalal Abualrub said ''For, how could a "religion of peace" have such an open-ended and encompassing edict to destroy anyone who chooses not to submit to it?''</ref><ref name=counterp/>

== Usage of the term ==
In the past the epithet "religion of peace and good will towards men" has been applied to Christianity.<ref>''Defensive War not Inconsistent with a Religion of Peace'', a sermon, Seeley, Jackson, & Halliday, 1860, [https://books.google.com/books?id=al1u2i6q5aQC&pg=PA11 p. 11] Quote: "While however, it is manifest and unquestionable that Christianity is emphatically a religion of peace and good will towards men &mdash; men of all countries and of all climes  &mdash; it is assuredly not a religion of absolute and passive non-resistance."</ref>

In the 1960s, [[Malcolm X]], acting as a spokesman for the [[Nation of Islam]], said on multiple occasions that Islam was a "religion of peace".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nessen|first1=Stephen|title=Remembering Malcolm X: Rare Interviews and Audio|url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/87636-remembering-malcolm-x-rare-interviews-and-audio/|website=WNYC - New York Public Radio|publisher=WNYC - New York Public Radio|accessdate=1 April 2018|quote=The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us the religion of Islam, which is a religion of peace.}}</ref><ref name="Malcolm X: Speech excerpt from Los Angeles">{{cite AV media | year=1962 | title=Malcolm X: Speech excerpt from Los Angeles | medium=speech | publisher=Educational Video Group | url=https://search.alexanderstreet.com/view/2787248 | quote=They also say that, uh, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was a draft dodger.
