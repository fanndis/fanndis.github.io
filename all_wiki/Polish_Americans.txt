'''Polish Americans''' ({{lang-pl|Polonia amerykańska}}) are [[Americans]] who have total or partial [[Poles|Polish]] ancestry. There are an estimated 9.15 million self-identified Polish Americans, representing about 2.83% of the [[Demographics of the United States|U.S. population]].<ref name="American Community Survey"/> Polish Americans are the second-largest [[Central Europe]]an immigrant group after the [[Germans]], and the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|eighth largest immigrant group overall]] in the United States.

The first Polish settlers arrived at [[Walter Raleigh]]'s failed [[Roanoke Colony]] in 1585.<ref name="polishtoledo.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.polishtoledo.com/tpanews/fallnewsltr08.pdf|title=Alliance News : 2008|format=PDF|website=Polishtoledo.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>J. H. Retinger, Polacy w cywilizacjach swiata, p. 200, Warszawa, 1937.</ref> Two Polish volunteers, [[Casimir Pulaski]] and [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], led armies in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and are remembered as American heroes. Overall, around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States,  between 1820 and 1914, chiefly after national insurgencies and famine.<ref>Polonia amerykańska, p. 40</ref> They included former Polish citizens of [[Roman Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Jews|Jewish]] or other minority descent. Exact immigration figures are unknown. Many immigrants were classified as "Russian", "German" or "Austrian" by the [[U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service]] as the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918 when the former territories of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were under [[Partitions of Poland|Prussian, Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control]]. Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent. In 1940, about 50 percent married other American ethnics and a study in 1988 found that 54% of Polish Americans were of mixed ancestry from three generations or longer. The ''Polish American Cultural Center'' places a figure of Americans who have some Polish ancestry at 19–20 million.

In 2000, 667,414<!-- directly from the 2000 Census table. --> Americans over five years old reported [[Polish language|Polish]] as the language spoken at home, which is about 1.4% of the census groups who speak a language other than English or 0.25% of the U.S. population.

{{main|History of the Poles in the United States}}
Their history is divided into three stages:

# From the colonial era down to 1870, small numbers of Poles and Polish subjects came to America as individuals or in small family groups, and they quickly assimilated and did not form separate communities. For instance, Polish settlers came to the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] as skilled craftsmen as early as 1608.<ref name="ALW1977">Arthur L. Waldo. 1977. ''True Heroes of Jamestown''. Miami, Fla.: American Institute of Polish Culture, 1977. https://books.google.com/books/about/True_heroes_of_Jamestown.html?id=kiESAAAAYAAJ, last accessed July 17, 2019.</ref><ref name="Obst 2012">{{cite web | last=Obst | first=Peter J. | title=Jamestown 1608 Marker | website=Poles in America Foundation | date=2012-07-20 | url=http://www.poles.org/Jamestown_Marker/ | access-date=2019-08-03}}</ref> Some Jews from Poland even assimilated into cities which were Polish (and also other Slavic, and sometimes additionally Jewish) bastions in order to conceal their Jewish identities.<ref>See the reference to [[Anusim]]. Additionally, refer to the similar case of [[John Kerry]]'s paternal grandfather,  a Non-Polish subject whom immigrated to [[Boston]] and passed for a [[Czechs|Czech]]-Austrian Hungarian [[Catholic]]</ref>   
#
# From 1870 to 1914, Poles and Polish subjects formed a significant part of the wave of immigration from [[Germany]], [[Imperial Russia]], and [[Austria Hungary]].  The Ethnic Poles and Jews in particular came in family groups, settled in and/or blended into largely Polish neighborhoods and other Slavic bastions, and aspired to earn relatively high wages compared to what they could earn back in Europe (thus why many took the ample job opportunities for unskilled manual labor in industry and mining).  The main Ethnically-Polish-American organizations were founded because of high Polish interest in the [[Catholic church]], [[parochial school]]s, and local community affairs. Relatively few were politically active. 
#
# Since 1914, the United States has seen mass emigration from Poland, and the coming of age of several generations of fully assimilated Polish Americans. Immigration from Poland has continued into the early 2000s, and began to decline after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The income levels have gone up from well below average, to above average. Poles became active members of the liberal [[New Deal Coalition]] from the 1930s to the 1960s, but since then, many have moved to the suburbs, and have become more conservative and vote less often [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]].<ref name="HEAEG1980">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Greene|first=Victor|editor-last=Thernstrom|editor-first=Stephan|editor-link=Stephan Thernstrom|editor-last2=Orlov|editor-first2=Ann|editor-last3=Handlin|editor-first3=Oscar|editor-link3=Oscar Handlin|title=Poles|pages=787-803|encyclopedia=Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups|url=https://archive.org/details/harvardencyclope00ther|year=1980|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=0674375122|oclc=1038430174}}</ref> Outside of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and Democratic politics, politics such as those of [[Agudath Israel of America]] have heavily involved Polish-Jewish Americans.

===Occupations===
Lopata (1976) argues that Poles differed from most  other ethnic groups in America in several ways. They did not plan to remain permanently and become "Americanized". Instead, they came temporarily to earn money, invest, and wait for the right opportunity to return. Their intention was to ensure a desirable social status in the old world for themselves. However, many of the temporary migrants decided to become permanent Americans.

Many found manual labor jobs in the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]] and the heavy industries (steel mills, iron foundries, slaughterhouses, oil and sugar refineries), of the Great Lakes cities of [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]].

===U.S. Census===
[[File:1922 Detroit store.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Polish-American grocery, 1922, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]]]
The U.S. Census asked Polish immigrants to specify Polish as their native language beginning in Chicago in 1900, allowing the government to enumerate them as an individual nationality when there was no Polish nation-state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flps.newberry.org/article/5423968_8_0624|title=About the Population Census|website=Flps.newberry.org|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> No distinction is made in the American census between [[ethnic Poles|ethnically Polish Americans]] and descendants of non-ethnic Poles, such as Jews or Ukrainians, who were born in the territory of Poland and considered themselves Polish nationals. Therefore, some say, of the 10 million Polish Americans, only a certain portion are of Polish ethnic descent.  On the other hand, many ethnic Poles when entering the US from 1795 to 1917, when Poland did not exist, did not identify themselves as ethnic Poles and instead identified themselves as either German, Austrian or Russian (this pertained to the nations occupying Poland from 1795 to 1917). Therefore, the actual number of Americans of at least partial Polish ancestry, could be well over 10 million. In the 2011 United States Census Bureau's Population Estimates, there are between 9,365,239 and 9,530,571 Americans of Polish descent, with over 500,000 being foreign-born.<ref name="American FactFinder"/>

Historically, Polish-Americans have assimilated very quickly to American society. Between 1940 and 1960, only 20 percent of the children of Polish-American ethnic leaders spoke Polish regularly, compared to 50 percent for Ukrainians.<ref>Bukowczyck, p. 108</ref> In the early 1960s, 3,000 of Detroit's 300,000 Polish-Americans changed their names each year. Language proficiency in Polish is rare in Polish-Americans, as 91.3% speak "English only".<ref name="American FactFinder"/> In 1979, the 8 million respondents of Polish ancestry reported that only 41.5 percent had single ancestry, whereas 57.3% of Greeks, 52% of Italians and Sicilians, and 44% of Ukrainians had done so. Polish-Americans tended to marry exogamously in the postwar era in high numbers, and tended to marry within the Catholic population, often to persons of German (17%), Italian (10%), East European (8%), Irish (5%), French-Canadian (4%), Spanish-speaking (2%), Lithuanian (2%), and English (1%) ancestry.<ref>Bukowczyck, p. 109</ref>

==Communities==
The vast majority of Polish immigrants settled in [[metropolitan area]]s, attracted by jobs in industry. The minority, by some estimates, only ten percent, settled in rural areas.

Historian John Bukowczyk noted that Polish immigrants in America were highly mobile, and 40 to 60 percent were likely to move from any given urban neighborhood within 10 years.<ref>Bukowczyk, pg. 35.</ref> The reasons for this are very individualistic; Bukowczyk's theory is that many immigrants with agricultural backgrounds were eager to migrate because they were finally freed from local plots of land as they had been in Poland. Others ventured into business and entrepreneurship, and the majority of them opened small retail shops such as bakeries, butcher shops, saloons, and print shops.<ref>Bukowczyk, pg. 36.</ref>

===Chicago===

[[File:Polish Market in Chicago.jpeg|thumb|220px|The deli counter at the former Bobak's Polish supermarket in [[Chicago]]]]

One of the most notable in size of the urban Polish American communities is in [[Chicago]] and [[Chicagoland|its surrounding suburbs]]. [[Chicago]] bills itself as the largest Polish city outside of Poland, with approximately 185,000 [[Polish language]] speakers,<ref>The Polish Community in Metro Chicago:A Community Profile of Strengths and Needs, A Census 2000 Report, published by the Polish American Association June 2004, p.  18</ref> making Polish the third most spoken language in Chicago.  The influence of [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago's Polish community]] is demonstrated by the numerous Polish-American organizations: the [[Polish Museum of America]], [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]] (the oldest Polish American fraternal organization in the United States), [[Polish American Association]], [[Polish American Congress]], [[Polish National Alliance]], [[Polish Falcons]], [[Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America]], and the [[Polish Genealogical Society of America]]. In addition, [[Illinois]] has more than one million people that are of Polish descent, the third largest ethnic group after the [[German American|German]] and [[Irish American]]s.

[[Poles in Chicago|Chicago's Polish community]] is concentrated along the city's [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|Northwest]] and [[South Side (Chicago)|Southwest Sides]], along [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee]] and [[Archer Avenue (Chicago)|Archer Avenues]], respectively. Chicago's [[Taste of Polonia]] festival is celebrated at the [[Copernicus Foundation]], in [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]], every [[Labor Day]] weekend. Nearly 3 million people of Polish descent live in the area between Chicago and Detroit, including [[Northern Indiana]], a part of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].  The community has played a role as a staunch supporter of the Democratic machine, and has been rewarded with several congressional seats.  The leading representative has been Congressman [[Dan Rostenkowski]], one of the most powerful members of Congress (1959 to 1995), especially on issues of taxation, before he went to prison.<ref>Tomasz Inglot, and John P.

====Linden, Elizabeth, and Newark New Jersey====
[[Linden, New Jersey]] in [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]],  near [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], has become heavily first-generation Polish in recent years.{{when|date=April 2017}} 15.6% of the residents five years old and above in the city of Linden primarily speak the Polish language at home and a variety of Polish-speaking establishments may be found by the [[Linden station (NJ Transit)|Linden station]], which is a direct line to Manhattan. St. Theresa's Roman Catholic Church offers Polish-language Mass. 

In the early part of the 20th century, up to and immediately following the second  World War, Newark, New Jersey and Elizabeth, New Jersey were the primary, historic centers of 'Polonia' as Polish-Americans of that era thought of themselves. Castle Garden and Ellis Island generation immigrants and those that followed them found employment in the industries of these two cities as well as Linden which housed oil refineries and auto manufacturing. Initial settlements were in Newark, primariliy the "Ironbound" section, where St. Stanislaw Roman Catholic Church, followed by Casimir's Parish were the first parish churches founded and built by the communities there.  In Elizabeth, the first parish serving the Polish community is St. Adalbert's Roman Catholic Church.  All these parishes are over 100 years old, dating from the late 1800s, with churches constructed in the early 20th century. Post-war prosperity allowed many Polish Americans to disperse from the original core in New Jersey's industrial areas to the surrounding suburban communities. Documentation of their early history may be found on individual parkish websites.Other significant centers of Polish settlement in New Jersey included Garfield, New Jersey, Manville in Somerset County, Trenton, New Jersey, and Camden, New Jersey.

====Other areas====

In [[Hudson County]], [[New Jersey]], [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]] houses New Jersey's largest Polish American community, while [[Wallington, New Jersey|Wallington]] in [[Bergen County]] contains the state's highest percentage of Polish Americans and one of the highest percentages in the United States, at over 40%. However, within New Jersey, Polish populations are additionally increasing rapidly in [[Clifton, New Jersey|Clifton]], [[Passaic County]] as well as in [[Garfield, New Jersey|Garfield]], Bergen County.

[[Riverhead, New York]], located on eastern [[Long Island]], contains a neighborhood known as ''Polish Town'', where many Polish immigrants have continued to settle since the [[World War II]] era; the town has Polish [[architecture]], stores, and St. Isidore's R.C. Church, and Polish Town hosts an annual summer Polish Fair. [[LOT Polish Airlines]] provides [[non-stop flight]] service between [[JFK International Airport]] in the [[Queens]] borough of New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and [[Warsaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lot.com/us/en/web/newlot/home-na|title=POLISH AIRLINES LOT|publisher=LOT POLISH AIRLINES|accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>

===Wisconsin and Minnesota===
[[Milwaukee]]'s Polish population has always been overshadowed by the city's more numerous [[German American]] inhabitants. Nevertheless, the city's once numerous Polish community built a number of [[Polish Cathedral style|Polish Cathedrals]], among them the magnificent [[Basilica of St. Josaphat]] and [[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]]. Many Polish residents and businesses are still located in the [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village neighborhood.]]  The city is also home to [[Polish Fest]], the largest [[Poland|Polish]] festival in the United States, where Polish Americans from all over [[Wisconsin]] and nearby [[Chicago]], come to celebrate [[Culture of Poland|Polish Culture]], through music, food and entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gauper|first=Beth|title=Polish for a day|publisher=St. Paul Pioneer Press|work=MidwestWeekends.com|date=2007-05-27|url=http://www.midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/history_heritage/heritage_travel/polish_fest_milwaukee.html|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>  Polonia in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul is centered on Holy Cross Church in the Northeast Neighborhood of Minneapolis, where a vibrant Polish ministry continues to care for the Polish Roman Catholic Faithful.  

Wisconsin, [[Minnesota]], and [[Nebraska]] represent a different type of settlement with significant Polish communities having been established in rural areas. Historian John Radzilowski estimates that up to a third of Poles in Minnesota settled in rural areas, where they established 40 communities, that were often centered around a Catholic church.<ref>John Radzilowski. ''Poles in Minnesota.'' St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society, 2005. p.  6</ref> Most of these settlers came from the Polish lands that had been taken by Prussia during the Partitions, with a sub-group coming from Silesia. The Kaszub minority, from Poland's Baltic coast, was also strongly represented among Polish immigrants to Minnesota, most notably in Winona.  Despite relative isolation from Poland and larger urban Polonian communities, due to strong community integration these communities retained Polish language use into the 1970s in some cases and continue to have a strong Polish identity.

===Michigan===
{{see also|History of the Polish Americans in Metro Detroit}}
[[Michigan]]'s Polish population of more than 850,000 is the third-largest among [[U.S. state|US states]], behind that of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]]. Polish Americans make up 8.6% of Michigan's total population. The city of [[Detroit]] has a very large Polish community, which historically settled in [[Poletown, Detroit|Poletown]] and [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] on the east side of Detroit, the neighborhoods along Michigan Avenue from 23rd street into east Dearborn, the west side of Delray, parts of Warrendale  and several sections of Wyandotte downriver. The northern part of Poletown was cleared of residents, to make way for the [[General Motors]] [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] plant. Today it contains some of the most opulent Polish churches in America like St. Stanislaus, Sweetest Heart of Mary, St. Albertus, St. Josephat and St. Hyacinthe. Michigan as a state has Polish populations throughout. In addition to [[metropolitan Detroit]], Grand Rapids, Bay City, Alpena and the surrounding area, the thumb of Michigan, Manistee, and numerous places in northern lower Michigan and south-central Michigan also have sizable Polish populations.

The Polish influence is still felt throughout the entire metropolitan Detroit area, especially the suburb of [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]], which is slowly emerging as the major center of Polish American activities in the state. An increase in new immigration from Poland is helping to bolster the parish community of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and a host of Polish American civic organizations, located within the city of Wyandotte. Also, the Detroit suburb of [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]] is home to the American Polish Cultural Center, where the [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]] has over 200 artifacts on display from over 100 inductees, including [[Stan Musial]] and [[Mike Krzyzewski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polishsportshof.com/ccpresense.html|title=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame Artifacts on Display at the American Polish Cultural Center|accessdate=2009-02-23|publisher=National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[St. Mary's Preparatory]], a high school in [[Orchard Lake, Michigan|Orchard Lake]] with historically Polish roots, sponsors a popular annual Polish County Fair that bills itself as "America's Largest High School Fair."

===Ohio===
[[File:Lagrange street Polish Festival items booth.JPG|thumbnail|Polish and Polish themed items booth at the Lagrange Street Polish Festival in [[Toledo, Ohio]]|300px]]
[[Ohio]] is home to more than 440,000 people of Polish descent, their presence felt most strongly in the [[Greater Cleveland]] area, where half of Ohio's Polish population resides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP02&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212212624/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP02&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 February 2020|title=American FactFinder - Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|website=Factfinder2.census.gov|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] has a large Polish community, especially in historic [[Slavic Village]], as part of its Warszawa Section. Poles from this part of Cleveland migrated to the suburbs, such as [[Garfield Heights, Ohio|Garfield Heights]], [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]] and [[Seven Hills, Ohio|Seven Hills]]. [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]] has even recently been designated a Polish Village commercial district.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/polishvillage|title=Polish Village In Parma Ohio|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> Farther out, other members of Cleveland's Polish community live in [[Brecksville, Ohio|Brecksville]], [[Independence, Ohio|Independence]] and [[Broadview Heights, Ohio|Broadview Heights]]. Many of these Poles return to their Polish roots, by attending masses at [[St. Stanislaus Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|St. Stanislaus Church]], on East 65th Street and Baxter Avenue. Poles in Cleveland celebrate the annual Harvest Festival, which is usually held at the end of August. It features [[polka]] music, Polish food and all things Polish. Cleveland's other Polish section is in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Tremont]], located on Cleveland's west side. The home parishes are St. John Cantius and St. John Kanty. They also host Polish celebratory events in Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandsociety.com/index.html |title=The Cleveland Society of Poles &#124; Polish Foundation &#124; Cleveland Ohio |publisher=Clevelandsociety.com |accessdate=2012-09-10}}</ref>

Poles, in Cleveland, were instrumental in forming the [[Third Federal Savings and Loan]], in 1938. After seeing fellow Poles discriminated against by Cleveland's banks, Ben Stefanski formed Third Federal. Today the Stefanski family still controls the bank. Unlike Cleveland's [[KeyBank]] and [[National City Corp.]], which have their headquarters in [[Downtown Cleveland]], Third Federal is on Broadway Avenue in the [[Slavic Village]] neighborhood. Third Federal Savings and Loan is in the top 25 saving and loan institutions in the United States. In 2003, they acquired a [[Florida]] banking company and have branches in Florida and Ohio.

=== Texas ===
[[Panna Maria, Texas]], was founded by Upper Silesian settlers on Christmas Eve in 1854. Some people still speak [[Texas Silesian]]. The [[Silesian language]] is a dialect of Polish. [[Cestohowa, Texas|Cestohowa]], [[Kosciusko, Texas|Kosciusko]], [[Falls City, Texas|Falls City]], [[Polonia, Texas|Polonia]], [[New Waverly, Texas|New Waverly]], [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]], [[Marlin, Texas|Marlin]], [[Bremond, Texas|Bremond]], [[Anderson, Texas|Anderson]], [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], and [[Chappell Hill, Texas|Chappell Hill]] were either founded or populated by the Poles.

Other industrial cities, with major Polish communities, include: [[Buffalo, New York]]; [[Boston]]; [[History of the Poles in Baltimore|Baltimore]]; [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Connecticut]]; [[Dallas Texas|Dallas]], [[Houston Texas|Houston]], [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Minneapolis]]; [[Philadelphia]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]; [[Rochester, New York]]; [[Syracuse, New York]]; [[Los Angeles]]; [[San Francisco]]; [[Seattle]]; [[Pittsburgh]]; [[central Massachusetts|central]]/[[western Massachusetts]]; and [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. There is a relatively large Polish population in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]] in addition to the area's many German-Americans. 

[[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County]], in [[northeastern Pennsylvania]], is the only county in the United States, where a plurality of residents state their ancestry as Polish. (See: [[Maps of American ancestries]]) This includes the cities of [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazelton]], and [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]]. Many of the immigrants were drawn to this area, because of the mining of [[Anthracite]] coal in the region. Polish influences are still common today, in the form of church bazaars, [[polka]] music, and [[Polish cuisine]]. It is widely believed that [[Boothwyn, Pennsylvania]], has one of the fastest growing Polish communities in the United States.

In 2007, at the urging of Attorney Adrian Baron and the local Polonia Business Association, New Britain, Connecticut officially designated its Broad Street neighborhood as ''Little Poland'', where an estimated 30,000 residents claim Polish heritage.  Visitors can do an entire day's business completely in Polish including banking, shopping, dining, legal consultations, and even dance lessons. The area has retained its Polish character since 1890.

Polish Americans built dozens of [[Polish Cathedral style|Polish Cathedrals]] in the [[Great Lakes]] and [[New England]] regions and in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago's]] Poles founded the following churches: St. Stanislaus Kostka, Holy Trinity, St. John Cantius, Holy Innocents, St. Helen, St. Fidelis, St. Mary of the Angels, St. Hedwig, St. Josaphat, St. Francis of Assisi (Humboldt Park), St. Hyacinth Basilica, St. Wenceslaus, Immaculate Heart of Mary, St. Stanislaus B&M, St. James (Cragin), St. Ladislaus, St. Constance, St. Mary of Perpetual Help, St. Barbara, SS.

[[File:Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Little Falls, MN.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Little Falls, Minnesota. Built in 1922 by Polish-American immigrants.]]
Poles established approximately 50 Roman Catholic parishes in Minnesota. Among them: St. Wojciech (Adalbert) and [[Church of St. Casimir (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|St. Kazimierz (Casimir)]] in St. Paul; Holy Cross, St. Philip, St. Hedwig (Jadwiga Slaska) and All Saints, in Minneapolis; Our Lady Star of the Sea and St. Casimir's in Duluth; and St. Kazimierz (Casimir) and St. Stanislaw Kostka in Winona. A few of the parishes of particular note, founded by Poles elsewhere in Minnesota, include: St. John Cantius in Wilno; [[Church of St. Joseph (Browerville, Minnesota)|St. Jozef (Joseph)]] in Browerville; [[Church of St. John the Baptist (Virginia, Minnesota)|St. John the Baptist]] in Virginia; St. Mary in Częstochowa; St. Wojciech (Adalbert) in Silver Lake; Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Opole; Our Lady of Lourdes in Little Falls; St. Stanislaus B&M in Sobieski; St. Stanislaus Kostka in Bowlus; St. Hedwig in Holdingford; Sacred Heart in Flensburg; Holy Cross in North Prairie; Holy Cross in Harding; and St. Isadore in Moran Township.

Poles in Cleveland established St. Hyacinth's (now closed), [[St. Stanislaus Church (Cleveland, Ohio)|Saint Stanislaus Church]] (1873), Sacred Heart (1888–2010) Immaculate Heart of Mary (1894), St. John Cantius (Westside Poles), St. Barbara (closed), Sts Peter and Paul Church (1927) in Garfield Heights, Saint Therese (1927) Garfield Heights, Marymount Hospital (1948) Garfield Heights, and Saint Monica Church (1952) Garfield Heights. Also, the Polish Community created the Our Lady of Częstochowa Shrine on the campus of Marymount Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Lady of Czestochowa Shrine|url=http://www.marymount.org/SpecialtiesServices/PastoralCareSpiritualLife/tabid/1623/Default.aspx|publisher=Marymount Hospital|accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>

Poles in [[South Bend, Indiana]], founded four parishes: St. Hedwig Parish (1877), St. Casimir Parish (1898), St. Stanislaus Parish (1907), and [[St. Adalbert Parish, South Bend]] (1910).

[[File:Czestochowska.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]], a religious figure in Polish Catholicism]]
Polish Americans preserved their longstanding tradition of venerating the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa|Lady of Czestochowa]] in the United States. Replicas of the painting are common in Polish American churches and parishes, and many churches and parishes are named in her honor. The veneration of the Virgin Mary in Polish parishes is a significant difference between Polish Catholicism and Catholicism; Polish nuns in the [[Felician Sisters|Felician Order]] for instance, took to Marianism as the cornerstone of their spiritual development, and Polish churches in the U.S. were seen as "cult-like" in their veneration of Mary.<ref name="marythemessiah">Mary the Messiah: Polish Immigrant Heresy and the Malleable Ideology of the Roman Catholic Church, 1880-1930. John J. Bukowczyk. Journal of American Ethnic History. Vol. 4, No. 2 (Spring, 1985), pp. 5-32</ref> Religious catechism and writings from convents found that Polish nuns in the Felician Sisters and The Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth were taught to have "a sound appreciation of Mary's [[Co-Redemptrix|role in the mystery of the Redemption]] and ...a filial confidence in her patronage," more explicitly, to be "a true daughter to the immaculate Virgin Mary". The Marianism that was taught in Polish parish schools in the United States was done independent of the Catholic Church, and demonstrated autonomy on the part of the nuns who taught Polish American youths. It is notable that there was a concurrent movement in Poland that eventually led to a separatist Catholic church, the [[Mariavite Church]], which greatly expanded the veneration of the Virgin Mary in its doctrine. In Poland, the Virgin Mary was believed to serve as a mother of mercy and salvation for Catholics, and throughout the Middle Ages, Polish knights prayed to her before battle. Polish American churches featured replicas of the [[Black Madonna|Lady of Częstochowa]], which was on feature at the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] and holds national and religious significance because of its connection to a victorious military defense in 1655. Several towns in America are named [[Częstochowa]], in commemoration of the town in Poland.<ref name="marythemessiah"/>

Though the majority of Polish Americans remained loyal to the Catholic Church, a [[Polish National Catholic Church|breakaway Catholic church]] was founded in 1897 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Polish parishioners founded the church to assert independence from the Catholic Church in America. The split was in rebellion from the church leadership, then dominated by Irish bishops and priests, and lacking in Polish language speakers and Polish church leaders. It exists today with 25,000 parishioners and remains independent from the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Poland is also home to followers of [[Protestantism]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Small groups of both of these groups also immigrated to the United States. One of the most celebrated painters of religious icons in North America today is a Polish American Eastern Orthodox priest, Fr.

A small group of [[Lipka Tatars]], originating from the [[Białystok]] region, helped co-found the first [[Muslim]] organization in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1907, and later, a [[mosque]], which is [[Powers Street Mosque|still in use]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758343,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: Ramadan | date=1937-11-15 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

==Social status==
In 1969, the median family income was $8,849 for Polish Americans.  The median family income for all families in the United States in 1968 was $7,900. Leonard F.

==Politics==
{{main|Poland–United States relations}}

===Anti-Polonism===
{{main|Antipolonism}}
The Polish community was long the subject of [[anti-Polish sentiment]] in America. The word ''[[Polack]]'' has become a [[List of ethnic slurs|racial slur]]. This prejudice was partially associated with [[anti-Catholicism]], and early 20th century worries about being overrun by [[Central Europe]]an immigrants.

==Culture==
<!-- Commented out: [[File:Nowy dziennik cover.gif|thumb|right|220px|The front page of New York City's ''[[Nowy Dziennik]]''.]] -->
The cultural contributions of Polish Americans cover a broad spectrum, including media, publishing industry, religious presence, artistic life, cuisine, museums and festivals.

[[File:Polish American flag.JPG|thumbnail|300px|Polish American novelty flag]]

===Media===
Among the most notable Polish American media groups are [[Hippocrene Books]] (founded by Polish American George Blagowidow); [[TVP Polonia]]; [[Polsat 2 International]]; [[TVN International]]; [[Polvision]]; TV4U New York; [[WPNA]] Radio Chicago; [[Polish Radio External Service]] (formerly Radio Polonia); Polonia Today and the [[Warsaw Voice]]. There are also Polish American newspapers and magazines, such as the ''[[Dziennik Związkowy (Polish Daily News)|Dziennik Związkowy]]'', ''PL'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.PLmagazine.net/ |title=PL - polsko-amerykański dwujęzyczny miesięcznik / Polish-American bilingual monthly |publisher=Plmagazine.net |accessdate=2012-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013012356/http://plmagazine.net/ |archive-date=2012-10-13 }}</ref> ''Polish Weekly Chicago'', the ''[[Super Express USA]]'' and ''[[Nowy Dziennik]]'' in New York and ''[[Tygodnik Polski]]'' and ''[[The Polish Times]]'' in Detroit, not to mention the Ohio University Press Series in Polish American Studies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohioswallow.com/ |title=Ohio University Press & Swallow Press |publisher=Ohioswallow.com |accessdate=2012-09-10}}</ref> Przeglad Polski Online, ''Polish American Journal'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polamjournal.com/|title=Welcome to the Polish American Journal|website=Polamjournal.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> the Polish News Online,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polishnews.com/ |title=Polsko Amerykański portal - Polish American portal |publisher=Polishnews.Com |accessdate=2012-09-10}}</ref>''Am-Pol Eagle Newspaper'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ampoleagle.com/|title=The Am-Pol Eagle|website=Ampoleagle.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> and Progress for Poland,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressforpoland.com/|title=Progress for Poland - Chicago: Fakty, Wiadomości, Opinie...|work=Progress for Poland|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> among others.

===Cultural identity===
Even in long-integrated communities, remnants of Polish culture and vocabulary remain. Roman Catholic churches built by Polish American communities often serve as a vehicle for cultural retention.

During the 1950s–1970s, the Polish wedding was often an all-day event. Traditional Polish weddings in [[Chicago metropolitan area]], in areas such as the southeast side of Chicago, inner suburbs like Calumet City and Hegewisch, and [[Northwest Indiana]] suburbs, such as Whiting, Hammond and East Chicago, always occurred on Saturdays. The receptions were typically held in a large hall, such as a VFW Hall. A polka band of drums, a singer, accordion, and trumpet, entertained the people, as they danced traditional dances, such as the oberek, "Polish Hop" and the waltz. Always an important part of Slavic culture, food played a very important role. The musicians, as well as the guests, were expected to enjoy ample amounts of both food and drink. Foods, such as Polish sausage, sauerkraut, pierogi and kluski were common. Common drinks were beer, screwdrivers and highballs. Many popular Polish foods became a fixture in the American cuisine of today, including [[kielbasa|kiełbasa]] (Polish sausage), [[babka (food)|babka]] cake, [[kaszanka]] (kasanzka) and [[pierogi]].

Polish American cultural groups include  [[Polish American Arts Association]] and the [[Polish Falcons]].

Among the many Polish American writers are a number of poets, such as [[Phil Boiarski]], [[Hedwig Gorski]], [[John Guzlowski]], [[John Minczeski]], [[Linda Nemec Foster]], [[Leonard Kress]] (poet and translator), [[Cecilia Woloch]], [[Kim Kikel]] and [[Mark Pawlak]] (poet and editor), along with novelists [[Leslie Pietrzyk]], [[Thad Rutkowski]], [[Suzanne Strempek Shea]]<ref name="PAHA">{{cite web|url=http://www.polishamericanstudies.org/resources.html|title=Polish American Historical Association - Resources and Supported Links|website=Polishamericanstudies.org|accessdate=28 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125204643/http://www.polishamericanstudies.org/resources.html|archive-date=2017-11-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> and others.

===Museums===
[[File:20070822 Polish Museum.JPG|thumb|220px|left|The [[Polish Museum of America]] in [[Chicago]] ]]
Among the best known Polish American museums are the [[Polish Museum of America]] in Chicago's old [[Polish Downtown]]; founded in 1935, the largest ethnic museum in the U.S. sponsored by the [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]]. The Museum Library ranks as one of the best, outside of Poland. Equally ambitious is the [[Polish American Museum]] located in [[Port Washington, New York]], founded in 1977. It features displays of folk art, costumes, historical artifacts and paintings, as well as bilingual research library with particular focus on achievements of the people of Polish heritage in America.<ref name="S-M">Smithsonian Magazine, [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/venues/Polish_American_Museum.html Polish American Museum] at Smithsonian.com</ref><ref name="NYT">James Barron, [[the New York Times]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EEDB1039F93BA3575BC0A964948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 If you're thinking of living in:; Port Washington] Published: August 8, 1982</ref> There is also the [[Polish Cultural Institute and Museum (Winona, Minnesota)|Polish Cultural Institute and Museum]] of [[Winona, Minnesota]], known informally as "[http://polishmuseumwinona.org The Polish Museum of Winona]." Formally established in 1979 by Father [[Paul Breza]], the Polish Museum of Winona features exhibits pertaining to Winona's Kashubian Polish culture and hosts a wide range of events celebrating America's Polish-American heritage in general.

===Festivals===
[[File:2008 Pulaski Day Parade.jpg|thumb|right|Polish-American parade in New York City, 2008]]
There are a number of unique festivals, street parties and parades held by the Polish American community. The [[Polish Fest]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is a popular annual festival, takes place at the Henry Maier Festival Park. It is also the largest Polish festival in the United States. It attracts Polish Americans from all over Wisconsin and nearby Chicago, who come to celebrate Polish culture through music, food and entertainment. [[New York City]] is home to the [[New York Polish Film Festival]], an annual film festival showcasing current and past films of [[Polish cinema]]. NYPFF is the only annual presentation of Polish films in New York City and the largest festival promoting and presenting Polish films on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Święto polskiego kina w Nowym Jorku |url=http://film.wp.pl/id,94753,title,Swieto-polskiego-kina-w-Nowym-Jorku,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=1dfc5&_ticrsn=3 |publisher=[[Wirtualna Polska]]|date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=12 March 2012|language= pl}}</ref> 

[http://www.polishscholarship.com/ The Polish Festival] in Syracuse's Clinton Square has become the largest cultural event in the history of the Polish community in Central New York. There's also the [[Taste of Polonia]] festival held in Chicago every Labor Day weekend since 1979 at the [[Copernicus Cultural and Civic Center]] in the Jefferson Park area.

Polish Americans carried on celebrations of Constitution Day throughout their time in the United States without political suppression. In Poland, from 1940 to 1989, the holiday was banned by Nazi and Soviet occupiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ampoleagle.com/may-rd-polish-constitution-day-p6745-105.htm|title=May 3rd Polish Constitution Day|website=Ampoleagle.com|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Polish American vets of World War I.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Polish-Americans]] who fought in the Blue Army. Image taken in [[Detroit, Michigan]] (1955) and featured in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine.]]

Polish-Americans have influenced [[American culture]] in many ways. Most prominent among these is that Jefferson drafting the [[Constitution of the United States]] was inspired by religious tolerance of the [[Warsaw Confederation]],<ref>Sandra Lapointe. ''The Golden Age of Polish Philosophy: Kazimierz Twardowski's Philosophical Legacy''. Springer. 2009. pp. 2-3. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5u84tl5ux0gC&pg=PA2&dq=jefferson+american+constitution+warsaw+confederation&hl=en&sa=X&ei=A7NQUc33NsXaPMK0gdAL&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=jefferson%20american%20constitution%20warsaw%20confederation&f=false]</ref> which guaranteed freedom of conscience.

The Polish culture left also culinary marks in the United States – the inclusion of traditional [[Polish cuisine]] such as [[pierogi]],  [[kielbasa]], [[golabki]]. Some of these Polish foods were tweaked and reinvented in the new American environment, such as Chicago's [[Maxwell Street Polish Sausage]].

Polish Americans have also contributed to altering the physical landscape of the cities they have inhabited, erecting monuments to Polish-American heroes such as [[Kościuszko]] and Pulaski. Distinctive cultural phenomena such as [[Polish flat]]s or the [[Polish Cathedral style]] of architecture became part and parcel of the areas where Polish settlement occurred.

Poles' cultural ties to Roman Catholicism have also influenced the adoption of such distinctive rites like the blessing of the baskets before Easter in many areas of the United States by fellow Roman Catholics.

===Architectural influence===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The John Gawlik House.jpg|thumb|left|High-pitched roofs were a common feature in Polish architecture. Displayed is ''The John Gawlik House'', in Panna Maria, built 1858]] -->
Early Polish immigrants built houses with high-pitched roofs in the United States. The high-pitched roof is necessary in a country subject to snow, and is a common feature in Northern and Eastern European architecture. In Panna Maria, Texas, Poles built brick houses with thick walls and high-pitched roofs. Meteorological and soil data show [[Karnes County, Texas|that region in Texas]] is subject to less than 1 inch of snow<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellicast.com/Local/History.aspx?location=USTX1020|title=Intellicast - Panna Maria Historic Weather Averages in Texas (78144)|website=Intellicast.com|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> and a meteorological study conducted 1960-1990 found the lowest one-day temperature ever recorded was 5 degrees Fahrenheit on January 21, 1986, highly unlikely to support much snow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/Manuscripts/TX255/0/Karnes.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321155214/http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/Manuscripts/TX255/0/Karnes.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-21 }}</ref> The shaded [[veranda]] that was created by these roofs was a popular living space for the Polish Texans, who spent much of their time there to escape the sub-tropical temperatures of Texas. The Poles in Texas added porches to these verandas, often in the southward windy side, which is an alteration to traditional folk architecture.<ref name="Abernathy2000"/> According to oral histories recorded from descendants, the verandas were used for "almost all daily activities from preparing meals to dressing animal hides."<ref name="Abernathy2000">{{cite book|author=Francis Edward Abernathy|title=Publications of the Texas Folklore Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MzC5rRHjMsC&pg=PA132|accessdate=10 April 2013|date=1 August 2000|publisher=University of North Texas Press|isbn=978-1-57441-092-1|pages=132–}}</ref> The Poles in Texas put [[Thatching|straw thatching]] on their roofs until the early 1900s, another European influence. The first house built by a Pole in Panna Maria is the John Gawlik House, constructed in 1858. The building still stands and is visited as a historical attraction in the cultural history of Texas. In 2011, the [[San Antonio Conservation Society]] financed a replacement of the building's roof, identifying it as a "historically and architecturally significant building."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysoutex.com/view/full_story_landing/16973461/article-Grant-will-replace-roof-of-1858-Panna-Maria-house|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629223054/http://www.mysoutex.com/view/full_story_landing/16973461/article-Grant-will-replace-roof-of-1858-Panna-Maria-house|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2013|title=mySouTex.com - Grant will replace roof of 1858 Panna Maria house|website=Mysoutex.com|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>

===Military===
Organizations like the [[Polish Legion of American Veterans]] were organized to memorialize the Polish contribution to the American military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plav.org/plavhist.htm|title=PLAV History|website=Plav.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref>
