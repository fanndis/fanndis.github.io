On January 20, 2009, at the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|presidential inauguration of Barack Obama]], Alexander recited her poem "[[Praise Song for the Day]]", which she had composed for the occasion.<ref name=ny/><ref name=yal/> She became only the fourth poet to read at an American presidential inauguration, after [[Robert Frost]] in 1961, [[Maya Angelou]] in 1993 and [[Miller Williams]] in 1997.<ref name=wp>{{cite news |author=Michael E.

The ''Minneapolis Star-Tribune'' found the poem "dull, 'bureaucratic' and found it proved that "the poet's place is not on the platform but in the crowd, that she should speak not for the people but to them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/37883244.html?page=2&c=y|title=''Star Tribune''.|accessdate=December 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123081257/http://www.startribune.com/politics/37883244.html?page=2&c=y|archive-date=January 23, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>
