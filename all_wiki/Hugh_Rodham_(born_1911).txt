In [[World War II]], Rodham served in the [[United States Navy]].

Rodham entered politics once. Hoping to work his way into favor with the [[Cook County Democratic Party]] [[political machine]] in order to capitalize on a downtown investment he had made, he ran for [[Chicago City Council|Chicago alderman]] as a Democratic-leaning [[Independent (politician)|independent]] in 1947.<ref name="bernstein-book"/> The contest, held in Chicago's 49th Ward, was won by Frank Keenan, a Democratic ward committeeman running on the regular Democratic line, with 17,073 votes; a Republican, Joseph Reubens, finished second with 5,509 votes.<ref name="butler"/> Rodham finished fifth out of eight candidates with only 382 votes, or 1.5 percent of the total votes cast.<ref name="butler">{{cite book | title=Hidden History of Uptown & Edgewater | first=Patrick | last=Butler | publisher=[[The History Press]] | location=Charleston, South Carolina | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-62619-143-3 | page=102}} See also {{cite web | url=http://www.edgewaterhistory.org/ehs/articles/v24-1-8 | title=Edgewater Teaser #18 | publisher=Edgewater Historical Society | date=Spring 2013}}</ref> According to some family members, this episode led to his strong dislike of the Democratic Party for the rest of his life.<ref name="bernstein-book"/>

Rodham was a staunch supporter of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential campaign]] and remained a committed [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] until his death. Even after his daughter married Democrat [[Bill Clinton]], he (according to Bill Clinton) "never gave up hope that his son-in-law would join him in the Republican Party and support a cut in the [[capital gains tax]]."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/candidates/democrat/clinton/rodham.shtml The Rodham Family Biography], AllPolitics, CNN.com, 1996.</ref> In late 1992, following son-in-law Bill Clinton's election as president, Rodham made a cameo appearance on the television comedy ''[[Hearts Afire]]'', whose producers were friends of the Clintons.<ref name="nyt-obit"/>
