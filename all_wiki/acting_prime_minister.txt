{{Executive}}
An '''Acting Prime Minister''' is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] member (often in [[Westminster system]] countries) who is serving in the role of [[Prime Minister]], whilst the individual who normally holds the position is unable to do so. The role is often performed by the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] (where that position exists), or by another senior minister. 

The office is commonly used when the Prime Minister is absent from the territory of that nation or when the Prime Minister is unable to perform duties for health reasons.

An Acting Prime Minister should be distinguished from a [[Caretaker government|Caretaker Prime Minister]], which refers to an Outgoing Prime Minister following an electoral defeat, and who by [[convention (norm)|convention]] does not implement new policies or an [[Interim government|Interim Prime Minister]] who is appointed to perform a similar role to a Caretaker Prime Minister, but who is typically not a Prime Minister at the time of being appointed.

==Statutory authority==
Within a Commonwealth nation, the office of Acting Prime Minister like that of Prime Minister is found only in convention, and is not legislated.{{cn|date=June 2017}} The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, or an equivalent ministry, drafts, reviews and publishes any formal conventions (though these are expressly non binding in a court of law).{{cn|date=November 2019}}

==By country==
===Australia===
According to ''House of Representatives Practice'', an official publication of the [[Parliament of Australia]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] "may make temporary ministerial arrangements without reference to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. A Minister may act for another Minister on account of absence from Australia or from the Ministry or due to ill health. The ''Acts Interpretation Act'' confers upon an Acting Minister the same power and authority with respect to the absent Minister's statutory responsibilities."<ref name=aus>[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/practice/chapter2 Chapter 2 House, Government and Opposition, ''House of Representative Practice'' (5th edition)]. Published by the Parliament of Australia.</ref>

The position of ''acting prime minister'' is a special case of an acting minister, and generally occurs when the prime minister is travelling overseas, is on vacation, or is in ill health. In the early 20th century, when travel by ship was still the norm, it was not uncommon for there to be an acting prime minister for months on end. 

The [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|deputy prime minister]] is usually designated as the acting prime minister, although another senior member of the government may fill the role if both the prime minister and deputy prime minister are unavailable.<ref name=aus/> An acting prime minister is required quite frequently – for instance, between 3 December 2007 and 23 February 2009 (during [[Kevin Rudd]]'s first term), [[Julia Gillard]] acted as prime minister on 16 separate occasions.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/Estimates/Live/fapa_ctte/estimates/add_0809/pmc/answers/PM4.ashx Dates and individuals who acted as Acting Prime Minister]</ref>

The term ''acting prime minister'' is sometimes also applied to someone who is temporarily appointed Prime Minister following a death in office (more commonly called a ''caretaker prime minister'' or an ''interim prime minister''). Examples include [[Frank Forde]] (seven days following [[John Curtin]]'s death), [[Earle Page]] (19 days following [[Joseph Lyons]]' death), and [[John McEwen]] (22 days following [[Harold Holt]]'s disappearance). 

Unlike those who merely acted in the absence of a prime minister, Forde, Page and McEwen were officially commissioned by the Governor General and took the oath of office; they are considered prime ministers in their own right.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prime Ministers|url=https://primeMinisters.moadoph.gov.au/prime-Ministers|website=Australian Prime Ministers|publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy|accessdate=23 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314174122/https://primeministers.moadoph.gov.au/prime-ministers|archive-date=14 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Canada===
In Canada, the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Canada|Deputy Prime Minister]]—a position that is not always in use—becomes acting head of government in the event that the Prime Minister is absent from Canada or incapacitated. Prior to the creation of the Deputy Prime Minister position, acting prime ministers were routinely appointed when prime ministers were temporarily away from their duties; however, prime ministers typically appointed a different cabinet member each time, rather than designating one specific person as a permanent official "deputy".  

In February 1958, Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] appointed [[Ellen Fairclough]] as acting Prime Minister for two days while he was absent from his duties; Fairclough was historically noteworthy as the first woman ever given the duty.<ref>"As Acting Prime Minister Ellen Fairclough First Again". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', February 21, 1958.</ref>

===Israel===
{{Main|Acting Prime Minister of Israel}}
The designated Acting Prime Minister takes the role of Prime Minister as Acting Prime Minister, for up to one hundred consecutive days, if the incumbent is temporarily incapacitated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Miri Regev appointed acting PM while Netanyahu abroad|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-miri-regev-appointed-acting-pm-while-netanyahu-abroad/|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=[[Times of Israel]]|date=14 June 2017}}</ref> Whilst in other countries the term "Acting Prime Minister" only refers to an individual actually performing the role, in Israel the term is also in use when a designated Minister is allocated, even if they never actually perform the role.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Acting Prime Minister is the designated head of government when the incumbent is not available to fulfill their duties. This includes when the Prime Minister is overseas, unwell, or otherwise temporarily unavailable. Typically this position is filled by the [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-business-units/cabinet-office/supporting-work-cabinet/cabinet-manual/2-ministers-crown-2|title=Deputy Prime Minister|work=Cabinet Manual|publisher=Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref> [[Hugh Watt]], who was then the Deputy Prime Minister, served as Acting Prime Minister for six days, after [[Norman Kirk]] died in office in 1974. 

Deputy Prime Minister [[Winston Peters]] was serving as Acting Prime Minister as of 21 June 2018 until 2 August 2018, while [[Jacinda Ardern]] took maternity leave.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jacinda Ardern on baby news: 'I'll be Prime Minister and a mum'|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/348449/ardern-i-ll-be-prime-minister-and-a-mum|accessdate=19 January 2018|publisher=RNZ|date=19 January 2018}}</ref>

Prior to the establishment of the Deputy Prime Minister role, a senior Minister would be appointed to act as Prime Minister when, for example, the incumbent was travelling overseas. In the current era, when both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister are unavailable, the next highest ranking minister who is available will be asked to act as Prime Minister, until a colleague of higher rank is available again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/politics/bennett-to-serve-as-acting-pm-while-key-english-are-out-of-nz/ |title=Bennett to serve as acting PM while Key, English are out of NZ |first1=Felix |last1=Marwick |first2=Claire |last2=Trevett |website=[[Newstalk ZB]] |accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Dan|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/general/tony-ryall-promoted-to-acting-prime-minister-2009082018|title=Tony Ryall promoted to Acting Prime Minister|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=6 March 2018|publisher=Newshub}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chapman|first=Grant|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/11/kelvin-davis-takes-charge-of-the-country-as-acting-prime-minister.html|title=Kelvin Davis takes charge of the country as Acting Prime Minister|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=6 March 2018|publisher=Newshub}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the post of Deputy Prime Minister is non-concurrent but is the ''[[de facto]]'' second in Government. Where there is no [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]], the [[First Secretary of State]] typically deputises for the Prime Minister.

On 6 April 2020, Prime Minister, [[Boris Johnson]] was admitted to intensive care at St Thomas Hospital, London after contracting [[COVID-19]]. [[First Secretary of State]], [[Dominic Raab]] was formally asked to 'deputise where necessary' due to the ill-health of the incumbent Prime Minister, but was not formally made Acting Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coronavirus: Boris Johnson moved to intensive care |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52192604 |work=BBC News |date=6 April 2020 |accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>
