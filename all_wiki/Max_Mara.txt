==History==
Achille Maramotti began designing couture clothing in 1947, and officially established the House of Max Mara in 1951. The "Mara" came from his surname, while "Max" referred to Count Max, a local character who was seldom sober but always stylish.<ref name="Indy">{{Citation | last = Barbieri | first = Annalisa | publication-date =2005-01-24 | year =2005 | title =Tycoon who pioneered 'off the peg' designer clothes with his fashion label MaxMara | periodical =The Independent | publication-place = London | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/achille-maramotti-488030.html 
 | access-date =2008-04-09}}</ref> Maramotti was one of the first to see that the future of fashion lay in the mass production of designer-quality clothes.  He was also keen to emphasise the brand of Max Mara ahead of the names of individual designers, even though he employed [[Karl Lagerfeld]], [[Jean-Charles de Castelbajac]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Narciso Rodriguez]]<ref name="Times"/> and [[Anne Marie Beretta]].<ref name=soy>{{Cite news|url=http://www.palaisgalliera.paris.fr/en/work/soy-dress-anne-marie-beretta|title='Soy' dress, Anne-Marie Beretta|work=Palais Galliera {{!}} Musée de la mode de la Ville de Paris|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}</ref> The company remains in the hands of the family.<ref name="Times">{{Citation | last =Ashworth | first =Anne | publication-date =2008-03-14 | year =2008 | title =MaxMara: A store that's always maximally stylish | periodical =The Times | publication-place =London | url = http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article3547053.ece | access-date =2008-04-09}}</ref>
