Byrd served in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1947 to 1950, and the West Virginia State Senate from 1950 to 1952. Initially elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1952, Byrd served there for six years before being elected to the Senate in [[1958 United States Senate election in West Virginia|1958]]. He rose to become one of the Senate's most powerful members, serving as secretary of the [[Senate Democratic Caucus]] from 1967 to 1971 and—after defeating his longtime colleague [[Ted Kennedy]] for the job—as [[Senate Majority Whip]] from 1971 to 1977. Over the next three decades, Byrd led the Democratic caucus in numerous roles depending on whether his party held control of the Senate, including [[Senate Majority Leader]], [[Senate Minority Leader]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] and president pro tempore emeritus.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> As president pro tempore—a position he held four times in his career—he was third in the [[United States presidential line of succession|line of presidential succession]], after the vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]].

Serving three different tenures as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations]] enabled Byrd to steer a great deal of federal money toward projects in West Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Woodward, Calvin |url=http://www.register-herald.com/archives/byrd-s-passions-poetry-power-and-home-state-pork/article_7f94bdd3-2199-5f5e-9d7c-920cae75a5a9.html |title=The Associated Press: Byrd's passions: Poetry, power and home-state pork |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref> Critics derided his efforts as [[pork (politics)|pork barrel spending]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100628/ap_on_re_us/us_byrd_s_legacy |title=Pork or progress?

While he filibustered against the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]] and supported the [[Vietnam War]] earlier in his career, Byrd's views changed considerably over the course of his life. He would later completely renounce racism and segregation, and spoke in opposition to the [[Iraq War]]. Renowned for his knowledge of Senate precedent and [[parliamentary procedure]], Byrd wrote a four-volume history of the Senate in later life.

Near the end of his life, Byrd was in declining health and was hospitalized several times. He died in office on June 28, 2010, at the age of 92. Byrd is the oldest member of Congress to die in office. He was buried at [[Columbia Gardens Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

====Children====
Robert Byrd had two daughters (Mona Byrd Fatemi and Marjorie Byrd Moore), six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/>

===Ku Klux Klan===
In the early 1940s, Byrd recruited 150 of his friends and associates to create a new chapter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in [[Sophia, West Virginia]].<ref name=nyt1/><ref name="WP061905"/>

As a young boy, Byrd had witnessed his adoptive father walk in a Klan parade in [[Matoaka, West Virginia]]. While growing up, Byrd had heard that "the Klan defended the American way of life against racemixers and communists". He then wrote to Joel L. Baskin, Grand Dragon of the Realm of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, who responded that he would come and organize a chapter when Byrd had recruited 150 people. Byrd's house couldn't fit 150 people, so he arranged to hold the ceremony at the home of C.M. "Clyde" Goodwin, a former law enforcement officer who lived in [[Crab Orchard, West Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historynet.com/robert-byrd-consorts-kkk-grand-dragon.htm |title=Robert Byrd Consorts With a KKK Grand Dragon |last=Carlson |first=Peter |date=August 1, 2011 |website=History Net |publisher=Historynet LLC |location=Leesburg, VA}}</ref>

It was Baskin who told Byrd, "You have a talent for leadership, Bob&nbsp;... The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation." Byrd later recalled, "Suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone important had recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought of a political career had never really hit me. But strike me that night, it did."<ref>{{cite book |last=Byrd |first=Robert C. |date=2005 |title=Robert C.

In December 1944, Byrd wrote to [[racial segregation|segregationist]] [[Mississippi]] Senator [[Theodore G. Bilbo]]:

{{quote|I shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side&nbsp;... Rather I should die a thousand times, and see [[Old Glory]] trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.|Robert C.

In 1946, Byrd wrote a letter to a [[Grand Wizard]] stating, "The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia and in every state in the nation."<ref>King, Colbert I.: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/03/02/sen-byrd-the-view-from-darrells-barbershop/4d78d270-f993-4336-b08c-4c83852157ef/ ''Sen.

During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan." He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was [[anti-communist]].<ref name=" WP061905"/>

Byrd later called joining the KKK "the greatest mistake I ever made."<ref name=slatebyrd/> In 1997, he told an interviewer he would encourage young people to become involved in politics but also warned, "Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] around your neck.

Byrd worked as a gas station attendant, a grocery store clerk, a [[shipyard]] [[welder]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]], and a butcher before he won a seat in the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1946, representing [[Raleigh County, West Virginia|Raleigh County]] from 1947 to 1950.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> Byrd became a local celebrity after a radio station in [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]] began broadcasting his "fiery fundamentalist lessons."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holley|first1=Joe|title=Sen.

===Continued education===
[[File:Byrd jfk.gif|thumb|right|Byrd and JFK at his 1963 commencement ceremony]]
Early in his career Byrd attended [[Beckley College]], [[Concord College]], [[Morris Harvey College]], [[Marshall University|Marshall College]], and [[George Washington University Law School]],<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> and joined the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite news|date=November 20, 2008|title=Frater Robert Byrd Celebrates 91st Birthday|url=http://www.tke.org/news/2008/11/20/frater-robert-byrd-celebrates-91st-birthday|newspaper=Tau Epsilon|location=Indianapolis, IN|access-date=January 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130055051/http://www.tke.org/news/2008/11/20/frater-robert-byrd-celebrates-91st-birthday|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Byrd began night classes at [[American University]] [[Washington College of Law]] in 1953, while a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He earned his [[Juris Doctor|JD]] ''[[cum laude]]'' a decade later,<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> by which time he was a [[U.S. Senator]]. President [[John F. Kennedy]] spoke at the commencement ceremony on June 10, 1963, and presented the graduates their diplomas, including Byrd. Byrd completed law school in an era when undergraduate degrees were not a requirement. He later decided to complete his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]], and in 1994 he graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Marshall University]].<ref name="111809_CNN_Byrd"/>

==Congressional service==
In 1952, Byrd was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[West Virginia's 6th congressional district]],<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> succeeding [[E. H. Hedrick]], who retired from the House to make an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of West Virginia|governor]]. Byrd was re-elected twice from this district, anchored in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] and also including his home in Sophia, serving from January 3, 1953, to January 3, 1959.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> Byrd defeated [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent [[W. Chapman Revercomb]] for the [[United States Senate]] in 1958. Revercomb's record supporting civil rights had become an issue, playing in Byrd's favor.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> Byrd was re-elected to the Senate eight times. He was West Virginia's junior senator for his first four terms; his colleague from 1959 to 1985 was [[Jennings Randolph]], who had been elected on the same day as Byrd's first election in a special election to fill the seat of the late Senator [[Matthew Neely]].

[[File:Congressman Robert Byrd.png|thumb|left|Byrd official portrait as a congressman]]
While Byrd faced some vigorous Republican opposition in his career, his last serious electoral opposition occurred in 1982 when he was challenged by freshman Congressman [[Cleve Benedict]]. Despite his tremendous popularity in the state, Byrd ran unopposed only once, in 1976. On three other occasions—in 1970, 1994 and 2000—he won all 55 of West Virginia's counties. In his re-election bid in 2000, he won all but seven [[electoral precinct|precinct]]s. Congresswoman [[Shelley Moore Capito]], the daughter of one of Byrd's longtime foes, former governor [[Arch A. Moore Jr.|Arch Moore Jr.]], briefly considered a challenge to Byrd in 2006 but decided against it. Capito's district covered much of the territory Byrd had represented in the U.S. House.

In the 1960 Democratic presidential election primaries, Byrd—a close Senate ally of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] – endorsed and campaigned for [[Hubert Humphrey]] over front-runner [[John F. Kennedy]] in the state's crucial [[primary election|primary]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=William H.|title=Politics: New Campaign Tactics Emerge; West Virginia's Popularity Contest Now Takes On Deeper Meaning for the National Campaign|work=The New York Times|date=May 1, 1960}}</ref> However, Kennedy won the state's primary and eventually the general election.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Michael|title=John F.

Byrd was elected to a record ninth consecutive full Senate term on November 7, 2006.

Upon the death of former Florida Senator [[George Smathers]] on January 20, 2007, Byrd became the last living United States Senator from the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Senators Who Have Cast More than 10,000 Votes | publisher=United States Senate Democratic Policy Committee Vote Information Office | date=January 3, 2009 | url=http://senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/10000_or_more_votes.htm| url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060531105507/https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/10000_or_more_votes.htm | archive-date=May 31, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Having taken part in the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the union, Byrd was the last surviving senator to have voted on a bill granting [[U.S. state|statehood]] to a U.S. territory. At the time of Byrd's death, fourteen sitting or former members of the Senate had not been born when Byrd's tenure in the Senate began, President [[Barack Obama]] among them.

===Filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964===
[[File:Byrd meeting with Ford.jpg|thumb|right|Majority Whip Byrd meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]]]]
Byrd was a member of the wing of the Democratic Party that opposed federally-mandated desegregation and civil rights. However, despite his early career in the [[KKK]], Byrd was linked to such senators as [[John C. Stennis]], [[J. William Fulbright]] and [[George Smathers]], who based their segregationist positions on their view of [[states' rights]] in contrast to senators like [[James Eastland]], who held a reputation as a committed racist.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaufman |first=Burton Ira |date=2006 |title=The Carter Years |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIzooiFd6IoC&pg=PA170 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Facts On File |page=170 |isbn=978-0-8160-5369-8}}</ref>

=== Vietnam ===
In February 1968, Byrd questioned General [[Earle Wheeler]] during the latter's testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. During a White House meeting between President Johnson and congressional Democratic leaders on February 6, Byrd stated his concern for the ongoing [[Vietnam War]], citing the U.S.'s lack of intelligence, preparation, underestimating of the morale and vitality of the [[Viet Cong]], and overestimated how backed Americans would be by [[South Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Last Great Senator: Robert C.

===Leadership roles===
[[File:DemSenateLeadersDesk.jpg|thumb|right|Drawer of the Senate desk used by Democratic leaders, including Byrd]]

Byrd served in the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded [[George Smathers]] as secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> He unseated [[Ted Kennedy]] in 1971 to become [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|majority whip]], or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> Smathers recalled that, "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching [[Lyndon Johnson]]." Byrd himself had told Smathers that " I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life.

[[File:Byrd-stevens-supp-mark-web.jpg|thumb|right|Byrd with then-Senate president pro tempore [[Ted Stevens]] in 2003]]
In 1976, Byrd was the "favorite son" Presidential candidate in West Virginia's primary. His easy victory gave him control of the delegation to the Democratic National Convention. Byrd had the inside track as majority whip but focused most of his time running for majority leader, more so than for re-election to the Senate, as he was virtually unopposed for his fourth term. By the time the vote for majority leader came, his lead was so secure that his lone rival, Minnesota's [[Hubert Humphrey]], withdrew before the balloting took place. From 1977 to 1989 Byrd was the leader of the Senate Democrats, serving as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|majority leader]] from 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 1989, and as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|minority leader]] from 1981 to 1987.<ref name="CONG_BIO"/>

====Appropriations Committee====
Byrd was known for steering federal dollars to West Virginia, one of the country's poorest states. He was called the "King of [[pork barrel|Pork]]" by [[Citizens Against Government Waste]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Citizens Against Government Waste: Byrd Droppings |publisher=[[Citizens Against Government Waste]] |url=http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=news_byrddroppings |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709044348/http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=news_byrddroppings |archive-date=July 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After becoming chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] in 1989, Byrd set a goal securing a total of {{Nowrap|$1 billion}} for public works in the state. He passed that mark in 1991, and funds for highways, dams, educational institutions, and federal agency offices flowed unabated over the course of his membership. More than 30 existing or pending federal projects bear his name. He commented on his reputation for attaining funds for projects in West Virginia in August 2006, when he called himself "Big Daddy" at the dedication for the Robert C.

====Parliamentary expertise====
Byrd was also known for using his knowledge of [[parliamentary procedure]]. Byrd frustrated Republicans with his encyclopedic knowledge of the inner workings of the Senate, particularly prior to the [[Reagan Revolution]]. From 1977 to 1979 he was described as "performing a procedural tap dance around the minority, outmaneuvering Republicans with his mastery of the [[Rules of the United States Senate|Senate's arcane rules]]."<ref>{{cite news | author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg | title=DISPUTE IN THE SENATE: THE PLAYERS; Behind the Scenes, an Army of Senate Aides Takes On the Filibuster Fight | date=May 20, 2005 | work=The New York Times | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C13FD3F5D0C738EDDAC0894DD404482 | access-date=February 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520192426/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C13FD3F5D0C738EDDAC0894DD404482 | archive-date=May 20, 2013 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1988, majority leader Byrd [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|moved]] a [[Call of the house|call of the Senate]], which was adopted by the majority present, in order to have the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Sergeant-at-Arms]] arrest members not in attendance.

====President pro tempore====
As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd served as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] four times when his party was in the majority:<ref name="CONG_BIO"/> from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and outgoing Vice President [[Al Gore]] broke the tie in favor of the Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]] left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, as a result of the [[2006 United States Senate elections|2006 Senate elections]]. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]].

===Scholarships and TAH History Grants===
{{Main|Teachinghistory.org}}
In 1969, Byrd launched a Scholastic Recognition Award; he also began to present a savings bond to valedictorians from high schools—public and private—in West Virginia. In 1985 Congress approved the nation's only merit-based scholarship program funded through the [[U.S. Department of Education]], a program which Congress later named in Byrd's honor. The [[Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program]] initially comprised a one-year, $1,500 award to students with "outstanding academic achievement" who had been accepted at a college or university. In 1993, the program began providing four-year scholarships.<ref name="byrd_education"/>

In 2002 Byrd secured unanimous approval for a major national initiative to strengthen the teaching of "traditional American history" in K-12 public schools.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Miriam E.

===Senate historian===
[[File:Byrd baker book 1.jpg|thumb|right|Byrd and [[Richard A. Baker (historian)|Dr. Richard Baker]], the Senate historian]]
Television cameras were first introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on March 19, 1979, by [[C-SPAN]]. Unsatisfied that Americans only saw Congress as the House of Representatives, Byrd and others pushed to televise Senate proceedings to prevent the Senate from becoming the "invisible branch" of government, succeeding in June 1986.

To help introduce the public to the inner workings of the legislative process, Byrd launched a series of one hundred speeches based on his examination of the [[Roman Republic]] and the intent of the Framers. Byrd published a four-volume series on Senate history: ''The Senate: 1789–1989: Addresses on the History of the Senate''.<ref>
[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]], 1989–94</ref> The first volume won the Henry Adams Prize of the Society for History in the Federal Government as "an outstanding contribution to research in the history of the Federal Government." He also published ''The Senate of the Roman Republic: Addresses on the History of Roman Constitutionalism''.<ref>
Government Printing Office, 1995</ref>

In 2004, Byrd received the [[American Historical Association]]'s first [[Theodore Roosevelt]]-[[Woodrow Wilson]] Award for Civil Service; in 2007, Byrd received the [[Friend of History Award]] from the [[Organization of American Historians]]. Both awards honor individuals outside the academy who have made a significant contribution to the writing and/or presentation of history.

On February 26, 2009, Byrd was one of two Democrats to vote against the [[District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009]], which if it had become law would have added a voting seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for the [[District of Columbia]] and add a seat for [[Utah]], explaining that he supported the intent of the legislation, but regarded it as an attempt to solve with legislation an issue which required resolution with a Constitutional amendment.

===LGBT rights===
Byrd strongly opposed Clinton's 1993 efforts to allow gays to [[Don't ask, don't tell|serve in the military]] and supported efforts to limit [[gay marriage]]. In 1996, before the passage of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], he said, "The drive for same-sex marriage is, in effect, an effort to make a sneak attack on society by encoding this aberrant behavior in legal form before society itself has decided it should be legal. [...] Let us defend the oldest institution, the institution of marriage between male and female as set forth in the Holy Bible."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/11/us/senators-reject-both-job-bias-ban-and-gay-marriage.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title=Senators Reject Both Job-Bias Ban And Gay Marriage |first=Eric |last=Schmitt |date=September 11, 1996 |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520195051/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/11/us/senators-reject-both-job-bias-ban-and-gay-marriage.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date=May 20, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Despite his previous position, he later stated his opposition to the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] and argued that it was unnecessary because the states already had the power to ban gay marriages.<ref>

===Abortion===
On March 11, 1982, Byrd voted against a measure sponsored by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] that sought to reverse ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and allow Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortions. Its passing was the first time a congressional committee supported an anti-abortion amendment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/11/us/abortion-curbs-endorsed-10-7-by-senate-panel.html|title=Abortion Curbs Endorsed, 10–7, By Senate Panel|date=March 11, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927160058/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/11/us/abortion-curbs-endorsed-10-7-by-senate-panel.html|archive-date=September 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/28/magazine/howard-baker-trying-to-tame-an-unruly-senate.html|title=Howard Baker Trying to Tame an Unruly Senate|date=March 28, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927222009/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/28/magazine/howard-baker-trying-to-tame-an-unruly-senate.html|archive-date=September 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1995, Byrd voted against a ban on [[intact dilation and extraction]], a late-term abortion procedure typically referred to by its opponents as "partial-birth abortion".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/bill/2752/7841/53359/partial-birthlate-term-abortion-ban-act-of-1995#.Wx6UQUgvzIU|title=HR 1833 – Partial-Birth/Late-Term Abortion Ban – National Key Vote|website=votesmart.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612153302/https://votesmart.org/bill/2752/7841/53359/partial-birthlate-term-abortion-ban-act-of-1995#.Wx6UQUgvzIU|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2003, however, he voted for the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which prohibits intact dilation and extraction.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&session=1&vote=00402 |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 108th Congress – 1st Session |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001235535/http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&session=1&vote=00402 |archive-date=October 1, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Byrd also voted against the 2004 [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], which recognizes a "child in utero" as a legal victim if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of a crime of violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&session=2&vote=00063|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=January 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110133931/http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&session=2&vote=00063|archive-date=November 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Richard Nixon era ===
In April 1970, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] approved a plan to replace the Electoral College with direct elections of presidents. Byrd initially opposed direct elections on the key vote and was one of two senators to switch votes in favor of the proposal during later votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/24/archives/senate-unit-asks-popular-election-of-the-president-amendment-to.html|title=Senate Unit Asks Popular Election of the President|date=April 24, 1970|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816235805/https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/24/archives/senate-unit-asks-popular-election-of-the-president-amendment-to.html|archive-date=August 16, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1970, as the Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Supreme Court nominee [[Harry Blackmun]], Byrd stated that "no nomination should be voted on within 24 hours after the hearing" after the previous two Supreme Court nominees had delays and was one of the 17 committee members who went on record of assuring Blackmun's nomination would be reported favorably to the full Senate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/01/archives/senators-put-off-vote-on-blackmun-decision-by-judiciary-panel.html|title=Senators Put Off Vote on Blackmun|date=May 1, 1970|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914204906/https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/01/archives/senators-put-off-vote-on-blackmun-decision-by-judiciary-panel.html|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 1970, Byrd sponsored an amendment protecting members of Congress and those elected that have not yet assumed office. Byrd mentioned the 88 political assassinations in the United States and said state law was not adequate to handle the increase in political violence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/09/archives/rush-of-crime-bills-voted-by-senate-in-night-session-anticrime.html|title=Rush of Crime Bills Voted By Senate in Night Session|first=Marjorie|last=Hunter|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915001749/https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/09/archives/rush-of-crime-bills-voted-by-senate-in-night-session-anticrime.html|archive-date=September 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 1971, after [[Fred R. Harris]] and [[Charles Mathias]] requested the Senate Rules Committee change the rules to permit selection of committee chairmen on a basis aside from seniority, Byrd indicated through his line of questioning that he saw considerable value in the seniority system.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/13/archives/harris-and-mathias-ask-seniority-curb.html|title=Harris and Mathis Ask Seniority Curb|date=February 13, 1971|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919030423/https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/13/archives/harris-and-mathias-ask-seniority-curb.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1971, after Representative [[Hale Boggs]] stated that he had been tapped by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and called on FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to resign, Byrd opined that Boggs' imagination was involved and called on him to reveal any possible "good, substantial, bona fide evidence".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/08/archives/kleindienst-assails-boggs-invites-inquiry-into-fbi-us-aide-assails.html|title=Kleindienst Assails Boggs; Invites Inquiry Into F.B.I.|date=April 8, 1971|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

In April 1971, Byrd met with President Nixon, [[Hugh Scott]], and [[Robert P. Griffin]] for a briefing that after which Byrd, Scott, and Griffin asserted they had been told by Nixon of his intent to withdraw American forces from [[Indochina]] by a specific date. White House Press Secretary [[Ronald L. Ziegler]] disputed their claims by stating that the three had not been told anything by Nixon he had not mentioned in his speech the same day as the meeting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/09/archives/3-senators-aver-nixon-said-he-had-pullout-deadline-but-white-house.html|title=3 Senators Aver Nixon Said He Had Pullout Deadline|date=April 9, 1971|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915001955/https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/09/archives/3-senators-aver-nixon-said-he-had-pullout-deadline-but-white-house.html|archive-date=September 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1971, [[Jacob Javits]], Fred R. Harris, and [[Charles H. Percy]] circulated letters to their fellow senators in an attempt to gain cosponsors for a resolution to appoint the Senate's first girl pages. Byrd maintained that the Senate was ill-equipped for girl pages and was among those that cited the long hours of work, the carrying of sometimes heavy documents and the high crime rate in the Capitol area as among the reasons against it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/3-senators-press-girlpage-drive-resolution-barring-denial-of-job.html|title=3 SENATORS PRESS GIRL‐PAGE DRIVE|date=April 11, 1971|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919030357/https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/3-senators-press-girlpage-drive-resolution-barring-denial-of-job.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 1971, Representative [[Richard H. Poff]] was under consideration by President Nixon for a Supreme Court nomination, Byrd warning Poff that his nomination could be met with opposition by liberal senators and see a filibuster emerge. Within hours, Poff announced his declining of the nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/06/archives/senator-warned-poff-of-a-floor-battle.html|title=Senator Warned Poff of a Floor Battle|date=October 6, 1971|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813212040/https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/06/archives/senator-warned-poff-of-a-floor-battle.html|archive-date=August 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1972, Senate Majority Leader Mansfield announced that he had authorized Byrd to present an amendment to the Senate for a fixed deadline for total troop withdrawal that the Nixon administration would be obligated to meet and that the measure would serve as an amendment to the State Department‐United States Information Agency authorization bill.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/16/archives/new-senate-war-debate-seen-on-mansfield-pullout-measure.html|title=New Senate War Debate Seen On Mansfield Pullout Measure|date=April 16, 1972|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917034322/https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/16/archives/new-senate-war-debate-seen-on-mansfield-pullout-measure.html|archive-date=September 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1972, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination of [[Richard G. Kleindienst]] as [[United States Attorney General]], Byrd being one of four Democrats to support the nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/28/archives/senate-unit-114-again-approves-kleindienst-post-way-is-cleared-for.html|title=Senate Unit, 11–4, Again Approves Kleindienst Post|date=April 28, 1972|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> On June 7, Byrd announced that he would vote against Kleindienst, saying in a news release that this was Nixon's first nomination that he had not voted to confirm and that testimony at hearings investigating Kleindienst's tenure at the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation displayed "a show of arrogance and deception and insensitivity to the people's right to know."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/08/archives/top-democrat-asks-kleindienst-defeat.html|title=Top Democrat Asks Kleindienst Defeat|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 8, 1972|access-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813212206/https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/08/archives/top-democrat-asks-kleindienst-defeat.html|archive-date=August 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a May 1972 luncheon speech, Byrd criticized American newspapers for "an increasing tendency toward shoddy technical production" and observed that there was "a greater schism between the Nixon Administration and the media, at least publicly, than at any previous time in our history."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/31/archives/senator-scores-newspapers-for-shoddy-production.html|title=Senator Scores Newspapers For 'Shoddy' Production|date=May 31, 1972|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917034301/https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/31/archives/senator-scores-newspapers-for-shoddy-production.html|archive-date=September 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 1972, Byrd introduced a proposal supported by the Nixon administration that would make cutting off all funding for American hostilities in Indochina conditional upon agreement on an internationally supervised cease‐fire. Byrd and Nixon supporters argued modification would bring the amendment more in line with President Nixon's proposal to withdraw all American forces from Vietnam the previous week and it was approved in the Senate by a vote of 47 to 43.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/17/archives/senate-4743-adds-ceasefire-to-amendment-to-halt-the-war.html|title=Senate, 47‐43, Adds Cease‐Fire To Amendment to Halt the War|date=May 17, 1972|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917034353/https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/17/archives/senate-4743-adds-ceasefire-to-amendment-to-halt-the-war.html|archive-date=September 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 1972, [[Edward Brooke]] attempted to reintroduce his war ending amendment that had been defeated earlier in the week as an addendum to a clean drinking water bill when he discovered that Byrd had arranged a unanimous consent free agreement prohibiting amendments that were not relevant to the subject. Brooke charged the Byrd agreements with impairing his senatorial prerogatives to introduce amendments.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/29/archives/panel-resubmits-vetoed-hew-bill-seeks-to-make-nixon-pick-programs.html|title=PANEL RESUBMITS VETOED H.E.W.

During the 1972 general election campaign, Democratic nominee [[George McGovern]] advocated for partial amnesty for draft dodges. Byrd responded to the position in a November speech the day before the election without mentioning McGovern by name in saying, "How could we keep faith with the thousands of Americans we sent to Vietnam by giving a mere tap on the wrist to those who fled to Canada and Sweden?" Byrd said the welfare proposals were part of "pernicious doctrine that the Federal Government owes a living to people who don't want to work" and chastised individuals that had personal trips to Hanoi rather than official missions as "the Ramsey Clarks in our society who attempt to deal unilaterally with the enemy."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/07/archives/democratic-whip-criticizes-mcgovern-campaign-views.html|title=THE 1972 CAMPAIGN|date=November 7, 1972|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

In January 1973, the Senate passed legislation containing an amendment Byrd offered requiring President Nixon to give Congress an accounting of all funds that he had impounded and appropriated by February 5. Byrd stated that President Nixon had been required to submit reports to Congress and that he had not done so since June, leaving Congress in the dark on the matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/07/archives/senate-vote-calls-on-nixon-to-report-impounded-funds.html|title=Senate Vote Calls on Nixon To Report Impounded Funds|date=January 7, 1973|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094550/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/07/archives/senate-vote-calls-on-nixon-to-report-impounded-funds.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 1973, the Senate approved legislation requiring confirmation of the director and deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the White House in what was seen as "another battleground for the dispute between Congress and the White House over cuts in social spending programs in the current Federal budget and in the Nixon Administration's spending request for the fiscal year 1974, which begins next July 1". The legislation contained an amendment sponsored by Byrd limiting the budget officials to a maximum term of four years before having another confirmation proceeding. Byrd introduced another amendment that required all Cabinet officers be required to undergo reconfirmation by the Senate in the event that they are retained from one administration to another.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/06/archives/senate-votes-to-require-approval-of-budget-aides-move-to-seek.html|title=Senate Votes to Require Approval of Budget Aides|first=James M.|last=Naughton|date=February 6, 1973|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094547/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/06/archives/senate-votes-to-require-approval-of-budget-aides-move-to-seek.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 1973, Byrd led Senate efforts to reject a proposal that would have made most critical committee meetings open to the public, arguing that tampering with "the rides of the Senate is to tamper with the Senate itself" and argued against changing "procedures which, over the long past, have contributed to stability and efficiency in the operation of the Senate." The Senate voted down the proposal 47 to 38 on March 7.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/07/archives/senate-47-to-38-retains-a-limit-on-open-hearings-senate-retains.html|title=Senate, 47 to 38, Retains A Limit on Open Hearings|first=David E.|last=Rosenbaum|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919095945/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/07/archives/senate-47-to-38-retains-a-limit-on-open-hearings-senate-retains.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On May 2, 1973, the anniversary of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's death, Byrd called on President Nixon to appoint a permanent successor for Hoover.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/03/archives/hoover-anniversary-is-ignored-by-fbi.html|title=Hoover Anniversary Is Ignored by F.B.I.|date=May 3, 1973|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919095941/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/03/archives/hoover-anniversary-is-ignored-by-fbi.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 1973, Byrd sponsored a bill that would impose the first Tuesday in October as the date for all federal elections and mandate that states hold primary elections for federal elections between the first Tuesday in June and the first Tuesday in July. Senate Rules Committee approved the measure on June 13 and it was sent to the Senate floor for consideration.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/14/archives/panel-passes-bill-to-cut-campaigns.html|title=PANEL PASSES BILL TO CUT CAMPAIGNS|date=June 14, 1973|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919095929/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/14/archives/panel-passes-bill-to-cut-campaigns.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 1973, along with [[Lloyd Bentsen]], Mike Mansfield, [[John Tower]], and [[Jennings Randolph]], Byrd was one of five senators to switch their vote on the foreign military aid authorization bill to assure its passage after previously voting against it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/27/archives/senate-approves-military-aid-bill-votes-770million-after-rejecting.html|title=Senate Approves Military Aid Bill|date=June 27, 1973|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094532/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/27/archives/senate-approves-military-aid-bill-votes-770million-after-rejecting.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 1973, President Nixon vetoed the request of the United States Information Agency for $208 million for fiscal year 1974 on the grounds of a provision forcing the agency to provide any document or information demanded. Byrd introduced a bill identical to the one vetoed by Nixon the following month, differing in not containing the information provision as well as a ban on appropriating or spending more money than the annual budget called for, the Senate approving the legislation on November 13.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/14/archives/senate-approves-altered-usia-bill.html|title=Senate Approves Altered U.S.I.A.

In November 1973, after the Senate rejected an amendment to the [[National Energy Emergency Act]] intending to direct President Nixon to put gasoline rationing into effect on January 15, Byrd indicated the final vote not coming for multiple days.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/16/archives/senate-rejects-gas-deadline-blocks-bid-to-force-nixon-to-impose.html|title=Senate Rejects 'Gas' Deadline|date=November 16, 1973|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094608/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/16/archives/senate-rejects-gas-deadline-blocks-bid-to-force-nixon-to-impose.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 1974, the Senate confirmed [[John C. Sawhill]] as Federal Energy Administrator only to rescind the confirmation hours later, the direct result of [[James Abourezk]] wanting to speak out and vote against the nomination due to the Nixon administration's refusal to roll back crude oil prices. Abourezk confirmed that he had asked Byrd for notice of when he could assume the Senate floor to deliver his remarks.

In May 1974, the House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against President Nixon after the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides and the administration became engulfed in the scandal that would come to be known as [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]. That month, Byrd delivered a speech on the Senate floor opposing Nixon's potential resignation, saying it would serve only to convince the President's supporters that his enemies had driven him out of office: "The question of guilt or innocence would never be fully resolved. The country would remain polarized — more so than it is today. And confidence in government would remain unrestored." Most of the members of the Senate in attendance for the address were conservatives from both parties that shared opposition to Nixon being removed from office. Byrd was among multiple conservative senators who stated that they would not ask Nixon to resign.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/14/archives/leading-senators-refuse-to-press-nixon-on-quitting-conservatives-of.html|title=LEADING SENATORS REFUSE TO PRESS NIXON ON QUITTING|date=May 14, 1974|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928044005/https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/14/archives/leading-senators-refuse-to-press-nixon-on-quitting-conservatives-of.html|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that month, Republican attorney general [[Elliot L. Richardson]] termed Nixon "a law and order President who says subpoenas must he answered by everyone except himself," the comment being echoed by Byrd who additionally charged President Nixon with reneging on his public pledge that the independence of the special prosecutor to pursue the Watergate investigation would not be limited without the prior approval of a majority of Congressional leaders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/27/archives/bar-leader-urges-president-to-heed-justices-on-tapes-smith-says-he.html|title=BAR LEADER URGES PRESIDENT TO HEED JUSTICES ON TAPES|date=May 27, 1974|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928003354/https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/27/archives/bar-leader-urges-president-to-heed-justices-on-tapes-smith-says-he.html|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 29, Byrd met with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]], and Republican whip [[Robert P. Griffin]] in the first formality by Senate leaders on the matter of President Nixon's impeachment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/30/archives/senate-leaders-prepare-for-impeachment-trial-working-quietly.html|title=Senate Leaders Prepare|first=Richard L.|last=Madden|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203841/https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/30/archives/senate-leaders-prepare-for-impeachment-trial-working-quietly.html|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Byrd opposed Nixon being granted immunity. ''The New York Times'' noted that as [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]] [[George H. W.

===Gerald Ford era===
On November 22, 1974, the Senate Rules Committee voted unanimously to recommend the nomination of [[Nelson Rockefeller]] as [[Vice President of the United States]] to the full Senate. Byrd admitted that he had preferred sending the nomination with no recommendation but was worried the act would apply prejudice to the nominee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/23/archives/senate-panel-90-backs-rockefeller-for-confirmation-byrd-and-allen.html|title=SENATE PANEL,9‐0, BACKS ROCKEFELLER FORCONFIRMATION|date=November 23, 1974|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813213622/https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/23/archives/senate-panel-90-backs-rockefeller-for-confirmation-byrd-and-allen.html|archive-date=August 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 1975, after President Ford requested $300 million in additional military aid for South Vietnam and $222 million more for Cambodia from Congress, Byrd said Ford and Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] had described the aid as "imperative" and that congressional leaders had been told North Vietnam would take over Saigon "little by little" if additional ammunition and other aid were not provided by the US to Saigon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/29/archives/new-indochina-aid-is-asked-by-ford-president-formally-urges.html|title=NEW INDOCHINA AID IS ASKED BY FORD|date=January 29, 1975|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814040635/https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/29/archives/new-indochina-aid-is-asked-by-ford-president-formally-urges.html|archive-date=August 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In February, along with Mike Mansfield, [[Hugh Scott]], and [[Robert P.

==== Role in changes in Senate rules ====
On January 18, 1977, after the Senate established a special 15‐member committee to draw up a code of ethics for senators, Byrd and Senate Minority Leader [[Howard Baker]] announced their support for the resolution, Byrd adding that knowledge of the code of ethics being enacted in the Senate would be privy to the public, press, and members of the Senate.<ref name="nytimes1977"/> While eight of Carter's secretaries were confirmed within the first hours of his presidency, Byrd made an unsuccessful effort to secure a date and time limit for debate on the confirmation of [[F. Ray Marshall]], Carter's nominee for [[United States Secretary of Labor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/21/archives/10-carter-nominees-are-approved-but-action-is-delayed-on-others.html|title=10 Carter Nominees Are Approved, But Action Is Delayed on Others|date=January 21, 1977|first=Warren|last=Weaver, Jr.|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023159/https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/21/archives/10-carter-nominees-are-approved-but-action-is-delayed-on-others.html|archive-date=August 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between January and February 1979, Byrd proposed outlawing tactics frequently used to prevent him from bringing a bill to the floor for consideration. He stated the filibuster tactics gave the Senate a bad reputation and rendered it ineffective. His proposals initially earned the opposition of Republicans and conservative Democrats until there was a compromise for the reform package to be split and have the less objectionable part come up first for consideration. The Senate passed legislation curtailing tactics that had been used in the past to continue filibusters after cloture had been invoked on February 22.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/23/archives/senate-votes-to-cut-postcloture-debate-to-100-hours-proposal-still.html|title=Senate Votes to Cut Post‐Cloture Debate to 100 Hours|date=February 23, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094539/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/23/archives/senate-votes-to-cut-postcloture-debate-to-100-hours-proposal-still.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In March, Byrd negotiated an agreement that a proposed amendment was referred to the Judiciary Committee and would be reported by April 10.

==== Domestic issues ====
In October 1977, Byrd stated his refusal to authorize the Senate dropping consideration of the natural gas legislation under any circumstances, predicting the matter would be settled in the coming days as a result of conversations with colleagues he had the night before and a growing disillusion with filibusters in place of action on legislation. Byrd added that the deregulation bill would not become law due to it being identical to the Carter administration's proposal and President Carter's prior statement that he would veto deregulation bills.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/02/archives/byrd-vows-senate-will-vote-on-energy-despite-filibuster.html|title=Byrd Vows Senate Will Vote on Energy Despite Filibuster|date=October 2, 1977|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817124913/https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/02/archives/byrd-vows-senate-will-vote-on-energy-despite-filibuster.html|archive-date=August 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 1978, Byrd announced that he would not move to end a filibuster against the Carter administration's labor law revision bill until after the Memorial Day recess. The decision was seen as allowing wavering senators to not be cornered on their votes as lobbying efforts for both business and labor commenced and various opponents of the bill viewed Byrd's call as a sign of weakness toward the Carter administration. Byrd stated that his decision to wait was "to give ample time for debate on the measure" and that he was expecting the first petition to end the filibuster to come sometime following the Senate returning in June.<ref>{{cite news|title=Byrd Says He'll Postpone Action on Labor Filibuster|date=May 19, 1978|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>

==== Turkey ====
In July 1978, Byrd introduced and endorsed a proposal by [[George McGovern]] for an amendment to repeal the 42‐month‐old embargo on American military assistance for Turkey that also linked any future aid for that country to progress on a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem. The Senate approved the amendment in a vote of 57 to 42 as part of a $2.9 billion international security assistance bill. Byrd stated that every government in the NATO alliance except Greece favored repeal of the embargo.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/26/archives/senate-acts-to-lift-arms-ban-on-turks-but-adds-warning-help-tied-to.html|title=SENATE ACTS TO LIFT ARMS BAN ON TURKS, BUT ADDS WARNING|first=Graham|last=Hovey|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817124932/https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/26/archives/senate-acts-to-lift-arms-ban-on-turks-but-adds-warning-help-tied-to.html|archive-date=August 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 1979, Byrd stated that giving Turkey a grant should not be construed as retaliation against [[Greece]] and that aid for Turkey would improve Turkey's security in addition to that of Greece, NATO, and of American allies in the Middle East. Byrd mentioned his encouragement from the report on the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities agreeing to resume negotiations on the island's future as well as reports that progress was also being made on the reintegration of Greece into NATO. Byrd furthered that American military installations in Turkey were "of major importance in the monitoring of Soviet strategic activities" and would have "obvious significance" in the goal of verifying compliance by the Soviet Union with the strategic arms treaty. The Senate approved the Turkey grant, to Byrd's wishes, but against that of both President Carter and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/23/archives/senate-votes-to-make-50-million-for-turkey-a-grant-sarbanes-leads.html|title=Senate Votes to Make $50 Million for Turkey a Grant|first=Graham|last=Hovey|date=May 23, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919211709/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/23/archives/senate-votes-to-make-50-million-for-turkey-a-grant-sarbanes-leads.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Foreign policy ====
On February 2, 1978, Byrd and Minority Leader Baker invited all other senators to join them in sponsoring two amendments to the Panama Canal neutrality treaty, the two party leaders sending copies of amendments recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee the previous week.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/03/archives/byrd-and-baker-bid-colleagues-cosponsor-2-canal-amendments.html|title=Byrd and Baker Bid Colleagues Co‐Sponsor 2 Canal Amendments|date=February 3, 1978|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817124946/https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/03/archives/byrd-and-baker-bid-colleagues-cosponsor-2-canal-amendments.html|archive-date=August 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 1979, Byrd met with [[Deputy Prime Minister of China]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] for assurances by Deng that China hoped to unite Taiwan to the mainland by peaceful means and would fully respect "the present realities" on the island. Byrd afterward stated that his concern on the Taiwan question had been allayed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/31/archives/teng-on-capitol-hill-says-peking-must-keep-taiwan-options-open-teng.html|title=Teng, on Capitol Hill, Says Peking Must Keep Taiwan Options Open|date=January 31, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919133800/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/31/archives/teng-on-capitol-hill-says-peking-must-keep-taiwan-options-open-teng.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In June, Byrd opined that a decision by President Carter to not proceed with the new missile system would kill the strategic arms limitation treaty in the Senate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/11/archives/soviet-cautions-us-on-mx-deployment-but-commentary-in-pravda-gives.html|title=Soviet Cautions U.S. on MX Deployment|date=June 11, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094534/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/11/archives/soviet-cautions-us-on-mx-deployment-but-commentary-in-pravda-gives.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Byrd held meetings with Soviet leaders between July 3 to July 4.

Byrd noted that he was opposed to the treaty being "held hostage to the Cuban situation" as American interests could be harmed in the event the treaty was defeated solely due to Soviet troops being in Cuba.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/23/archives/byrd-says-arms-pact-could-still-be-acted-on-in-79.html|title=Byrd Says Arms Pact Could Still Be Acted on in '79|date=September 23, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919211702/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/23/archives/byrd-says-arms-pact-could-still-be-acted-on-in-79.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In November, Byrd admitted to complaining to President Carter about Senate leadership receiving only occasional briefings about the [[Iranian hostage crisis]] and that Carter had agreed to daily consultations for Minority Leader [[Howard Baker]], chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee [[Frank Church]], and ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee [[Jacob Javits]]. Byrd added that he did not disagree with the move by the Carter administration to admit [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] for hospitalization and that the same action would extend to "[[Ayatollah Khomeini]] himself if he were needing medical treatment and had a terminal illness."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/byrd-says-carter-agrees-to-consult-him-on-iran.html|title=Byrd Says Carter Agrees To Consult Him on Iran|date=November 18, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919211705/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/byrd-says-carter-agrees-to-consult-him-on-iran.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On December 3, Byrd told reporters that the Iranian hostage crisis was making the Senate uninhabitable for a debate on the strategic arms treaty, noting that a discussion could still occur before the Senate adjourned on December 21 but that he did not believe he would call up the opportunity even if granted the chance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/04/archives/iran-issue-detracts-from-arms-treaty-byrd-says-environment-in.html|title=IRAN ISSUE DETRACTS FROM ARMS TREATY|date=December 4, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920011000/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/04/archives/iran-issue-detracts-from-arms-treaty-byrd-says-environment-in.html|archive-date=September 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Days later, Byrd announced there was no chance that the Senate would take up debate on the strategic arms treaty that year while speaking to reporters, adding that he would see no harm in having the discussion on the treaty begin in January of the following year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/07/archives/byrd-sees-no-arms-debate-in-79.html|title=Byrd Sees No Arms Debate in '79|date=December 7, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919211429/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/07/archives/byrd-sees-no-arms-debate-in-79.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== 1980 Presidential election ====
In July 1979, Senators [[Henry M. Jackson]] and George McGovern made comments expressing doubt on President Carter being assured as the Democratic nominee in the 1980 Presidential election. When asked about their comments by a reporter, Byrd referred to Jackson and McGovern as "two very strong voices and not at all to be considered men who have little background in politics" but stated it was too early to participate in "writing the political obituary of the President at this point." Byrd added that the powers of the presidency made it possible that Carter could have a comeback and cited the events in November and December as being telling of his prospects of achieving higher popularity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/29/archives/byrd-says-its-too-soon-to-count-out-president.html|title=Byrd Says It's Too Soon To Count Out President|date=July 29, 1979|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919095928/https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/29/archives/byrd-says-its-too-soon-to-count-out-president.html|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September, Byrd said that Republican presidential nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] had made comments on the war between Iran and Iraq that were a disservice to the United States and that he was exercising "reckless political posturing" in foreign policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/09/28/archives/byrd-accuses-reagan-of-reckless-posturing-on-war-the-wrong-signal.html|title=Byrd Accuses Reagan of 'Reckless Posturing' on War; 'The Wrong Signal'|date=September 28, 1980|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817023138/https://www.nytimes.com/1980/09/28/archives/byrd-accuses-reagan-of-reckless-posturing-on-war-the-wrong-signal.html|archive-date=August 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== George H. W. Bush era ===
In early 1990, Byrd proposed an amendment granting special aid to coal miners who would lose their jobs in the event that Congress passed clean air legislation. Byrd was initially confident in the number of votes he needed to secure its passage being made available but this was prevented by a vote from Democrat [[Joe Biden]] who said the measure's passage would mean an assured veto by President Bush. Speaking to reporters after its defeat, Byrd stated his content with the results: "I made the supreme effort. I did everything I could and, therefore, I don't feel badly about it."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/us/senate-rejects-plan-on-aid-to-miners.html|title=Senate Rejects Plan on Aid to Miners|date=March 30, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525204355/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/us/senate-rejects-plan-on-aid-to-miners.html|archive-date=May 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-30/news/mn-193_1_clean-air-bill|title=Senate Kills Obstacle to Clean Air Bill Passage : Congress: Byrd's costly plan to aid coal miners is defeated on 50–49 vote after fierce White House lobbying.

Byrd was one of eleven senators to vote against the bill and said he "cannot vote for legislation that can bring economic ruin to communities throughout the Appalachian region and the Midwest."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/04/us/senators-approve-clean-air-measure-by-a-vote-of-89-11.html|title=Senators Approve Clean Air Measure by a Vote of 89–11|date=April 4, 1990|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826110448/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/04/us/senators-approve-clean-air-measure-by-a-vote-of-89-11.html|archive-date=August 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In August 1990, after the Senate passed its first major campaign finance reform bill since the Watergate era that would prevent political action committees from federal campaigns, lend public money into congressional campaigns and bestow candidates vouchers for television advertising, Byrd stated that he believed the bill would "end the money chase."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/02/us/senate-votes-to-curb-donations-from-outside-campaign-groups.html|title=Senate Votes to Curb Donations From Outside Campaign Groups|date=August 2, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=January 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105043610/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/02/us/senate-votes-to-curb-donations-from-outside-campaign-groups.html|archive-date=January 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Byrd authored an amendment to the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] that would bar the endowment from funding projects considered obscene such as depictions of sadomasochism, homo-eroticism, the sexual exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex acts while also requiring grant recipients to sign a pledge swearing their compliance with the restrictions. The October 1990 measure approved in the Senate was a bipartisan measure loosening government restrictions on art project funding and leaving courts to judge what art could be considered obscene.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/10/24/Senate-votes-to-loosen-NEA-restrictions/2112656740800/|title=Senate votes to loosen NEA restrictions|date=October 24, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914132056/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/10/24/Senate-votes-to-loosen-NEA-restrictions/2112656740800/|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

President Bush nominated [[Clarence Thomas]] for the Supreme Court. In October 1991, Byrd stated his support in the credibility of [[Anita Hill]]: "I believe what she said. I did not see on that face the knotted brow of satanic revenge. I did not see a face that was contorted with hate. I did not hear a voice that was tremulous with passion. I saw the face of a woman, one of 13 in a family of Southern blacks who grew up on the farm and who belonged to the church." Byrd questioned how members of the Senate could be convinced that Thomas would serve as an objective judge when he could refuse to watch Hill's testimony against him.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/16/us/the-thomas-nomination-senators-who-switched-tell-of-political-torment.html|title=THE THOMAS NOMINATION; Senators Who Switched Tell of Political Torment|date=October 16, 1991|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207025038/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/16/us/the-thomas-nomination-senators-who-switched-tell-of-political-torment.html|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 1992, the Senate turned down a Republican attempt sponsored by [[John McCain]] and [[Dan Coats]] to grant President Bush line-item veto authority and thereby be authorized to kill projects that he was opposed to, Byrd delivering an address defending congressional power over spending for eight hours afterward. The speech had been written by Byrd two years prior and he had at this point steered $1.5 billion to his state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/28/us/senate-rejects-a-line-item-veto.html|title=Senate Rejects a Line-Item Veto|date=February 28, 1992|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203345/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/28/us/senate-rejects-a-line-item-veto.html|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1992, there was an effort made to pass a constitutional amendment to ensure a balanced federal budget. Byrd called the amendment "a smokescreen that will allow lawmakers to claim action against the deficit while still postponing hard budgetary decision" and spoke to reporters on his feelings against the amendment being passed: "Once members are really informed as to the mischief this amendment could do, and the damage it could do to the country and to the Constitution. I just have faith that enough members will take a courageous stand against the amendment." The sponsor of the amendment, [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], admitted that Byrd's predicton was not off and that other senators speak "when the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee talks".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/03/us/byrd-predicts-senate-will-defeat-amendment-for-balanced-budget.html|title=Byrd Predicts Senate Will Defeat Amendment for Balanced Budget|date=June 3, 1992|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203852/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/03/us/byrd-predicts-senate-will-defeat-amendment-for-balanced-budget.html|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a June 1992 debate, Byrd argued in favor of the United States withdrawing accepting immigrants that did not speak English, the comment being a response to a plan from the Bush administration that would enable former Soviet states to receive American assistance and allow immigrants from a variety of countries to receive welfare benefits. Byrd soon afterward apologized for the comment and said they were due to his frustration over the federal government's inability to afford several essential services.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/27/us/remark-on-immigrants-brings-byrd-s-apology.html|title=Remark on Immigrants Brings Byrd's Apology|date=June 27, 1992|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914205330/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/27/us/remark-on-immigrants-brings-byrd-s-apology.html|archive-date=September 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Bill Clinton era ===
In February 1994, the Senate passed a $10 billion spending bill that would mostly be allocated to [[Los Angeles, California]] earthquake victims and military operations abroad. Bob Dole, [[John Kerry]], [[John McCain]], and [[Russ Feingold]] partnered together to persuade the Senate in favor of cutting back the deficit expense. Byrd raised a procedural point to derail an attempt by Dole that would approve $50 billion in spending cuts over the following five years. McCain proposed killing highway demonstration projects with a $203 million price tag, leading Byrd to produce letters written by McCain that the latter had sent to the Appropriations Committee in 1991 in an attempt to gather highway grants for his home state of [[Arizona]]. Byrd said that McCain "is very considerate of the taxpayers when it comes to financing projects in other states, but he supports such projects in his own state."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/11/us/senate-votes-a-quake-relief-measure.html|title=Senate Votes a Quake Relief Measure|date=February 11, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=October 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004111120/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/11/us/senate-votes-a-quake-relief-measure.html|archive-date=October 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2000, Byrd and [[John Warner]] sponsored a provision threatening to withdraw American troops from Kosovo, the legislation if enacted cutting off funds for troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, without Congressional consent. The language would have also withheld 25 percent of the money for Kosovo in the bill unless the assertion that European countries were living up to their promises to provide reconstruction money for the province was certified by President Clinton by July 15. Byrd argued that lawmakers had never approved nor debate whether American troops should be stationed in Kosovo. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the legislation in a vote of 23-to-3 that was said to reflect "widespread concern among lawmakers about an open-ended deployment of American soldiers".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/10/world/senators-seek-vote-in-congress-on-extending-kosovo-mission.html|title=Senators Seek Vote in Congress On Extending Kosovo Mission|date=May 10, 2000|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924145303/https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/10/world/senators-seek-vote-in-congress-on-extending-kosovo-mission.html|archive-date=September 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2000, Congress passed an amendment sponsored by Byrd diverting tariff revenues from the Treasury Department and instead allocating them to the industry complaining, the amount involved ranging from between $40 million and $200 million a year. The following month, Japan and the European Union led a group of countries in filing a joint complaint with the World Trade Organization to the law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/22/business/group-of-countries-protests-us-change-in-dumping-law.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=063675A65E2BB0248AADC957B886B076&gwt=pay|title=Group of Countries Protest U.S. Change in Dumping|date=December 22, 2000|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920085543/https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/22/business/group-of-countries-protests-us-change-in-dumping-law.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=063675A65E2BB0248AADC957B886B076&gwt=pay|archive-date=September 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===George W. Bush era===
Byrd praised the nomination of [[John G. Roberts]] to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]. Likewise, Byrd was one of four Democrats who supported the confirmation of [[Samuel Alito]] to replace retiring Associate Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]].<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm Roll Call Vote 109th Congress – 2nd Session (on the confirmation of Samuel Alito of New Jersey)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321194124/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm |date=March 21, 2017 }}, ''[[United States Senate]]'', January 31, 2006.

Like most Democrats, Byrd opposed Bush's tax cuts and his proposals to change the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] program.

Byrd opposed the 2002 [[Homeland Security Act]], which created the [[Department of Homeland Security]], stating that the bill ceded too much authority to the [[executive branch]].

On May 2, 2002, Byrd charged the White House with engaging in "sophomoric political antics", citing [[Homeland Security Advisor]] [[Tom Ridge]] briefing senators in another location instead of the Senate on how safe he felt the U.S. was.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/05/02/Byrd-White-House-pulling-stunts/89501020350467/|title=Byrd: White House pulling stunts|date=May 2, 2002|publisher=UPI|access-date=November 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042849/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/05/02/Byrd-White-House-pulling-stunts/89501020350467/|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

He also led the opposition to Bush's bid to win back the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress cannot amend, but lost overwhelmingly. In the 108th Congress, however, Byrd won his party's top seat on the new Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.

In July 2004, Byrd released The New York Times best-selling book ''Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency'', which criticized the Bush presidency and the [[war in Iraq]].

====Iraq War====

Byrd led a filibuster against the resolution granting [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] broad power to wage a [[preemptive war|"preemptive" war]] against Iraq, but he could not get even a majority of his own party to vote against [[cloture]].<ref>"[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/11/iraq.us/index.html Senate approves Iraq war resolution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030131/http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/11/iraq.us/index.html |date=October 16, 2015 }}" (October 11, 2002). CNN.</ref>

Byrd was one of the Senate's most outspoken critics of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

Byrd anticipated the difficulty of fighting an insurgency in Iraq, stating on March 13, 2003,

{{quote|If the United States leads the charge to war in the [[Persian Gulf]], we may get lucky and achieve a rapid victory. But then we will face a second war: a war to win the peace in Iraq. This war will last many years and will surely cost hundreds of billions of dollars. In light of this enormous task, it would be a great mistake to expect that this will be a replay of the 1991 war. The stakes are much higher in this conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2003march/byrd_speeches_2003march_list/byrd_speeches_2003march_list_2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825063856/http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2003march/byrd_speeches_2003march_list/byrd_speeches_2003march_list_2.html|archive-date=August 25, 2005 |title=Senator Byrd – Senate Speeches |publisher=Byrd.senate.gov |date=March 13, 2003 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref>}}

On March 19, 2003, when Bush ordered the invasion after receiving [[Iraq Resolution|congressional approval]], Byrd said,

{{quote|Today I weep for my country. I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned. Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten recrimination. Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to have succeeded in isolating ourselves.<ref>Byrd, Robert (March 23, 2003), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/23/usa.iraq2 Why I weep for my country] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201213158/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/23/usa.iraq2 |date=December 1, 2016 }}. ''The Observer''.</ref>}}

Byrd also criticized Bush for his speech declaring the "end of major combat operations" in Iraq, which Bush made on the [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']]. Byrd stated on the Senate floor,

{{quote|I do not begrudge his salute to America's warriors aboard the carrier Lincoln, for they have performed bravely and skillfully, as have their countrymen still in Iraq. But I do question the motives of a deskbound president who assumes the garb of a warrior for the purposes of a speech.<ref>Richard W. Stevenson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/us/aftereffects-the-president-white-house-clarifies-bush-s-carrier-landing.html AFTEREFFECTS: THE PRESIDENT; White House Clarifies Bush's Carrier Landing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128200512/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/us/aftereffects-the-president-white-house-clarifies-bush-s-carrier-landing.html |date=November 28, 2016 }}, ''The New York Times'' (May 7, 2003).</ref>}}

On October 17, 2003, Byrd delivered a speech expressing his concerns about the future of the nation and his unequivocal antipathy to Bush's policies. Referencing the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] children's tale ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'', Byrd said of the president: "the emperor has no clothes." Byrd further lamented the "sheep-like" behavior of the "cowed Members of this Senate" and called on them to oppose the continuation of a "war based on falsehoods."

In April 2004, Byrd mentioned the possibility of the Bush administration violating law by its failure to inform leadership in Congress midway through 2002 about its use of emergency anti-terror dollars to begin preparations for an invasion of Iraq. Byrd stated that he had never been told of a shift in money, a charge reported in the [[Bob Woodward]] book ''[[Plan of Attack]]'', and its validation would mean "the administration failed to abide by the law to consult with and fully inform Congress."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/21/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-byrd-questions-use-of-money-for-iraq.html|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; Byrd Questions Use Of Money for Iraq|date=April 21, 2004|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810144320/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/21/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-byrd-questions-use-of-money-for-iraq.html|archive-date=August 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Byrd accused the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] of stifling dissent:

{{quote|The right to ask questions, debate, and dissent is under attack. The drums of war are beaten ever louder in an attempt to drown out those who speak of our predicament in stark terms. Even in the Senate, our history and tradition of being the world's greatest deliberative body is being snubbed. This huge spending bill—{{Nowrap|$87 billion}}—has been rushed through this chamber in just one month. There were just three open hearings by the Senate Appropriations Committee on {{Nowrap|$87 billion}}—$87 for every minute since [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] was born—{{Nowrap|$87 billion}} without a single outside witness called to challenge the administration's line.}}

Of the more than 18,000 votes he cast as a senator, Byrd said he was proudest of his vote against the Iraq war resolution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/12/byrd.access/index.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=June 12, 2006 |accessdate=June 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706084002/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/12/byrd.access/index.html |archive-date=July 6, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Byrd also voted to tie a timetable for troop withdrawal to war funding.

====Gang of 14====
On May 23, 2005, Byrd was one of 14 senators<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rudin|first1=Ken|title=Judging Alito: The Gang of 14 Factor|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5080836|accessdate=June 29, 2016|publisher=NPR|date=January 4, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816174105/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5080836|archive-date=August 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> (who became known as the "[[Gang of 14]]") to forge a compromise on the judicial [[filibuster]], thus securing up and down votes for many judicial nominees and ending the threat of the so-called [[Nuclear option (filibuster)|nuclear option]] that would have eliminated the filibuster entirely. Under the agreement, the senators retained the power to filibuster a judicial nominee in only an "extraordinary circumstance." It ensured that the [[appellate court]] nominees ([[Janice Rogers Brown]], [[Priscilla Owen]] and [[William H. Pryor Jr.|William Pryor]]) would receive votes by the full Senate.

===Other votes===
In 1977, Byrd was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of [[F. Ray Marshall]] as [[United States Secretary of Labor]]. Marshall was opposed by conservatives in both parties because of his pro-labor positions, including support for repealing [[Right-to-work law|right to work laws]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/27/archives/senate-rollcall-vote-approving-marshall.html|title=Senate Roll‐Call Vote Approving Marshall|date=January 27, 1977|access-date=March 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319152949/https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/27/archives/senate-rollcall-vote-approving-marshall.html|archive-date=March 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Marshall was confirmed and served until the end of Carter's term in 1981.

In February 1981, as the Senate voted on giving final approval to the $50 billion increase in the [[debt limit]], Democrats initially opposed the measure as part of an effort to elicit the highest number of Republicans in support of the measure. Byrd proceeded to give a signal for Democrats that saw caucus members switch their votes in support of the increase.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/07/us/senate-votes-raise-in-us-debt-ceiling.html|title=SENATE VOTES RAISE IN U.S. DEBT CEILING|first=Martin|last=Tolchin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 7, 1981|access-date=September 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923052509/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/07/us/senate-votes-raise-in-us-debt-ceiling.html|archive-date=September 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

President Reagan was injured during an assassination attempt in March 1981. Following the shooting, Byrd opined that the aftermath of the attempt had proven there were "holes that need to be plugged" in the constitution's handling of the presidential line of succession after a president's disability and stated his intent to introduce legislation calling for a mandatory life sentence for anyone attempting to assassinate a president, vice president, or member of Congress.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/06/us/byrd-sees-a-need-to-alter-rules-on-succession-to-the-presidency.html|title=Byrd Sees a Need to Alter Rules On Succession to the Presidency|date=April 6, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923052822/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/06/us/byrd-sees-a-need-to-alter-rules-on-succession-to-the-presidency.html|archive-date=September 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 1981, during a Capitol Hill interview, Byrd stated that the Reagan administration was promoting an economic package with assumptions for the national economy that might take a year for the public to see its difficulties and thereby lead to a political backlash. Byrd contented that President Reagan would win approval by Congress of $35 to $40 billion of the $48 billion in proposed budget cuts while having more difficulty in passing his tax-cut package, asserting Democratic opposition and some Republicans having misgivings about the approach as the reason Congress would block the plan and furthering that he would be surprised if a one-year cut in rates lasted more than year. Byrd opined that it was time for "some tax reform" that would see loopholes closed for the rich dropped to bring in revenues and expressed belief in the likelihood of the administration dismantling existing energy programs: "Energy programs are not as catchy now as budget cuts. But if the gas lines begin to form again, or the overseas oil gets cut off, we will have lost the time, the momentum, the money. Basically, they have a wholesale dismantlement of the energy programs we spent several years creating around here."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/14/us/byrd-calls-reagan-fiscal-plan-rosy-and-sees-tax-cut-held-to-one-year.html|title=BYRD CALLS REAGAN FISCAL PLAN 'ROSY' AND SEES TAX CUT HELD TO ONE YEAR|date=March 14, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923052820/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/14/us/byrd-calls-reagan-fiscal-plan-rosy-and-sees-tax-cut-held-to-one-year.html|archive-date=September 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 1981, during a news conference, Byrd stated that the Reagan administration had not established a coherent foreign policy. He credited conflicting statements from administration officials with having contributed to confusion in Western European capitals. Byrd also said, "We've seen these statements, and backing and filling, and the secretary of state has been kept pretty busy explaining and denying assertions and pronouncements by others, which indeed indicate that the administration has not yet got its foreign policy act together."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/23/Senate-Democratic-leader-Robert-Byrd-says-no-one-is/5454354171600/|title=Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd says no one is...|date=March 23, 1981|publisher=UPI|access-date=September 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926130731/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/23/Senate-Democratic-leader-Robert-Byrd-says-no-one-is/5454354171600/|archive-date=September 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 1981, Byrd announced his support for the Reagan administration's proposed budget for the fiscal year 1982 during a weekly news conference, citing that the "people want the President to be given a chance with his budget." Byrd added that he did not believe a balanced budget would be achieved by 1984, calling the budget "a balanced budget on paper only, made up of juggled figures produced out of thin air", and charged the administration with making assumptions, his comments being seen as an indication that little opposition would amount from the Democrats to the Reagan budget.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/us/despite-doubts-byrd-will-back-reagan-s-budget.html|title=DESPITE DOUBTS, BYRD WILL BACK REAGAN'S BUDGET|date=May 3, 1981|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813190348/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/us/despite-doubts-byrd-will-back-reagan-s-budget.html|archive-date=August 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 1981, as Senate leaders rejected the request of Senator [[Harrison A.

In February 1982, Byrd wrote a letter to President Reagan urging him to "withdraw the Administration's proposed fiscal 1983 budget, and resubmit a budget that provides for much lower deficits and makes use of more realistic assumptions", recalling his previous appeal to President Carter in 1980 amid the rise of soaring inflation rates and Carter afterward consulting with Democrats in Congress. Byrd stated that he was in favor of "a document we in Congress can work with, one based on realistic assumptions, one which shows a much clearer trend toward a balanced budget." Byrd had cautious praise for a proposal by Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] called for a freeze on all benefit programs with the exception of food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid in addition to a freeze on military spending while eliminating a pay increase for federal employees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/us/byrd-asks-president-to-resubmit-his-1983-budget.html|title=BYRD ASKS PRESIDENT TO RESUBMIT HIS 1983 BUDGET|date=February 11, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923052640/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/us/byrd-asks-president-to-resubmit-his-1983-budget.html|archive-date=September 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 1982, Byrd announced he would introduce an amendment to the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]] that would bar the president from being able to send combat troops to El Salvador without the approval of Congress. Byrd described the proposal as only allowing the president to act with independence in the event that Americans needed to evacuate El Salvador or if the United States was attacked. "It is my view that if Americans are to be asked to shed their blood in the jungles of El Salvador, all Americans should first have an opportunity to debate and carefully evaluate that action."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/world/byrd-seeking-to-bar-us-combat-troops-from-salvador-war.html|title=Byrd Seeking to Bar U.S. Combat Troops from Salvador War|date=March 7, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=August 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813111854/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/world/byrd-seeking-to-bar-us-combat-troops-from-salvador-war.html|archive-date=August 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

By March 1982, along with Alan Cranston, Byrd was one of two senators supporting both the measure sponsored by Henry M. Jackson and [[John W. Warner]] calling upon the United States and the Soviet Union to freeze their nuclear arsenals at "equal and sharply reduced levels" and the bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy and [[Mark Hatfield]] calling upon the two countries first to negotiate a freeze on nuclear forces at existing levels before following atomic arms reduction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/world/58-senators-back-alternative-plan-on-nuclear-arms.html|title=58 SENATORS BACK ALTERNATIVE PLAN ON NUCLEAR ARMS|first=Judith|last=Miller|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 31, 1982|access-date=September 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923052817/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/world/58-senators-back-alternative-plan-on-nuclear-arms.html|archive-date=September 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 1983, after President Reagan said during his [[1983 State of the Union Address]] that he hoped for the same bipartisan support that had produced the Social Security recommendations would lead Congress during the year on other issues, Byrd and House Majority Leader [[Jim Wright]] assailed the unfairness of a six-month delay in the cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients during a period of letting the wealthy reap the benefits of the general income tax cut for a third year. Byrd stated that he did not "want a six-month delay in Social Security while leaving in place the third year of the tax cut for upper-income people" and stated that Reagan's speech had been "'rhetorically good, but substantively lacking in measures that would deal now with the crises that millions of people are experiencing."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/us/democrats-say-any-pension-shift-should-mean-a-change-in-tax-cut.html|title=DEMOCRATS SAY ANY PENSION SHIFT SHOULD MEAN A CHANGE IN TAX CUT|first=Martin|last=Tolchin|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923235552/https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/us/democrats-say-any-pension-shift-should-mean-a-change-in-tax-cut.html|archive-date=September 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the beginning of February 1983, House Democrats committed themselves "to an emergency economic assistance program that would create public service jobs, provide shelter and soup kitchens for the destitute and avert foreclosures of homes and farms." Concurrently, Byrd pledged to work with the House Democrats in developing legislation concerning jobs, proposing $5 to $10 billion be spent and introducing legislation intended to form a national investment corporation that would assist with underwriting faltering basic industries and starting new ones in areas of high unemployment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/02/us/all-house-democratic-chiefs-ask-emergency-jobs-and-aid-program.html|title=ALL HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CHIEFS ASK EMERGENCY JOBS AND AID PROGRAM|date=February 2, 1983|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924000838/https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/02/us/all-house-democratic-chiefs-ask-emergency-jobs-and-aid-program.html|archive-date=September 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 1984, Byrd voted against a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing periods in public school for silent prayer,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/16/us/senate-vote-on-school-prayer.html|title=SENATE VOTE ON SCHOOL PRAYER|date=March 16, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315003710/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/16/us/senate-vote-on-school-prayer.html|archive-date=March 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and in favor of President Reagan's unsuccessful proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized school prayer in public schools.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/us/amendment-drive-on-school-prayer-loses-senate-vote.html|title=AMENDMENT DRIVE ON SCHOOL PRAYER LOSES SENATE VOTE|date=March 21, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070445/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/us/amendment-drive-on-school-prayer-loses-senate-vote.html|archive-date=March 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-school-prayer.html|title=SENATE'S ROLL-CALL ON SCHOOL PRAYER|date=March 21, 1984|access-date=March 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315005350/https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-school-prayer.html|archive-date=March 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 1984, Byrd was one of five Democrats to vote against the [[Lawton Chiles]] proposal to cease MX production for a year during study in search of a smaller and single-warhead missile. The 48 to 48 tie was broken by then-Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/14/The-49-48-vote-by-which-the-Senate-tabled-a/8470456033600/|title=The 49–48 vote by which the Senate tabled a...|date=June 14, 1984|publisher=UPI|access-date=March 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105610/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/14/The-49-48-vote-by-which-the-Senate-tabled-a/8470456033600/|archive-date=March 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 1986, Byrd endorsed the death penalty for some drug pushers in anti-drug legislation that would order President Reagan to end drug trafficking within 45 days through using the military as a means of intercepting smugglers, and imposing the death penalty on those pushers who intentionally cause a death as part of their operations while providing funding for prevention, drug abuse treatment, and anti-drug laws enforcement that was estimated to cost $3 to $4 billion over three years. Byrd admitted that calling for the death penalty seemed harsh, but cautioned that children in some cases had their entire lives destroyed through using drugs and that Congress had been soft for too long without seeing a change in results.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/09/12/Reagan-Byrd-endorse-death-penalty-in-anti-drug-law/7457526881600/|title=Reagan, Byrd endorse death penalty in anti-drug law|date=September 12, 1986|publisher=UPI|access-date=September 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926205852/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/09/12/Reagan-Byrd-endorse-death-penalty-in-anti-drug-law/7457526881600/|archive-date=September 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 1986, Byrd announced that the Senate would convene a Watergate-type select committee to investigate the [[Iran-Contra affair]] the following year and that he had reached an agreement with Bob Dole for the committee to have six Democrats and five Republicans. Byrd and Dole disagreed on whether it was a necessity for Congress to be launched into a special session that month for the purpose of getting the investigative process moving. Naming members during December enabled participants to informally move ahead by selecting the staff and be prepared before the [[100th United States Congress]] began.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-04/news/mn-1429_1_watergate|title=Senate Will Convene Watergate-Style Panel|date=December 4, 1986|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

In September 1988, in response to charges by Vice President Bush's presidential campaign that Democratic nominee [[Michael Dukakis]] was weak on defense, Byrd delivered a Senate speech in which he said that the Reagan administration "is living in a glass house when it throws a stone at the Democratic Party for its so-called Disneyland defense policies" and that the U.S. land-based missiles had grown in vulnerability due to the administration being "unable to produce an acceptable solution to make our missiles survivable." Byrd furthered, "Indeed, the Fantasyland exhibits of this White House's Defense Disneyland are loaded with the rejected systems that have been developed and discarded. If anything deserves the names 'Goofy' and 'Daffy' and 'Mickey Mouse,' it is those' basing proposals."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/09/14/Byrd-Reagan-missile-plans-goofy/4310590212800/|title=Byrd: Reagan missile plans 'goofy'|date=September 14, 1988|publisher=UPI|access-date=September 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926205753/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/09/14/Byrd-Reagan-missile-plans-goofy/4310590212800/|archive-date=September 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 1990, Byrd and [[James A. McClure]] served as floor managers for the appropriation bill for the [[National Endowment of the Arts]], accepting an amendment by [[Jesse Helms]] prohibiting NEA support of work denigrating objects or beliefs of religions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-25/news/mn-4234_1_national-endowment|title=Senate Defeats Attempts by Helms to Cut Art Funding : Congress: A proposal to relax current restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts passes easily|date=October 25, 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603181717/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-25/news/mn-4234_1_national-endowment|archive-date=June 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 1993, when the Senate voted to seek federal court enforcement of a subpoena for the diaries of [[Bob Packwood]], Byrd stated the possibility of Americans becoming convinced that the Senate was delaying taking action to protect one of its own members. Byrd also called for Packwood to resign. "None of us is without flaws. But when those flaws damage the institution of the Senate, it is time to have the grace to go!"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-03/news/mn-52654_1_ethics-panel|title=Senate Votes for Subpoena of Full Packwood Diaries : Politics: Lopsided ballot lets ethics panel seek access to memoirs.

In October 1999, Byrd was the only senator to vote present on the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/world/defeat-treaty-overview-senate-kills-test-ban-treaty-crushing-loss-for-clinton.html|title=DEFEAT OF A TREATY: THE OVERVIEW; SENATE KILLS TEST BAN TREATY IN CRUSHING LOSS FOR CLINTON; EVOKES VERSAILLES PACT DEFEAT|first=Eric|last=Schmitt|date=October 14, 1999|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414172505/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/world/defeat-treaty-overview-senate-kills-test-ban-treaty-crushing-loss-for-clinton.html|archive-date=April 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/oct99/senate14.htm|title=Senate Rejects Test Ban Treaty|date=October 14, 1999|first=Helen|last=Dewar|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=March 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227153749/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/oct99/senate14.htm|archive-date=February 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Byrd opposed the [[Flag Desecration Amendment]], saying that, while he wanted to protect the [[American flag]], he believed that amending the Constitution "is not the most expeditious way to protect this revered symbol of our Republic." As an alternative, Byrd cosponsored the [[Flag Protection Act of 2005]] (S. 1370), a bill to prohibit destruction or desecration of the flag by anyone trying to incite violence or causing a breach of the peace, or who steals, damages, or destroys a flag on federal property, whether owned by the federal government or a private group or individual—can be imprisoned, fined or both. The bill did not pass.

In 2009, Byrd was one of three Democrats to oppose the confirmation of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Timothy Geithner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531082810/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00015 |archive-date=May 31, 2010 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote|publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}</ref> After missing nearly two months while in hospital, Byrd returned to the Senate floor on July 21 to vote against the elimination of funding for the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22]] fighter plane.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/07/sen_byrd_back_on_the_senate_fl.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | title=Sen.

On July 1, 2010, Byrd [[lay in repose]] on the [[Lincoln Catafalque]] in the Senate chamber of the [[United States Capitol]], becoming the first senator to do so since 1957.

Multiple political figures issued statements following Byrd's death:<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/28/usa-congress-byrd-reaction-idUSN2826562320100628 | work=Reuters | title=Factbox-Reaction to death of U.S. Senator Byrd | date=June 28, 2010 | access-date=July 1, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030132/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/28/usa-congress-byrd-reaction-idUSN2826562320100628 | archive-date=October 16, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>
* Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]: "It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest-serving member, he was its heart and soul. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://observer.com/2010/06/hillary-clinton-remembers-friend-and-mentor-robert-byrd/ | newspaper=Observer.com | title=Hillary Clinton Remembers 'Friend and Mentor' Robert Byrd | date=June 28, 2010 | access-date=July 21, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611082236/https://observer.com/2010/06/hillary-clinton-remembers-friend-and-mentor-robert-byrd/ | archive-date=June 11, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>
* Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) [[Joe Biden]]: "A very close friend of mine, one of my mentors, a guy who was there when I was a 29-year-old kid being sworn into the United States Senate. Shortly thereafter, a guy who stood in the rain, in the pouring rain, freezing rain outside a church as I buried my daughter and my wife before I got sworn in ... We lost the dean of the United States Senate, but also the state of West Virginia lost its most fierce advocate and, as I said, I lost a dear friend."
* [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Chris Dodd]]: "He [Robert Byrd] never stopped growing as a public official, and was a man who learned from his mistakes. He was more than a friend and colleague. He was a mentor to me and literally hundreds of legislators with whom he served over the past five decades."
* [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Lindsey Graham]]: "Senator Byrd was a valuable ally and worthy opponent. He will be viewed by history as one of the giants of the Senate."
* Republican senator [[Orrin Hatch]]: "On the issues, we were frequent opponents, but he was always gracious both in victory and defeat. This is a man who earned his law degree while serving in the Senate, and who had a prodigious knowledge of ancient and modern history."
* [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]: "He [Robert Byrd] was as much a part of the Senate as the marble busts that line its chamber and its corridors. His profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something I appreciated greatly as a young senator."
* [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Republican leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]]: "Senator Byrd combined a devotion to the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate. We will remember him for his fighter's spirit, his abiding faith, and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes."
* [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]]: "Throughout his historic career in the House and Senate, he never stopped working to improve the lives of the people of West Virginia. While some simply bore witness to history, Senator Byrd shaped it and strove to build a brighter future for us all."
* Fellow Democratic senator from West Virginia [[Jay Rockefeller]]: "Senator Byrd came from humble beginnings in the southern coalfields, was raised by hard-working West Virginians, and triumphantly rose to the heights of power in America. But he never forgot where he came from nor who he represented, and he never abused that power for his own gain."

==In popular culture==
Byrd had a prominent role in the 2008 [[Warner Bros.]] documentary ''[[Body of War]]'' directed by [[Phil Donahue]]. The film chronicles the life of Tomas Young, paralyzed from the chest down after a sniper shot him as he was riding in a vehicle in Iraq. Several long clips of Byrd show him passionately arguing against authorizing the use of force in Iraq. Later in the movie, Byrd has a one-on-one interview with Tomas Young in Byrd's Senate office, followed by a shot of Byrd walking beside the Young as they leave the Capitol.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

A fictionalized version of Byrd, then the Senate Majority Leader, was a character in the [[Jeffrey Archer]] novel ''[[Shall We Tell the President?]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Byrd was an avid [[violin|fiddle]] player for most of his life, starting in his teens when he played in various square dance bands. Once he entered politics, his fiddling skills attracted attention and won votes. In 1978 when Byrd was majority leader, he recorded an album called ''U.S. Senator Robert Byrd: Mountain Fiddler'' (County, 1978). Byrd was accompanied by [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] [[Doyle Lawson]], James Bailey, and [[Spider Gilliam]]. Most of the LP consists of bluegrass music. Byrd covers "Don't Let Your Sweet Love Die", a [[Zeke Manners]] song, and "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]". He had performed at the [[Kennedy Center]], on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and on ''[[Hee Haw]]''. He occasionally took a break from Senate business to entertain audiences with his fiddle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He stopped playing in 1982 when the symptoms of a benign [[essential tremor]] had begun to affect the use of his hands.<ref>

Byrd appeared in the Civil War movie ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' in 2003 along with then-Virginia senator [[George Felix Allen|George Allen]]. Both played [[General officers in the Confederate States Army|Confederate States officers]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Sean Loughlin and Robert Yoon, CNN Washington Bureau|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/02/21/movie.lawmakers|title='Gods and Generals'—and Congress|publisher=CNN|date=February 21, 2003|accessdate=June 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424193415/http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/02/21/movie.lawmakers/|archive-date=April 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>
