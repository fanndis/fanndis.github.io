'''Blas Fajardo Ople''' (February 3, 1927 – October 14, 2003)<!--Per MOS, full dates in infobox need not be repeated in lede--> was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[journalist]] and [[politician]] who held several high-ranking positions in the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|executive]] and [[Congress of the Philippines|legislative]] branches of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]], including as [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] from 1999 to 2000, and as [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] from 2002 until his death. Perceived as a [[Left-wing nationalism|leftist-nationalist]] at the onset of his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited [[United States]] military presence in the Philippines, and for American initiatives in the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]] including the [[Iraq War|2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]].

Ople's most enduring role was his nineteen years as Secretary (later Minister) of [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]] during the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], when Philippine [[Labour law|labor laws]] were overhauled through the enactment of the [[Labor Code of the Philippines]] that he had helped author.

==Early life and career==
Ople was born in [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]], [[Bulacan]] on February 3, 1927 to Felix Antonio Ople, a [[artisan|craftsman]] who repaired boats, and his wife Segundina Fajardo. He graduated valedictorian of his grade school class at the Hagonoy Elementary School in 1941. Upon the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)|invasion of the Philippines]] by [[Japan]] during [[World War II]], he also had been to Hagonoy Institute during his secondary schooling, the teenage Ople joined the guerilla movement and fought under the Del Pilar Regiment and the Buenavista Regiment of the Bulacan Military Area founded by [[Alejo Santos]].<ref name=sbio1>{{cite web |title=Biography of Senate President Blas Ople |url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/senpres/ople.asp |publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]] |work=Official Website of the Senate of the Philippines |accessdate=April 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317190832/http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/senpres/ople.asp |archivedate=March 17, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1948, he finished his high school studies at the [[Far Eastern University|Far Eastern University High School]] in [[Manila]]. He worked towards a degree in [[liberal arts]] at the Educational Center of Asia (formerly [[Manuel L. Quezon University|Quezon College]]) in [[Manila]]. After graduation, Ople pursued a career in [[journalism]]. He became a desk editor at the ''Daily Mirror'' and the author of its ''Jeepney Tales'' column. Still in his twenties, Ople was one of the youngest newspaper columnists of that era.<ref name=sbio1/> Ople also established a [[public relations]] consulting firm.<ref name=sbio1/>

He soon became known for his [[nationalism|nationalist]] views. He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s.<ref name=sbio1/> In 1953, he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement, a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of [[Ramon Magsaysay]], heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a [[speechwriter]] for candidates of the [[Nacionalista Party]].<ref name=sbio1/><ref>{{cite news|author=Alfredo G. Rosario |title=Little known Ople anecdotes |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/jan/31/yehey/opinion/20080131opi5.html |publisher=Manila Times |date=January 31, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> After Magsaysay's election, he joined the government as special assistant to the Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs.

==Secretary of Labor==
In 1965, Ople was appointed as Social Security Commissioner by President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]. In 1967, he was appointed Secretary of Labor and Employment (in 1978 the position was renamed Minister of Labor and Employment). He resigned briefly in 1971 to run an unsuccessful campaign for election to the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]], but was re-appointed to his post in 1972, retaining the position until 1986.  At the time of his appointment, Ople was perceived as a "[[Left-wing nationalism|leftist Nationalist]]".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Third Philippine Republic: 1946–1972 |last=Gleeck, Jr. |first=Lewis E. |year=1993 |publisher=New Day Publishers |location=[[Quezon City]] |isbn=971-10-0473-9 |pages= 346}}</ref> His leftist credentials were enhanced when he co-founded, in 1972, the ''Philippine-Soviet Friendship Society''.<ref>Gleeck, Jr., p. 387</ref>

As Labor Secretary Ople was instrumental in the framing of the [[Labor Code of the Philippines]], which [[Philippine legal codes|codified]] the labor laws of the country and introduced innovations such as prohibiting the [[Termination of employment|termination of workers]] without legal cause. Ople instituted labor policies institutionalizing the technical education of workers. In 1976, Ople initiated a program for the overseas employment of Filipino workers. It was during his tenure at Labor that the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration were created.<ref name=sbio1/> Ople obtained recognition from the [[International Labour Organization]] during his stint as Labor Minister. In 1975, he was elected president of the 60th International Labour Conference of the ILO, the first Filipino to hold that post. In 1983, that organization awarded Ople a Gold Medal of Appreciation.<ref name=sbio1/> He was a close adviser of President Marcos, though he was not later to be associated with the corruption of the Marcos' government and was  perceived as "not corrupt".<ref name=time>{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |title=Eulogy: Blas Ople |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,565986,00.html |publisher=Time Magazine |date=December 20, 2003 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> He created international headlines in December 1984 when he admitted to the press that the [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]]-stricken Marcos was incapacitated to the point of being unable "to take major initiatives", and that the President's illness had placed the Philippines in "a kind of [[interregnum]]".<ref name=time/><ref>{{cite news |title=Aide Confirms Illness of Marcos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/04/world/aide-confirms-illness-of-marcos.html?sec=health |work=New York Times |date=December 4, 1984 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> Marcos responded a few days later by baring his chest to his Cabinet before television cameras to dispel rumors that he was seriously ill or had undergone surgery.<ref>{{cite news |author=Henry Giniger |author2=Milt Freudenheim |title=Marcos Fights Illness Rumors|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/09/weekinreview/the-world-marcos-fightsillness-rumors.html?sec=health |work=New York Times |date=December 9, 1984 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref>
  
In 1978, Ople was elected an Assemblyman of the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] representing [[Central Luzon]], and  reelected in 1984. During the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 presidential elections]], Ople served as a political [[campaign manager]] of President Marcos, who was running against [[Corazon Aquino]]. Shortly before the outbreak of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 People Power Revolution]], Marcos dispatched Ople to [[Washington, D.C.]] to lobby the American government on behalf of the President. Ople was in Washington D.C. upon the outbreak of the revolt, and was advised  by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]], [[George P. Shultz]], to call on Marcos to resign.<ref>{{cite book |last=Karnow |first=Stanley |authorlink=Stanley Karnow |title=[[In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines]] |year=1989 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=0-345-32816-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/inourimageameric00karn/page/420 420] }}</ref> Ople publicly reiterated his support for Marcos in the American media in such fora as on ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with David Brinkley]]''.

==1986 Constitutional Commission Member==
Following the success of the People Power Revolution and the installation to the presidency of [[Corazon Aquino]], Ople was relieved of his Cabinet post. Ople returned to the Philippines and immediately attempted to position himself as the leader of the political opposition against Aquino.<ref>{{cite news |author=Leslie Gelb |title=Problems Already Popping Up; Ex-Marcos Cabinet Official Hopes to Lead Opposition (pay site) |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F5071EFD3D5D0C748EDDAB0894DE484D81&scp=32&sq=Blas+Ople&st=nyt |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723015545/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F5071EFD3D5D0C748EDDAB0894DE484D81&scp=32&sq=Blas+Ople&st=nyt |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |work=New York Times |date=February 27, 1986 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> Nonetheless in May 1986, Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the [[Constitution of the Philippines#Background of the 1987 Constitution|Constitutional Commission]] that drafted a [[Constitution of the Philippines|new Philippine Constitution]].<ref name=sbio1/>

In the [[1987 Philippine legislative election|1987 congressional elections]], Ople ran a second time for the Philippine Senate, under the banner of the nationalist-led Grand Alliance for Democracy coalition. He was defeated in this attempt, and returned to private life, serving as chairman of the Institute for Public Policy (IPP), a policy research institute.<ref name=sbio1/>

==Senator of the Philippines==
[[File:Blas Ople.jpg|thumb|Blas Ople]]
In 1992, he ran again for the Senate under the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]]. He was elected to a six-year term. In the Senate, Ople served as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and on the Commission of Appointments. He became [[Senate President Pro-Tempore]] in 1998.

Ople won a re-election for the senate in 1998, under the [[Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino]].
In 1999, upon the resignation of the terminally-ill [[Marcelo Fernan]], Ople became the [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|President of the Senate]]. In that capacity, he was a key proponent of the 1999 [[RP-US Visiting Forces Agreement|Visiting Forces Agreement]] between the Philippines and the United States, which allowed American forces to enter the Philippines for short-term training exercises.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news |title=Philippines foreign minister named |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2150736.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=July 25, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> He yielded the Senate presidency in 2000 to [[Franklin Drilon]].

Later that year, he sat as one of the senator-judges in the impeachment trial of his ally, President [[Joseph Estrada]]. He was one of the eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Estrada v. Desierto'', 445 SCRA 655 |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |date=March 2, 2001 |url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/mar2001/146710_15.htm |accessdate=April 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041231172731/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/mar2001/146710_15.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2004 |df=mdy }}</ref> Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]], leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to the presidency.

==Secretary of Foreign Affairs==
In July 2002, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] appointed Ople, a member of the political opposition in the Senate, as [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] in her cabinet. The appointment was with some controversy. Weeks earlier, Arroyo's hand-picked Vice-President [[Teofisto Guingona]] had resigned as Foreign Affairs Secretary after voicing disagreement with the plan of the Philippine and United States governments to allow [[Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines|American troops to help combat Islamic terrorist groups]] such as the [[Abu Sayyaf]] as part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|post-9/11]] "[[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Philippine foreign minister resigns |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2081341.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=July 2, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> Ople, who had earlier been a vocal supporter of the 1999 [[RP-US Visiting Forces Agreement|Visiting Forces Agreement]], was perceived to be more amenable to the plan. In addition, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] labor activists denounced the appointment of Ople, citing his Marcos-era role in promoting [[Overseas Filipino|overseas employment]] of Filipino workers which, they said, had resulted in abuses inflicted on Filipino workers abroad.<ref name=bbc/>

During his stint as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Ople was at the forefront of the negotiations that led to the deployment of American military forces inside the Philippines, though he insisted that the American troops would not participate in combat missions.<ref>{{cite news |author=Seth Mydans |title=Combat Role For the G.I.'s In Philippines Left Unclear |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/25/world/threats-responses-east-asia-combat-role-for-gi-s-philippines-left-unclear.html |work=New York Times |date=February 25, 2003 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> Under his watch, the American and Filipino governments signed an agreement that provided [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity]] to each other's citizens facing charges before international tribunals such as the [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Carlos Conde |title=Pact with U.S. on Tribunals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/03/world/world-briefing-asia-philippines-pact-with-us-on-tribunals.html |work=New York Times |date=June 3, 2003 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> Ople was also a vocal supporter of the [[Iraq War]], and pushed for the deployment of a small Filipino contingent in Iraq.<ref name=star>{{cite news |author=Agence France Presse |title=Blas Ople succumbs to heart attack |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2003/12/15/news/blas.ople.succumbs.to.heart.attack.html |date=December 15, 2003 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930012944/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2003/12/15/news/blas.ople.succumbs.to.heart.attack.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He predicted in November 2003, "''Baghdad will be transformed from a symbol of brutal despotism to a new, shining symbol of human freedom.

President Arroyo mourned Ople as "an architect of Philippine foreign policy in the finest tradition of enlightened and pragmatic diplomacy",<ref name=iht/> while U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] hailed him as "one of the pivotal figures of the late Twentieth Century for Philippine history".<ref name=us/> More critical of Ople, [[Teodoro Casiño|Teddy Casiño]], secretary-general of the leftist coalition [[BAYAN]], called him a "political chameleon" who "tried to pass himself off as a nationalist but [was] most pro-American".<ref name=nyt2/> Nonetheless, Casiño acknowledged that Ople was "a consistent, brilliant and very astute politician".<ref name=nyt2/>

Ople was eulogized in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', which recalled his erudition, his skill at political survival, and his trademark "extraordinary [[baritone]]".<ref name=time/> The eulogy also said that at the height of the [[People Power Revolution]], Ople in Washington, D.C. had reported to Marcos in Manila that the President's support within the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] was falling. Marcos responded by asking Ople to reach out to his contacts in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government.<ref name=time/> Ople rebuffed Marcos, and as ''Time'' noted, declined "to help make the Philippines a Soviet colony three years before the Berlin Wall fell".<ref name=time/>

Ople is buried at the [[Libingan ng mga Bayani]]. In 2004, President Arroyo named Ople's daughter, Susan Ople, as Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and Employment.<ref>{{cite web|title=GMA names Susan Ople as new DOLE undersecretary |url=http://www.gov.ph/news/default.asp?i=4267 |work=The Official Website of the Government of the Philippines |date=January 6, 2004 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
