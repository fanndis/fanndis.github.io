===Muslim immigration===
In January 2019, he attended an event sponsored by city councilman Eberhard Brett, a member of Germany's far-right [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] party, to discuss the role of Muslims in German society. He supported the construction of mosques that are "compatible" (verträglichen) and not "stately buildings" (Herrschaftsbauten), and said the real concern was Islamic groups that take an offensive stance and with preaching against German values. He said Muslims believe they can kill those who do not submit to them, and needed to acknowledge Germany's basic law establishing the equality of persons and respect for others.<ref>{{cite news | accessdate = 13 January 2019 | url = https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.afd-empfang-im-stuttgarter-rathaus-frueherer-bischof-mixa-mahnt-masshalten-beim-moscheebau-an.a020d1a8-ed07-42a4-961b-c96603e933f6._amp.html | first = Josef | last = Schunder |date= 11 January 2019 | title = Früherer Bischof Mixa mahnt Maßhalten beim Moscheebau an | trans-title= Former Bishop Mixa advises modesty in mosque construction | language = de | work = Stuttgarter-Zeitung }}</ref>
