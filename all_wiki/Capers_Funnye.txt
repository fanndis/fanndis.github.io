His family moved to Chicago as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans to industrial cities out of the South. He grew up on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]]. There he got to see more of his mother's extended family in Chicago, including [[Michelle Obama|future]] [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]], his first cousin once removed.

Funnye and they were involved in community organizing.<ref name='NYT090402'/>

Funnye was raised in the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the first independent black denomination. At 17, he was encouraged by his minister to enter the clergy.<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/confront-antisemitism/antisemitism-podcast/capers-funnye-jr ''Voices on Antisemitism:'' Interview with Rabbi Capers Funnye Jr.], 25 September 2008, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, accessed 12 April 2014</ref> Dissatisfied with Christianity during his college years at [[Howard University]] and influenced by movements for civil rights and [[black nationalism]], he investigated other religions, including [[Islam]]. After meeting with Rabbi Robert Devine, the spiritual leader of the [[House of Israel Congregation (Chicago)|House of Israel Congregation]] in Chicago, which practiced a kind of messianic Judaism, Funnye joined his congregation. Related Black Jewish movements in the United States had started in the late 19th century in Kansas.<ref name='NYT090402'/>

Funnye became drawn to the "more conventional teachings of a black, Brooklyn-based rabbi named Levi Ben Levy, the chief rabbi of the International Israelite Board of Rabbis.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/10/30/with-new-chief-rabbi-black-hebrew-israelites-bid-to-enter-the-jewish-mainstream/|title=With new chief rabbi, black Hebrew-Israelites make bid to enter the Jewish mainstream|website=Washington Post}}</ref> This group has its roots in the [[Commandment Keepers]] Congregation of the Living God, founded in 1919 by [[Wentworth Arthur Matthew]] in [[Harlem]]. It incorporated in 1930 and later moved to Brooklyn, where Matthew established a seminary.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Eedw2JKjkIUC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Black+Culture+and+Black+Zion:+African+American+Religious+Encounters+with+Judaism,+1790%E2%80%931930&source=bl&ots=DvOo_GygK1&sig=CFKffa2UwaCTPQeUU_Dr0vZ1EFs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uV1JU5HcD6LbyQHfxYHoBw&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Black%20Culture%20and%20Black%20Zion%3A%20African%20American%20Religious%20Encounters%20with%20Judaism%2C%201790%E2%80%931930&f=false Anthony B.

With the goal of building bridges to United States Judaism, in 1985 Funnye undertook a second formal conversion to Judaism that was certified by a Conservative rabbinical court.<ref name='NYT090402'/> He had also studied Judaism more intensively in Chicago, earning a [[Bachelor of Arts degree]] in [[Jewish Studies]] and [[Master of Science]] in Human Service Administration from the [[Spertus Institute|Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies]] there.<ref name='NYT090402'/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethshalombz.org/Biography_Funnye.pdf |title=Biography of Rabbi Capers C.

Funnye married Mary White of [[Chicago]]. Her brother Frank White, Jr. is a businessman who served on Barack Obama's national finance committee during his first presidential campaign.<ref name='NYT090402'/>

==Career==
In 1985, Funnye was selected as assistant rabbi at Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Chicago; with 200 members, it is now one of the largest black synagogues in the United States.<ref name='NYT090402'/> Its congregation is mostly African American.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |author-link= |title=Divine Law or Sexism? |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11918123 |work= |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2007-07-12 |access-date=2008-02-13 }}</ref> Funnye is the first African-American member of the Chicago Board of Rabbis, and serves on the boards of the [[Jewish Council on Urban Affairs]] and the [[American Jewish Congress]] of the Midwest. In 1996, Funnye was the only black rabbi in the Chicago area.<ref name="USA">{{cite news |agency= Associated Press|last= |title=Farrakhan inspires and infuriates at once |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nman005.htm |work= |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=1996-02-16 |access-date=2008-02-13 }}</ref>

Funnye has been active in the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, reaching out to historically [[Jewish African-Americans|black Jewish]] communities outside the [[United States]]. These include the [[Beta Israel]] in [[Ethiopia]], which are formally recognized by Israeli authorities as Jewish, and the [[Igbo Jews]] in [[Nigeria]], which are not.<ref name="nt">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/us/16rabbi.html |title=Black Rabbi Reaches Out to Mainstream of His Faith |access-date=2008-03-16 |author=Niko Koppel |date=2008-03-16 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref>

Funnye's current congregation was founded by Rabbi Horace Hasan from [[Bombay]] (now [[Mumbai]]), [[India]], in 1918 as the Ethiopian Hebrew Settlement Workers Association. Along with African Americans, members include [[Hispanic]]s and [[White people|whites]] who were born Jews; the majority of the congregation has converted to Judaism.<ref name='NYT090402'/> As is traditional with Judaism, the congregation does not engage in missionary activity. Members who want to convert must study Judaism for a year before undergoing a traditional conversion, requiring men to be ritually [[circumcision|circumcised]] and women to undergo ritual immersion in a [[mikvah]]. The [[synagogue]] is "somewhere between [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Modern Orthodox]]" with distinctive African-American influences; while men and women sit separately as in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogues, a [[choir|chorus]] sings [[spirituals]] to the beat of a [[drum]]. The congregation occupies a synagogue built by an earlier [[Ashkenazi]] congregation in the [[Marquette Park (Chicago)|Marquette Park]] neighborhood.<ref name="nt"/> Funnye says they have not applied to belong to any mainstream synagogue organizations, as they do not feel the need.<ref name="ort"/>

In 1995, Funnye was a co-founder, with Michelle Stein-Evers of California and [[Robin Washington]] of Boston, of the [[Alliance of Black Jews|National Conference of Black Jews]]. Washington is also Jewish and is the editor of the African-American newspaper, ''Bay State Banner.'' <ref name="ort">{{cite web |url=http://www.ortamerica.org/site/DocServer/Summer_1995.pdf?docID=921 |title=Black Jews: Changing the Face of American Jewry |access-date=2008-03-16 |author=Miriam Rinn |date=Summer 1995 |format=PDF |work=The Reporter: Women's American ORT |publisher=[[World ORT|Women's American ORT]] |pages=11–13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725131217/http://www.ortamerica.org/site/DocServer/Summer_1995.pdf?docID=921 |archive-date=2011-07-25 }}</ref> They have worked to broaden the conversation among black Jews and Black Hebrews across the country, as well as to build bridges to conventional Judaism, made up predominately of whites. Funnye said, "I am a Jew, and that breaks through all color and ethnic barriers."<ref name="nt"/>

On April 2, 2009, Funnye was invited for the first time "to speak at a white, mainstream synagogue in New York", at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregation. He called it his "Broadway debut". The congregation had reached out to black Jewish congregations to celebrate [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], and about one-quarter of the audience were black Jews. Funnye spoke about King and [[Barack Obama]], the night before the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|latter's inauguration]] as president. The next day he and his family went to Washington to join the Obamas in inaugural events.<ref name='NYT090402'/>

In October 2015, Funnye was installed as Chief Rabbi of the International Israelite Board of Rabbis.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/> In August 2016, he was inaugurated to that position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/348199/new-hebrew-israelite-chief-rabbi-capers-funnye-makes-a-play-for-history/|title=New Hebrew Israelite Chief Rabbi Capers Funnye Makes a Play for History|publisher=}}</ref> The board is made up of "people who identify themselves as Black Jews or Israelites."<ref>{{cite web |title=The International Israelite Board of Rabbis |url=http://www.blackjews.org/ |website=blackjews.org |access-date=25 September 2018}}</ref>
