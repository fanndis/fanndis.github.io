Belgrade is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe]] and the World. One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the [[Vinča culture]], evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC.

Belgrade served as capital of the [[Serbian Despotate]] during the reign of [[Stefan Lazarević]], and then his successor [[Đurađ Branković]] returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|siege in 1456]] have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradenet.com/belgrade_history_middle_ages.html|title=The History of Belgrade|publisher=BelgradeNet Travel Guide|accessdate=5 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230032249/http://www.belgradenet.com/belgrade_history_middle_ages.html|archive-date=30 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> It frequently passed from Ottoman to [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the [[Austro-Ottoman Wars|Austro-Ottoman wars]].

[[Zemun|Northern Belgrade]] remained the southernmost [[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg]] post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] after [[World War I]].

[[Lithic reduction|Chipped stone tools]] found in [[Zemun]] show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by [[hunter-gatherer|nomadic foragers]] in the [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] eras. Some of these tools are of [[Mousterian|Mousterian industry]]—belonging to [[Neanderthals]] rather than modern humans.

The northern sections of what is now Serbia persisted as the [[Serbian Despotate]], with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under [[Stefan Lazarević]], the son of Serbian prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]]. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the [[Despot Stefan Tower|Despot's tower]] and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.<ref name="MSH" />

In 1427, Stefan's successor [[Đurađ Branković]], returning Belgrade to the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian king]], made [[Smederevo fortress|Smederevo]] his new capital.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture—such as mosques and [[bazaar]]s, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Basare und Boulevards: Belgrad im 19. Jahrhundert.|last=Mišković|first=Nataša|year=2008|location=Vienna|page=16}}</ref>

During the [[First Serbian Uprising]], Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans.<ref name="bglib">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201255|title=History (Liberation of Belgrade)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> After the [[Second Serbian Uprising]] in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] in 1830.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nations into States: National Liberations in Former Yugoslavia |last=Pavkovic |first=Aleksandar |journal=National Europe Centre Paper No. 5|publisher=The Australian National University |date=19 October 2001|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/41654/3/pavkovic.pdf}}</ref>

The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda|editor-last=Antonić|editor-first=Zdravko|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263–264}}</ref>
[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]

In 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenović]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815–1839), Prince Miloš Obrenović pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abadžijska čaršija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja čaršija and Gornja čaršija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas''). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pašina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pašina, Bajram-begova and Laz Hadži-Mahmudova.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beogradski odonimi.|last=Radović|first=Srđan|year=2014|location=Belgrade|pages=47–48}}</ref> Following the [[Čukur Fountain incident]], Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vesković|first1=Ivana|title=Čukur česma = Čukur fountain|date=2010|publisher=The Cultural Heritage Protection Institute of the City of Belgrade |location=Belgrade|isbn=978-86-81157-45-9}}</ref>

On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from [[Kalemegdan]]. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's ''de facto'' independence dates from this event.<ref>Stanford J. Shaw and Ezel Kural Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Volume 2: Reform, Revolution and Republic—The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808–1975'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 148.</ref> In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimović had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a [[grid plan]]. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimović's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul—the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia ''de jure'' still belonged—underwent similar changes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nationalism and Architecture.|last=Quek|first=Raymond (ed.)|year=2012|location=Farnham|page=97}}</ref>

===World War I===

The First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]] shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] under General [[Oskar Potiorek]] on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Serbian troops]] under Marshal [[Radomir Putnik]]. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]] on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and [[French Army|French troops]] on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]] of France and [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia]]. Belgrade, decimated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Kingdom]] to [[Subotica]] for some time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanology.com/serbia/article_vojvodina.html|title=Serbia :: Vojvodina|publisher=Balkanology|accessdate=7 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312085105/http://balkanology.com/serbia/article_vojvodina.html|archive-date=12 March 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1929. The Kingdom was split into [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]] and Belgrade, together with [[Zemun]] and [[Pančevo]], formed a separate administrative unit.<ref>{{ISBN|86-17-09287-4}}: Kosta Nikolić, Nikola Žutić, Momčilo Pavlović, Zorica Špadijer: Историја за трећи разред гимназије, Belgrade, 2002, p. 144.</ref>

During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.<ref name="stan">{{cite journal

===World War II===
On 25 March 1941, the government of [[regent]] [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Paul]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], joining the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military [[coup d'état]] led by Air Force commander General [[Dušan Simović]], who proclaimed [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] to be of age to rule the realm.

===Modern Belgrade===
[[File:Belgrade from LH1407.jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view of central Belgrade]]

In 2014, [[Belgrade Waterfront]], an urban renewal project, was initiated by the [[Government of Serbia]] and its Emirati partner, [[Eagle Hills Properties]]. Aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy, the project hopes to revitalise the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected expanse on the right bank of the Sava river between the [[Belgrade Fair]] and the former [[Belgrade Main railway station]]. Around €3.5&nbsp;billion will be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Ekonomija/435629/Ovako-ce-izgledati-Beograd-na-vodi |title=Ovako će izgledati "Beograd na vodi" |publisher=Blic.rs |date=19 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222204657/http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Ekonomija/435629/Ovako-ce-izgledati-Beograd-na-vodi |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}</ref> The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned '[[Belgrade Tower]]'. The project is, however, quite controversial—there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2016/12/08/inside-abu-dhabis-bad-joke-the-belgrade-waterfront-project/#49c14d826c12|title=A Look at Abu Dhabi's 'Bad Joke': The Belgrade Waterfront Project|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
Apart from [[Belgrade Waterfront]], the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of [[New Belgrade|Novi Beograd]], where many apartment and office buildings are under construction to support the burgeoning [[Belgrade IT sector|IT sector]], now one of Serbia's largest economic players.

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[File:Kalemegdan park 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kalemegdan Park]] with [[Big Staircase in Kalemegdan Park|Great Staircase]]]]

Belgrade lies {{convert|116.75|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, [[Belgrade Fortress|Kalemegdan]], lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, [[New Belgrade]] was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with [[Zemun]]. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like [[Krnjača]], [[Kotež]] and [[Borča]], also merged with the city, while [[Pančevo]], a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of {{convert|360|km2|sqmi}}, while together with its metropolitan area it covers {{convert|3223|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.
On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is [[Torlak (Belgrade)|Torlak hill]] at {{convert|303|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of [[alluvial plain]]s and [[loam|loessial]] [[plateau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201033 |publisher=City of Belgrade (official website) |title=Natural Features |accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><!--{{cite conference |url=http://www.geo.uni.lodz.pl/~icuc5/text/P_1_10.pdf |title=Topoclimate and air pollution effects on respiratory diseases occurrences in Belgrade |first=Verica |last=Gburčik |author2=Valentina Gburčik|author3=Ljubinka Marčetić|author4=Slobodan Tošović |publisher=Institute of Public Health of Belgrade |format=PDF}}-->

One of the characteristics of the city terrain is [[mass wasting]]. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Višnjica, Serbia|Višnjica]], [[Vinča]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Voždovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].
{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}

Landslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardoš]], [[Ćukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. 
[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[Čukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]

However, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Belić | title = Klizišta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Belić | title = Otapanje pokreće i klizišta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>

===Tourism===
{{See also|Tourism in Serbia}}
Lying on the main artery connecting Europe and Asia, as well as, eventually, the [[Orient Express]], Belgrade has been a popular place for travellers through the centuries. 
In 1843, on Dubrovačka Street (today Kralj Petar Street ), Serbia's ''[[knez (title)|knez]]'' [[Mihailo Obrenović]] built a large edifice which became the first hotel in Belgrade: ''Kod jelena'' ('at the deer's'), in the neighbourhood of [[Kosančićev Venac]]. Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the ''staro zdanje'', or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938.<ref>{{ cite news | author = Dejan Aleksić | title = "Čitanka" srpske istorije i kulture | trans-title = Reading book of Serbian history and culture | newspaper = Politika | page = 17 | language = Serbian | date = 25 January 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/397365/Citanka-srpske-istorije-i-kulture }}</ref><ref>{{ cite news | author = Dejan Aleksić  | title = Razglednica koje više nema | trans-title = Postcards that is no more | newspaper = Politika | page = 22 | language = Serbian | date = 7–8 April 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/401579/Razglednica-koje-vise-nema }}</ref> After the ''staro zdanje'', numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: ''Nacional'' and ''Grand'', also in Kosančićev Venac, ''Srpski Kralj'', ''Srpska Kruna,'' ''[[Grčka Kraljica]]'' near Kalemegdan, ''Balkan'' and ''Pariz'' in [[Terazije]], ''[[London, Belgrade|London]]'', etc.<ref name=hanovi>{{cite news | author =  Dragan Perić | title = Kada su svi putevi vodili u Beograd | trans-title = When all roads were leading to Belgrade | newspaper = Politika-Magazin, No. 1092 | pages = 28–29 | language = Serbian | date = 2 September 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/410658/Kada-su-svi-putevi-vodili-u-Beograd}}</ref>

As Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala, the hotels ''Bosna'' and ''Bristol'' were opened. Other hotels included ''Solun'' and ''Orient'', which was built near the [[Financial Park]]. Tourists which arrived by the [[Orient Express]] mostly stayed at the Petrograd Hotel in [[Savamala#Sava Square|Wilson Square]]. Hotel ''Srpski Kralj'', at the corner of Uzun Mirkova and Pariska Street was considered the best hotel in Belgrade during the [[Interbellum]]. It was destroyed during World War II.<ref name=hanovi/>
