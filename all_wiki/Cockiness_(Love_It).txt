"'''Cockiness (Love It)'''" is a song by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]], from her sixth studio album ''[[Talk That Talk]]'' (2011). The song was written by Rihanna, Candice Pillay, D. Abernathy and Shondrae Crawford, with production helmed by Mr. Bangladesh. Conceptualized by Mr. Bangladesh, the producer revealed in an interview with [[MTV]] that the song had undergone many different versions before the final cut was included on the album. He stated that while he was writing and developing the song, Rihanna was the principal artist whom he wanted to record it.

"Cockiness (Love It)" is a [[dubstep]] and [[dancehall]] track. [[Instrumentation]] is provided by vocal whoops, drums and [[French horn|horns]]. The lyrics of the song revolve around declaring the singer's desire for [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]. "Cockiness (Love It)" received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Whilst some praised the song's memorability and compositional structure, others criticized its overtly sexual lyrical content. Upon the release of ''Talk That Talk'', the song charted in lower regions on the singles charts in South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

==Background and conception==
"Cockiness (Love It)" was written by Candice Pillay, D. Abernathy, Shondrae Crawford and [[Rihanna]], with production helmed by Crawford under his stage name Mr. Bangladesh.<ref name="Album notes"/> In an interview with [[MTV]], Mr. Bangladesh revealed that Rihanna was the principal artist who he wanted to record "Cockiness (Love It)".<ref name="BangladeshInterview">{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Lewis|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a353649/rihanna-perfect-for-talk-that-talk-track-cockiness-says-producer.html|title=Rihanna perfect for 'Talk That Talk' track 'Cockiness', says producer|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]. [[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref> The producer continued to say that the song had undergone "many different guises" before the final version including on ''[[Talk That Talk]]'' (2011), saying {{" '}}Cockiness', it's layers of things I had sampled for a long time, never really messed with it too much."<ref name="BangladeshInterview"/> Mr. Bangladesh continued to describe "Cockiness (Love It){{" '}}s development and song-writing process, saying:

{{quote|I was in LA, and I had just pulled it out, chopped it up, made it a beat. My artist Candice Pillay, my other writers, [[Dem Jointz]], they wrote the song. It wasn't 'Cockiness' at first, it was something else. They had the 'I love it' part. ... [They] came up with that part first, and that wasn't even on that track. It was just an idea. I was going to make a whole new beat out of it, what they wrote to it that day, it wasn't really all the way done. A couple days later, they revisited it and came up with the 'Cockiness'.<ref name="BangladeshInterview"/>}}

After revealing that the song was finished, Mr. Bangladesh stated that he wanted to wait until the right artist came along to record the song. He later decided that it would be Rihanna, saying, "I was like, 'That's dope. That's Rihanna all day'. They sent the song back, and I finished producing it. I put the 'I love it' on it that they had already had&nbsp;...  She loved it, and that's what it was."<ref name="BangladeshInterview"/>
