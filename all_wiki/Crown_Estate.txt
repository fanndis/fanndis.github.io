The '''Crown Estate''' is a collection of lands and holdings in the territories of England, Wales and Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom belonging to the British monarch as a [[Corporation sole#The Crown|corporation sole]], making it "the sovereign's public estate", which is neither government property nor part of the monarch's private estate.<ref name=report>{{cite book| url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmtreasy/325/325i.pdf| title=The management of the Crown Estate| publisher=House of Commons| author=The House of Commons Treasury Committee| year=2010| location=London| pages=5–8}}</ref><ref name=backgrounder>{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/leg_sovereign_grant_secondreading_140711.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/leg_sovereign_grant_secondreading_140711.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 January 2013 |title=Sovereign Grant Bill – Further background information provided to Members of Parliament in advance of the Bill's Second Reading Debate on 14 July 2011 |publisher=Her Majesty's Treasury |date=July 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2015 }}</ref><ref name="FAQ Who Owns">{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/en-gb/resources/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate |title=FAQs: Who owns The Crown Estate? |publisher=The Crown Estate |accessdate=30 July 2019 |location=London, UK}}</ref><ref name=guidance>{{cite web| url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance/sovereign-grant-act-2011-guidance| title=Sovereign Grant Act,2011: Guidance| publisher=Her Majesty's Treasury (gov.uk)|year=2011| accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> The sovereign is not involved with the management or administration of the estate, and exercises only very limited control of its affairs.<ref name=Act>{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1961/55/pdfs/ukpga_19610055_en.pdf| title=Crown Estate Act, 1961| publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office and Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament|year=1961| accessdate=31 December 2015| pages=5–7}}</ref> Instead, the estate's extensive [[financial portfolio|portfolio]] is overseen by a semi-independent, incorporated public body headed by the '''Crown Estate Commissioners''', who exercise "the powers of ownership" of the estate, although they are not "owners in their own right".<ref name=report/> The revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed by the monarch at the disposition of [[Her Majesty's Government]] in exchange for relief from the responsibility to fund the Civil Government.<ref>{{cite web|title=The management of the Crown Estate|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmtreasy/325/32505.htm|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=17 May 2018}}</ref> These revenues thus proceed directly to [[Her Majesty's Treasury]], for the benefit of the British nation.<ref name=report/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/who-we-are/| title=The Crown Estate – Who We Are| publisher=The Crown Estate| accessdate=29 December 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218025640/http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/who-we-are/| archive-date=18 December 2015| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/leg_sovereign_grant_graciousmsg_queen_commons_290611.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/leg_sovereign_grant_graciousmsg_queen_commons_290611.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 January 2013 |title=Gracious Message from the Queen to the House of Commons re: Sovereign Grant |publisher=Buckingham Palace |year=2011 |accessdate=29 December 2015 }}</ref> The Crown Estate is formally accountable to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]],<ref name="FAQ Treasury">{{cite web |title=FAQs: What is The Crown Estate's relationship with the Treasury? |url=https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/en-gb/resources/faqs/ |publisher=The Crown Estate |accessdate=30 July 2019 |location=London, UK}}</ref> where it is legally mandated to make an annual report to the sovereign, a copy of which is forwarded to the House of Commons.<ref name=Act/>

Historically, Crown Estate properties were administered by the reigning monarch to help fund the business of governing the country. However, in [[Civil List Act 1760|1760]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] surrendered control over the Estate's revenues to the Treasury,<ref name=guidance/> thus relieving him of the responsibility of paying for the costs of the civil service, defence costs, the national debt, and his own personal debts. In return, he received an annual grant known as the [[civil list#United Kingdom|Civil List]]. By tradition, each subsequent monarch agreed to this arrangement upon his or her accession. However, from 1 April 2012, under the terms of the [[Sovereign Grant Act 2011]] (SSG), the Civil List was abolished and the monarch was thenceforth provided with a stable source of revenue indexed to a percentage of the Crown Estate's annual net revenue (currently set at 25%).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/661399/Report_of_the_Royal_Trustees_on_the_Sovereign_Grant_2018-19_WEB.pdf|title=Report of the Royal Trustees on the sovereign grany|publisher=HM government |accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref> This was intended to provide a long-term solution and remove the politically sensitive issue of Parliament having to debate the Civil List allowance every ten years. Subsequently, the Sovereign Grant Act allows for all future monarchs to simply extend these provisions for their reigns by [[Order in Council]].<ref name=backgrounder/> The act does not imply any legal change in the nature of the estate's ownership, but is simply a benchmark by which the sovereign grant is set as a grant by Parliament.

==History==

===Crown land in England and Wales===
The history of the Crown lands in England and Wales begins with the [[Norman conquest]].<ref name="Our History">{{cite web |title=Our history |url=https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/en-gb/our-business/our-history/ |publisher=The Crown Estate |accessdate=30 July 2019 |location=London, UK}}</ref> When [[William I of England|William I]] died, the land he had acquired by [[right of conquest]] was still largely intact.<ref>Pugh, p 3</ref> His successors, however, granted large estates to the nobles and barons who supplied them with men and arms.<ref>Pugh. pp. 3–4</ref> {{anchor|Royal manor}}<!-- [[Royal manor]] redirects here --> The monarch's remaining land was divided into '''royal manors''', each managed separately by a [[seneschal]]. The period between the reigns of William I and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was one of continuous [[Alienation (property law)|alienation]] of lands.<ref>Commissioners of Enquiry, s. 38</ref> The Crown lands were augmented as well as depleted over the centuries: [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] extended his possessions into [[Wales]], and [[James I of England|James VI & I]] had his own Crown lands in Scotland which were ultimately combined with the Crown lands of England and Wales.<ref>Pugh, p. 5</ref> However, the disposals outweighed the acquisitions: at the time of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, the total revenue arising from Crown lands was estimated to be £263,598 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|263598|1660}}}} today).<ref>Commissioners of Enquiry, s. 26</ref> By the end of the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] (1689–1702), however, it was reduced to some £6,000 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|6000|1702}}}} today).<ref name=blue>H M Treasury "Blue Note", Class X, 2, 1912</ref>

Before the reign of William III all the revenues of the kingdom were bestowed on the monarch for the general expenses of government. These revenues were of two kinds:<ref name=best1>Best, p. 1</ref>
*the hereditary revenues, derived principally from the Crown lands, feudal rights (commuted for the hereditary excise duties in 1660), profits of the post office, with licences, etc.
*the temporary revenues derived from taxes granted to the king for a term of years or for life.

After the [[Glorious Revolution]], [[English Parliament|Parliament]] retained under its own control the greater part of the temporary revenues, and relieved the sovereign of the cost of the naval and military services and the burden of the [[Government debt|national debt]]. During the reigns of William III, Anne, [[George I of the United Kingdom|George I]] and [[George II of the United Kingdom|George II]] the sovereign remained responsible for the maintenance of the civil government and for the support of the royal household and dignity, being allowed for these purposes the hereditary revenues and certain taxes.<ref name=best1/>

As the state machinery expanded, the cost of the civil government exceeded the income from the Crown lands and feudal rights; this created a personal debt for the monarch.

On George III's accession he surrendered the income from the Crown lands to Parliament, and abrogated responsibility for the cost of the civil government and the clearance of associated debts. As a result, and to avoid pecuniary embarrassment, he was granted a fixed [[civil list]] payment and the income retained from the [[Duchy of Lancaster]].<ref name=best2>Best, p. 2</ref> The King surrendered to parliamentary control the hereditary excise duties, post office revenues, and "the small branches" of hereditary revenue including rents of the Crown lands in England (which amounted to about £11,000, or £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|11000|1760}}}} today), and was granted a civil list annuity of £800,000 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|800000|1760}}}} today) for the support of his household, subject to the payment of certain annuities to members of the royal family.<ref name=best2/>

Although the King had retained large hereditary revenues, his income proved insufficient for his charged expenses because he used the privilege to reward supporters with bribes and gifts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/06/monarchy.princessmargaret|title=The royal family and the public purse|first=Paul|last=Kelso|date=6 March 2000|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> Debts amounting to over £3&nbsp;million (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3000000|1820}}}} today) over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was then increased from time to time.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/astudentsmanual03medlgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/astudentsmanual03medlgoog/page/n534 501]|quote=george iii crown estate debts.|title=A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History|first=Dudley Julius|last=Medley|date=30 January 2018|publisher=B. Blackwell|accessdate=30 January 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Every succeeding sovereign down to and including [[Elizabeth II]] renewed the arrangement made between George III and Parliament; and the practice was, by the 19th century, recognised as "an integral part of the Constitution [which] would be difficult to abandon".<ref name=best1/><ref>Ilbert, C. P., ''[[The Times]],'' 14 August 1871, p. 4</ref> Nevertheless, a review of funding arrangements for the monarchy led to the passage of the [[Sovereign Grant Act 2011]], which according to HM Treasury, is:<ref>[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_faq.htm United Kingdom.  Her Majesty's Treasury.  "Sovereign Grant Act: frequently asked questions relating to the Act and on general issues."] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_faq.htm |date=29 January 2013 }} Accessed 2 May 2013.</ref>

<blockquote>A new consolidated grant rounding together the Civil List, Royal Palaces and Royal Travel grants-in-aid. It is intended that future funding will be set as a fraction of The Crown Estate revenue and paid through the annual Treasury Estimates process, and subject to full National Audit Office audit....</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Grant is to enable The Queen to discharge her duties as Head of State. i.e. it meets the central staff costs and running expenses of Her Majesty's official Household – such things as official receptions, investitures, garden parties and so on. It will also cover the maintenance of the Royal Palaces in England and the cost of travel to carry out royal engagements such as opening buildings and other royal visits....</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the amount of the Grant will be linked to the profits of the Crown Estate, those profits will continue to be paid in to the Exchequer; they are not to be hypothecated. Setting the Grant at a percentage of profits of the Crown Estate will help to put in place a durable and transparent framework.</blockquote>

After winning the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 Scottish election]], the [[Scottish National party]] (SNP) called for the [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] of the Crown Estate income to Scotland.<ref name = "snp">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/snp-anger-at-plan-for-crown-estate-handout-1.1113447|title=SNP anger at plan for Crown Estate handout|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=22 July 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011|first=Michael|last=Settle}}</ref> In response to this demand, the [[Scotland Office]] decided against dividing up the Crown Estates. However, plans have been developed to allocate some of the Crown Estate income to the [[Big Lottery Fund]], which would then distribute funds to coastal communities.<ref name = "snp"/> These plans have also been criticised by the SNP.<ref name = "snp"/>

====Crown Estate Scotland====
The Scottish government has taken control of a portfolio of assets totalling £272&nbsp;million ($339.6&nbsp;million) after a devolved Scottish Crown Estate was established, including the rights to develop marine energy projects in the country.

A new public body, called [[Crown Estate Scotland]] (CES), will oversee seabed areas hosting offshore wind, wave and tidal projects, and some continental shelf activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ijglobal.com/articles/105711/scottish-crown-estate-assets-transfer-to-holyrood|title=Scottish Crown Estate assets transfer to Holyrood|website=Ijglobal.com|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref>

Prior to the handover, the Crown Estate owned a multi-million stake in Fort Kinnaird retail park Edinburgh representing about 60% of the value of all crown assets in Scotland. This was not passed to Crown Estates Scotland with other Scottish properties in 2016. Two years later, the Crown Estate sold its stake and used the funds to assume full ownership of the Gallagher Retail Park in Cheltenham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/moray/1504741/uk-crown-estate-accused-of-167-million-cash-grab-from-scottish-purse/|title=UK Crown Estate accused of £167&nbsp;million 'cash grab' from Scottish purse}}</ref>

==Present day==
===Crown Estate Act 1961===
The Crown Estate is now a [[statutory corporation]] run on commercial lines by the Crown Estate Commissioners under the provisions of the '''Crown Estate Act 1961'''. Under that Act, the Crown Estate Commissioners have a duty "while maintaining the Crown Estate as an estate in land [...] to maintain and enhance its value and the return obtained from it, but with due regard to the requirements of good management".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1961/pdf/ukpga_19610055_en.pdf|title=Crown Estate Act 1961, S. 1(3)|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> The Act provides among other things that (Section 1(5)) "The validity of transactions entered into by the Commissioners shall not be called in question on any suggestion of their not having acted in accordance with the provisions of this Act regulating the exercise of their powers, or of their having otherwise acted in excess of their authority, nor shall any person dealing with the Commissioners be concerned to inquire as to the extent of their authority or the observance of any restrictions on the exercise of their powers".

====Summary of the Act====
The Act includes the following:<ref>[http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/crown_estate_act_1961_summary.pdf "The Crown Estate Act, Brief Summary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615054410/http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/crown_estate_act_1961_summary.pdf |date=15 June 2011 }}, The Crown Estate website. Retrieved 12 July 2010</ref>
*The Crown Estate is an estate in land only, apart from cash and [[gilts]] holdings necessary for the conduct of business.
*The Crown Estate Commissioners, who comprise the main board, are approved by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister. They are limited to eight persons.
*The board of Commissioners have a duty to:
**maintain and enhance the capital value of the estate and its revenue income; but at the same time
**take into account the need to observe a high standard of estate management practice.
*When selling or letting its property the Crown Estate should always seek to achieve the best consideration (i.e. price) which can reasonably be obtained in all the circumstances, but discounting any monopoly value (mainly from ownership of the foreshore and seabed).
*The Crown Estate cannot grant leases for a term of longer than 150 years.
*The Crown Estate cannot grant land options for more than ten years unless the property is re-valued when the option is exercised.
*The Crown Estate cannot borrow money.
*Donations can be made for religious or educational purposes connected with the estate or for tenants' welfare. Otherwise, charitable donations are forbidden.
*The character of the Windsor Estate (Park and Forest) must be preserved; no part of the estate may be sold.
*A report should be submitted to the Queen and to Parliament annually, showing the performance of the estate over the previous year.
*The Crown Estate should observe professional accounting practices and distinguish in its accounts between capital and revenue.
*Money received as a premium from a tenant on the granting of a new lease should be allocated between capital and revenue as follows:
**where the lease is for a term of thirty years or less it must be treated as revenue;
**for leases of more than thirty years it must be treated as capital.

In 2010 a UK Parliament Treasury Committee report on the Crown Estate, the first for twenty years, reported that
* it is "alarmed" that the Crown Estate in 2007 started investing in joint ventures such as the Gibraltar Limited Partnership, which it says is in "grave" financial difficulties. The Crown Estate owns 50% of the partnership, which owns the [[Fort Kinnaird]] retail park near Edinburgh;
* the Crown Estate has a monopoly over the marine environment, and has focused too strongly on collecting revenues rather than acting in the long-term public interest around ports and harbours;
* the quality of residential property management in the urban estate falls short. Consultation processes have lacked transparency, and the Committee was "particularly concerned" that the Crown Estate had failed to consult local bodies which had rights to nominate key workers;
* some non-commercial historic properties should be reviewed with a view to transferring management to conservation bodies such as English Heritage;
* Ministers should take a greater interest in the Crown Estate, because its overall management struggles to balance revenue generation with acting in the wider public interest.

Crown Estate chief executive Roger Bright said: "We welcome the Committee’s recognition that we run a successful business operation."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publicpropertyuk.com/2010/03/30/treasury-committee-slates-crown-estate/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805031317/http://www.publicpropertyuk.com/2010/03/30/treasury-committee-slates-crown-estate/ |archivedate=5 August 2010  }}</ref>
