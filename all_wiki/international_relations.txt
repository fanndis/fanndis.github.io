{{Politics sidebar|Disciplines}}
'''International relations''' ('''IR''') or '''international affairs''' ('''IA''')—commonly also referred to as '''international studies''' ('''IS'''), '''global studies''' ('''GS'''), or '''global affairs''' ('''GA''')—is the study of [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on a global level. Depending on the academic institution, it is either a field of [[political science]], an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field similar to [[global studies]], or an independent academic [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] that examines [[social science]] and [[humanities]] in an international context.

In all cases, international relations is concerned with the relationships between ''political entities'' ([[polity|polities]]) such as [[sovereign state]]s, [[international organization|inter-governmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[international non-governmental organization]]s (INGOs), other [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), and [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs), and the wider [[world-system]]s produced by this interaction. International relations is an [[academic]] and a [[public policy]] field, and so can be [[Positive statement|positive]] and [[Normative statement|normative]], because it analyses and formulates the [[foreign policy]] of a given state.

As a political activity, international relations dates from at least the time of Greek historian [[Thucydides]] ({{circa|460–395 BC}}), but emerged as a discrete academic field within political science in the early 20th century.<ref group="Note">No. 5901 in the [[4-digit UNESCO Nomenclature]]</ref> In practice, international relations and affairs forms a separate academic program or field from political science, and the courses taught therein are highly interdisciplinary.<ref>"International Relation", ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' (1993) pp.000–0000.</ref>

For example, international relations draws from the fields of [[politics]], [[economics]], [[international law]], [[communication studies]], [[history]], [[demography]], [[area studies|geography]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. The scope of international relations encompasses issues such as [[globalization]], [[diplomatic relations]], [[Sovereign state|state sovereignty]], [[international security]], [[ecological]] [[sustainability]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[nationalism]], [[economic development]], [[global finance]], [[terrorism]], and [[human rights]].

Studies of international relations start thousands of years ago; [[Barry Buzan]] and Richard Little consider the interaction of ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-states, starting in 3,500 [[Anno Domini|BC]], as the first fully-fledged international system.<ref>Barry Buzan, Richard Little.

[[File:French Spanish and Polish fashion.jpg|thumb|The official portraits of King [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] dressed according to [[Kingdom of France|French]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and Polish fashion reflects the complex politics of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]

The history of international relations is generally traced back to the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 in Europe, a stepping stone in the development of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|modern state system]]. During the preceding [[Middle Ages]], European organization of political authority was based on a vaguely hierarchical religious order. Contrary to popular belief, Westphalia still embodied layered systems of sovereignty, especially within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>Stéphane Beaulac: "The Westphalian Model in defining International Law: Challenging the Myth", ''Australian Journal of Legal History'' Vol. 9 (2004), [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2004/9.html]; Krasner, Stephen D.: "Westphalia and all that" in Judith Goldstein & Robert Keohane (eds): ''Ideas and Foreign Policy'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1993), pp.235–264</ref> More than the Peace of Westphalia, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 is thought to reflect an emerging norm that sovereigns had no internal equals within a defined territory and no external superiors as the ultimate authority within the territory's sovereign borders. These principles underpin the modern international legal and political order.

The period between roughly 1500 to 1789 saw the rise of independent, sovereign [[Sovereign state|states]] and the institutionalization of [[diplomacy]] and the military. The [[French Revolution]] contributed the idea that the citizenry of a state, defined as the nation, that were sovereign, rather than a monarch or noble class. A state wherein the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a [[nation-state]], as opposed to a monarchy or a religious state; the term [[republic]] increasingly became its synonym. An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely if ever fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only. The same claim to sovereignty was made for both forms of nation-state. In Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.

The particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via [[colonialism]] and the "standards of civilization". The contemporary international system was finally established through [[decolonization]] during the [[Cold War]]. However, this is somewhat over-simplified. While the nation-state system is considered "modern", many states have not incorporated the system and are termed "pre-modern".

Further, a handful of states have moved beyond insistence on full sovereignty, and can be considered "post-modern". The ability of contemporary IR discourse to explain the relations of these different types of states is disputed. "Levels of analysis" is a way of looking at the international system, which includes the individual level, the domestic state as a unit, the international level of transnational and intergovernmental affairs, and the global level.

What is explicitly recognized as international relations theory was not developed until after [[World War I]], and is dealt with in more detail below. IR theory, however, has a long tradition of drawing on the work of other [[social science]]s. The use of capitalizations of the "I" and "R" in international relations aims to distinguish the academic discipline of international relations from the phenomena of international relations. Many cite [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (6th century BC), [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' (5th century BC), [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' providing further elaboration.

Similarly, [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]] draws upon the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], with the work of the former often being cited as the first elaboration of [[democratic peace theory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/|publisher=Stanford press|access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Though contemporary human rights is considerably different from the type of rights envisioned under [[natural law]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[John Locke]] offered the first accounts of universal entitlement to certain rights on the basis of common humanity. In the 20th century, in addition to contemporary theories of [[liberal internationalism]], [[Marxism]] has been a foundation of international relations.

{{Main|International relations theory}}

===Normativity===
IR theories can be categorised on the basis of normativity. In line with the [[is–ought problem]], non-normative [[Empirical theory|empirical]] theories seek to explain why certain events or trends exist in world politics (what the world ''is''), whereas [[normative]] theories are concerned with the events or trends that should exist (what the world ''ought'' to be) and how to make [[Ethics|ethical]] judgements accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |last= Griffiths |first=Martin |date=2007 |title=International Relations Theory for the Twenty-First Century: An introduction |url=https://hostnezt.com/cssfiles/internationalrelations/International-Relations-Theory-for-21st-Century.pdf |publisher=Routledge |page=xiii }}</ref> Smith, Baylis & Owens (2008) make the case that the normative position is to make the world a better place, and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of implicit assumptions and explicit assumptions that constitute a non-normative position and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], political [[idealism]] and political [[globalization]].<ref>{{cite book|isbn= 9780199297771|edition= Fourth|pages= [https://archive.org/details/globalizationofw0000unse_f5x2/page/2 2–13]|title= The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations|first1= John|last1= Baylis|first2= Steve|last2= Smith|first3= Patricia|last3= Owens|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 2008|url= https://archive.org/details/globalizationofw0000unse_f5x2/page/2}}</ref>

===Epistemology===
IR theories are also roughly divided into one of two [[epistemology|epistemological]] camps: "positivist" and "post-positivist". Positivist theories aim to replicate the [[Scientific method|methods of the natural sciences]] by analyzing the impact of material forces. They typically focus on features of international relations such as state interactions, size of military forces, and [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of powers]]. Post-positivist epistemology rejects the idea that the social world can be studied in an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and value-free way. It rejects the central ideas of neo-realism/liberalism, such as [[rational choice theory]], on the grounds that the scientific method cannot be applied to the social world and that a "science" of IR is impossible.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

A key difference between the two positions is that while positivist theories, such as neo-realism, offer causal explanations (such as why and how power is exercised), post-positivist theories focus instead on constitutive questions, for instance what is meant by "power"; what makes it up, how it is experienced and how it is reproduced. Often, post-positivist theories explicitly promote a normative approach to IR, by considering ethics. This is something which has often been ignored under "traditional" IR as positivist theories make a distinction between "facts" and normative judgments, or "values". During the late 1980s and the 1990s, debate between positivists and post-positivists became the dominant debate and has been described as constituting the Third "Great Debate" (Lapid 1989).

===Schools of thought===

====Realism====
{{main|Realism (international relations)}}
[[Realism (international relations)|Realism]] focuses on state security and power above all else. Early realists such as [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]] argued that states are self-interested, power-seeking rational actors, who seek to maximize their security and chances of survival.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morganthau|first=Hans|title=Politics Among Nations: The struggle for Power and Peace|year=1978|location=New York|pages=4–15|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/morg6.htm|access-date=2016-02-24}}</ref> Cooperation between states is a way to maximize each individual state's security (as opposed to more idealistic reasons). Similarly, any act of war must be based on self-interest, rather than on idealism. Many realists saw [[World War II]] as the vindication of their theory.

Realists argue that the need for survival requires state leaders to distance themselves from traditional morality. Realism taught American leaders to focus on interests rather than on ideology, to seek peace through strength, and to recognize that great powers can coexist even if they have antithetical values and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Globalization of World Politics|last=Baylis|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-956909-0|pages=86–87}}</ref>

''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', written by [[Thucydides]], is considered a foundational text of the realist school of political philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Cochrane, Charles|title=Thucydides and the Science of History|date=1929|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=179}}</ref> There is debate over whether Thucydides himself was a realist; Ned Lebow has argued that seeing Thucydides as a realist is a misinterpretation of a more complex political message within his work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lebow|first=Richard Ned|date=2001|title=Thucydides the Constructivist|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=95|issue=3|pages=547–560|jstor=3118232|doi=10.1017/S0003055401003112}}</ref> Amongst others, philosophers like [[Machiavelli]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]] are considered to have contributed to the Realist philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baylis|first=John|title=The globalization of world politics : an introduction to international relations|date=2001|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0198782636|page=[https://archive.org/details/globalizationofw0002unse/page/149 149]|edition=2.|author2=Smith, Steve|url=https://archive.org/details/globalizationofw0002unse/page/149}}</ref> However, while their work may support realist doctrine, it is not likely that they would have classified themselves as realists in this sense. [[Political realism]] believes that politics, like society, is governed by objective laws with roots in [[human nature]]. To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, persons will challenge them only at the risk of failure. Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking.

Placing realism under positivism is far from unproblematic, however. E. H. Carr's "What is History" was a deliberate critique of positivism, and [[Hans Morgenthau]]'s aim in "Scientific Man vs Power Politics" was to demolish any conception that international politics/power politics can be studied scientifically. Morgenthau's belief in this regard is part of the reason he has been classified as a "classical realist" rather than a realist.

Major theorists include [[E. H. Carr]], [[Robert Gilpin]], [[Charles P. Kindleberger]], [[Stephen D. Krasner]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Kenneth Waltz]], [[Stephen Walt]], and [[John Mearsheimer]].

====Liberalism====
{{Main|Liberalism (international relations)}}
{{See also|Liberal internationalism}}

According to liberalism, individuals are basically good and capable of meaningful cooperation to promote positive change. Liberalism views states, nongovernmental organizations, and intergovernmental organizations as key actors in the international system. States have many interests and are not necessarily unitary and autonomous, although they are sovereign. Liberal theory stresses interdependence among states, multinational corporations, and international institutions. Theorists such as [[Hedley Bull]] have postulated an international society in which various actors communicate and recognize common rules, institutions, and interests. Liberals also view the international system as anarchic since there is no single overarching international authority and each individual state is left to act in its own self-interest. Liberalism is historically rooted in the liberal philosophical traditions associated with [[Adam Smith]] and Immanuel Kant that posit that human nature is basically good and that individual self-interest can be harnessed by society to promote aggregate social welfare. Individuals form groups and later, states; states are generally cooperative and tend to follow international norms.<ref name="Mingst, Karen A. 2011">Mingst, Karen A., & Arreguín-Toft, Ivan M. (2011). Essentials of International Relations (5th ed.). New York: W. W. Norton & Company.</ref>

[[Liberal international relations theory]] arose after World War I in response to the inability of states to control and limit war in their international relations. Early adherents include [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Norman Angell]], who argued that states mutually gained from cooperation and that war was so destructive as to be essentially futile.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Woodrow|title=History Learning site|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/woodrow_wilson.htm|access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref>

Liberalism was not recognized as a coherent theory as such until it was collectively and derisively termed idealism by [[E. H. Carr]]. A new version of "idealism" that focused on [[human rights]] as the basis of the legitimacy of [[international law]] was advanced by [[Hans Köchler]].

Major theorists include [[Montesquieu]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Michael W. Doyle]], [[Francis Fukuyama]], and [[Helen Milner]].<ref>Mingst, Karen A., & Snyder, Jack L. (2011). Essential Readings in World Politics (4th ed.). New York: W. W. Norton & Company.</ref>

===== Neoliberalism =====
{{Main|Neoliberalism (international relations)}}
{{Further|Complex interdependence}}
[[neoliberalism in international relations|Neoliberalism]] seeks to update liberalism by accepting the neorealist presumption that states are the key actors in international relations, but still maintains that [[non-state actor]]s (NSAs) and [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs) matter. Proponents argue that states will cooperate irrespective of [[relative gains]], and are thus concerned with [[absolute gains]]. This also means that nations are, in essence, free to make their own choices as to how they will go about conducting policy without any [[international organization]]s blocking a nation's right to [[sovereignty]]. Neoliberal institutionalism, an approach founded by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, emphasize the important role of international institutions in maintaining an open global trading regime.

Prominent neoliberal institutionalists are [[John Ikenberry]], [[Robert Keohane]], and [[Joseph Nye]].

===== Regime theory =====
{{Main|Regime theory}}
[[Regime theory]] is derived from the liberal tradition that argues that international institutions or regimes affect the behaviour of states (or other international actors). It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of international cooperation.

While [[realism (international relations)|realism]] predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights and [[collective security]] among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition of regimes comes from [[Stephen Krasner]], who defines regimes as "principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given issue-area".<ref>Krasner, Stephen D., ed. 1983. "Structural Causes and Regime Consequences: Regimes as Intervening Variables." In ''International Regimes'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, pp. 1.</ref>

Not all approaches to regime theory, however, are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like [[Joseph Grieco]] have developed hybrid theories which take a realist based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation ''never'' happens, just that it is not the norm; it is a difference of degree).

====Post-positivist/reflectivist theories====

=====Constructivism=====
{{Main|Constructivism (international relations)}}
[[Radical constructionism|Social constructivism]] encompasses a broad range of theories that aim to address questions of [[ontology]], such as the [[structure and agency|structure-and-agency]] debate, as well as questions of [[epistemology]], such as the "material/ideational" debate that concerns the relative role of material forces versus ideas. Constructivism is not a theory of IR in the manner of neo-realism, but is instead a [[social theory]] which is used to better explain the actions taken by states and other major actors as well as the identities that guide these states and actors.

[[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism in IR]] can be divided into what [[Ted Hopf]] (1998) calls "conventional" and "critical" constructivism. Common to all varieties of constructivism is an interest in the role that ideational forces play. The most famous constructivist scholar, [[Alexander Wendt]], noted in a 1992 article in ''[[International Organization]]'' —and later in his 1999 book ''Social Theory of International Politics—''that "anarchy is what states make of it". By this he means that the anarchic structure that neo-realists claim governs state interaction is in fact a phenomenon that is socially constructed and reproduced by states.

For example, if the system is dominated by states that see anarchy as a life or death situation (what Wendt terms a "Hobbesian" anarchy) then the system will be characterized by warfare. If on the other hand anarchy is seen as restricted (a "Lockean" anarchy) then a more peaceful system will exist. Anarchy in this view is constituted by state interaction, rather than accepted as a natural and immutable feature of international life as viewed by neo-realist IR scholars.

Prominent social constructivist IR scholars are [[Rawi Abdelal]], [[Michael N. Barnett|Michael Barnett]], [[Mark Blyth]], [[Martha Finnemore]], [[Ted Hopf]], [[Kathryn Sikkink]] and [[Alexander Wendt]].

=====Marxism=====
[[Marxism|Marxist]] and Neo-Marxist theories of IR reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. It makes the assumption that the economy trumps other concerns, allowing for the elevation of class as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. Thus, [[colonialism]] brought in sources for raw materials and [[captive markets]] for exports, while [[decolonialization]] brought new opportunities in the form of dependence.

A prominent derivative of Marxian thought is [[critical international relations theory]] which is the application of "[[critical theory]]" to international relations. Early critical theorists were associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], which followed Marx's concern with the conditions that allow for social change and the establishment of rational institutions. Their emphasis on the "critical" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism. Modern-day proponents such as [[Andrew Linklater]], [[Robert W. Cox]] and [[Ken Booth (academic)|Ken Booth]] focus on the need for human [[freedom (political)|emancipation]] from the nation-state. Hence, it is "critical" of mainstream IR theories that tend to be both positivist and state-centric.

Further linked in with Marxist theories is [[dependency theory]] and the [[Core-periphery|core–periphery model]], which argue that developed countries, in their pursuit of power, appropriate developing states through international banking, security and trade agreements and unions on a formal level, and do so through the interaction of political and financial advisors, missionaries, relief aid workers, and MNCs on the informal level, in order to integrate them into the capitalist system, strategically appropriating undervalued natural resources and labor hours and fostering economic and political dependence.

Marxist theories receive little attention in the United States. It is more common in parts of Europe and is one of the more important theoretic contributions of Latin American academia to the study of global networks.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=====Feminism=====
{{Main|Feminism (international relations)}}
Feminist IR considers the ways that international politics affects and is affected by both men and women and also at how the core concepts that are employed within the discipline of IR (e.g. war, security, etc.) are themselves gendered. Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on states, wars, diplomacy and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political economy. In this sense, there is no clear cut division between feminists working in IR and those working in the area of International Political Economy (IPE). From its inception, feminist IR has also theorized extensively about men and, in particular, masculinities. Many IR feminists argue that the discipline is inherently masculine in nature. For example, in her article "Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals" Signs (1988), Carol Cohn claimed that a highly masculinized culture within the defence establishment contributed to the divorcing of war from human emotion.

Feminist IR emerged largely from the late 1980s onwards. The end of the Cold War and the re-evaluation of traditional IR theory during the 1990s opened up a space for gendering International Relations. Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship have sought to problematize the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline – often by adopting methodologies of deconstructivism associated with postmodernism/poststructuralism. However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the World Bank and the United Nations) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women.

Prominent scholars include [[Carol Cohn]], [[Cynthia Enloe]], [[Sara Ruddick]], and [[J. Ann Tickner]].

=====International society theory (the English school)=====
{{Main|English school of international relations theory}}
International society theory, also called the English School, focuses on the shared norms and values of states and how they regulate international relations. Examples of such norms include diplomacy, order, and [[public international law|international law]]. Unlike neo-realism, it is not necessarily positivist. Theorists have focused particularly on humanitarian intervention, and are subdivided between solidarists, who tend to advocate it more, and pluralists, who place greater value in order and sovereignty. Nicholas Wheeler is a prominent solidarist, while [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Robert H. Jackson]] are perhaps the best known pluralists.

====Post-structuralist theories====
Post-structuralism theories of international relations developed in the 1980s from [[Postmodernism (international relations)|postmodernist studies in political science]]. Post-structuralism explores the deconstruction of concepts traditionally not problematic in IR (such as "power" and "agency") and examines how the construction of these concepts shapes international relations. The examination of "narratives" plays an important part in poststructuralist analysis; for example, [[Post-structural feminism|feminist poststructuralist]] work has examined the role that "women" play in global society and how they are constructed in war as "innocent" and "civilians". (See also [[Feminism (international relations)|feminism in international relations]].) Rosenberg's article "Why is there no International Historical Sociology"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Justin|date=2006|title=Why is There No International Historical Sociology?|journal=European Journal of International Relations|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=307–340|doi=10.1177/1354066106067345|s2cid=145406417|issn=1354-0661}}</ref> was a key text in the evolution of this strand of international relations theory. Post-structuralism has garnered both significant praise and criticism, with its critics arguing that post-structuralist research often fails to address the real-world problems that international relations studies is supposed to contribute to solving.

===Leadership theories===

====Interest group perspective====
[[Interest group]] theory posits that the driving force behind state behaviour is sub-state interest groups. Examples of interest groups include political [[lobbyists]], the military, and the corporate sector. Group theory argues that although these interest groups are constitutive of the state, they are also causal forces in the exercise of state power.

====Strategic perspective====
Strategic perspective is a theoretical approach that views individuals as choosing their actions by taking into account the anticipated actions and responses of others with the intention of maximizing their own welfare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/strategic-planning-organization|title=Strategic planning}}</ref>

====Inherent bad faith model====
{{Further|Bad faith|inherent bad faith model}}
The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = Douglas   | last2 = Starr | first2 = Harvey | year = 1981 | title = The 'Inherent Bad Faith Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 1–33 | jstor = 3791139 | doi = 10.2307/3791139 }}</ref> It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.<ref>"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent...", ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, [[Susan T. Fiske]], Gardner Lindzey</ref> A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].<ref>"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent", The handbook of social psychology, Volumes 1–2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey</ref>

==Levels of analysis<!--'Levels of analysis in international relations' and 'Levels of Analysis in international relations' redirect here-->==

===Systemic level concepts===
International relations are often viewed in terms of '''levels of analysis'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->. The ''systemic level'' concepts are those broad concepts that define and shape an international milieu, characterized by [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchy]]. Focusing on the systemic level of international relations is often, but not always, the preferred method for neo-realists and other structuralist IR analysts.

====Sovereignty====
{{main|Westphalian sovereignty}}
Preceding the concepts of interdependence and dependence, international relations relies on the idea of sovereignty. Described in [[Jean Bodin]]'s "Six Books of the Commonwealth" in 1576, the three pivotal points derived from the book describe sovereignty as being a state, that the sovereign power(s) have absolute power over their territories, and that such a power is only limited by the sovereign's "own obligations towards other sovereigns and individuals".<ref>p. 13, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: [[Carolina Academic Press]], 2012.</ref> Such a foundation of sovereignty is indicated by a sovereign's obligation to other sovereigns, interdependence and dependence to take place. While throughout world history there have been instances of groups lacking or losing sovereignty, such as African nations prior to decolonization or the occupation of Iraq during the [[Iraq War]], there is still a need for sovereignty in terms of assessing international relations.

====Power====
{{main|Power (international relations)}}
The concept of power in international relations can be described as the degree of resources, capabilities, and influence in international affairs. It is often divided up into the concepts of [[hard power]] and [[soft power]], hard power relating primarily to coercive power, such as the use of force, and soft power commonly covering [[economics]], [[diplomacy]] and [[culture|cultural]] influence. However, there is no clear dividing line between the two forms of power.

====National interest====
Perhaps the most significant concept behind that of power and sovereignty, [[national interest]] is a state's action in relation to other states where it seeks to gain advantage or benefits to itself. National interest, whether aspirational or operational, is divided by core/vital and peripheral/non-vital interests. Core or vital interests constitute the things which a country is willing to defend or expand with conflict such as territory, ideology (religious, political, economic), or its citizens. Peripheral or non-vital are interests which a state is willing to compromise. For example, in Germany's annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] in 1938 (a part of Czechoslovakia) under the [[Munich Agreement]], Czechoslovakia was willing to relinquish territory which was considered ethnically German in order to preserve its own integrity and sovereignty.<ref>p. 17-20, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.</ref>

====Non-state actors====
In the 21st century, the status-quo of the international system is no longer monopolized by states alone. Rather, it is the presence of non-state actors, who autonomously act to implement unpredictable behaviour to the international system. Whether it is [[transnational corporations]], [[liberation movements]], [[non-governmental agencies]], or [[international organizations]], these entities have the potential to significantly influence the outcome of any international transaction. Additionally, this also includes the individual person as while the individual is what constitutes the states collective entity, the individual does have the potential to also create unpredicted behaviours. [[Al-Qaeda]], as an example of a non-state actor, has significantly influenced the way states (and non-state actors) conduct international affairs.<ref>pp. 14–15, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.</ref>

====Power blocs====
The existence of power blocs in international relations is a significant factor related to [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]]. During the [[Cold War]], the alignment of several nations to one side or another based on ideological differences or national interests has become an endemic feature of international relations. Unlike prior, shorter-term blocs, the Western and Soviet blocs sought to spread their national ideological differences to other nations. Leaders like U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] under the [[Truman Doctrine]] believed it was necessary to spread democracy whereas the [[Warsaw Pact]] under Soviet policy sought to spread communism. After the Cold War, and the dissolution of the ideologically homogeneous Eastern bloc still gave rise to others such as the [[South-South Cooperation]] movement.<ref>pp. 15–16, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.</ref>

=====Polarity=====
{{main|Polarity (international relations)}}
Polarity in international relations refers to the arrangement of power within the international system. The concept arose from bipolarity during the [[Cold War]], with the international system dominated by the conflict between two [[superpower]]s, and has been applied retrospectively by theorists. However, the term bipolar was notably used by Stalin who said he saw the international system as a bipolar one with two opposing powerbases and ideologies. Consequently, the international system prior to 1945 can be described as '''multipolar''', with power being shared among [[Great powers]].

[[File:World empires and colonies around World War I.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Empires of the world in 1910]]
The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 had led to unipolarity, with the United States as a sole superpower, although many refuse to acknowledge the fact. [[People's Republic of China|China's]] continued rapid economic growth—it became the world's second-largest economy in 2010—respectable international position, and the power the Chinese Government exerts over its people (consisting of the largest population in the world), resulted in debate over whether China is now a superpower or a possible candidate in the future. However, China's strategic force unable of projecting power beyond its region and its nuclear arsenal of 250 warheads (compared to 7700 of the United States<ref>[[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country]]</ref>) mean that the unipolarity will persist in the policy-relevant future.

Several theories of international relations draw upon the idea of [[polarity (power)|polarity]]. The [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the [[First World War]], the thought being that by balancing power blocs it would create stability and prevent war. Theories of the balance of power gained prominence again during the [[Cold War]], being a central mechanism of [[Kenneth Waltz]]'s Neorealism. Here, the concepts of balancing (rising in power to counter another) and bandwagonning (siding with another) are developed.

[[Robert Gilpin]]'s [[Hegemonic stability theory]] also draws upon the idea of polarity, specifically the state of unipolarity. [[Hegemony]] is the preponderance of power at one pole in the international system, and the theory argues this is a stable configuration because of mutual gains by both the dominant power and others in the international system. This is contrary to many neorealist arguments, particularly made by [[Kenneth Waltz]], stating that the end of the [[Cold War]] and the state of unipolarity is an unstable configuration that will inevitably change.

The case of Gilpin proved to be correct and Waltz's article titled "The Stability of a Bipolar World" <ref>Daedalus, 93/3: (1964), 881–909</ref> was followed in 1999 by [[William Wohlforth]]'s article titled "The Stability of a Unipolar World"<ref>International Security, 24/1: (1999), 5–41</ref>

Waltz's thesis can be expressed in [[power transition theory]], which states that it is likely that a [[great power]] would challenge a hegemon after a certain period, resulting in a major war. It suggests that while hegemony can control the occurrence of wars, it also results in the creation of one. Its main proponent, [[A. F. K. Organski]], argued this based on the occurrence of previous wars during British, Portuguese, and Dutch hegemony.

====Interdependence====
Many advocate that the current international system is characterized by growing interdependence; the mutual responsibility and dependency on others. Advocates of this point to growing [[globalization]], particularly with international economic interaction. The role of international institutions, and widespread acceptance of a number of operating principles in the international system, reinforces ideas that relations are characterized by interdependence.

====Dependency====
[[File:ISAF soldier looking for enemy positions in Kunar Province of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[NATO]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] in [[Afghanistan]]]]
[[Dependency theory]] is a theory most commonly associated with [[Marxism]], stating that a set of core states exploit a set of weaker periphery states for their prosperity. Various versions of the theory suggest that this is either an inevitability (standard dependency theory), or use the theory to highlight the necessity for change (Neo-Marxist).

====Systemic tools of international relations====
* [[Diplomacy]] is the practice of communication and '''negotiation''' between representatives of states. To some extent, all other tools of international relations can be considered the failure of diplomacy. Keeping in mind, the use of other tools are part of the communication and negotiation inherent within diplomacy. Sanctions, force, and adjusting trade regulations, while not typically considered part of diplomacy, are actually valuable tools in the interest of leverage and placement in negotiations.
* [[International sanctions|Sanctions]] are usually a first resort after the failure of diplomacy, and are one of the main tools used to enforce treaties. They can take the form of diplomatic or economic sanctions and involve the cutting of ties and imposition of barriers to communication or trade.
* [[War]], the use of force, is often thought of as the ultimate tool of international relations. A popular definition is that given by [[Carl von Clausewitz]], with war being "the continuation of politics by other means". There is a growing study into "new wars" involving actors other than states. The study of war in international relations is covered by the disciplines of "[[war studies]]" and "[[strategic studies]]".
* The mobilization of international shame can also be thought of as a tool of international relations. This is attempting to alter states' actions through '[[name and shame|naming and shaming]]' at the international level. This is mostly done by the large human rights NGOs such as [[Amnesty International]] (for instance when it called Guantanamo Bay a "Gulag"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL10/014/2005/en%3E|title=Error – Amnesty International|website=www.amnesty.org}}</ref> or [[Human Rights Watch]]. A prominent use of was the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] 1235 procedure, which publicly exposes state's human rights violations. The current [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] has yet to use this mechanism
* The allotment of economic and/or diplomatic benefits such as the [[European Union]]'s [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement policy]]; candidate countries are only allowed to join if they meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]].
* The mutual exchange of ideas, information, art, music and language among nations through [[cultural diplomacy]] has also been recognized by governments as an important tool in the development of international relations.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xAgkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=cultural+diplomacy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAmeT22rbeAhUCc98KHaLzCW4Q6AEIVzAI#v=onepage&q=cultural%20diplomacy&f=false ''Music, Art and Diplomacy East-West cultural Interactions and the Cold War''] Editors: Siom Mukkonen & Pekka Suutari.

===Unit-level concepts in international relations===
As a level of analysis the unit level is often referred to as the state level, as it locates its explanation at the level of the state, rather than the international system.

====Regime type====
It is often considered that a state's form of government can dictate the way that a state interacts with others in the international relation.

[[Democratic peace theory]] is a theory that suggests that the nature of [[democracy]] means that democratic countries will not go to war with each other. The justifications for this are that democracies externalize their norms and only go to war for just causes, and that democracy encourages mutual trust and respect.

[[Communism]] justifies a world revolution, which similarly would lead to peaceful coexistence, based on a proletarian global society.

====Revisionism/status quo====
States can be classified by whether they accept the international [[status quo]], or are revisionist—i.e., want change. Revisionist states seek to fundamentally change the rules and practices of international relations, feeling disadvantaged by the status quo. They see the international system as a largely western creation which serves to reinforce current realities. [[Japan]] is an example of a state that has gone from being a revisionist state to one that is satisfied with the status quo, because the status quo is now beneficial to it.

====Religion====
Religion can have an effect on the way a state acts within the international system, and different theoretical perspectives treat it in somewhat different fashion. One dramatic example is the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48) that ravaged much of Europe, which was at least partly motivated by theological differences within Christianity. Religion is a major organizing principle particularly for [[Islamic state]]s, whereas secularism sits at the other end of the spectrum, with the separation of state and religion being responsible for the [[liberal international relations theory]]. The [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, the role of [[Islam]] in [[terrorism]], and religious strife in the [[Middle East]] have made the role of religion in international relations a major topic. China's reemergence as a major international power is believed by some scholars to be shaped by [[Confucianism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Snyder, ed.|first=Jack|title=Religion and International Relations Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZfrWuXy77sC&pg=PA1|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=1–23|access-date=2016-02-24|isbn=9780231153386}}</ref>

===Individual or sub-unit level concepts===
The level beneath that of the unit (state) can be useful both for explaining factors in international relations that other theories fail to explain, and for moving away from a state-centric view of international relations.<ref>Morin, Jean-Frederic and Jonathan Paquin, Foreign Policy Analysis: A Toolbox, Palgrave, 2018.</ref>
* Psychological factors in international relations{{spaced ndash}}Understanding a state is not a "black box" as proposed by [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], and that there may be other influences on foreign policy decisions. Examining the role of personalities in the decision making process can have some [[explanatory power]], as can the role of misperception between various actors. A prominent application of sub-unit level psychological factors in international relations is the concept of [[Groupthink]], another is the propensity of policymakers to think in terms of analogies.
* Bureaucratic politics{{spaced ndash}}Looks at the role of the [[bureaucracy]] in decision-making, and sees decisions as a result of bureaucratic infighting, and as having been shaped by various constraints.
* Religious, ethnic, and secessionist groups{{spaced ndash}}Viewing these aspects of the sub-unit level has explanatory power with regards to [[ethnic conflict]]s, [[religious wars]], transnational [[diaspora]] ([[diaspora politics]]) and other actors which do not consider themselves to fit with the defined state boundaries. This is particularly useful in the context of the pre-modern world of weak states.
* Science, technology and international relations{{spaced ndash}}How science and technology impact global health, business, environment, technology, and development.
* [[International political economy]], and economic factors in international relations<ref>E.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.

==Study of international relations==
=== History ===
International relations as a distinct field of study began in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. IR emerged as a formal [[academic discipline]] in 1919 with the founding of the first IR professorship: the Woodrow Wilson Chair at [[Aberystwyth]], [[University of Wales]] (now [[Aberystwyth University]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=Aberystwyth University – Department of International Politics|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/|website=www.aber.ac.uk}}</ref> held by [[Alfred Eckhard Zimmern]]<ref name="AAA">{{Cite journal|last=Abadía|first=Adolfo A.|date=2015|title=Del liberalismo al neo-realismo.

[[Georgetown University]]'s [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] is the oldest international relations faculty in the [[United States]], founded in 1919. In the early 1920s, the [[London School of Economics]]' department of international relations was founded at the behest of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Philip Noel-Baker]]: this was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. This was rapidly followed by establishment of IR at universities in the US and in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The creation of the posts of [[Montague Burton Professor of International Relations]] at LSE and at Oxford gave further impetus to the academic study of international relations. Furthermore, the International History department at LSE developed a focus on the history of IR in the [[early modern]], [[History of colonialism|colonial]] and [[Cold War]] periods.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0uVHo4ZLc4C&pg=PA5|title=Handbook of International Relations|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2012|isbn=9781446265031|editor-last=Carlsnaes|editor-first=Walter|pages=1–28|access-date=2016-02-24|display-editors=etal}}</ref>
[[File:Centre for International Governance Innovation 2.jpg|thumb|[[CIGI Campus]], home to the [[Balsillie School of International Affairs]]]]

The first university entirely dedicated to the study of IR was the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies|Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]], which was founded in 1927 to form diplomats associated to the [[League of Nations]]. The [[Committee on International Relations (University of Chicago)|Committee on International Relations]] at the [[University of Chicago]] was the first to offer a [[graduate degree]], in 1928. [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], a collaboration between [[Tufts University]] and [[Harvard]], opened its doors in 1933 as the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=A History of Excellence|url=http://fletcher.tufts.edu/About/Fletcher-History|website=The Fletcher School|publisher=Tufts}}</ref> In 1965, [[Glendon College]] and the [[Norman Paterson School of International Affairs]] were the first institutions in Canada to offer an undergraduate and a graduate program in international studies and affairs, respectively.[[File:Maison de la paix petals 1 and 2.jpg|thumb|[[Maison de la paix|Maison de la Paix]], home to the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|Graduate Institute Geneva]]]]
