The '''American Academy of Arts and Sciences''' (abbreviation: '''AAAS''') is one of the oldest [[learned societies]] in the [[United States of America|United States]]. Founded in 1780, the Academy is dedicated to honoring excellence and leadership, working across disciplines and divides, and advancing the common good. 

Membership in the academy is achieved through a thorough petition, review, and election process and has been considered a high honor of scholarly and societal merit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/content.aspx?d=1424|title=Academy Bylaws – American Academy of Arts & Sciences|access-date=2017-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602211522/http://www.amacad.org/content.aspx?d=1424|archive-date=2017-06-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> The academy was founded during the [[American Revolution]] by [[John Adams]], [[John Hancock]], [[James Bowdoin]],<ref>Kershaw, G.

Today the Academy is charged with a dual function: to elect to membership the finest minds and most influential leaders, drawn from science, scholarship, business, public affairs, and the arts, from each generation, and to conduct policy studies in response to the needs of society. Major Academy projects now have focused on higher education and research, humanities and cultural studies, scientific and technological advances, politics, population and the environment, and the welfare of children. ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Dædalus]]'', the Academy's quarterly journal, is widely regarded as one of the world's leading intellectual journals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amacad.org/about.aspx |title=About the Academy |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=2012-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902040629/http://www.amacad.org/about.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Academy carries out nonpartisan policy research by bringing together scientists, scholars, artists, policymakers, business leaders, and other experts to make multidisciplinary analyses of complex social, political, and intellectual topics. The Academy's current areas of work are Arts & Humanities, Democracy & Justice, Education, Energy & Environment, Global Affairs, and Science & Technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/our-work|title=Our Work|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences}}</ref>

[[David W. Oxtoby]] began his term as the organization's president in January 2019. A chemist by training, he served as President of [[Pomona College]] from 2003 to 2017. He was elected a member of the American Academy in 2012. 

The Academy is headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

==History==
The Academy was established by the Massachusetts legislature on May 4, 1780. Its purpose, as described in its charter, is "to cultivate every art and science which may tend to advance the interest, honor, dignity, and happiness of a free, independent, and virtuous people."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx |title=Charter of Incorporation |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=2012-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103142200/https://www.amacad.org/about/charter.aspx |archive-date=2011-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The sixty-two incorporating fellows represented varying interests and high standing in the political, professional, and commercial sectors of the state. The first class of new members, chosen by the Academy in 1781, included [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[George Washington]] as well as several international honorary members. The initial volume of Academy ''Memoirs'' appeared in 1785, and the ''Proceedings'' followed in 1846. In the 1950s, the Academy launched its journal ''Daedalus'', reflecting its commitment to a broader intellectual and socially-oriented program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/american-academy-of-arts-and-sciences |title=Gale Encyclopedia of US History: American Academy of Arts and Sciences}}</ref>

Since the second half of the twentieth century, independent research has become a central focus of the Academy. In the late 1950s, [[arms control]] emerged as one of its signature concerns. The Academy also served as the catalyst in establishing the [[National Humanities Center]] in North Carolina. In the late 1990s, the Academy developed a new strategic plan, focusing on four major areas: science, technology, and global security; social policy and education; humanities and culture; and education. In 2002, the Academy established a visiting scholars program in association with [[Harvard University]]. More than 75 academic institutions from across the country have become Affiliates of the Academy to support this program and other Academy initiatives.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amacad.org/content/about/about.aspx?d=363&t=4&s=0 |title=Visiting Scholars Program |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=2014-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830090435/https://www.amacad.org/content/about/about.aspx?d=363&t=4&s=0 |archive-date=2014-08-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Academy has sponsored a number of awards and prizes,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/about/prizes|title=Prizes|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences}}</ref> throughout its history and has offered opportunities for fellowships and visiting scholars at the Academy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/about/fellowships|title=Fellowships|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences}}</ref> 

In July 2013 the Boston Globe exposed then president [[Leslie Berlowitz]] for falsifying her credentials, faking a doctorate, and consistently mistreating her staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/06/03/leader-cambridge-prestigious-academy-arts-and-sciences-inflated-resume-falsely-claiming-doctorate/kWvnF95OTkI0HCVvBHe9XJ/story.html|title=Leader of Cambridge's prestigious Academy of Arts and Sciences inflated resume, falsely claiming doctorate – The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com}}</ref> Berlowitz subsequently resigned.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/2013/07/25/berlowitz/FmygIUuorBBKl95LwtcHML/story.html Embattled head of American Academy of Arts and Sciences resigns after questions about resume – Metro].
