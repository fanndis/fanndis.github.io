'''Jon Stewart''' (born '''Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz'''; November 28, 1962) is an American comedian, writer, producer, director, political commentator, actor, and television host. He hosted ''[[The Daily Show]]'', a [[news satire |satirical news program]] on [[Comedy Central]], from 1999 to 2015.

Stewart started as a stand-up comedian but branched into television as host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' for Comedy Central. He went on to host ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' and then ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'', both on MTV. Stewart also has appeared in several films, such as ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film) |Big Daddy]]'' (1999) and ''[[Death to Smoochy]]'' (2002), but did few cinematic projects after becoming host of ''The Daily Show'' in 1999. He also was a writer and co-executive producer of the show. After Stewart joined, ''The Daily Show'' steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, and during his tenure, it won 22 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 2 [[Grammy Awards]] and also was [[List of awards and nominations received by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart |nominated for news and journalism awards]]. Stewart hosted the [[78th Academy Awards |78th]] and [[80th Academy Awards]]. He is the co-author of ''[[America (The Book) |America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]'', which was one of the best-selling books in the U.S. in 2004,<ref name="Top15books2004">{{cite news |date=December 20, 2004 |title=The top 100 selling books of 2004 |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-12-20-top-books-of-2004_x.htm |access-date=November 6, 2006}}</ref> and ''[[Earth (The Book) |Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]'', released in 2010.

Since leaving ''The Daily Show'', Stewart has mostly maintained a low profile in entertainment industry circles, but has used his celebrity and voice in a sustained advocacy for [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks |9/11 first responders]],<ref name="NYT 9-11">{{cite news |last=Gold |first=Michael |date=June 12, 2019 |title=How Jon Stewart Became a Fierce Advocate for 9/11 Responders |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/nyregion/jon-stewart-9-11-congress.html |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref> and also for war veterans' health benefits.

Stewart's parents divorced when he was eleven years old, and Stewart was largely estranged from his father.<ref name=moment/> Because of his strained relationship with his father, which in 2015 he described as "still 'complicated'", he dropped his surname and began using his middle name, Stuart. Stewart stated, "There was a thought of using my mother's maiden name, but I thought that would be just too big a fuck you to my dad... Did I have some problems with my father? Yes.

Stewart grew up in the era of the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Watergate scandal]], which inspired in him "a healthy skepticism towards official reports". His first job was working with his brother at a [[F. W. Woolworth Company |Woolworth's]] store, and jokingly says being fired by Lawrence was one of the "scarring events" of his youth.<ref name=TheGuardian/>

Stewart graduated in 1984 from [[The College of William & Mary]] in [[Virginia]], where he played on the [[William & Mary Tribe men's soccer |soccer team]] and initially majored in [[chemistry]] before switching to [[psychology]].<ref name=moment/><ref>{{cite video |medium=Television production |date=October 22, 2010 |title=Bloomberg Game Changers: Jon Stewart |publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]] |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/63932062/ |access-date=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025111914/http://www.bloomberg.com/video/63932062/ |archive-date=October 25, 2010}}</ref> While at William & Mary, Stewart became a member of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity,<ref>{{cite web |title=Prominent Pikes |publisher=Pikes.org |url=http://www.pikes.org/media/documents/recruitmentresources/brochure/prominent.html |access-date=February 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060236/http://www.pikes.org/media/documents/recruitmentresources/brochure/prominent.html |archive-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref> but later disassociated himself from the fraternity and left after six months.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Top 49 Men of 2010 |publisher=AskMen.com |url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment_150/167_jon_stewart.html |access-date=February 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013103852/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment_150/167_jon_stewart.html |archive-date=October 13, 2008}}</ref> "My college career was waking up late, memorizing someone else's notes, doing bong hits, and going to soccer practice", he later said.<ref name="ny1994">{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Chris |date=1994 |title=The Man Who Should Be Conan |work=[[New York (magazine) |New York]] |url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/10/jon-stewarts-1994-interview-with-new-york.html |access-date=November 2, 2014}}</ref> His [[Al Albert (soccer) |soccer coach]] would later describe him as a "good player" with "high energy".<ref>{{cite web |title=Jon Stewart: College Soccer Star Named 'Leibo' |website=SportsGrid |url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/jon-stewart-college-soccer-player-once-led-william-mary-to-an-upset-win-over-uconn/ |access-date=February 19, 2016}}</ref> After college, Stewart held numerous jobs: a contingency planner for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, a contract administrator for the [[City University of New York]], a puppeteer for children with disabilities, a soccer coach at [[Gloucester High School (Virginia) |Gloucester High School]] in Virginia, a caterer, a busboy, a shelf stocker at Woolworth's, a bartender at the Franklin Corner Tavern (a local blue-collar bar), and a bartender at the legendary [[City Gardens]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].<ref name=moment/><ref name="mtv">{{cite news |last=Gerston |first=Jill |date=March 13, 1994 |title=MTV Has a Hit With Words By Jon Stewart |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EFDC163DF930A25750C0A962958260 |access-date=March 9, 2008}}</ref><ref name=oscar/> He has said that working at City Gardens was a pivotal moment for him: "finding this place City Gardens was like, 'Oh, maybe I'm not a giant weirdo.

==Career==

===Early work===
With a reputation for being a funny man in school,<ref name=moment/><ref name="mtv"/> Jon Stewart returned to [[New York City]] in 1986 to try his hand at the [[comedy club]] circuit, but he could not muster the courage to get on stage until the following year.<ref>{{cite news |last=McLellan |first=Dennis |date=May 27, 1993 |title=He Has Faith in His Jokes |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-27/news/ol-40130_1_jon-stewart |access-date=June 3, 2008}}</ref> He made his [[stand-up comedy |stand-up]] debut at [[The Bitter End]], where his comedic idol, [[Woody Allen]], also began.<ref name="cool">{{cite magazine |last=Speidel |first=Maria |date=April 4, 1994 |title=Prince of Cool Air |magazine=[[People (magazine) |People]] |url=https://people.com/archive/prince-of-cool-air-vol-41-no-12/ |access-date=February 12, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304171657/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20107783,00.html |archive-date=March 4, 2014}}</ref> He began using the [[stage name]] "Jon Stewart" by dropping his last name and changing the spelling of his middle name "Stuart" to "Stewart". He often jokes this is because people had difficulty with the pronunciation of Leibowitz or it "sounded too Hollywood" (a reference to [[Lenny Bruce]]'s joke on the same theme).<ref name="record">{{cite news |last=Howard |first=Susan |year=1994 |title=Nighttime Talk, MTV Style |newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County) |The Record]] |url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/94_0000record.html |access-date=June 3, 2008}}</ref> He has implied that the name change was due to a strained relationship with his father, with whom Stewart no longer had any contact.<ref name=oscar>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Paul |date=February 26, 2006 |title=The Oscar for best satirist goes to ... |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/26/broadcasting.oscars2006 |access-date=October 21, 2008}}</ref>

Stewart became a regular at the [[Comedy Cellar]], where he was the last performer every night. For two years, he would perform at 2 a.m. while developing his comedic style.<ref>{{cite episode |airdate=March 14, 2007 |title=Jon Stewart |episode-link=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg |series=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg |series-link=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg |network=[[TV Land]] |season=2 |number=4}}</ref> In 1989, Stewart landed his first television job as a writer for ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]''. In 1990, he began co-hosting [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'', with [[Patty Rosborough]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Weiner |first=Jonah |date=June 21, 2015 |title=Comedy Central in the Post-TV Era |work=New York Times |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/slideshow/100000003747353/2015/06/21/magazine/comedy-central-in-the-post-tv-era/s/21mag-comedycentral-ss-slide-KWZZ.html |access-date=November 6, 2017  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030309/https://mobile.nytimes.com/slideshow/100000003747353/2015/06/21/magazine/comedy-central-in-the-post-tv-era/s/21mag-comedycentral-ss-slide-KWZZ.html |archive-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> In 1992, Stewart hosted the short-lived ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'' on MTV, which invited viewers to send in their stories to be acted out by the comedy troupe, [[The State (1993 TV series) |The State]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Gerston |first=Jill |date=March 13, 1994 |title=TELEVISION; MTV Has a Hit With Words By Jon Stewart |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/arts/television-mtv-has-a-hit-with-words-by-jon-stewart.html |access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>

Stewart relates that his career did not take off until his March 6, 1992 appearance on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.<ref name="ny1994"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Jon Stewart on Letterman, March 6, 1992 |language=en |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxUBJYzJrYg |access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> He was considered a finalist to take over Letterman's position upon his departure from the program, but instead, it was given to relatively unknown [[Conan O'Brien]].<ref name="record"/>

===''The Jon Stewart Show''===
Later in 1993, Stewart developed ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', a [[talk show]] on [[MTV]]. ''The Jon Stewart Show'' was the first talk show on that network and was an instant hit, becoming the second-highest rated MTV show, behind ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Michael |date=February 19, 1994 |title=New York's Mr. Schmooze |work=[[TV Guide]] |url=http://www.geocities.com/jonstewartshow/jontvguide.htm |access-date=June 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query |archive-date=October 26, 2009}}</ref> In 1994, [[Paramount Pictures |Paramount]] canceled ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and, with new corporate sibling MTV (through MTV parent [[Viacom (2005–present) |Viacom]]'s acquisition of the studio), launched an hour-long [[broadcast syndication |syndicated]] late-night version of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Many local affiliates had moved Hall's show to 2 a.m. during its decline and Stewart's show inherited such early morning time slots in many cities. Ratings were dismal and the show was canceled in June 1995.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |date=August 19, 2016 |title=[Watch&#93; Jon Stewart To Larry Wilmore: 'What Did You Do, Piss Off Peter Thiel?' |magazine=Deadline |url=https://deadline.com/2016/08/jon-stewart-visits-larry-wilmore-final-nightly-show-peter-thiel-1201805694/ |access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref>

Among the fans of the show was [[David Letterman]], who was the final guest of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Letterman signed Stewart with his production company, [[Worldwide Pants]].<ref>{{cite web |date=June 6, 1996 |title=Comic Stewart Set to Head CBS Talker |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0696plaindealer.html |access-date=June 3, 2008}}</ref> Stewart then became a frequent guest host for [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series) |The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder]]'', which was produced by Letterman and aired after the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman |Late Show]]'' on [[CBS]]. This led to much speculation that Stewart would soon replace Snyder permanently,<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Peter |date=October 1, 1996 |title=Stewart to Sub&nbsp;– Not Take Over&nbsp;– for Snyder |newspaper=USA Today |url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_1001usatoday.html |access-date=June 3, 2008}}</ref> but instead, Stewart was offered the time slot after Snyder's, which he turned down.<ref>{{cite news |last=Adaliang |first=Josef |date=November 25, 1997 |title=What's the Deal With Stewart? |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/97_1125nypost.html |access-date=June 3, 2008}}</ref>

In 1996 Stewart hosted a short-lived talk show entitled, ''[[Where's Elvis This Week?]]'', that was a half-hour, weekly comedy television program. It aired on Sunday nights in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Two]]. It was filmed at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and featured a set of panelists, two from the UK and two from the United States, who discussed news items and cultural issues. The show premiered in the UK on October 6, 1996; five episodes aired in total. Notable panelists included [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Phill Jupitus]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Craig Kilborn]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Armando Iannucci]], [[Norm Macdonald]], and [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. In 1997, Stewart was chosen as the host and interviewer for George Carlin's tenth HBO special, ''40 Years of Comedy''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Horowitz |first=Alana |date=April 7, 2013 |title=Jon Stewart Interview With George Carlin From 1997 Is Amazing (VIDEO) |work=The Huffington Post |url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3032418 |access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

===''The Daily Show''===
In 1999, when [[Craig Kilborn]] left the show to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series) |The Late Late Show]]'', Stewart began hosting ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]]. ''The Daily Show'' blends humor with the day's top news stories, usually in politics, while simultaneously poking fun at politicians, newsmakers, and the news media. In an interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', Stewart denied the show has any intentional political agenda, saying the goal was "schnicks and giggles" and that "[t]he same weakness that drove me into comedy also informs my show", meaning that he was uncomfortable talking without hearing the audience laugh.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jon Stewart on The O'Reilly Factor |publisher=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5pK7sK0i4A |access-date=April 23, 2008}}</ref> In his first Daily Show on-air appearance on January 11, 1999, Stewart told his guest that evening, [[Michael J. Fox]], that he felt as if "this is my bar mitzvah".<ref>{{cite web |last=Gillick |first=Jeremy |title=Meet Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz |url=https://www.momentmag.com/meet-jonathan-stuart-leibowitz-aka-jon-stewart/ |access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref> His style was described by one critic as, "Stewart does not offer us cynicism for its own sake, but as a playful way to offer the kinds of insights that are not permitted in more serious news formats that slavishly cling to official account of events."<ref>Bennett, Lance W. "Relief in Hard Times: A Defense of Jon Stewart's Comedy in an Age of Cynicism." Critical Studies in Media Communication. 24.3 (2007): 278-283. Print.</ref>

Until Trevor Noah permanently took over the show, Stewart hosted almost all airings of the program, except for a few occasions when correspondents such as [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Rob Corddry]], [[Jason Jones (actor) |Jason Jones]], and [[Steve Carell]] subbed for him, and during [[John Oliver (comedian) |John Oliver]]'s stint as host during the summer of 2013. Stewart has won a total of twenty [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for ''The Daily Show'' as either a writer or producer, and two for producing ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2013–14), winning a total of twenty-two Primetime Emmy Awards, having the most wins for a male individual.<ref name="awards1">{{cite news |date=November 24, 2015 |title=Jon Stewart Comedic Genres |work=Salon |url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/24/trevor_noahs_just_not_funny_the_daily_show_is_a_trainwreck_i_know_because_i_watch_for_a_living/ |access-date=January 17, 2015}}</ref> In 2005, Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' received the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Comedy Album]] for the audiobook edition of ''[[America (The Book) |America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]''. In 2000 and 2004, the show won two [[Peabody Award]]s for its coverage of the U.S. presidential elections in those years, called "[[Comedy Central's Indecision 2000 |Indecision 2000]]" and "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2004 |Indecision 2004]]", respectively.<ref name="peabodyawards2000">[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2000 60th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2001.</ref><ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2004 64th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2005.</ref>

The show of September 20, 2001, the first show after the [[attacks of September 11, 2001]], began with no introduction.<ref name="DS091101">{{cite web |date=September 11, 2001 |title=September 11, 2001 |publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/1q93jy/september-11--2001 |access-date=September 1, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901110549/http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/1q93jy/september-11--2001 |archive-date=September 1, 2015}}</ref> Before this, the introduction included footage of a fly-in toward the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001) |World Trade Center]] and New York City.

This symbol of American ingenuity, and strength, and labor, and imagination and commerce, and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The [[Statue of Liberty]].

In mid-2002, amid rumors that [[David Letterman]] was going to switch from CBS to ABC when his contract ran out, Stewart was rumored as Letterman's replacement on CBS.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |date=March 11, 2002 |title=David Letterman will stay at CBS |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,216668,00.html |access-date=March 29, 2008}}</ref> Ultimately, Letterman renewed his contract with CBS. On the March 9, 2002, episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', hosted by Stewart, a ''[[Weekend Update]]'' sketch poked fun at the situation.

In late 2002, ABC offered Stewart his own talk show to air right after ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program) |Nightline]]''. Stewart's contract with ''The Daily Show'' was near expiring, and he expressed strong interest. ABC, however, decided to give another Comedy Central figure, [[Jimmy Kimmel]], the post-''Nightline'' slot.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Bill |date=November 3, 2002 |title=In the Land of the Insomniac, the Narcoleptic Wants to Be King |work=The New York Times |url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/2002/02_1103nytimes.html}}</ref>

Are you freaking out on us, because if you're freaking out and you're going into the crazy [[Base (politics) |base]] world—are you going into crazy base world?" McCain replied, "I'm afraid so."

On April 28, 2009, during a discussion on [[torture]] with [[Clifford May]], Stewart expressed his opinion that former President [[Harry S.

In 2004, Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' writing staff released, ''[[America (The Book) |America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]'', a mock high-school history textbook offering insights into the unique American system of government, dissecting its institutions, explaining its history and processes, and satirizing such popular American political precepts as, "[[one man, one vote]]", "government by the people", and "every vote counts". The book sold millions of copies upon its 2004 release and ended the year as a top-fifteen best seller.<ref name="Top15books2004"/>

===Acting===
Although best known for his work on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', Stewart has had roles in several films and television series. His first film role was a bit part in the box-office bomb, ''[[Mixed Nuts]].'' He landed a minor part in ''[[The First Wives Club]]'', but his [[deleted scene |scene was deleted]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0827usatoday.html |title=Out of the Club |newspaper=USA Today |author1=Vigoda, Arlene |author2=Susan Wloszczyna |date=August 27, 1996 |access-date=June 3, 2008}}</ref> In 1995, Stewart signed a three-year deal with [[Miramax]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299594,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |title=Monitor |date=November 17, 1995 |access-date=March 3, 2007}}</ref> He played romantic leads in the films, ''[[Playing by Heart]]'' and ''[[Wishful Thinking (1997 film) |Wishful Thinking]]''. He had a supporting role in the romantic comedy, ''[[Since You've Been Gone (film) |Since You've Been Gone]]'' and in the horror film, ''[[The Faculty]]''. Other films were planned for Stewart to write and star in, but they never were produced. Stewart maintained a relationship with Miramax founders [[Harvey Weinstein |Harvey]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] and appeared in films they produced including, ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', ''[[Doogal]]'', and the documentary, ''[[Wordplay (film) |Wordplay]]''.

He appeared in ''[[Half Baked]]'' as an "enhancement smoker" and in ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film) |Big Daddy]]'' as [[Adam Sandler]]'s roommate; he has joked on the ''Daily Show'' and in the documentary ''[[The Aristocrats (film) |The Aristocrats]]'' that to get the role, he slept with Sandler. Stewart often makes fun of his appearances in the high-profile flop, ''[[Death to Smoochy]]'',<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-02-19-jon-stewart_x.htm |title=Jon Stewart looks Oscar in the eye |newspaper=USA Today |last=Levin |first=Gary |date=February 19, 2006 |access-date=June 4, 2008}}</ref> in which he played a treacherous television executive; and the animated film ''[[Doogal]]'',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/lkl.01.html |title=CNN Larry King Live: Interview With Jon Stewart |work=[[Larry King Live]] |publisher=CNN |date=February 27, 2006 |access-date=June 4, 2008}}</ref> where he played a blue [[Spring (device) |spring]] named Zeebad who shot a freeze ray from his mustache. In 2007, Stewart made a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in ''[[Evan Almighty]]'', which starred former ''Daily Show'' correspondent [[Steve Carell]]. In the movie, Stewart was seen on a television screen in a fictional ''Daily Show'' episode poking fun at Carell's character for building an [[Noah's Ark |ark]].

Stewart had a recurring role in ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', playing himself as an occasional substitute and possible successor to late-night talk show host [[List of The Larry Sanders Show characters |Larry Sanders]] (played by [[Garry Shandling]]). In 1998, Stewart hosted the television special, ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', celebrating 30 years of ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He has guest-starred on other sitcoms including ''[[The Nanny]]'', ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He also has made guest appearances on the [[children's television series]] ''[[Between the Lions]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]'', and ''[[Gravity Falls]]''.

===Producing===
In the mid-1990s, Stewart launched his own [[production company]], [[Busboy Productions]], naming the company in reference to his previous job as a [[busboy]]. Stewart signed a deal with [[Miramax]] to develop projects through his company, but none of his ideas have been produced. After Stewart's success as host and producer of ''The Daily Show'', he revived Busboy Productions with ''Daily Show'' producers [[Ben Karlin]] and Rich Korson. In 2002, Busboy planned to produce a [[sitcom]] for NBC starring Stephen Colbert, but the show did not come to fruition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jon Stewart: TV Mogul |publisher=[[E! Online]] |date=February 15, 2005}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Comedy Central]] reached an agreement with Busboy in which Comedy Central would provide financial backing for the production company. Comedy Central has a first-look agreement on all projects, after which Busboy is free to shop them to other networks.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4762101-1.html |title=Comedy Inks Deal with Stewart's Busboy |last=Larson |first=Megan |magazine=[[Adweek]] |date=February 18, 2005 |access-date=October 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/16/entertainment/et-stewart16 |title=Jon Stewart, Comedy Central Sign Deal |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=February 18, 2005 |access-date=October 8, 2008}}</ref>

The deal spawned the ''Daily Show'' [[Spin-off (media) |spin-off]] ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and its replacement, ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]''. Other projects include the sitcom [[television pilot |pilot]] ''[[Three Strikes (TV series) |Three Strikes]]'', the [[documentary film |documentary]] ''Sportsfan'', the series ''[[Important Things with Demetri Martin]]'', and the film ''The Donor''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iff0ec139962d42d4152b670707cce783 |title=Stewart stamp on 'Martin' |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=October 3, 2007 |access-date=February 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516180516/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3iff0ec139962d42d4152b670707cce783 |archive-date=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>

On directing, Stewart noted on ''[[Employee of the Month (podcast) |Employee of the Month]]'' that ''The Daily Show'' influenced his directing process more than his acting gigs did. He said, "It's about the collaboration. It's about understanding. Doing a show taught me this process of clarity of vision, but the flexibility of process. So know your intention, know where you're wanting to go with the scene with the way that you want it to go, the momentum shifts, the emphasis, where you want it to be."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jon-stewart-is-ready-for-next-iteration-of-the-daily-show-20150220#ixzz3SxWwIEKR |title=Jon Stewart Is Ready for 'Next Iteration' of 'Daily Show' - Rolling Stone |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=March 13, 2015}}</ref> He also expressed interest in directing more films.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Hilary |last2=Simmons |first2=Ted |title=Jon Stewart Reveals Hopes For 'Daily Show' Successor, Talks Future Plans |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jon-stewart-reveals-hopes-daily-775586 |website=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

Stewart got into a [[Twitter]] war with then-candidate [[Donald Trump]], who in multiple tweets stated that Stewart's changing his name from his birth name indicated that Stewart was a fraud. Stewart and some analysts considered this to be [[anti-Semitic]]. Trump then tweeted that Stewart should be "proud of his heritage", and Stewart tweeted back, facetiously, that Trump's real name was "Fuckface Von Clownstick" and that Trump should be proud of the "Clownstick heritage".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/jon-stewart-calls-action-against-trump-colbert-551226 |title=Jon Stewart thinks Trump can make America great ... just not the way you might think |date=February 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gq.com/story/jon-stewart-donald-trump-burns |title=Jon Stewart's Latest Donald Trump Burns Will Make You Really, Really Miss Jon Stewart |first=Rohan |last=Nadkarni |date=May 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2015/06/17/jon_stewarts_dream_just_came_true_donald_trump_running_is_a_gift_from_heaven/ |title=Jon Stewart's dream just came true: Donald Trump running is a "gift from heaven" |first=Colin |last=Gorenstein |date=June 17, 2015 |website=Salon}}</ref>

==Criticism of television journalists==
Stewart is known as an outspoken, humorous critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular, those of the [[Media of the United States |U.S. media]] [[broadcast networks]] such as [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], and [[MSNBC]]. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his "[[news satire]]" desk;<ref name="serious">{{cite magazine |last=Tucker |first=Ken |author-link=Ken Tucker |date=November 1, 2004 |title=You Can't Be Serious! |url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/10180/ |magazine=[[New York (magazine) |New York]] |access-date=July 26, 2006}}</ref><ref name="CNN041015">{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html |title=CNN Crossfire |access-date=April 23, 2008 |publisher=CNN}}</ref> Stewart asserts that neither his show nor Comedy Central purport to be anything other than satire and comedy.<ref name="CNN041015" />

===''Crossfire'' appearance===
In a televised exchange with then-CNN correspondent [[Tucker Carlson]] on ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program) |Crossfire]]'' on October 15, 2004, Stewart criticized the state of television journalism and pleaded with the show's hosts to "stop hurting America", and he referred to both Carlson and co-host [[Paul Begala]] as "[[Partisan (political) |partisan]] hacks".<ref name="CNN041015" /><ref>{{cite video |people=Jon Stewart, Tucker Carlson |title=[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program) |Crossfire]] |medium=Television |publisher=CNN |date=2004}}</ref> When posted on the internet, this exchange became widely viewed and was a topic of much media discussion.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=aFQFB5YpDZE Jon Stewart on ''Crossfire''], October 15, 2004, Youtube</ref>

Despite being on the program to comment on current events, Stewart immediately shifted the discussion toward the show itself, asserting that ''Crossfire'' had failed in its responsibility to inform and educate viewers about politics as a serious topic. Stewart stated that the show engaged in partisan hackery instead of honest debate, and said that the hosts' assertion that ''Crossfire'' is a debate show is like "saying [[professional wrestling |pro wrestling]] is a show about athletic competition". Carlson responded by saying that Stewart criticizes news organizations for not holding public officials accountable, but when he interviewed [[John Kerry]], Stewart asked a series of "softball" questions (Stewart has acknowledged he voted for Kerry in the [[2004 United States presidential election |2004 presidential election]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/25/ST2008082503384.html |title=No Joke: Jon Stewart Takes Aim At 24-Hour Cable News 'Beast' |newspaper=washingtonpost.com |date=August 25, 2008 |access-date=September 17, 2010 |first=Howard |last=Kurtz}}</ref> Stewart responded that he didn't realize "the news organizations look to Comedy Central for their cues on integrity". When Carlson continued to press Stewart on the Kerry issue, Stewart said, "You're on CNN! The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers |puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?" In response to prods from Carlson, "Come on. Be funny." Stewart said, "No, I'm not going to be your monkey." Later in the show when Carlson jibed, "I do think you're more fun on your show", Stewart retorted, "You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show." In response to Stewart's criticisms, Carlson said, "You need to get a job at a journalism school", to which Stewart responded, "You need to go to one!"<ref name="CNN041015" />

Stewart discussed the incident on ''The Daily Show'' the following Monday:

So I go to ''Crossfire'' and, let's face it, I was dehydrated, it's the [[Martin Lawrence#Legal issues and health problems |Martin Lawrence]] defense ... and I had always in the past mentioned to friends and people that I meet on the street that I think that show ... um ... blows. So I thought it was only the right thing to do to go say it to them personally on their program, but here's the thing about confronting someone with that on their show: They're ''there!'' Un''com''fortable! And they were very mad, because apparently, when you invite someone on a show called ''Crossfire'' and you express an opinion, they don't care for that ... I told them that I felt their show was hurting America and they came back at me pretty good, they said that I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, "I know that, but tomorrow I will go back to being funny, and your show will still blow."<ref name="serious"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Stewart |first=Jon |title=Your Show Blows |publisher=[[Comedy Central]] |date=October 18, 2004 |url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/mr122o/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-your-show-blows |access-date=June 12, 2019 |work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart}}</ref>}}

In January 2005, CNN announced that it was canceling ''Crossfire''. When asked about the cancellation, CNN's incoming president, [[Jonathan Klein (CNN) |Jonathan Klein]], referred to Stewart's appearance on the show: "I think he made a good point about the noise level of these types of shows, which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day."<ref>{{cite news |last=Kurtz |first=Howard |title=Carlson & 'Crossfire,' Exit Stage Left & Right |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 6, 2004 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52274-2005Jan6.html |access-date=July 26, 2006 |author-link=Howard Kurtz}}</ref>

On March 18, 2009, Carlson wrote a blog entry for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' criticizing Stewart for his handling of the CNBC controversy (see below). Carlson discussed the CNN incident and claimed that Stewart remained backstage for at least "an hour" and "continued to lecture our staff", something Carlson described as, "one of the weirdest things I have ever seen".<ref>{{cite web |first=Tucker |last=Carlson |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-18/how-jon-stewart-went-bad |title=How Jon Stewart Went Bad |date=March 18, 2009}}</ref>

===Criticism of CNBC===
{{Main |Jon Stewart–Jim Cramer conflict}}
Stewart again became a [[Viral phenomenon |viral internet phenomenon]] following a March 4, 2009, ''The Daily Show'' sequence. CNBC canceled [[Rick Santelli]]'s scheduled appearance on ''The Daily Show'' that day, so the show ran a short segment showing CNBC giving poor investment advice.<ref>{{cite news |last=Linkins |first=Jason |title=Jon Stewart Eviscerates CNBC, Santelli On Daily Show |work=The Huffington Post |date=March 5, 2009 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/05/jon-stewart-eviscerates-c_n_172057.html |access-date=March 5, 2009}}</ref>

Subsequent media coverage of exchanges between Stewart and [[Jim Cramer]], who had been featured heavily in the original segment, led to a highly anticipated face-to-face confrontation on ''The Daily Show''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gold |first=Matea |title=Exclusive: Jim Cramer set to appear on ''The Daily Show'' Thursday |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 10, 2009 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/03/exclusive-jim-c.html |access-date=March 10, 2009}}</ref> The episode received much media attention and became the second most-viewed episode of ''The Daily Show'', trailing only the 2009 Inauguration Day episode.

===Criticism of Fox News===
Throughout his tenure on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart frequently accused [[Fox News]] of distorting the news to fit a [[Conservatism in the United States |conservative]] agenda, at one point ridiculing the network as "the meanest sorority in the world".<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/12/stewart-fox-news-is-the-m_n_496403.html |title=Stewart: Fox News Is The Meanest Sorority In The World |date=March 12, 2010 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=April 25, 2010 |first=Dan |last=Abramson}}</ref> In November 2009, Stewart "called out" Fox News for using some footage from a previous [[Tea Party movement |Tea Party]] rally during a report on a more recent rally, making the latter event appear more highly attended than it was.

Stewart said that Carlson was dumbing herself down for "an audience who sees intellect as an elitist flaw".<ref name="Carlson episode">{{cite news |url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ahba3f/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-gretchen-carlson-dumbs-down |title=Gretchen Carlson Dumbs Down |date=December 8, 2009 |work=The Daily Show |access-date=April 25, 2010}}</ref>

Stewart stepped up his criticism of Fox News in 2010; within five months, ''The Daily Show'' had 24 segments criticizing the Fox News coverage.<ref name="Stelter"/> [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator) |Bill O'Reilly]], host of the talk show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' on Fox News, countered that ''The Daily Show'' was a "key component of left-wing television" and that Stewart loved Fox News because the network was "not boring".<ref name="Stelter"/>

During an interview with [[Chris Wallace]] on June 19, 2011, Stewart called Wallace "insane" for saying that Stewart's earlier comparison of the marketing techniques of a Sarah Palin campaign video and an anti-herpes medicine ad was a political comment. Stewart also said Fox viewers are the "most consistently misinformed" viewers of political media.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/19/jon-stewart-fox-news-sunday-video_n_879964.html |title=Jon Stewart LIVE On Fox News, Tells Host 'You're Insane' (VIDEO) [UPDATE&#93; |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |access-date=September 16, 2012 |date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> This comment was ranked by the fact-checking site, [[PolitiFact]], as false, with conditions.

In 2014, Stewart engaged in an extended "call-out" of Fox News, based on their perceived hypocritical coverage of [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program |food stamps]] and U.S. government assistance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/v9wjc4/fox-news-welfare-academy |title=Fox News Welfare Academy - The Daily Show - Video Clip |publisher=Thedailyshow.cc.com |date=March 13, 2014 |access-date=August 24, 2014}}</ref> This culminated in segments across multiple episodes, specifically singling out [[Sean Hannity]] and his show's coverage of the [[Bundy standoff]].

==Advocacy==

===9/11 First Responders Bill===
[[File:911Presser 092519 (37 of 62) (46489501124).jpg |thumb |Stewart speaking at a press conference for the 9/11 first responders in 2019]] 
Over the years Stewart sometimes used ''The Daily Show'' to argue for causes such as the treatment of [[veteran]]s and [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks |9/11 first responders]]. He is credited with breaking a Senate deadlock over a bill to provide [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act |health care]] and [[Social programs in the United States |benefits]] for 9/11 emergency workers; the bill passed three days after he featured a group of 9/11 responders on the show. In March 2009, he criticized a White House proposal to remove veterans from Veterans Administration roles if they had private health insurance; the White House dropped the plan the next day.<ref name="Samuelsohn"/> In 2010, Stewart held an interview with a panel of four of the 9/11 first responders Kenny Specht with the [[FDNY]], Chris Bowman [[NYPD]], Ken George [[Department of Transportation |DOT]], and Kevin Denlin, Operating Engineer of Heavy Equipment, who discussed their health problems with Stewart. In 2015 four months after leaving ''The Daily Show'' he returned to reunite the four, with Specht as the only panelist healthy enough to attend. Devlin had died and the two other panelists, Bowman and George, were too ill to make it to the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ems1.com/ems-advocacy/articles/jon-stewart-reconvenes-panel-of-911-first-responders-VJLSkjUpBQlvXvN8/ |title=Jon Stewart reconvenes panel of 9/11 first responders |website=EMS1 |access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/nuwe6u/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-9-11-first-responders-react-to-the-senate-filibuster |title=9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS REACT TO THE SENATE FILIBUSTER |website=[[Comedy Central]] |access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref>

In February and June 2019, he again went to Congress to oppose the $7.375 billion limit in pay-outs to 9/11 responders through December 2020 and to lobby for permanent funding for the Victims Compensation Fund past December 2020, delivering a tearful testimony.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/jon-stewart-blasts-congress-failure-fund-9-11-victim-program-n975776 |title=Jon Stewart blasts Congress' failure to fund 9/11 victim program |last=Tsirkin |first=Julie |date=February 25, 2019 |work=NBC News |access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref><ref name="9-11-CBS-June19">{{cite news |last1=Tillett |first1=Emily |last2=Segers |first2=Grace |title=Jon Stewart lashes out at hearing on 9/11 responders bill: "You should be ashamed of yourselves" |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/victim-compensation-fund-jon-stewart-lashes-out-at-house-hearing-on-911-responders-bill-you-should-be-ashamed-of/ |access-date=11 June 2019 |work=[[CBS News]] |date=June 11, 2019}}</ref>

Stewart continued to be a vocal advocate appearing on late night shows such as ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', ''[[The Daily Show with Trevor Noah]]'', and news programs such as ''[[Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace]]'', and ''[[Fox Report |The Fox Report with Shepherd Smith]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/16/jon-stewart-continues-to-push-congress-on-behalf-of-9-11-victims-1365861 |title=Jon Stewart continues to push Congress on behalf of 9/11 Victims |website=[[Politico]] |access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref> On July 12, 2019 the House approved the bill overwhelmingly 402–12.

==Writers Guild of America strike of 2007–2008==
Stewart was an important factor in the unionization of the [[Comedy Central]] writers. ''The Daily Show'' writers were the first of Comedy Central's writers to be able to join the guild, after which other shows followed.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=April 23, 2008 |url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=2387 |title=Comedy Central Writers Win WGA Contract |publisher=[[Writers Guild of America |WGA]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102203818/http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=2387 |archive-date=January 2, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |access-date=April 23, 2008 |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/legal-services/4465402-1.html |title=Union Deal for 'Daily Show' Writers |publisher=AllBusiness.com}}</ref>

Stewart supported the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]]. On ''The Daily Show'' episode just before the strike, he sarcastically commented about how Comedy Central had made available all episodes for free on their website, but without advertising, and said, "go support our advertisers". The show went on hiatus when the strike began, as did other late-night talk shows. Upon Stewart's return to the show on January 7, 2008, he refused to use the title, ''The Daily Show'', stating that ''The Daily Show'' was the show made with all of the people responsible for the broadcast, including his writers. During the strike, he referred to his show as, ''A Daily Show with Jon Stewart'', until the strike ended on February 13, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |date=January 18, 2008 |access-date=September 4, 2016 |url=http://www.today.com/id/22571544/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/colbert-stewart-make-do-without-writers/ |title=Colbert, Stewart make do without writers |publisher=Today}}</ref>

Stewart's choice to return to the air did bring criticism that he was undermining the writers of his show. [[Seth MacFarlane]] wrote an inside joke into an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' about this, causing Stewart to respond with an hour-long call in which he questioned how MacFarlane could consider himself the "moral arbiter" of Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morgan |first=Piers |title=Seth MacFarlane Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrcOge6pMhg |publisher=CNN}}</ref> Other former writers of ''The Daily Show'' such as [[David Feldman (comedian) |David Feldman]] also have indicated that Stewart was anti-union at the time and punished his writers for their decision to unionize.<ref>{{cite web |last=David |first=Feldman |title=Former Daily Show Writer Accuses Jon Stewart of Punishing His Writers For Forming A Union |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union/ |publisher=Patheos |access-date=May 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=David |first=Feldman |title=Former Daily Show Writer Accuses Jon Stewart of Punishing His Writers For Forming A Union |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926234305/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2012/05/is-jon-stewart-anti-union |archive-date=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

The Writers Guild Strike of 2007–08 also was responsible for a notable mock [[The Colbert/O'Brien/Stewart feud |feud]] between Stewart, [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Conan O'Brien]] in early 2008. Without writers to help fuel their banter, the three comedians concocted a [[fictional crossover |crossover]]/rivalry to garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert claimed that because of "the Colbert bump", he was responsible for [[Mike Huckabee]]'s success in the [[2008 U.S. presidential election |2008 presidential race]]. O'Brien claimed that he was responsible for Huckabee's success because not only had he mentioned Huckabee on his show, but also that he was responsible for [[Chuck Norris]]'s success (Norris backed Huckabee). In response, Stewart claimed that he was responsible for the success of O'Brien since Stewart had featured him on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and in turn, the success of Huckabee. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows. The feud ended on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' with a mock brawl involving the three hosts.<ref>[http://www.today.com/id/23017599 Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud], February 5, 2008</ref>
