===2019 "Uplifting" controversy===

On 11 June 2019, the news website [[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] published a series of stories including a documentary called ''The Uplift'' criticizing Oranga Tamariki's practice of "uplifting" or separating children from their parents. Newsroom argued that Oranga Tamariki's "uplifting" policies disproportionately targeted [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pacific Islander|Pasifika]] children, claiming that three Māori babies were being "uplifted" from their mothers a week. According to Newsroom's report, 70% of children "uplifted" in 2018 came from Māori and Pasifika backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news |title=NZ’s own ‘taken generation’ |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/@investigations/2019/06/11/629363/nzs-own-taken-generation |accessdate=18 June 2019 |publisher=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |date=11 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stone |first1=David |title=An injustice we can no longer tolerate |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2019/06/11/629438/david-stone-on-uplift |accessdate=18 June 2019 |publisher=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |date=11 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jennings |first1=Mark |title=Baby uplift case breached legal processes |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2019/06/11/629437/baby-uplift-case-breached-legal-processes |accessdate=18 June 2019 |publisher=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]] |date=11 June 2019}}</ref>

On 22 August 2019, Oranga Tamariki signed an agreement with the North Island [[iwi]] [[Ngāi Tūhoe]] to ensure that fewer Māori children end up in state care.
