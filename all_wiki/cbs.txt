'''CBS''' is an American [[commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[television network|television]] and [[radio network]] owned by [[ViacomCBS]] through its CBS Entertainment Group division. The network is headquartered at the [[CBS Building]] in [[New York City]], with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the [[CBS Broadcast Center]]) and [[Los Angeles]] (at [[CBS Television City]] and the [[CBS Studio Center]]).

The name "CBS" is an initialism of its former legal name that was used from 1928 to 1974, '''Columbia Broadcasting System'''. CBS is also sometimes referred to as the '''Eye Network''', in reference to the company's trademark symbol, in use since 1951. It has also been called the "Tiffany Network", alluding to the perceived high quality of its programming during the tenure of [[William S. Paley]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Westinghouse Bids for Role In the Remake: CBS Deal Advances TV's Global Reach|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/02/news/02iht-cbs_0.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=August 2, 1995|accessdate=March 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403105014/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/02/news/02iht-cbs_0.html|archive-date=April 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> It can also refer to some of CBS's first demonstrations of [[color television]], which were held in a former [[Tiffany & Co.]] building in New York City in 1950.<ref>According to a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' piece on November 9, 1950, "the first local public demonstrations of color television will be initiated Tuesday by the Columbia Broadcasting System. Ten color receivers are being installed on the ground floor of the former Tiffany building at 401 Fifth Avenue, near Thirty-seventh Street, where several hundred persons can be accommodated for each presentation".</ref>

The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc., a radio network founded in Chicago by New York City [[talent agent]] [[Arthur Judson]] in January 1927. In April of that year, the Columbia Phonograph Company, parent of the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] record label, invested in the network, resulting in its rebranding as the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System (CPBS). In early 1928, Judson and Columbia sold the network to Isaac and Leon Levy, two brothers who owned [[WPHT|WCAU]], the network's Philadelphia affiliate, as well as their partner Jerome Louchheim. They installed Paley, an in-law of the Levys, as president of the network. With the Columbia record label out of ownership, Paley rebranded the network as the Columbia Broadcasting System.<ref>{{cite news|title=William S. Paley, Who Built CBS Into a Communications Empire, Dies at 89|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/obituaries/william-s-paley-who-built-cbs-into-a-communications-empire-dies-at-89.html?pagewanted=all|author=Jeremy Gerard|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 28, 1990|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116110012/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/obituaries/william-s-paley-who-built-cbs-into-a-communications-empire-dies-at-89.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=November 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Under Paley's guidance, CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States, and eventually one of the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three American broadcast television networks]]. In 1974, CBS dropped its original full name and became known simply as '''CBS, Inc.''' The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired the network in 1995, renaming its corporate entity '''CBS Broadcasting, Inc.''' two years later, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become [[CBS Corporation]]. In 2000, CBS came under the control of [[Viacom (1952–2006)|the original incarnation of Viacom]], which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its broadcast television, radio and select [[cable television]] and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]] through [[National Amusements]], which also controlled [[Viacom (2005–2019)|the second incarnation of Viacom]] until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|agreed to re-merge]] to become ViacomCBS. Following the sale, CBS and its other broadcasting and entertainment assets were reorganized into a new division, CBS Entertainment Group.

CBS operated the [[CBS Radio]] network until 2017, when it sold its radio division to [[Entercom]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-11-17|title=Entercom Finalizes Merger With CBS Radio, Becoming No. 2 Radio Operator in US|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8039439/entercom-cbs-radio-merger-finalized-no-2-radio-operator|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Billboard}}</ref>  Before this, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio of [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated radio stations]] in large and mid-sized markets, as well as its [[network affiliate|affiliated]] radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom,<ref>{{Cite news|date=2017-02-02|title=CBS to merge its radio business with Entercom|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-entercom-comm-m-a-cbs-corp-idUSKBN15H1MW|access-date=2020-07-16}}</ref> CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly; however, it still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and to the new owners of its former radio stations, and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has over 240 owned-and-operated and affiliated television stations throughout the United States, some also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in [[Canada–United States border|border areas]] over-the-air.

==History==
===Early radio years===
The origins of CBS date back to January 27, 1927, with the creation of the United Independent Broadcasters network in Chicago by New York City [[talent agent]] [[Arthur Judson]]. The fledgling network soon needed additional investors, and the Columbia Phonograph Company, manufacturers of [[Columbia Records]], rescued it in April 1927. Now the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System, the network went to air under its new name on September 18, 1927, with a presentation by the Howard L. Barlow Orchestra<ref name=bartow>{{cite book|title=A Tower in Babel: A History of Broadcasting in the United States to 1933|author=[[Erik Barnouw]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|page=222|year=1966|isbn=978-0-19-500474-8}}</ref> from [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] [[WOR-AM|WOR]] in Newark, and fifteen affiliates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Digest/1927/Radio-Digest-1927-09.pdf|title=Columbia System Ready to Go|work=Radio Digest|issue=Vol. XXII Number 2|date=September 1927|pages=5 and 20|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}</ref>

Operational costs were steep, particularly the payments to [[AT&T]] for use of its landlines, and by the end of 1927, Columbia Phonograph wanted out.<ref name=bartow223>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 223</ref> In early 1928 Judson sold the network to brothers Isaac and Leon Levy, owners of the network's Philadelphia affiliate [[WPHT|WCAU]], and their partner Jerome Louchheim. None of the three were interested in assuming day-to-day management of the network, so they installed wealthy 26-year-old William S. Paley, son of a Philadelphia cigar family and in-law of the Levys, as president. With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to "Columbia Broadcasting System".<ref name=bartow223/> He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's [[La Palina]] cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio.<ref name=bartow224>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 224</ref> By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.<ref name=berg>{{cite book|title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting|url=https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg|url-access=registration|author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Co.|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg/page/59 59]|isbn=978-0-451-61966-2}} Page numbers in this article refer to the first paperback edition, May 1981</ref>

====Turnaround: Paley's first year====
During Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to [[Alfred H. Grebe]]'s [[Atlantic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) for the small Brooklyn station [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] (no relation to the current [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]), which would become the network's flagship station. WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=berg56>Bergreen, p. 56. The station changed frequencies again to 880 kHz in the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s 1941 [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|reassignment of stations]]; in 1946, WABC was renamed [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]].</ref> The physical plant was also relocated to [[Steinway Hall]] on West 57th Street in [[Manhattan]], where much of CBS's programming would originate. By the turn of 1929, the network had 47 affiliates.<ref name=berg/>

Paley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing. In the fall of 1928, he entered into talks with [[Adolph Zukor]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], who planned to move into radio in response to [[RCA]]'s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.<ref name=berg61>Bergreen, p. 61</ref> The deal came to fruition in September 1929; Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8&nbsp;million at the time.<ref name=bartow224/> The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back for a flat $5&nbsp;million by March 1, 1932, provided that CBS had earned $2&nbsp;million during 1931 and 1932.<ref name=berg61/> For a brief time, there was talk that the network might be renamed "Paramount Radio", but it only lasted a month as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] sent all stock value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who had no alternative but to "turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years... This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born."<ref name=berg61/> The near-bankrupt film studio sold its CBS shares back to the network in 1932.<ref name=bartow251>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 261</ref> In the first year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from $1.4&nbsp;million to $4.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=halfirst>[[David Halberstam|Halberstam, David]] (1979).

[[File:WmSPaley1939.jpg|thumb|left|Paley's management saw a twentyfold increase in gross income in his first decade.]]

Much of the increase was a result of Paley's effort to improve affiliate relations. There were two types of program at the time: sponsored and sustaining, i.e., unsponsored. Rival network [[NBC]] paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried, and charged them for every sustaining show they ran.<ref name=bargoldfirst>{{cite book |title=The Golden Web: A History of Broadcasting in the United States, 1933–1953|url=https://archive.org/details/goldenwebhistory00barn|url-access=registration|author=[[Erik Barnouw]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|year=1968|page=[https://archive.org/details/goldenwebhistory00barn/page/57 57] |isbn= 978-0-19-500475-5}}</ref> It was onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs. Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible:<ref name=halfirst/> he would ''give'' the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so.<ref name=bargoldfirst/> CBS soon had more affiliates than either [[NBC Red Network|NBC Red]] or [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]].<ref>In 1943, the FCC would force NBC to sell off its Blue network, which then became ABC. Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 190</ref>

Paley valued style and taste,<ref name=hal26>Halberstam, pp. 26–27</ref> and in 1929, once he had his affiliates happy and his company's creditworthiness on the mend, he relocated his company to the sleek, new 485 [[Madison Avenue]], the "heart of the advertising community, right where Paley wanted his company to be",<ref name=berg60>Bergreen, p. 60</ref> and where it would stay until its move to its own [[Eero Saarinen]]-designed headquarters, the CBS Building, in 1965. When his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg60/>

====CBS takes on the Red and the Blue (1930s)====
[[File:Kate Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wholesome [[Kate Smith]], Paley's choice for ''La Palina Hour'', was unthreatening to home and hearth]]

Since NBC was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief [[David Sarnoff]] approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, or were on "[[clear-channel station|clear channel]]" frequencies. Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his and his affiliates' success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.<ref name=halfirst/>

Paley had an innate sense of entertainment. [[David Halberstam]] wrote that he had "a gift of the gods, an ear totally pure",<ref name=hal26a>Halberstam, p. 26</ref> and knew "what was good and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would not sell, and he never confused one with another."<ref name=hal24>Halberstam, p. 24</ref> As the 1930s loomed closer, Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the home to many popular musical and comedy stars, among them [[Jack Benny]] ("Your [[Canada Dry]] Humorist"), [[Al Jolson]], [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Kate Smith]], whom Paley had personally selected for his family's ''[[La Palina]] Hour'' as she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives.<ref name=berg69>Bergreen, p. 69</ref> When Paley heard a phonograph record of [[Bing Crosby]], then a young unknown crooner, on a mid-ocean voyage, he rushed to the ship's radio room and cabled New York to sign Crosby immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.<ref>Halberstam, p. 26, and Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 273</ref>

While the CBS primetime lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes&nbsp;– and into the hearts and minds of American women. For many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of female-interest products.<ref name=berg63>Bergreen, p. 63</ref> Starting in 1930, astrologer [[Evangeline Adams]] would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays, a description of their problems, and a boxtop from sponsor Forhan's toothpaste.<ref name=bartow240>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 240</ref> The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, backed by a tender violin, "made him a soul mate to millions of women"<ref name=bartow2401>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 240–241</ref> on behalf of the [[R. J. Reynolds]] tobacco company, whose cellophane-wrapped [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]] cigarettes were "as fresh as the dew that dawn spills on a field of clover".<ref name=bartow241>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 241</ref> The most popular radio-friend of all was M. Sayle Taylor, the ''Voice of Experience'', though his name was never uttered on air.<ref name=bartow241/> Women mailed descriptions of the most intimate of relationship problems to the Voice in the tens of thousands per week; sponsors Musterole ointment and Haley's M–O laxative enjoyed sales increases of several hundred percent in just the first month of ''The Voice of Experience''{{'}}s run.<ref name=bartow242>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 242</ref>

[[File:Chaplin cbs 1933.jpg|thumb|left|When [[Charlie Chaplin]] finally allowed the world to hear his voice after 20 years of mime, he chose to do it on CBS.]]

As the decade progressed, a new genre joined the daytime lineup: serial drama [[soap opera]]s, so named for the products that sponsored them. These were usually in quarter-hour episodes and proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s. They all had the same basic premise, namely that characters "fell into two categories: 1) those in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble. The helping-hand figures were usually older."<ref name=bargol96>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 96</ref> At CBS, ''[[Just Plain Bill]]'' brought human insight and [[Anacin]] pain reliever into households; ''[[Your Family and Mine]]'' came courtesy of [[Sealtest Dairy]] products; ''[[Bachelor's Children]]'' first hawked Old Dutch Cleanser, then [[Wonder Bread]]; ''[[Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories]]'' was sponsored by [[Spry Vegetable Shortening]]. ''[[Our Gal Sunday]]'' (Anacin again), ''[[The Romance of Helen Trent]]'' (Angélus cosmetics), ''[[Big Sister (radio)|Big Sister]]'' ([[Rinso]] laundry soap), and many others filled the daytime ether.<ref>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 94n9</ref>

[[File:CBS radio hollywood.JPG|thumb|The CBS West Coast headquarters in [[Columbia Square]] reflected its industry stature while hosting its top Hollywood talent.]]

Thanks to its daytime and primetime schedules, CBS prospered in the 1930s. In 1935, gross sales were $19.3&nbsp;million, yielding a profit of $2.27&nbsp;million.<ref name=bargol62>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 62</ref> By 1937, the network took in $28.7&nbsp;million and had 114 affiliates,<ref name=halfirst/> almost all of which cleared 100% of network-fed programming, thus keeping ratings, and revenue, high. In 1938 CBS even acquired the [[American Record Corporation]], parent of its one-time investor Columbia Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=LPs historic|url=http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html|publisher=Musicinthemail.com|accessdate=February 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426151404/http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html|archive-date=April 26, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1938, NBC and CBS each opened studios on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Hollywood in order to attract the entertainment industry's top talent to their networks.<ref name=berg99>Bergreen, p. 99</ref>

====CBS launches an independent news division====
The extraordinary potential of radio news showed itself in 1930, when CBS suddenly found itself with a live telephone connection to a prisoner called "the Deacon", who described, from the inside and in real time, a riot and conflagration at the [[Ohio Penitentiary Fire|Ohio Penitentiary]]; for CBS, it was "a shocking journalistic coup".<ref name=berg105>Bergreen, p. 105</ref> Yet as late as 1934, there was still no regularly scheduled newscast on network radio; "most sponsors did not want network news programming; those that did were inclined to expect veto rights over it."<ref name=bargol17>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 17</ref> There had been a longstanding wariness between radio and the newspapers as well; the papers had rightly concluded that the upstart radio business would compete with them in both advertising dollars and news coverage. By 1933, the newspapers began fighting back, many no longer publishing radio schedules for readers' convenience, or allowing their own news to be read on the air for radio's profit.<ref name=bargol18>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 18</ref> Radio, in turn, pushed back when urban department stores, newspapers' largest advertisers and themselves owners of many radio stations, threatened to withhold their ads from print.<ref name=bargol22>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 22</ref> A short-lived truce in 1933 even saw the papers proposing that radio be forbidden from running news before 9:30&nbsp;a.m., and then only after 9:00&nbsp;p.m., and that no news story could air until it was 12 hours old.<ref name=bargol21>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 21</ref>

[[File:CBSNewsRemote1937.jpg|thumb|left|[[CBS News]] engineers prepare a remote: Justice [[Hugo Black]]'s 1937 denial of [[Ku Klux Klan]] ties.]]

It was in this climate that Paley set out to "enhance the prestige of CBS, to make it seem in the public mind the more advanced, dignified and socially aware network".<ref name=berg90>Bergreen, p. 90</ref> He did it by sustaining programming of the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[Norman Corwin]]'s drama, and an in-house news division to gather and present news, free of fickle suppliers such as the newspapers or [[wire service]]s.<ref name=berg90/> In the fall of 1934, CBS launched an independent news division, shaped in its first years by Paley's vice-president, former ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist Ed Klauber, and news director [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]]. Since there was no blueprint or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years to bring live feeds of European events to its American air.<ref name=bartow2456>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 245–246</ref>

A key early hire was [[Edward R. Murrow]] in 1935; his first corporate title was Director of Talks. He was mentored in microphone technique by [[Robert Trout]], the lone full-time member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with his boss White.<ref name=berg107>Bergreen, p. 107</ref> Murrow was glad to "leave the hothouse atmosphere of the New York office behind"<ref name=berg109>Bergreen, p. 109</ref> when he was dispatched to London as CBS's European Director in 1937, when the growing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] menace underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described Murrow in London as "the right man in the right place in the right era".<ref name=hal38>Halberstam, p. 38</ref> Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists who would become known as the "[[Murrow Boys]]", including such men as [[William L. Shirer]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Bill Downs]], and [[Eric Sevareid]]. They were "in [Murrow's] own image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas all".<ref name=berg110>Bergreen, p. 110</ref> They covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves. On March 12, 1938, Hitler boldly [[Anschluss|annexed nearby Austria]], and Murrow and the Boys quickly assembled coverage with Shirer in London, [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] in Paris, [[Pierre Huss]] in Berlin, [[Frank Gervasi]] in Rome, and Trout in New York.<ref name=bargol78>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 78</ref> This bore the now-ubiquitous ''[[CBS World News Roundup|News Round-Up]]'' format.

Murrow's nightly reports from the rooftops during the dark days of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]] galvanized American listeners. Even before [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]], the conflict became "the story of the survival of Western civilization, the most heroic of all possible wars and stories. He was indeed reporting on the survival of the English-speaking peoples."<ref name=hal39>Halberstam, p. 39</ref> With his "manly, tormented voice",<ref name=berg112>Bergreen, p. 112</ref> Murrow contained and mastered the panic and danger he felt, thereby communicating it all the more effectively to his audience.<ref name=berg112/> Using his trademark self-reference "this reporter", he did not so much report news as interpret it, combining simplicity of expression with subtlety of nuance.<ref name=bargol140>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 140</ref><ref name=berg112/> Murrow himself said he tried to "describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting the intelligence of the professor".<ref name=berg112/> When he returned home for a visit late in 1941, Paley threw an "extraordinarily elaborate reception"<ref name=berg114>Bergreen, p. 114</ref> for Murrow at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]. This reception also served as an announcement to the world that Paley's network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other people's programming and had now become a cultural force in its own right.<ref name=berg1145>Bergreen, pp. 114–115</ref>

When the war was over and Murrow returned for good, it was as "a superstar with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within his company".<ref name=hal40>Halberstam, p. 40</ref> He possessed enormous capital within that company, and as the unknown form of television news loomed large, he would spend it freely, first in radio news, then in television, first taking on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], then eventually – and unsuccessfully – William S. Paley himself.<ref name=bargol276>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 276</ref>

On October 30, 1938, CBS gained a taste of infamy when ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' broadcast a radio adaptation of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', performed by [[Orson Welles]]. Its unique format, a contemporary version of the story in the form of faux news broadcasts, told listeners that invaders from Mars were actually invading and devastating [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]], despite three disclaimers during the broadcast stating that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on faux news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', becoming ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' to sell soup.<ref name=bargol88>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 88</ref> Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as "the Mercury Theatre's own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'"<ref name=berg96>Bergreen, p. 96</ref>

====CBS recruits Edmund A. Chester====
Before the United States joined [[World War II]], in 1940, CBS recruited [[Edmund Albert Chester, Sr.|Edmund A. Chester]] from his position as Bureau Chief for Latin America at the [[Associated Press]] to serve as Director of Latin American Relations and Director of Short Wave Broadcasts for the CBS radio network. In this capacity, Chester coordinated the development of the Network of the Americas (La Cadena de las Americas) with the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs|Office for Inter-American Affairs]] (chaired by [[Nelson Rockefeller]]), and the [[Voice of America]] as part of President Roosevelt's support for [[Pan-Americanism]] during World War II.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx00pQIkclMC&pg=PA166&dq=Eva+Garza&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXg_qkiPnZAhVFPN8KHbynAMAQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Edmund%20Chester&f=false ''Dissonant Divas In Chicana Music: The Limits of La Onda''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109230902/https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx00pQIkclMC&pg=PA166&dq=Eva+Garza&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXg_qkiPnZAhVFPN8KHbynAMAQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Edmund%20Chester&f=false |date=January 9, 2020 }} Deborah R.

====Zenith of network radio (1940s)====
As 1939 wound down, Paley announced that 1940 would be "the greatest year in the history of radio in the United States".<ref name=bargol139>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 139</ref> Indeed, the 1940s would turn out to be the apogee of network radio by every metric. Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines;<ref name=bargol138>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 138</ref> wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers and thus print advertisements, causing a shift toward radio sponsorship.<ref name=bargol165>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 165</ref> A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit,<ref name=bargol165/> which sent even automobile and tire manufacturers&nbsp;– who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production&nbsp;– scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.<ref name=bargol166>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 166</ref> In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped.<ref name=berg167>Bergreen, p. 167</ref>

CBS in the 1940s was vastly different from that of its early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired, or simply left the network.<ref name=berg168>Bergreen, p.168</ref> No change was greater than that in Paley himself, who had become difficult to work for, and had "gradually shifted from leader to despot".<ref name=berg168/> He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his hope was that CBS "could somehow learn to run itself".<ref name=berg168/> His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits and 100 shirts, and had special racks for 100 neckties.<ref name=hal31>Halberstam, p. 31</ref>

[[File:FrankStantonCBSPrez.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Frank Stanton, second only to Paley in his impact on CBS, president 1946–1971.]]

As Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was "a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker".<ref name=berg169>Bergreen, p. 169</ref> He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis "A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior" to CBS top brass, and they responded with a job offer.<ref name=berg170>Bergreen, p. 170</ref> He scored an early hit with his study "Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally", which CBS salesmen used to great effect, bringing in new sponsors.<ref name=berg170/> In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful but impeccable wardrobe&nbsp;– slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron&nbsp;– made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice president, "the greatest argument we have for color television".<ref name=berg171>Bergreen, p. 171</ref>

Despite the influx of advertisers and their money – or perhaps because of them – the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's chain broadcasting investigation, often called the "monopoly probe".<ref name=bargol168>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 168</ref> Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman [[James L. Fly]].<ref name=bargol1689>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 168–169</ref> By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's 1928 affiliate contract, which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time&nbsp;– the ''network option''&nbsp;– came under attack as being restrictive to local programming.<ref name=bargol171>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 171</ref> The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during the daytime, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.<ref name=bargol171/> Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to [[Music Corporation of America]], and it became Management Corporation of America.<ref name=bargol172>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 172</ref>

[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Arthur Godfrey spoke directly to listeners, making him the foremost pitchman in his era.]]

On the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[God Bless America]]", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith.<ref name=bargol155>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 155</ref> Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review, but most did not.<ref name=bargol156>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 156</ref> The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), as well as news about war production or troop, ship, or plane movements, and live man-on-the-street interviews. The ban on ad-libbing caused quizzes, game shows, and amateur hours to wither for the duration.<ref name=bargol156/>

Surprising was the "granite permanence" of the shows at the top of the ratings.<ref name=bargol284>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 284</ref> The vaudevillians and musicians who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been huge in the 1930s; Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Edgar Bergen]] all had been on the radio almost as long as there had been network radio.<ref name=bargol285>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 285</ref> A notable exception to this was relative newcomer [[Arthur Godfrey]], who was still doing a local morning show in Washington, D.C. as late as 1942.<ref name=berg179>Bergreen, p. 179</ref> Godfrey, who had been a cemetery lot salesman and a cab driver, pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an individual, with a singular "you" rather than phrases like "Now, folks..." or "Yes, friends...".<ref name=berg180>Bergreen, p. 180</ref> His combined shows contributed as much as 12% of all CBS revenues; by 1948, he was making $500,000 a year.<ref name=berg179/>

In 1947, Paley, still the undisputed "head talent scout" of CBS,<ref name=berg169/> led a much-publicized "talent raid" on NBC. One day, while [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable ''[[Amos and Andy]]'' series, Paley came to the door with an astonishing offer: "Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much."<ref name=berg181>Bergreen, p. 181</ref> Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a ''coup'', but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, [[Charlie McCarthy]], and [[Red Skelton]], as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, who was radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.<ref name=berg181/> CBS would buy the stars' names as a property in exchange for a large lump sum and salary.<ref name=bargol245>Barnouw, p. 245</ref> The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.<ref name=berg181/>

As a result of this, CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings in 1949,<ref name=berg183>Bergreen, p. 183</ref> but it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he and all of radio had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s&nbsp;– television.

====Primetime radio gives way to television (1950s)====
[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]

In the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system.<ref name=berg153>Bergreen, p. 153.

Shortly after ruling in favor of NBC, FCC chairman Charles Denny resigned from the FCC to become vice president and general counsel of NBC: Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 243</ref> In 1946, only 6,000 television sets were in operation, most in greater New York City where there were already three stations; by 1949, the number had increased to 3&nbsp;million sets, and by 1951, had risen to 12&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg1589>Bergreen, pp. 158–159</ref> There were 64 American cities with television stations, though most of them only had one.<ref name=bargol295>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 295</ref>

Radio continued to be the backbone of the company in the early 1950s, but it was "a strange, twilight period" where some cities had often multiple television stations which siphoned the audience from radio, while other cities such as Denver and Portland had no television stations at all.  In those areas, as well as rural areas and some entire states, network radio remained the sole nationally broadcast service.<ref name=bargol285/> NBC's venerable [[Fred Allen]] saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart ABC's game show ''Stop The Music!''; within weeks, he was dropped by longtime sponsor [[Ford Motor Company]] and was shortly gone from the scene.<ref name=bargol2878>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 287–288</ref> Radio powerhouse [[Bob Hope]]'s ratings plunged from a 23.8 share in 1949 to 5.4 in 1953.<ref name=bargol288>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 288</ref> By 1952, "death seemed imminent for network radio" in its familiar form;<ref name=bargol290>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 290</ref> most tellingly, the big sponsors were eager for the switch.

Gradually, as the television network took shape, radio stars began to migrate to the new medium. Many programs ran on both media while making the transition. The radio soap opera ''[[Guiding Light|The Guiding Light]]'' moved to television in 1952, where it would run for another 57 years; Burns & Allen, back "home" from NBC, made the move in 1950; [[Lucille Ball]] a year later; ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' in 1952 (though it continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life). The high-rated ''[[The Jack Benny Program|Jack Benny Program]]'' ended its radio run in 1955, and Edgar Bergen's Sunday night show went off the air a year later. In 1956, CBS announced that its radio operations had lost money, while the television network had made money.<ref name=berg230>Bergreen, p. 230</ref> When the soap opera ''[[Ma Perkins]]'' went off the air on November 25, 1960, only eight series remained, all relatively minor. Primetime radio ended on September 30, 1962, when ''[[Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar]]'' and ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' aired for the final time.<ref name=dun742>{{cite book|title=On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio|author=[[John Dunning (radio historian)|John Dunning]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|year=1998|page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/742 742]|isbn=0-19-507678-8|url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/742}}</ref>

====CBS's radio programming after 1972====
The retirement of Arthur Godfrey in April 1972 marked the end of long-form programming on CBS radio; programming thereafter consisted of hourly news summaries and news features, known in the 1970s as ''Dimension'', and commentaries, including the ''Spectrum'' series that evolved into the "Point/Counterpoint" feature on the television network's ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and ''First Line Report'', a news and analysis feature delivered by CBS correspondents. The network also continued to offer traditional radio programming through its nightly ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'' during week. This was the lone holdout of dramatic programming, which ran from 1974 to 1982, though shorter runs were given to the ''[[General Mills Radio Adventure Theater]]'' and the ''[[Sears Radio Theater]]'' in the 1970s; otherwise, most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious stations.<ref name=dun143>Dunning, p. 143</ref> The CBS Radio Network continues to this day, offering hourly newscasts, including its centerpiece ''CBS World News Roundup'' in the morning and evening, its weekend sister program ''[[CBS News Weekend Roundup]]'', the news-related feature segment ''[[Charles Osgood|The Osgood File]]'', ''What's in the News'', a one-minute summary of one story, and various other segments such as commentary from Seattle radio personality [[Dave Ross]], tip segments from various other sources, and technology coverage from [[CBS Interactive]] property [[CNET]].

===Television years: expansion and growth===
{{redirect|CBS Television|other uses|CBS Television (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Cbs-building.jpg|thumb|right|[[CBS Building|CBS Headquarters]] in New York City.]]

CBS's involvement in television dates back to the opening of experimental station W2XAB in New York City on July 21, 1931, using the [[mechanical television]] system that had more or less been perfected in the late 1920s. Its initial broadcast featured New York mayor [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.

Announcer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single shortwave channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter atop the [[Chrysler Building]], broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=W2XAB – CBS, New York|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|publisher=Earlytelevision.org|accessdate=October 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018041706/http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|archive-date=October 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Color Television System Chronology|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|publisher=Novia.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Broadcasting construction permit|construction permit]] and program authorization as WCBW. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, an hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now [[WNBC]]), making it the second authorized, fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the "first".

During World War II, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Towards the end of the war, however, it began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years: the local stations of NBC, CBS and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]. As RCA and DuMont raced to establish networks and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system. The FCC putting an indefinite [[Federal Communications Commission#"Freeze" of 1948|"freeze"]] on television licenses that lasted until 1952 did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago, and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, in which CBS&nbsp;– as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market&nbsp;– quickly purchased a 50% interest, partnering with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship station of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property KNX), later to become [[KCBS-TV]]. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer Chicago television station WBKB, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would again become a sister company of CBS decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to [[WBBM-TV]], moving the CBS affiliation away from [[WGN-TV]].

WCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) in a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1950, only to sell its stake to the newspaper in 1954 due to tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in Milwaukee (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WVTV]]) and WHCT in Hartford (now [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVN]]). However, as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] and WTIC-TV (now [[WFSB]]).

In Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate [[WCAN-TV]] (now defunct) first signed on the air. Prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on [[WTMJ-TV]], an NBC affiliate since 1947. In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, which it had purchased several months earlier. In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to WITI, the city's newer VHF station at the time. In turn, CBS shut down WXIX, sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station.  The first WITI-CBS union only lasted exactly two years, as the network moved its programming to [[WISN-TV]] on April 2, 1961, with WITI taking the ABC affiliation; the two stations reversed the network swap in March 1977, with WITI returning to the CBS station lineup. CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to an [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with New World Communications]] in 1994; it is now affiliated with [[WDJT-TV]] in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS of any Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming.

More long-term, CBS bought stations in Philadelphia ([[WCAU]], now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now [[KMOV]]), but would eventually sell these stations off as well. Before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now [[KPLR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Handshake|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-09-09-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=September 9, 1957|page=5}}</ref>

CBS did attempt to sign on a station in Pittsburgh after the freeze was lifted, as it was the sixth-largest market at the time, but had just one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day [[WPGH-TV]] and [[WINP-TV]]) or [[Public broadcasting|public television]] ([[WQED (TV)|WQED]]). Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby Steubenville, Ohio and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate [[WTOV-TV]]), CBS did score a major coup when Pittsburgh-based [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]], co-founder of NBC, bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled [[KDKA-TV]] with CBS instead of NBC (like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] radio) due to NBC extorting and coercing Westinghouse to trade [[KYW (AM)|KYW]] radio and WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) for Cleveland stations [[WTAM]], WTAM-FM (now [[WMJI]]), and WNBK (now [[WKYC]]); the trade ended up being reversed by order of the FCC and the Department of Justice in 1965 after an eight-year investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philadelphia Circle is Complete/Nine-year history of that trade in Philadelphia|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1964/1964-08-03-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |date=August 3, 1964|pages=23–25}}</ref> Had CBS not been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now [[WPXI]]) once it signed on in 1957 instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pittsburgh Ch. 11 Grantee to be CBS-TV Primary Outlet|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1955/1955-06-20-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=June 20, 1955|pages=89–90}}</ref> This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between Westinghouse and CBS.

====Programming (1945–1970)====
The mid-1940s "talent raid" on NBC had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television programs as well. One reluctant CBS star refused to bring her radio show ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' to television unless the network would recast the show with her real-life husband in the lead. ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' debuted in October 1951, and was an immediate sensation, with 11&nbsp;million of the 15&nbsp;million total television sets watching (a 73% [[Ratings share|share]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-i-love-lucy-dominated-222960 |title=How 'I Love Lucy' Dominated Ratings From Its Start |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 15, 2011 |access-date=July 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924184358/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-i-love-lucy-dominated-222960 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Paley and network president Frank Stanton had so little faith in the future of Lucille Ball's series that they granted her wish and allowed her husband [[Desi Arnaz]] to take financial control of the comedy's production.

CBS dominated television, now at the forefront of American entertainment and information, as it once had radio.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} In 1953, the CBS television network would make its first profit,<ref name="CC">{{cite web|title=Paley, William S|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/paleywillia.htm|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|access-date=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015417/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/paleywillia.htm|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and would maintain dominance on television between 1955 and 1976.<ref name="CC"/> By the late 1950s, the network often controlled seven or eight of the slots on the "top ten" ratings list with well-respected shows such as ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.

Under [[James T. Aubrey]] (1958–1965), CBS was able to balance prestigious television projects (befitting the "Tiffany Network" image), with more low culture, broad appeal programs. As such, the network had challenging fare like ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', and ''[[East Side/West Side]]'', as well as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', and ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.classictvhistory.com/EpisodeGuides/east_side_west_side.html|title=East Side/West Side|work=classictvhistory.com|last=Bowie|first=Stephen|accessdate=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015806/http://www.classictvhistory.com/EpisodeGuides/east_side_west_side.html|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

This success would continue for many years, with CBS being bumped from first place only due to the rise of ABC in the mid-1970s. Perhaps because of its status as the top-rated network, CBS felt freer to gamble with controversial properties like the ''[[Smothers Brothers|Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[All in the Family]]'' (and its many spinoffs) during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

====Programming: "Rural purge" and success in the 1970s and early-mid 1980s (1971–1986)====
{{Main|Rural purge}}

By the end of the 1960s, CBS was very successful in [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]], but many of its shows, including ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'', and ''[[Green Acres]]'', were appealing to older and more rural audiences, rather than to the young, urban, and more affluent audiences that advertisers sought to target. [[Fred Silverman]], who would later head [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later [[NBC]], made the decision to cancel most of those otherwise hit shows by mid-1971 in what became colloquially referred to as the "[[rural purge]]", with ''Green Acres'' cast member [[Pat Buttram]] remarking that the network cancelled "anything with a tree in it".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ken Berry interview|url=http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|work=KenBerry.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20000903070554/http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2000|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtehLu1cissC&pg=PA203|author=Anthony Harkins|page=203|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005|accessdate=March 23, 2009|isbn=0-19-518950-7}}</ref>

While the "rural" shows got the axe, new hits like ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', <!--''[[The Waltons]]'', - - - this is not a rural show? -->''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'', and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]'' took their place on the network's schedule and kept it at the top of the ratings through the early 1970s. The majority of these hits were overseen by then-East Coast vice president [[Alan Wagner]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|title=Alan Wagner, 76, First President of the Disney Channel, Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/arts/22wagner.html?_r=2&pagewanted=print|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|author=Dennis Hevesi|date=December 22, 2007|accessdate=June 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116110359/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/arts/22wagner.html?_r=2&pagewanted=print|archive-date=November 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> ''60 Minutes'' also moved to the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. slot on Sundays in 1975, and became the first ever primetime television news program to enter the Nielsen Top 10 in 1978.

One of CBS's most popular shows during the period was ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', which ran for 11 seasons from 1972 to 1983, and was based on the hit [[Robert Altman]] [[MASH (film)|film of the same name]]. The 2{{frac|1|2}}-hour [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|series finale]], in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125&nbsp;million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the most watched television episode in the United States. It also held the distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history, until it was surpassed by the [[Super Bowl]], which has taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game alternates between being broadcast by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).

Silverman also first developed his strategy of [[spin-off (media)|spinning new shows off]] from established hit series while at CBS, with ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' spun from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' from ''[[All in the Family]]'', and ''[[Good Times]]'' from ''Maude''. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped to second place behind ABC in the 1976–77 season, but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones, including ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', and ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', which was the biggest hit of the early 1980s and holds the record for the most watched non-series finale television episode in the U.S.&nbsp;– the primetime telecast of the [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolution episode]] of the internationally prominent "[[Who Shot J.R.?]]" cliffhanger on November 21, 1980.

By 1982, ABC had run out of steam and NBC was in dire straits, with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president. CBS nosed ahead once more thanks to the major success of ''Dallas'' (and its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]''), as well as hits in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Simon & Simon]]'', and ''60 Minutes''. CBS also acquired the broadcast rights to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1982, which it now broadcasts every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed CBS/Kane Productions International. The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years, including ''[[Kate & Allie]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'', ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''. However, this resurgence was short-lived, as CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by [[Ted Turner]], which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by [[Loews Corporation|Loew's Inc.]] chairman [[Laurence Tisch]]. Collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as chief operating officer and Paley returning as chairman.<ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990"/>

====Programming: Tiffany Network in distress (1986–2002)====
By the end of the [[1987–88 United States network television schedule|1987–88 season]], CBS had fallen to third place behind both ABC and NBC for the first time. In 1984, ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Miami Vice]]'' debuted on NBC and immediately garnered high ratings, allowing NBC to rise back to first place by the [[1985–86 United States network television schedule|1985–86 season]] with a slate that included several other hits such as ''[[Amen (TV series)|Amen]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts Of Life]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'', and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''. ABC had also rebounded with hits such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Growing Pains]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Roseanne]]''.

Some of the groundwork had been laid as CBS fell in the ratings, with hits ''Simon & Simon'', ''Falcon Crest'', ''Murder, She Wrote'', ''Kate & Allie'', and ''Newhart'' still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence, and to-be-hits ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', and newsmagazine ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'' all debuting in the late 1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for ''60 Minutes'', ''Dallas'', and ''Knots Landing''. During the early 1990s, the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the [[Major League Baseball on CBS|broadcast television rights]] to [[Major League Baseball]] from ABC and NBC, and the [[Olympics on CBS|Winter Olympics]] from ABC, despite losing the [[National Basketball Association]] to NBC after the 1989–90 NBA season.

Under network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'', ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', ''[[Picket Fences]]'', and a resurgent ''Jake and the Fatman''. CBS was briefly able to reclaim first place during the [[1992–93 United States network television schedule|1992–93 season]]. However, the network's programming slate skewed toward an older demographic than ABC, NBC, or even the fledgling Fox network. A common joke during this period was that CBS was "the network for the living dead".<ref name="tvtropes.org">{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|title=CBS (Creator) - TV Tropes|publisher=|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209025436/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|archive-date=February 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1993, the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|late-night talk show]] franchise to compete with NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' when it signed [[David Letterman]] away from NBC after the ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' host was passed over as [[Johnny Carson]]'s successor on ''Tonight'' in favor of [[Jay Leno]].

Despite having success with the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', CBS as a whole suffered in 1993. The network lost the rights to two major sports leagues; it terminated its rights to the MLB after losing approximately $500&nbsp;million over a four-year span, and the league reached a new contract with NBC and ABC. On December 17, 1993, in a move that surprised many media analysts and television viewers, Fox&nbsp;– then a fledgling network which had begun to accrue several popular programs in the Nielsen Top 20 during its seven years on air&nbsp;– outbid CBS for the broadcast rights to the [[National Football Conference]], stripping CBS of [[National Football League]] telecasts for the first time since CBS began broadcasting games from the pre-[[AFL-NFL merger|merger]] NFL in 1955. Fox bid $1.58&nbsp;billion for the NFC television rights, significantly higher than CBS's reported offer of $290&nbsp;million to retain the contract.<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC Gets Final N.F.L.

The network attempted to fill its loss of the NFL by going after the rights to the [[National Hockey League]], which it again lost to Fox.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Outbids CBS for N.H.L.

The loss of the NFL, along with an ill-fated effort to court younger viewers, led to a drop in CBS's ratings. One of the affected shows was the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind ABC's ''[[Nightline]]''. As a result, NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which had previously been dominated by the ''Late Show'', became the top-rated late-night talk show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman in London, Seeking Boost at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1995|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822063316/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|archive-date=August 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> However, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s such as ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' (which moved to the network from NBC), ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'', ''[[Cybill (TV series)|Cybill]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.

During the [[1997–98 United States network television schedule|1997–98 season]], CBS attempted to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy block known as the [[CBS Block Party]]. This block consisted of shows like ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'', and ''[[The Gregory Hines Show]]'', all but the last coming from [[Miller-Boyett Productions]]. The lineup failed to compete against ABC's [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] lineup, as ''Meego'' and ''Hines'' were canceled by November. That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Games]] in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]].

In 1997, CBS regained the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the [[American Football Conference]], effective with the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS mood positively 'electric' after reconnecting with NFL Intercepting AFC games caps network's comeback from rights turnover in '94|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|last=Kent|first=Milton|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502212451/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|archive-date=May 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The contract was struck shortly before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, spurred in part by the turnaround of the [[New England Patriots]] during the 2000s. With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in the [[1998–99 United States network television schedule|1998–99 season]], although it was beaten by ABC the following year. The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as ''[[The King of Queens]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[Judging Amy]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''.

====Programming: Return to first place and rivalry with Fox (2002–present)====
Another turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000, when it debuted the summer reality shows ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (US)|Big Brother]]'', which became surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the [[Survivor: The Australian Outback|second season]] of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXV]], and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot) to follow ''Survivor'' at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup.

During the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals, several of which were produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. These included ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', and ''[[The Mentalist]]'', along with ''CSI'' spinoffs ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'', and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', as well as the reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of ''CSI'', briefly led it to retake first place in the ratings from NBC during the [[2002–03 United States network television schedule|2002–03 season]]. The 2000s also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and the relatively short-lived but acclaimed ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.

CBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the [[2005–06 United States network television schedule|2005–06 season]]. The next year, Fox overtook CBS for first place, becoming the first non-[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States. Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on ''[[American Idol]]'' (the longest reigning number-one primetime U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]]. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the [[2008–09 United States network television schedule|2008–09 season]], where it has remained every season since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Television (TV) Ratings: Network Primetime Averages|url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|work=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023543/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18–34, 18–49, and 25–54 demographics. ''NCIS'', which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama during the 2007–08 season.

The 2010s saw additional hits for the network, including drama series ''[[The Good Wife]]''; police procedurals ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'', and ''NCIS'' spin-off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''; reality series ''[[Undercover Boss (American TV series)|Undercover Boss]]''; and sitcoms ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. ''The Big Bang Theory'', one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer [[Chuck Lorre]], started off with modest ratings, but saw its viewership skyrocket, earning ratings of up to 17&nbsp;million viewers per episode. It became the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the [[2010–11 United States network television schedule|2010–11 season]], as well as the second most watched U.S. television program by the [[2013–14 United States network television schedule|2013–14 season]], when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, ''Two and a Half Men'' saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star [[Charlie Sheen]] and the addition of [[Ashton Kutcher]] as its primary lead.

Until 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18–49, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the [[2012–13 United States network television schedule|2012–13 season]], CBS was able to take the top spot in the demographic, as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012–13 season, the tenth season of ''NCIS'' took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, giving CBS its first top-rated show since the 2002–03 season, when ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' led Nielsen's seasonal primetime network ratings.

The strength of CBS's [[2013–14 United States network television schedule|2013–14]] slate led to a surplus of series on its [[2014–15 United States network television schedule|2014–15 schedule]], with 21 series held over from the previous season along with eight new series, including moderate hits in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', and ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]''. The network also aired midseason hits ''[[The Odd Couple (2015 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' and ''CSI'' spinoff ''[[CSI: Cyber]]''. CBS also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with the [[NFL Network]] to carry [[Thursday Night Football]] games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS-NFL marriage extended to Thursday nights in 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/02/05/cbs-thursday-tv-games-nfl-network/5227869/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710032146/https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/02/05/cbs-thursday-tv-games-nfl-network/5227869/|archive-date=July 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

====CBS television news operations====
{{main|CBS News}}
Upon becoming commercial station WCBW in 1941, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 and 7:30&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, anchored by Richard Hubbell. Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW, usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off, took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening and to give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941, and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 was "unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.

In May 1942, WCBW, like almost all television stations, sharply cut back its live program schedule and canceled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily because much of the staff had either joined the service or had been redeployed to war-related technical research, as well as because it was necessary to prolong the life of the cameras, which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]] and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everett Holles 1944 WCBW Newscast|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|work=Indiana University Archives|access-date=March 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906063204/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|archive-date=September 6, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the war, WCBW, which changed its call letters to [[WCBS-TV]] in 1946, introduced expanded news programs on its schedule. These were first anchored by Milo Boulton and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor; the nightly [[Lowell Thomas]] NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) for a time in the early 1940s, and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City area. In contrast, the ''NBC Television Newsreel'', the NBC television network's offering at the time which premiered in February 1948, was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories. In 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of [[Edmund A. Chester]], who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events, and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.

In 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts the following year, thanks to a new [[coaxial cable]] connection. As such, Edwards used the greeting "Good evening everyone, coast to coast". The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins Of Television News In America|chapter=The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television|author=Mike Conway|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York City}}</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.

====Color technology (1953–1967)====
Although CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, in part because its color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA&nbsp;– then the parent company of NBC&nbsp;– made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits, and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.

The specials included the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' programs (which included the first ever telecast of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''), as well as the 1957 telecast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'', [[Cole Porter]]'s musical version of ''[[Aladdin (TV special)|Aladdin]]'', and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''{{'}}s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. The ''Nutcracker'' telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a one-hour German-American version hosted by [[Eddie Albert]], shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the popular [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] production from 1977 to 1981.

Beginning in 1959, ''The Wizard of Oz'' became an annual tradition on color television. It had been the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', which became the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''Cinderella'', and ''Aladdin''.

From 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as ''The Wizard of Oz'', and only if the sponsor would pay for it. In the early 1960s, Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color using a converted movie studio. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was forced to sell it. Rival NBC was pushing for the use of color at the time. Even ABC had several color programs beginning in the fall of 1962, although those were limited due to financial and technical issues the network was going through. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy|White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy]], which was broadcast in black and white.

Beginning in 1963, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball, who realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication. Even this show, however, was broadcast in black and white through the end of the [[1964–65 United States network television schedule|1964–65 season]]. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the [[1965–66 United States network television schedule|1965–66 season]] and complete the transition to the format during the [[1966–67 United States network television schedule|1966–67 season]]. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was ''[[The Twentieth Century (TV series)|The Twentieth Century]]'', which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, but even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS, which had reluctantly purchased a handful of the early RCA color cameras from its archrival in the 1950s, began deploying the new color studio cameras from [[Philips]] by 1965, which bore the [[Norelco]] brand name at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|title=Norelco Cameras – Eyes Of A Generation…Television's Living History|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002233035/http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. This version, starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]] in the roles formerly played by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Jon Cypher]], was shot on videotape (at its [[Television City]] complex in Los Angeles) rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.

In 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', and the film moved to NBC beginning the following year. However, in 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' twice in 1991, in March and again the night before Thanksgiving. Thereafter, it was broadcast the night before Thanksgiving.

By the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.

==Conglomerate==
Prior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions, such as American Record Corporation and Hytron, had mostly related to its broadcasting business. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS did operate a CBS-Columbia division, which manufactured phonographs, radios, and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, and CBS never achieved much success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio [[Terrytoons]] from its founder [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]], not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network, but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for [[20th Century Fox]] well into the 1960s.

During the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio and looked for suitable investments. Their acquisitions eventually led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions. In 1965, CBS acquired electric guitar maker [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from [[Leo Fender]], who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes electric pianos]], which had already been acquired by Fender. The quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms "pre-CBS" to refer to products of higher quality and "CBS" for mass-produced products of lower quality.

In other diversification attempts, CBS would buy and later sell a variety of other properties. This included sports teams, especially the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club; book and magazine publishers, such as [[Fawcett Publications]], which included ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]); map-makers and toy manufacturers like [[Gabriel Toys]], Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy, and Ideal; [[X-Acto]];<ref>{{cite web |title=History of The House of Miniatures Brand |url=http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |accessdate= |first=Colin |last=Michael |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327203550/http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and distributors of educational films and [[film strips]], namely Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California. CBS eventually merged the two film companies into a single company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early [[home video]] system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.

William Paley attempted to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually, he gained Paley's confidence and, with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the ax. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the [[CBS Technology Center]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and had evolved to become the company's technology research and development unit.

Through its [[CBS Productions]] unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's ''[[Caroline in the City]]''.

===Columbia Records===
{{main|Columbia Records}}
Columbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched [[CBS Records International]] to market Columbia recordings outside of North America, where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of the Columbia Broadcasting System.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lieverson to Helm Group; Other Changes Made in the CBS Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc.|pages=1, 10|date=June 18, 1966|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122152333/http://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|archive-date=November 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS sold the CBS Records Group to [[Sony]] on November 17, 1987, initiating a Japanese buying spree of American companies, including [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach Co.]], [[Rockefeller Center]], and even the [[Empire State Building]], which continued into the 1990s. The record company was rechristened as [[Sony Music|Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991, as Sony had a short-term license on the CBS name.

Sony purchased its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the United States, Canada, Spain and Japan from [[EMI]]. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004 as [[Sony BMG]]; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] in 2006.

===Publishing===
In 1967, CBS entered the publishing business by acquiring [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]], a publisher of trade books and textbooks, as well as the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company [[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] and merged it with Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of ''[[Road & Track]]'' and ''[[Cycle World]]''. CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as ''Woman's Day''. In 1982, CBS acquired British publisher [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] from [[Macmillan Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Unit Acquired by CBS| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190901192756/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-date = September 1, 2019| url-status = live}}</ref> In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by [[Ziff Davis]].

CBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]]; the U.S. trade book division, renamed [[Henry Holt and Company]], was sold to the West German publisher [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]]. Cassell was sold in a management buyout.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Philip Sturrock| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = http://www.philipsturrock.com/experience.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180822234057/http://philipsturrock.com/experience.html| archive-date = August 22, 2018| url-status = dead}}</ref> CBS exited the magazine business through the sale of the unit to its executive Peter Diamandis, who later sold the magazines to [[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]] in 1988, forming [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.]]

===CBS Musical Instruments division===
Forming the CBS Musical Instruments division, the company also acquired Fender (1965–1983), Electro-Music Inc. ([[Leslie speaker]]s) (1965–1980), [[Rogers Drums]] (1966–1983), [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos (1972–1985), [[Gemeinhardt]] flutes, [[Lyon & Healy]] harps (in the late 1970s), [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]] (institutional) organs, and [[Gulbransen]] home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt [[ARP Instruments]], a developer of electronic synthesizers.

It is widely held that the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly between 1965 and 1985, outraging Fender fans. Because of this, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985, and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.

===Film production===
{{Main|CBS Films}}
CBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, when they created [[Cinema Center Films]]. The studio released such films as the 1969 [[Steve McQueen]] drama ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]'' and the 1970 [[Albert Finney]] musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''. This profitless unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via [[CBS Home Entertainment]]) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication; most other ancillary rights remain with CBS.

Ten years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS tried again to break into the film industry by co-founding [[TriStar Pictures]], a [[joint venture]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[HBO]]. Despite releasing box office successes such as ''[[The Natural]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'', and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', CBS felt the studio was not making a profit, and sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent [[The Coca-Cola Company]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125165839/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|archive-date=January 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to re-enter the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name had been used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used as CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.

===Home video===
CBS entered into the home video market when it partnered with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to form [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1978. The joint venture was dissolved in 1982, after MGM purchased [[United Artists]]. CBS later partnered with 20th Century Fox to form [[CBS/Fox Video]]. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.

===CBS Toys Division===

The CBS Toys Division of CBS Inc. purchased Child Guidance, Creative Playthings of Framingham, Massachusetts and Hagerstown, Maryland; Gilbert; Gym-Dandy of Bossier City, Louisiana; Hubley; Ideal; Kohner; and Wonder Products of Collierville, Tennessee.<ref>[https://www.toyassociation.org/App_Themes/tia/pdfs/events/centenary/theycametoplay.pdf] The  Toy Industry Association | Page 85</ref><ref>[https://cpsc.gov/manufacturer/gabriel-industries] Creative Playthings, a unit of Gabriel Industries, a division of CBS Inc., New York, N.Y.</ref>

CBS entered the [[video game]] market briefly through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys). It published several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name CBS Electronics for the [[Atari 2600]] and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first karaoke players. CBS Electronics also distributed all [[Coleco]]-related video game products in Canada, including the [[ColecoVision]]. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to [[View-Master]], which eventually ended up as part of [[Mattel]].

===New owners===
By the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, as well as the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, the first of which were reportedly [[KDFX-CD|KDFX]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], and [[KECY-TV|KECY]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], which made the switch in August 1994. Many other television markets lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.

====Westinghouse Electric Corporation====
In the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] partially in reaction to a [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|1994 agreement]] between Fox and [[New World Pictures|New World Communications]], which resulted in the loss of many of CBS's longtime affiliates owned by New World.

In response, CBS began affiliating with UHF stations in Detroit and Cleveland, namely former Fox affiliate [[WOIO]] and low-rated ethnic independent WGPR-TV (now [[WWJ-TV]]), which CBS eventually purchased. This was, however, only after CBS failed to woo [[WXYZ-TV]] and [[WEWS-TV]], the respective longtime ABC affiliates in those markets (the latter of which had been a CBS affiliate from 1947 to 1955), to replace departing affiliates [[WJBK]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]]. The [[E. W. Scripps Company]] actually used this situation as leverage to sign a group-wide affiliation deal with ABC that kept the network on WXYZ and WEWS.<ref>{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; TV Stations Shift to ABC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 17, 1994|accessdate=October 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111215200/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|archive-date=November 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ABC pre-empts CBS in Cleveland, Detroit|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-06-20.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=June 20, 1994|page=7}}</ref>

Included in the Scripps deal was Baltimore NBC affiliate [[WMAR-TV]], which had been affiliated with CBS from 1948 to 1981. With this agreement, WMAR-TV was able to displace longtime ABC affiliate and Westinghouse-owned [[WJZ-TV]], which had long been the Baltimore market's dominant station, while WMAR-TV had been in a distant third and had even nearly lost its broadcast license in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|title=Smith family seeks to take Channel 2; WBFF owners' move could shift WMAR|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|author=David Zurawik|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=September 13, 1991|accessdate=March 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213185614/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|archive-date=December 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> WMAR-TV's loss of popularity did not sit well with Westinghouse. Even before the New World deal, the company had been seeking a group-wide affiliation deal of its own, but it accelerated the process after the Scripps–ABC agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business; Group W's Negotiations|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|page=8|date=July 11, 1994}}</ref>

In July 1994, Westinghouse signed a long-term deal to affiliate all five of its television stations, including WJZ-TV, with CBS.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS to Add Three Affiliates in Deal With Westinghouse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 1994|accessdate=July 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023121452/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|archive-date=October 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, Group W Form Historic Alliance|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-07-18.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=July 18, 1994|page=14}}</ref> [[KPIX]] in San Francisco and [[KDKA-TV]] in Pittsburgh were already longtime affiliates of the network, while [[KYW-TV]] in Philadelphia and [[WBZ-TV]] in Boston were longtime affiliates of NBC. The network decided to sell off its Philadelphia owned-and-operated station [[WCAU]] to NBC, even though it was rated much higher locally than KYW-TV at the time. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the KYW-TV swap was delayed after CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have resulted in massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia – Ken Matz|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423000255/http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|archive-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> To solve this, CBS, NBC, and Westinghouse, known also as Group W, entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in November 1994 (which was scheduled to take effect in the fall of 1995). NBC traded [[KCNC-TV]] in Denver and [[KUTV]] in Salt Lake City (which had been acquired by NBC earlier that year) to CBS in return for WCAU, which, for legal reasons, was considered an even trade. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded transmitter facilities in Miami, with the NBC-owned [[WTVJ]] moving to channel 6 and the CBS-owned WCIX moving to channel 4 as [[WFOR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, NBC changing channels.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|author=Tom Jicha|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=November 22, 1994|accessdate=March 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703093638/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|archive-date=July 3, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

On August 1, 1995, Westinghouse announced it was acquiring CBS outright for $5.4&nbsp;billion;<ref name="Westinghouse-CBS">{{cite news|title=CBS Agrees to Buyout Bid by Westinghouse : Entertainment: $5.4-billion merger would create biggest TV, radio empire.

Except for KUTV, which CBS sold to [[Four Points Media Group]] in 2007 and is now owned by [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.

Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS turned the combined company's [[all-news radio]] stations in New York City ([[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) and Los Angeles ([[KNX (AM)|KNX]] and [[KFWB]]) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations. WINS, which had pioneered the all-news format in 1965, generally restricts its news coverage to the five core [[Borough (New York City)|New York City boroughs]], while WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covers the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, Westinghouse's [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] began to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news. It often focused on business news so as to differentiate itself from [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]]. This lasted until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation resulted in CBS Radio's decision to move its all-sports network [[WSCR]] to WMAQ's signal and to sell off the former WSCR facility.

In 1997, Westinghouse acquired the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]], which owned more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9&nbsp;billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed upon the acquisition of [[the Nashville Network]] (now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) and [[Country Music Television]] from the [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]], and the creation of [[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]], which was later sold to [[Discovery Communications]]. CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network [[Telemundo Puerto Rico (TV channel)|CBS Telenoticias]].

Following the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network were handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed. Westwood One had previously purchased the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], NBC's radio networks, and the rights to use the "NBC Radio Networks" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks, and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. {{As of|2008}}, Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock. The same year the company purchased Infinity, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and its corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998, with the acquisition of [[American Radio Systems]] Corporation for $2.6&nbsp;billion.

In 1999, CBS paid $2.5&nbsp;billion to acquire [[King World Productions]], a television syndication company whose programs included ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. By the end of 1999, apart from the retention of rights to the name for brand licensing purposes, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past were gone.

====Viacom====
By the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant. However, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]], which had been created by CBS in 1952 as [[CBS Films, Inc.]] to syndicate old CBS series and was eventually spun off under the Viacom name in 1971, announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37&nbsp;billion. The takeover was completed on May 4, 2000, upon which Viacom became the second largest entertainment company in the world. Incidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.

====CBS Corporation, ViacomCBS, and CBS Studios====
Having assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there. As such, in 2005, Viacom announced it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities,<ref>{{cite news|title=Moonves ready to play hardball in Viacom split|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|author=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815051557/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|archive-date=August 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> with CBS becoming the center of CBS Corporation. As the legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and [[UPN]], the latter of which later merged with [[Time Warner]]-owned [[The WB|WB]] to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]; and CBS Radio); [[Paramount Television]]'s production operations (now known as [[CBS Television Studios]]); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]); [[Showtime Networks]]; [[Simon & Schuster]]; and [[Paramount Parks]], which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted [[MTV Networks]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Networks]], and [[Famous Music]], the last of which was sold to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007.

As a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split and other recent acquisitions, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades. These include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs produced by Paramount and others originally aired on competing networks such as ABC and NBC. Series and other material in this library include ''I Love Lucy'', ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (both the original and current remake), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (1963 TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (U.S. television rights only), ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder [[Lucasfilm]]), ''[[Evening Shade]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''), and the entire [[Terrytoons]] library from 1930 forward.

ViacomCBS is owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. [[Paramount Home Entertainment]] continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.

In August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more films and television and to become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. The deal was completed on December 4, 2019. ViacomCBS has a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|title=CBS, Viacom to Reunite as Media Giants Bulk Up for Streaming|date=2019-08-13|website=KTLA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218165956/https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CBS|CBS News|CBS Sports}}
{{As of|2013}}, CBS provides 87{{frac|1|2}} hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of primetime programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturday from 8:00 to 11:00&nbsp;p.m. and Sunday from 7:00–11:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific time (7:00–10:00&nbsp;p.m. Monday through Saturday and 6:00–10:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sunday in Central/Mountain time).

The network also provides daytime programming from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays, including a half-hour break for local news and features the game shows ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', [[soap opera]]s ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', and talk show ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]''.

[[CBS News]] programming includes ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. weekdays and Saturdays; nightly editions of ''[[CBS Evening News]]''; the Sunday political talk show ''[[Face the Nation]]''; early morning news program ''[[CBS Morning News]]''; and the newsmagazines ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'', and ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]''. On weeknights, CBS airs the talk shows ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.

[[CBS Sports]] programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS occasionally delays scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice most commonly seen with [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]. In addition to rights to sports events from major sports organizations such as the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]], and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]], CBS broadcasts the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', a sports [[anthology series]] which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to (or in some cases, in lieu of) a major sporting event.

===Daytime===
{{main|CBS Daytime}}
CBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4{{frac|1|2}} hours. It is the home of the long-running game show ''[[The Price Is Right]]'', which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by [[Bob Barker]] for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor and comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The network is also home to the current incarnation of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', hosted by singer and comedian [[Wayne Brady]].

CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's daytime lineup include ''Match Game'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10/25,000 Pyramid]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Card Sharks]]'', ''Family Feud'', and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', and ''Password''. Two long-running primetime-only games were the panel shows ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.

The network is also home to ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]'', a panel talk show similar in format to ABC's ''[[The View (American TV series)|The View]]''. It debuted in October 2010 and is hosted by moderator [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] with [[Marie Osmond]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], and [[Sheryl Underwood]]).

CBS Daytime airs two daytime soap operas each weekday: the hour-long series ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', which debuted in 1973, and the half-hour series ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', which debuted in 1987. CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] networks, carrying 3{{frac|1|2}} hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1982 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than ''Guiding Light'', notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', and ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]''.

===Children's programming===
{{Main|Children's programming on CBS}}
CBS broadcast the live-action series ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays until 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, CBS's children's programming has mostly focused on animated series such as reruns of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, as well as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. In 1997, CBS premiered ''[[Wheel 2000]]'', a children's version of the syndicated game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' which aired simultaneously on the [[Game Show Network]].

In September 1998, CBS began contracting the time period out to other companies to provide programming and material for its Saturday morning schedule. The first of these outsourced blocks was the ''[[CBS Kidshow]]'', which ran until 2000 and featured programming from Canadian studio [[Nelvana]]<ref name="Nick Jr. on CBS">{{cite news|title=CBS picks Nick mix|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/cbs-picks-nick-mix-1117782661/|last=Schneider|first=Michael|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 15, 2000|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730112321/http://variety.com/2000/tv/news/cbs-picks-nick-mix-1117782661/|archive-date=July 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> such as ''[[Anatole (TV series)|Anatole]]'', ''[[Mythic Warriors]]'', ''[[Rescue Heroes]]'', and ''[[Flying Rhino Junior High]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=CTV pacts for 3 Nelvana series|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/ctv-pacts-for-3-nelvana-series-1117489638/|last=Kelly|first=Brendan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 21, 1998|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730115119/http://variety.com/1998/tv/news/ctv-pacts-for-3-nelvana-series-1117489638/|archive-date=July 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After its agreement with Nelvana ended, the network then entered into a deal with [[Nickelodeon]] to air programming from its [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block beginning in September 2000, under the banner [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick Jr. on CBS]].<ref name="Nick Jr. on CBS"/> By the time of the deal, Nickelodeon and CBS were corporate sisters through the latter's then parent company Viacom as a result of its 2000 merger with CBS Corporation. From 2002 to 2005, live-action and animated Nickelodeon series aimed at older children also aired as part of the block under the name [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]].

Following the Viacom-CBS split, the network decided to discontinue the Nickelodeon content deal. In March 2006, CBS entered into a three-year agreement with [[DIC Entertainment]], which was acquired later that year by the [[Cookie Jar Group]], to program the Saturday morning time slot as part of a deal that included distribution of select [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] [[Formula One]] auto races.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cookie Jar and Dic Entertainment to Merge, Creating independent global children's entertainment and education powerhouse |url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080620.php |publisher=[[Cookie Jar Group]] |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531232059/http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080620.php |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cookie Jar Entertainment Expands Brand Portfolio, Talent and Global Reach with Closing of DIC Transaction|url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php |work=[[Cookie Jar Group]]|date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531231944/http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DIC Names Programming Chief for New CBS Block|url=http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=dic30706.htm |work=WorldScreen |date=March 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226231914/http://www.worldscreen.com/newscurrent.php?filename=dic30706.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Synergy not kid-friendly at Eye web|url=https://variety.com/2006/digital/markets-festivals/synergy-not-kid-friendly-at-eye-web-1117936466/|last=Guider|first=Elizabeth|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 19, 2006|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730115052/http://variety.com/2006/digital/markets-festivals/synergy-not-kid-friendly-at-eye-web-1117936466/|archive-date=July 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The ''KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS'' replaced ''Nick Jr. on CBS'' that September, with the inaugural lineup featuring two new first-run live-action programs, one animated series that originally aired in syndication in 2005, and three shows produced prior to 2006.

On July 24, 2013, CBS entered into an agreement with [[Litton Entertainment]], which already programmed a syndicated Saturday morning block exclusive to ABC stations and would later produce a [[One Magnificent Morning|block for CBS sister network The CW]] that would debut the following year, to launch a new Saturday morning block featuring live-action reality-based lifestyle, wildlife, and sports series.

===Specials===
====Animated primetime holiday specials====
CBS was the original broadcast network home of the animated primetime holiday specials based on the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip, beginning with ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' in 1965. Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel), beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own [[Saturday morning cartoon]] on the network, ''Garfield and Friends'', which ran from 1988 to 1995). ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', produced in [[stop motion]] by [[Rankin/Bass]], has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special first aired on NBC in 1964. {{as of|2011}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' are the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the ''Charlie Brown'' specials are now held by ABC, ''The Grinch'' rights by NBC, and the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials by [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|title=Boomerang &#124; Full Episodes of Your Family's Favorite Cartoons|website=Boomerang|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608084708/https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

All of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words "A CBS Special Presentation" were displayed in colorful lettering (the [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word "SPECIAL", in [[all caps]] and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', titled "Call to Danger" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the [[Miss USA]] pageants and the annual presentation of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by or under the supervision of longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]], who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]], who died in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |title=TDC Medal Winner— Lou Dorfsman |url=https://www.tdc.org/profiles/lou-dorfsman/ |website=tdc.org |publisher=The Type Directors Club |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>

====Classical music specials====
CBS was also responsible for airing the series of ''[[Young People's Concerts]]'', conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to [[classical music]] through the eloquent commentaries of Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several [[Emmy Award]]s, including two wins in 1961 and later in 1966,<ref>{{Citation|title=New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015418/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and were among the first programs ever broadcast from the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].

Over the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]''&nbsp;– two live telecasts of the George Balanchine [[New York City Ballet]] production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred [[Edward Villella]], [[Patricia McBride]] and [[Melissa Hayden (actress)|Melissa Hayden]]), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with [[Gelsey Kirkland]]&nbsp;– a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of ''Horowitz in Moscow'', a live piano recital by pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]], which marked his return to Russia after over 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' (televised at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. in [[Russia]]). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on [[PBS]]; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by [[Charles Kuralt]], but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1986, CBS telecast ''Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening'' in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of [[Carnegie Hall]] after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]].

====''Cinderella''====
In order to compete with NBC, which produced the televised version of the [[Mary Martin]] Broadway production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', CBS responded with a musical production of ''Cinderella'', with music by [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Based upon the [[Cinderella|classic Charles Perrault fairy tale]], it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for [[Julie Andrews]], who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100&nbsp;million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, [[Ginger Rogers]], and [[Walter Pidgeon]] among its stars; the remake also included the new song "Loneliness of Evening", which was originally composed in 1949 for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' but was not performed in that musical.<ref name=recreates>{{cite news|title=Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=February 19, 1966|edition=TV Week|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0057950|Cinderella (1965, TV)}}. Accessed February 8, 2010.</ref> This version was rebroadcast several times on CBS into the early 1970s, and is occasionally broadcast on various cable networks to this day; both versions are available on DVD.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====National Geographic====
CBS was also the original broadcast home for the primetime specials produced by the [[National Geographic Society]]. The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS&nbsp;– under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED&nbsp;– in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as [[Louis Leakey]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and [[Jane Goodall]], that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably [[Alexander Scourby]] during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the [[National Geographic Channel]], a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and [[Fox Cable Networks]]. The specials' distinctive theme music, by [[Elmer Bernstein]], was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.

====Other notable specials====
From 1949 to 2002, the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]], an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Bob Barker]], [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]], [[Willard Scott]] (although under contract with CBS's rival NBC) and [[Alex Trebek]].

The Miss USA [[beauty pageant]] aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an [[animal rights activist]] who eventually convinced producers of ''The Price Is Right'' to cease offering [[fur coat]]s as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996. The pageant's highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s, when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. pulchritude tops TV charts|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|page=P15|date=May 21, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pageant tops Nielsen ratings|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|page=P15|date=May 19, 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Beauty pageant most-watched show|publisher=The Globe and Mail Associated Press|page=P15|date=May 18, 1983}}</ref> Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20&nbsp;million to an average of 7&nbsp;million from 2000 to 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=There She Goes: Pageants Move to NBC|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|date=June 22, 2002}}</ref> In 2002, [[Donald Trump]] (owner of the Miss USA pageant's governing body, the [[Miss Universe Organization]]) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract,<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump moves pageants from CBS to NBC|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|page=2B|date=June 22, 2002}}</ref> which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trump's controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC: Done With Donald Trump, Miss USA, Miss Universe – Update|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/nbc-donald-trump-cancels-miss-usa-miss-universe-1201461913/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=July 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630174133/http://deadline.com/2015/06/nbc-donald-trump-cancels-miss-usa-miss-universe-1201461913/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

On June 1, 1977, it was announced that [[Elvis Presley]] had signed a deal with CBS to appear in a new television special. Under the agreement, CBS would videotape Presley's concerts during the summer of 1977; the special was filmed during Presley's final tour at stops in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] (on June 19) and [[Rapid City, South Dakota]] (on June 21 of that year). CBS aired the special, ''[[Elvis in Concert]]'', on October 3, 1977,<ref>{{cite web|title=Elvis in Concert |url=http://www.elvispresley.com.au/elvis/presley/elvis_in_concert.shtml |work=ElvisPresley.com.au |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504105529/http://elvispresley.com.au/elvis/presley/elvis_in_concert.shtml |archivedate=May 4, 2009 }}</ref> nearly two months after [[Death of Elvis Presley#Final year and death|Presley's death]] in his [[Graceland]] mansion on August 16.

Currently, [[New Jersey]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Delaware]] are the only U.S. states where CBS does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WCBS-TV and Philadelphia O&O KYW-TV; Delaware is served by KYW and [[Salisbury, Maryland]] affiliate [[WBOC-TV]]; and New Hampshire is served by [[Boston]] O&O [[WBZ-TV]] and [[Burlington, Vermont]] affiliate [[WCAX-TV]]).

CBS maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] ([[WSVF-CD]]), [[Palm Springs, California]] ([[KPSP-CD]]) and [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]] ([[WIYE-LD]]). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. CBS also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the largest CBS subchannel affiliate by market size is [[KHNL|KOGG]] in [[Wailuku, Hawaii]], which serves as a repeater of [[Honolulu]] affiliate [[KGMB]] (the sister station of KOGG parent KHNL).

[[Nexstar Media Group]] is the largest operator of CBS stations by numerical total, owning 49 CBS affiliates (counting satellites); [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna Media]] is the largest operator of CBS stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 CBS-affiliated stations (including affiliates in the larger markets in [[KHOU (TV)|Houston]], [[WTSP|Tampa]] and [[WUSA (TV)|Washington, D.C.]]) that reach 8.9% of the country.

In December 2018, the service was launched in Australia under the name '''10 All Access''', due to its affiliation with ViacomCBS-owned free to air broadcaster [[Network 10]]. Due to local programming rights, not all content is shared with its US counterpart, whilst the Australian version also features numerous full seasons of local Network 10 shows, all commercial-free.

It was announced in September 2020 that the service will be rebranded as '''Paramount+''' in early 2021, and will feature content from the wider [[ViacomCBS]] library following the re-merger between CBS and Viacom. The name will also be extended to international markets and services such as 10 All Access. <ref name="ParamountPlus">{{cite press release|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005412/en/ViacomCBS-Unveils-Brand-Upcoming-Global-Streaming-Service|title=ViacomCBS Unveils Brand for Upcoming Global Streaming Service: Paramount+|publisher=[[ViacomCBS]]|via=[[Business Wire]]|date=September 15, 2020|access-date=September 15, 2020}}</ref>

===CBSHD===
CBS's master feed is transmitted in [[1080i]] [[high-definition television|high definition]], the native resolution format for CBS Corporation's television properties. However, seven of its affiliates transmit the network's programming in [[720p]] HD, while seven others carry the network feed in [[480i]] [[standard definition]]<ref name=re/> either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry CBS programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed CBS affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.

CBS began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed CBS HD in September 1998, at the start of the [[1998–99 United States network television schedule|1998–99 season]]. That year, the network aired the first NFL game broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]–[[1998 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] game on November 8. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] to high definition beginning with the [[2000–01 United States network television schedule|2000–01 season]], with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD starting with their debuts. ''The Young and the Restless'' became the first daytime soap opera to broadcast in HD on June 27, 2001.<ref name="HDTV">{{cite news|title=Finding the art in HDTV|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/finding-art-hdtv/97190|author=Karen Anderson Prikios|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=June 25, 2001|accessdate=July 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722012918/https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/finding-art-hdtv/97190|archive-date=July 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

CBS's 14-year conversion to an entirely high definition schedule ended in 2014, with ''Big Brother'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' becoming the final two series to convert from [[4:3]] standard definition to HD (in contrast, NBC, Fox and The CW were already airing their entire programming schedules&nbsp;– outside of Saturday mornings&nbsp;– in high definition by the 2010–11 season, while ABC was broadcasting its entire schedule in HD by the 2011–12 midseason). All of the network's programming has been presented in full HD since then (with the exception of certain [[Christmas holiday season|holiday]] specials produced prior to 2005&nbsp;– such as the Rankin-Bass specials&nbsp;– which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have been remastered for HD broadcast).

On September 1, 2016, when ABC converted to a [[16:9]] widescreen presentation, CBS and The CW were the only remaining networks that framed their promotions and on-screen graphical elements for a [[4:3]] presentation, though with CBS Sports' ''de facto'' 16:9 conversion with [[Super Bowl 50]] and their new graphical presentation designed for 16:9 framing, in practice, most CBS affiliates ask pay-TV providers to pass down a 16:9 widescreen presentation by default over their standard definition channels. This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018, when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for ''Dream Team'' within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.

==Brand identity {{anchor|Logos and slogans}}==
===Logos===
[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]
[[File:CBS Eyemark.svg|upright=0.7|thumb|CBS Eyemark]]
[[File:CBS Eye (Didot).svg|thumb|The classic CBS corporate logo, using CBS Didot typeface]]

The CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters "CBS".<ref>See an illustration of this early logo at {{cite web|title=cbs-1949.jpg|url=http://www.pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|publisher=Chuck Pharis Web Page|format=[[JPEG]]|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126183721/http://pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|archive-date=November 26, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[hex sign]] and a [[Shaker]] drawing; while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by CBS staff designer [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]], one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Search for Georg Olden|author=Julie Lasky (editors: Steven Heller and Georgette Ballance)|journal=Graphic Design History|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York City|pages=121–122|year=2001}}</ref> The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new "ident", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by [[Lou Dorfsman]], one of his top assistants, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).

The CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo/|work=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018003809/http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollbäck + Company that was introduced by the network in 2006, the eye was placed in a "trademark" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the "Eyemark", which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.

The eye logo has served as inspiration for the logos of [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the United Kingdom, [[Canal 4 (El Salvador)|Canal 4]] in El Salvador,  [[Televisa]] in Mexico, [[France 3]], [[Latina Televisión|Frecuencia Latina]] in Peru, [[Fuji Television]] in Japan, [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in Brazil, and [[Canal 10 (Uruguay)|Canal 10]] in Uruguay.

In October 2011, the network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo, featuring special IDs of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns being shown during the network's primetime lineup.<ref>{{cite web|title=The CBS Eye turns 60|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703103325/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|archive-date=July 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is [[Didot (typeface)|Didot]], a close relative to [[Bodoni]]. Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by [[Herb Lubalin]] of [[International Typeface Corporation]], an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include Avant Garde, Lubalin Graph, and Serif Gothic.

===Image campaigns===
====1980s====
CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The "Reach for the Stars" campaign used during the [[1981–82 United States network television schedule|1981–82 season]] features a space theme to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle [[Columbia (space shuttle)|Columbia]]. 1982's "Great Moments" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as ''I Love Lucy'' with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H''. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan "We've Got the Touch". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by [[Richie Havens]] (1983–84; one occasion in 1984–85) and [[Kenny Rogers]] (1985–86).

The [[1986–87 United States network television schedule|1986–87 season]] ushered in the "Share the Spirit of CBS" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and [[digital video effect]]s. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of "Share the Spirit" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987–88 "CBS Spirit" (or "CBSPIRIT") campaign. Like its predecessor, most "CBSpirit" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or "swishing") blue line that was used to represent "the spirit". The full-length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.

For the [[1988–89 United States network television schedule|1988–89 season]], CBS unveiled a new image campaign officially known as "Television You Can Feel", but more commonly identified as "You Can Feel It On CBS". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS saw its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with "Get Ready for CBS", introduced with the [[1989–90 United States network television schedule|1989–90 season]]. The initial version was an ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, [[Kmart]]) to encourage viewership, with the "CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway".

====1990s====
For the [[1990–91 United States network television schedule|1990–91 season]], the campaign featured a new jingle performed by [[the Temptations]], which featured an altered version of their hit "[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as "This is CBS" (1992) and "You're on CBS" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with "Welcome Home to a CBS Night" (1996–1997), simplified to ''Welcome Home'' (1997–1999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign "The Address is CBS" (1999–2000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, "The Stars' Address is CBS". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the "Welcome Home" era.

====2000s====
Throughout the 2000s, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's "It's All Here" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005 campaign introduced the slogan "This is CBS" Everybody's Watching", the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was "America's Most Watched Network". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan "We Are CBS", with [[Don LaFontaine]] providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled "Only CBS", in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The "America's Most Watched Network" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the "Only CBS" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, America's Most Watched Network, Also Posts The Largest Live Plus 7-Day DVR Lift During The 2010–2011 Season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018081239/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====2020s====
In October 2020, CBS announced that it will begin to employ a more unified branding between the network and its divisions to strengthen [[brand awareness]] across platforms. This includes a new frontcap (featuring an animation of the eyemark as shapes) and five-note [[Sound trademark|sonic branding]] that will be aired before all CBS-produced programming and event telecasts (with CBS entertainment programming using a dark blue version, CBS News using black and white, and CBS Sports using colors relating to the event), as well as CBS Television Studios being renamed to CBS Studios. The animation will also be used as an ID, reinstating the historic "This is CBS" tagline. The network also plans to discontinue its use of proclamations regarding its stature in promos, with chief marketing officer Michael Benson explaining that they aimed to "be something where people feel like they are part of the family. It's tough to unify if you’re bragging about yourself." These new elements are being rolled out in stages, with CBS News beginning to use them ahead of the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], and CBS Sports planning to launch the elements for [[Super Bowl LV]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-08|title=CBS rethinks iconic eye in new branding strategy|url=https://adage.com/article/media/cbs-rethinks-iconic-eye-new-branding-strategy/2286431|access-date=2020-10-08|website=adage.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2020-10-08|title=CBS Casts New Eye on Audiences Who Don't Watch Its Programs on Regular TV|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/cbs-marketing-mike-benson-streaming-video-netflix-1234797032/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref>

==International broadcasts==
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2018}}
CBS programs are shown outside the United States: through various ViacomCBS international networks and/or content agreements, and in two North American countries, through U.S.-based CBS stations.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], CBS network programming is carried on cable, satellite and [[IPTV]] providers through affiliates and owned-and-operated stations of the network that are located within proximity to the Canada–United States border (such as [[KIRO-TV]]/[[Seattle]], [[KBJR-TV|KBJR-DT2]]/[[Duluth, Minnesota]], [[WWJ-TV]]/[[Detroit]] and [[WIVB-TV]]/[[Buffalo, New York]] and [[WCAX-TV]]/[[Burlington, Vermont]] ), some of which may also be receivable over-the-air in parts of southern Canada depending on the signal coverage of the station. Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]]s, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.

===Bermuda===
In Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]-based [[ZBM-TV]], locally owned by [[Bermuda Broadcasting|Bermuda Broadcasting Company]].

===Mexico===
CBS programming is available in [[Mexico]] through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the [[Mexico–United States border]] (such as [[KYMA-DT]]/[[Yuma, Arizona]]; [[KVTV]]/[[Laredo, Texas]]; [[KDBC-TV]]/[[El Paso, Texas]]; [[KVEO-TV|KVEO-DT2]]/[[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]/[[Harlingen, Texas]]; and [[KFMB-TV]]/[[San Diego]]), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico.

===Europe===

[[CBS News]] and [[BBC News]] have maintained a news sharing agreement since 2017, replacing the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s longtime agreement with [[ABC News]] and CBS's with [[Sky News]] (which would have ended in any event in 2018 due to that entity's purchase by NBCUniversal).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bbc-cbs-abc-sky-news-1202494555/|title=BBC and CBS Forge News Pact, Leaving ABC and Sky Out of the Picture|last=Clarke|first=Stewart|date=17 July 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=19 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819090506/https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bbc-cbs-abc-sky-news-1202494555/|archive-date=August 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

As of the close of the Viacom merger on December 4, 2019, [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] is now a sister operation to CBS, though no major changes to CBS's relationship with the BBC are expected in the near future, as Channel 5 sub-contracts [[5 News|its news programming obligations]] to [[ITN]].

===Australia===
Australian free-to-air broadcaster [[Ten Network Holdings]] has been owned by CBS Corporation since 2017 (and subsequently, ViacomCBS). All of Network Ten's channels, [[Network 10|10]], [[10 Peach]], [[10 Bold]] and [[10 Shake]], all carry CBS programming, with 10 Shake drawing extensively from the wider ViacomCBS library including MTV and Nickelodeon. Prior to the acquisition, CBS had long been a major supplier of international programs to the network. The cost of maintaining program supply agreements with CBS and 21st Century Fox was a major factor in the network's unprofitability during the mid-2010s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Max|title=Keeping Ten afloat relies on reworking 21st Century Fox and CBS TV deals|url=http://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/tv/keeping-ten-afloat-relies-on-reworking-21st-century-fox-and-cbs-tv-deals-20170612-gwpb8e|accessdate=22 November 2017|work=Australian Financial Review|date=2017-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041956/http://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/tv/keeping-ten-afloat-relies-on-reworking-21st-century-fox-and-cbs-tv-deals-20170612-gwpb8e|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Network Ten entered voluntary administration in June 2017.<ref>{{cite news |last=Danckert |first=Sarah |date=14 June 2017 |title=Network Ten heads into voluntary administration |url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/network-ten-heads-into-voluntary-administration-20170614-gwqo47.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829011122/http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/network-ten-heads-into-voluntary-administration-20170614-gwqo47.html |archive-date=August 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> CBS Corporation was the network's largest creditor.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Battersby|first1=Lucy|title=CBS claiming debts of $843 million from Network Ten|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/cbs-claiming-debts-of-843-million-from-network-ten-20170710-gx8bmq.html|accessdate=16 November 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116204815/http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/cbs-claiming-debts-of-843-million-from-network-ten-20170710-gx8bmq.html|archive-date=November 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS Corporation chose to acquire the network, completing the transaction in November 2017.<ref>[https://images.tenplay.com.au/~/media/Corporate%20Site%20Media/Files/Media%20Releases/2017/CBS%20Corporation%20Completes%20Acquisition%20Of%20Ten%20Network.pdf CBS Corporation Completes Acquisition Of Ten Network.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116132657/https://images.tenplay.com.au/~/media/Corporate%20Site%20Media/Files/Media%20Releases/2017/CBS%20Corporation%20Completes%20Acquisition%20Of%20Ten%20Network.pdf |date=November 16, 2017 }}, Ten Network Holdings, 16 November 2017.</ref>

==Controversies==

===Brown & Williamson interview===
In 1995, CBS refused to air a ''60 Minutes'' segment that featured an interview with a former president of research and development for [[Brown & Williamson]], the U.S.'s third largest tobacco company. The controversy raised questions about the legal roles in decision-making and whether journalistic standards should be compromised despite legal pressures and threats. The decision nevertheless sent shockwaves throughout the television industry, the journalism community, and the country.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The 60 Minutes controversy: What lawyers are telling the news media|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/coml18&div=18&id=&page=|author=Joseph A.

In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a record $550,000 fine, the largest fine ever for a violation of federal decency laws, against CBS for an incident during its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in which singer [[Janet Jackson]]'s right breast (which was partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry) was briefly and accidentally exposed by guest performer [[Justin Timberlake]] at the end of a duet performance of Timberlake's 2003 single "[[Rock Your Body]]" during the [[halftime show]] (produced by then sister cable network [[MTV]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Apologizes for Jackson Breast-Flash |url=http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SUPER_BOWL_JACKSON?SITE=CACRU&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |agency=Associated Press |date=February 2, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202201416/http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SUPER_BOWL_JACKSON?SITE=CACRU&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |archivedate=February 2, 2004 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Following the incident, CBS apologized to its viewers and denied foreknowledge of the incident, which was televised live.

{{main|Killian documents controversy}}
On September 8, 2004, less than two months before the [[2004 United States presidential election|Presidential election]] in which he defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[John Kerry]], CBS aired a controversial episode of ''[[60 Minutes II|60 Minutes Wednesday]]'', which questioned then-President [[George W.

In its front-page story on his dismissal, which came on "the sunniest Sunday in February" 1965, ''The New York Times'' declared that "the circumstances [behind Aubrey's firing] rivaled the best of CBS adventure or mystery shows". Aubrey offered no explanation following his dismissal, nor did CBS President Frank Stanton or Board Chairman William Paley.<ref name="Sterling, C. H. 1990"/>
|-
| [[Michael Dann]] || 1963–1970 || Dann, who would later join the upstart [[Children's Television Workshop]], took a pragmatic approach to programming, opting not to enforce a personal vision for the network other than to try to get more viewers without regard to [[key demographic]]s. To this effect, he commissioned various rural sitcoms for the network (although he personally hated this genre) and, in 1967, he canceled all of the network's profitable, but low-rated, game shows. He believed in the notions of [[hammocking]] and [[tent-pole programming]], in which a new or struggling sitcom could be made more successful by putting more successful shows before and after it.
|-
| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1970–1975 || In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to vice president, Programs&nbsp;– heading the network's entire programming department.<ref name="BarberaAutoBio">{{cite book|title=My Life in "Toons": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163 163–173]|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163}}</ref> Silverman was the chief architect of the "[[rural purge]]" of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale [[baby boomer]] generation (such as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''Cannon'', ''Barnaby Jones'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''). Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], new television series developed with characters originating on an existing series. For example, he spun off ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' from ''All in the Family'', and ''Rhoda'' from ''Mary Tyler Moore'' (as well as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' from ''MTM''{{'}}s writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a ''Maude'' spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]''; that show's success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC's new hit, ''[[Happy Days]]'', the following fall. In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network's daytime lineup in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show ''The Price Is Right'', which remains on the air nearly four decades later. After the success of ''The Price Is Right'', Silverman would establish a working relationship with [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in which most of their game shows would air on CBS, including a revival of ''Match Game''. Under Silverman's tenure, CBS also ended the practice of [[wiping]] and saved as much of its recorded content as possible, while other networks recycled tapes constantly to save money. On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned [[Hanna-Barbera]] to produce the animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]'' (one of the show's main characters, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], is named after Silverman). The success of ''Scooby-Doo'' led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.
