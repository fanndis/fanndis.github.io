'''Maiduguri''' {{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|d|uː|g|ʊ|r|i}} is the capital and the largest city of [[Borno State]] in north-eastern [[Nigeria]]. The city sits along the seasonal [[Ngadda River]] which disappears into the ''Firki'' swamps in the areas around [[Lake Chad]].<ref name=britannica>{{cite web | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358466/Maiduguri | access-date = 6 April 2007}}</ref> Maiduguri was founded in 1907 as a military outpost by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and has since grown rapidly with a population exceeding a million by 2007.

==History==
===Early period===
The region was home to the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] for centuries. Maiduguri actually consists of two cities: Yerwa to the West and Old Maiduguri to the east.

Yerwa was founded in 1907 by [[Abubakar Garbai of Borno]] as the capital of the Bornu Kingdom.<ref name="Vincent">{{cite book |last1=Hiribarren |first1=Vincent |title=A History of Borno: Trans-Saharan African Empire to Failing Nigerian State |date=2017 |publisher=Hurst & Company |location=London |isbn=9781849044745 |pages=106}}</ref> The location had before that been a small village known as Kalwa. This involved the transfer of the capital of the [[Kanuri people]] from [[Kukawa]].

Old Maiduguri was selected by the British as their military headquarters in 1908 replacing [[Mafoni]].<ref name="britannica"/> In that same year it became the location for the British resident commissioner over British Bornu.

In 1957 Yerwa became the designated name for the urban center while Maiduguri was officially applied as the name of the surrounding rural area.

In 1964 the railway was extended here which lead to its rise as a major commercial center in the region.

The city was once known as a "hub of Islamic scholarship in West Africa that ... [taught] tolerance and hospitality like its welcoming [[Azadirachta indica|neem]] trees."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2012/09/24/tears-maiduguri-ahmad-salkida|title=Tears From Maiduguri|last=Salkida|first=Ahmad|date=2012-09-24|website=Sahara Reporters|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref>

Maiduguri is one of the sixteen LGAs that constitute the [[Borno Emirate]], a [[Nigerian traditional states|traditional state]] located in Borno State, Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite book

===Islamist violence===
Since the mid-1960s, Maiduguri has witnessed outbreaks of large inter-religious riots. Members of religious sects led intercommunal violence in 1982 and 2001.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Barnaby|title=Eclipse Triggers Nigeria Riot|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1110791.stm|access-date=25 January 2015|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 January 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Around the World: Nigerian Toll Put at 452 in Religious Riots|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/01/world/around-the-world-nigerian-toll-put-at-452-in-religious-riots.html?sec=&spon=|access-date=25 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=1 November 1982}}</ref>

On 18 February 2006, riots related to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons]] published by the Danish newspaper [[Jyllands-Posten]] left at least 15 people dead, and resulted in the destruction of approximately 12 churches. Soldiers and police quelled the riots, and the government temporarily imposed a curfew.<ref name=aljazeera>{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera: Fifteen killed in Nigerian cartoon riots |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=18647 |access-date=6 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323052035/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=18647 |archive-date=23 March 2007 }}</ref><ref name=reliefweb>{{cite web | title = ReliefWeb: Nigeria's northeast state imposes curfew after religious crisis | url = http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EKOI-6M83L9?OpenDocument | access-date = 6 April 2007}}</ref>

In 2002, [[Muslim cleric]] [[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]] founded the [[Islamist]] group [[Boko Haram]] in Maiduguri, establishing a [[mosque]] and a [[madrasa]] that attracted children from poor Muslim families from both Nigeria and neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501|title=Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamists?|last=Chothia|first=Farouk|date=4 May 2015|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=11 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/28/-sp-maiduguri-nigeria-boko-haram-future|title=Why Maiduguri city is key to Boko Haram's future|last=Allison|first=Simon|date=2015-01-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The city is the heart of the Boko Haram insurgency<ref name=NYT/> and is the city which is most often attacked by the group.<ref name=CNBC>[https://cnbc.com/2017/03/22/blasts-kill-4-injure-18-in-northeastern-nigeria-police-say.html Blasts kill 4, injure 18 in northeastern Nigeria]</ref> In late July 2009, Maiduguri was the worst-hit location of [[2009 Boko Haram uprising|major religious violence in northern Nigeria]] committed by Boko Haram, which left over 700 people dead.

On 14 May 2013, [[President of Nigeria|President]] [[Goodluck Jonathan]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in northeast Nigeria, including Borno State, due to the militant activity of Boko Haram.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nigeria: State of Emergency Declared|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/world/africa/nigeria-state-of-emergency-declared.html|access-date=6 June 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 May 2013}}</ref> The entire city was under overnight [[curfew]], and trucks have been prevented from entering the city.

In 2014, Boko Haram bombed Maiduguri in [[January 2014 Maiduguri bombing|January]], [[July 2014 Maiduguri bombing|July]] and [[November 2014 Maiduguri bombings|November]].

In May 2016, [[Amnesty International]] released a report on the Giwa barracks detention centre, calling it a "place of death."
