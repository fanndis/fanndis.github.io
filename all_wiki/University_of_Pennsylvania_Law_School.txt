==History==
[[File:Lewis 5333429670 112607c0ef o.jpg|thumb|180px|[[William Draper Lewis]], Penn Law's Dean, and founder of the [[American Law Institute]]]]
The University of Pennsylvania Law School traces its origins to a series of lectures delivered, in 1790, by [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/about/history/ |title=History of Penn Law |publisher=Law.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> Penn began offering a full-time program in law in 1850, under the leadership of [[George Sharswood]].<ref name="history" /> In 1852, Penn was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence, then called ''The American Law Register'', which was later renamed the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', one of the most-cited law journals in the world.<ref name="lawlib.wlu.edu">{{cite web|url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx|title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking|work=wlu.edu|access-date=2017-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307221833/http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx|archive-date=2006-03-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Louis_Pollak.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Louis H. Pollak]], Dean and later a judge of the  [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]].]]
In 1881 the first woman was admitted to the school, [[Carrie Burnham Kilgore]], and in 1888 the first African American man graduated from the school, [[Aaron Albert Mossell]].<ref>[https://www.law.upenn.edu/about/history.php About: History • Penn Law<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[William Draper Lewis]] was named dean in 1896.<ref name="Almanac"/> In 1900, the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania approved a move to the law school's current location at the intersection of 34th and [[Chestnut Street (Philadelphia)|Chestnut Street]]s.<ref name="Owen Roberts 1949">Owen Roberts, William Draper Lewis, 98 ''U. Pa. L. Rev.'' 1 (1949)</ref> Under Lewis' deanship, the law school was one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.<ref name="Owen Roberts 1949"/> As legal education became more formalized, the school initiated a three-year curriculum and instituted stringent admissions requirements. While the School continued to accept students who did not hold a bachelor's degree, it warned applicants that "[a] large number of those who study law are college graduates; and those who are not cannot hope, except in rare instances, to compete successfully with the college man."<ref>"Department of Law," Catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania, 1899-1900 234 (1899).</ref>

After 30 years with the law school, Lewis founded the [[American Law Institute]] in 1925, which was seated in the law school and was chaired by Lewis himself. The ALI was later chaired by another of Penn Law's Deans, [[Herbert Funk Goodrich]]. Two years before Goodrich was named dean, in 1927 the law school graduated with a J.D. [[Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander]], who was the first African-American woman to ever receive a Ph.D. in the United States (also from the University of Pennsylvania, in economics).<ref name=Almanac/> The first woman to join the faculty was [[Martha Field]] in 1969; she is now a professor at [[Harvard Law School]].<ref name=Almanac/> From 1974 to 1978 the Dean of the law school was [[Louis Pollak]], who later became a federal judge.

In November 2019, Penn Law received a $125 million donation from the W.P. Carey Foundation, the largest single donation to any law school to date; the school was renamed University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, in honor of the foundation's first president, Penn Law alumnus Francis J. Carey (1926-2014), who was the brother of [[William P. Carey|William Polk Carey]] (1930 - 2012), founder of the [[W. P. Carey|W. P. Carey Inc.]] [[REIT]], and of the charitable foundation.<ref>[https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/11/penn-law-carey-foundation-donation-renaming "Penn Law renamed ‘Carey Law School’ following record $125 million donation", by Manlu Liu, November 8, 2019.

Retrieved November 17, 2019.]</ref> The change was met by some controversy, and a petition to quash the abbreviated "Carey Law", in favor of the traditional "Penn Law", was circulated and it was agreed that the official short form name for next few years could remain "Penn Law" and/or "Penn Carey Law".

==Campus==
[[File:University of Pennsylvania Law School-angled.JPG|300px|thumb|Silverman Hall]]
The University of Pennsylvania campus covers over 269 acres (~1&nbsp;km²) in a contiguous area of [[West Philadelphia]]'s [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] district. All of Penn's schools, including the law school, and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the architecture firm of [[Cope & Stewardson]], whose principal architects combined the [[Gothic architecture]] of the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] with the local landscape to establish the [[Collegiate Gothic]] style.

The law school consists of four interconnecting buildings around a central [[courtyard]].  At the east end of the courtyard is Silverman Hall, built in 1900, housing the Levy Conference Center, classrooms, faculty offices, the Gittis Center for Clinical Legal Studies, and administrative and student offices. Directly opposite is Tanenbaum Hall, home to the Biddle Law Library several law journals, administrative offices, and student spaces. The law library houses 1,053,824 volumes and volume equivalents making it the 4th-largest law library in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-pennsylvania-03140|title=University of Pennsylvania|work=rankingsandreviews.com}}</ref> Gittis Hall sits on the north side and has new classrooms (renovated in 2006) and new and expanded faculty offices.  Opposite is Golkin Hall, which contains {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} and includes a state-of-the-art court room, 350-seat auditorium, seminar rooms, faculty and administrative offices, a two-story entry hall, and a roof-top garden.

A small row of restaurants and shops faces the law school on Sansom Street.  Nearby are the Penn Bookstore, the Pottruck Center (a {{convert|115000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multi-purpose sports activity area), the Institute of Contemporary Art, a performing arts center, and area shops.

===Multidisciplinary Focus===
Throughout its modern history, Penn has been known for its strong focus on inter-disciplinary studies, a character that was shaped early on by Dean [[William Draper Lewis]].<ref>[[Margaret Center Klingelsmith]], "History of the Department of Law of the University of Pennsylvania," The Proceedings at the Dedication of the New Building of the Department of Law, February 21st and 22nd, 1900, 16-18 (George Erasmus Nitzsche, comp. 1901).</ref> Its medium-size student body and the tight integration with the rest of Penn's schools (the "One University Policy")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/uplan/paoneuniv1972.pdf |title=Pennsylvania: One University |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Archives |year=1973 |accessdate=2011-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128081440/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/uplan/paoneuniv1972.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> have been instrumental in achieving that aim. More than 50 percent of the law school's courses are interdisciplinary, and it offers more than 20 joint and dual degree programs, including a JD/MBA ([[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]), a JD/PhD in Communication ([[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania]]), and a JD/MD ([[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|Perelman School of Medicine]]).

Various certificate programs that can be completed within the three-year JD program are also available, including in Business and Public Policy, in conjunction with the [[Wharton School]]); Cross-Sector Innovation; the School of Social Policy & Practice; International Business and Law, as the Themis Joint Certificate with ESADE Law School in Barcelona, Spain; and in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN).<ref>{{cite web |title=SCAN Certificate helps law students use neuroscience to understand human behavior |url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/5382-scan-certificate-helps-law-students-use |website=Penn Law}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Graduate Certificate in Social, Cognitive & Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) |url=https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/scan/ |website=Center for Neuroscience and Society}}</ref> 19 percent of the Class of 2007 earned a certificate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/crossdisc/study/certificates/ |title=Penn Law&nbsp;– Certificates of Study |publisher=Law.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525174504/http://www.law.upenn.edu/crossdisc/study/certificates/ |archive-date=May 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Penn Law also offers joint degrees with international affiliates, such as [[Sciences Po]], France; [[ESADE]], Spain; and the [[University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law]]. Under the guidance of former Dean Michael A. Fitts, the School has further expanded its international programs with the addition of the International Internship Program, the International Summer Human Rights Program, and the Global Research Seminar, all under the umbrella of the Penn Law Global Initiative. Penn Law takes part in a number of international annual events, such as the [[Monroe E. Price Media Law Moot Court Competition]] at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 International Rounds in Oxford&nbsp;– Results|url=http://pricemootcourt.socleg.ox.ac.uk/competitions/oxford/2011/results|publisher=University of Oxford&nbsp;– Price Media Law Moot Court Programme|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>

===Career prospects===
Penn combines a strong tradition in public service with being one of the top feeders of law students to the most prestigious law firms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202483173162&slreturn=1&hbxlogin=1|title=LAW SCHOOLS REPORT|work=National Law Journal}}</ref> Penn Law was the first top-ranked law school to establish a mandatory pro bono requirement, and the first law school to win American Bar Association's Pro Bono Publico Award.

==Notable faculty==
The law school's faculty is selected to match its inter-disciplinary orientation. Seventy percent of the standing faculty hold advanced degrees beyond the JD, and more than a third hold secondary appointments in other departments at the university.

==Toll Public Interest Center and related activities==
Penn was the first national law school to establish a mandatory [[pro bono]] program, and the first law school to win the [[American Bar Association]]'s Pro Bono Publico Award.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  The public interest center was founded in 1989 and was renamed the Toll Public Interest Center in 2006 in acknowledgement of a $10 million gift from Robert Toll (Executive Chairman of the Board of [[Toll Brothers]]) and Jane Toll. In 2011 the Tolls donated an additional $2.5 million. The Toll Public Interest Center has supported many students who have won the [[Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom#Skadden Fellowship Foundation|Skadden Fellowship]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skaddenfellowships.org/sitecontent.cfm?page=recentFellows |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117221137/http://www.skaddenfellowships.org/sitecontent.cfm?page=recentFellows |archive-date=2012-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> called by ''The Los Angeles Times'' "a legal Peace Corps."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skaddenfellowships.org/sitecontent.cfm?page%3Dabout |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010181141/http://www.skaddenfellowships.org/sitecontent.cfm?page=about |archivedate=October 10, 2006 }} Skadden Fellowship Foundation: About the Foundation</ref> In October of 2020, The Robert and Jane Toll Foundation announced that it was donating fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) to Penn Law, which is the largest gift in history to be devoted entirely to the training and support of public interest lawyers, and among the ten (10) largest gifts ever to a law school in the United States of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inquirer.com/business/toll-public-interest-penn-law-50-million-gift-scholars-20200929.html</ref> The gift expands the Toll Public Interest Scholars and Fellows Program by doubling the number of public interest graduates in the coming decade through a combination of full and partial tuition scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/robert-and-jane-toll-foundation-gift-penn-law-toll-public-interest-scholars</ref>

==Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law==
The Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law (CERL or Center) is a non-partisan, interdisciplinary research and policy institute at the University of Pennsylvania. CERL focuses on the application of the rule of law and ethics to pressing issues of [[national security]], [[Veterans affairs|veterans' affairs]], [[War|armed conflict]], and [[International crisis|transnational crises]]. CERL was co-founded in 2012 by Professor [[Claire Finkelstein]], Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and by William Craven, Chairman of Federal Systems and the Center's first Executive Board Chair, principally as a direct response to the interrogation policies and abuses in the post-9/11 era,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2012/09/penn-law-unveils-center-for-ethics-and-the-rule-of-law|title=Penn Law unveils Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law|last=Bromfield|first=Heather|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-us}}</ref> including at Baghdad's [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib Prison]].

The central mission of CERL is to protect and promote rule of law values and ethical principles in the face of international challenges such as conflict with violent non-state actors, (seemingly) irrational and dangerous enemies, and transnational security risks. Its primary means of accomplishing this is to foster an exchange of ideas among academics, analysts, and practitioners regarding the interplay of rule of law/ethics and national and international security matters; to share the products of those discussions through published volumes or in open forums to raise public consciousness; and to prepare briefing papers and otherwise disseminate its views to educate policymakers as well as to impact public discussion.

Much of CERL's work to date has revolved around setting up two annual [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable]], interdisciplinary conferences that bring together scholars and practitioners to consult on critical global issues relating to national or international security and the rule of law. Articles authored for the conference are then compiled with other writings into published volumes by [[Oxford University Press]]. CERL's event topics have been wide-ranging and included The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons Systems (November 2014),<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://issuu.com/pennlawits/docs/cerl_annual_report_2014-2015|title=CERL Annual Report 2014-2015|last=|first=|date=|work=issuu|access-date=2017-09-25|pages=22–23|language=en}}</ref> Preventing and Treating the Invisible Wounds of War: Combat Trauma and Psychological Injury (December 2015), The Ethics of Negotiation in Armed Conflict (April 2016), Using Law to Fight Terror: Legal Approaches to Combating Violent Non-State Actors (September 2016), Preserving Art and Culture in Times of War (April 2017), and Foreign Interference with Democratic Institutions (April 2017). Events are generally held at Penn Law School, but sometimes at other Philadelphia-area venues, such as the [[National Constitution Center]], the [[Penn Museum]], and the Perry World House.

Notable speakers or participants at these events have included: [[James Cartwright|General James "Hoss" Cartwright]] (a Four-Star General who served as Vice Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] from August 2007 to August 2011), [[Haleh Esfandiari|Dr. Haleh Esfandiari]] (the Iranian-American Founding Director of the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]]'s Middle East Program), [[Dennis Ross|Ambassador Dennis Ross]] (Director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff under President George W.

CERL also issued its first policy briefing paper in January 2017, entitled, "The Intersection of Opioid Usage and Veteran Mental Health Challenges."

CERL's non-fiduciary Executive Board consists of a high-level mix of former U.S. government officials, law professors, philosophy professors, businesspersons, and practicing lawyers. The current Chair of the Executive Board is Paul G.
