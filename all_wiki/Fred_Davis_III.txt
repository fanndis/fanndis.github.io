In the late-1970s and early-1980s, Davis was majority partner in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] advertising agency Davis & Nauser (with partner Jeffery Nauser), where his client list included just one political candidate, his uncle, then Tulsa mayoral candidate and current U.S. Senator [[Jim Inhofe]].

Davis left for California when Oklahoma's economy suffered from the collapse of the local oil industry.<ref name="Barabak" /> He founded and leads Strategic Perception, an advertising firm based in [[Hollywood]].<ref name="Lapowsky">{{cite news|url=http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/fred-davis-gop-most-notorious-ad-man.html|title=What You Can Learn from the GOP's Most Feared Ad Man|author=Issie Lapowsky|date=August 21, 2012|work=[[Inc.

Bush|President George W. Bush]], presidential candidates [[Dan Quayle]], [[John McCain]], [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Jon Huntsman]] and [[John Kasich]]. Senators [[Jim Inhofe]], [[John Cornyn]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John McCain]], [[Jeff Flake]], [[Bob Corker]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [[David Perdue]], [[John Kennedy (Louisiana politician)|John Kennedy]], [[Ben Sasse]], [[Elizabeth Dole]] and [[Paul Coverdell]]. Also governors [[Sonny Perdue]], [[Rick Snyder]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Ernie Fletcher]].

His long-shot gubernatorial campaign for [[Sonny Perdue]] in Georgia featured a video of a giant rat rampaging Georgia. The rat portrayed the current, popular governor [[Roy Barnes]]. The video is credited as starting the movement toward viral videos in politics. Perdue beat Barnes handily, in spite of being outspent more than seven to one.

A similar campaign for now-Governor [[Rick Snyder]] of Michigan featured the unusual Davis slogan, “One Tough Nerd.” The slogan caught on across the state helping propel the unknown Snyder past several statewide office holders into a primary win without a runoff, then the general election.

He created a well-known 2010 ad for [[United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010|U.S. Senate candidate]] [[Christine O'Donnell]] which featured her declaring she was "not a witch", in response to the re-airing of past statements made by her about her interactions with non-Christian religious practices.<ref name="McGreal2010-09-20">{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Christine O'Donnell: I dabbled in witchcraft|date=2010-09-20|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/20/christine-o-donnell-dabbled-witchcraft|accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> O’Donnell’s witch statements had become a staple of late night comedy programs, including Saturday Night Live, before Davis was hired.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/09/kristen-wiig-parodies-chr_n_757116.html|title='SNL' Does The Best Parody Of Christine O'Donnell's 'Not A Witch' Ad Yet|work=Huffington Post|last=McGlynn|first=Katia|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/20/elvira-christine-odonnell_n_770527.html|title=Elvira Spoofs Christine O'Donnell's 'I'm Not A Witch' Ad|work= Huffington Post|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2010-12-03|first=Katla|last=McGlynn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/im-not-a-witch-the-remix/|title="I'm Not A Witch" — The Remix|work=The Ca10-2626-10|accessdate=2010-12-03|first=Ashley|last=Parker|date=2010-10-26}}</ref>

In February 2012, Davis authored a controversial ad for Representative [[Pete Hoekstra]] for his Senate campaign against incumbent Democrat [[Debbie Stabenow]]. The ad attacked Stabenow as Debbie "Spend-it-now" and showed an Asian woman riding a bicycle in a rice paddy thanking Stabenow (in broken English) for enriching the Chinese economy at the expense of the U.S.

Republican strategist [[Mike Murphy (political consultant)|Mike Murphy]] tweeted that the ad was "really, really dumb,"<ref name="hill">{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/video/senate/208793-hoekstra-super-bowl-ad-hits-debbie-spend-it-now-on-debt|title=Hoekstra defends ad against charges of racial insensitivity|author=Cameron Joseph|date=February 6, 2012|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref> while Stabenow called it "shocking" and "nasty."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/offensive-pete-hoekstra-ad-draws-big-bucks-for-rival-sen-debbie-stabenow/|title='Offensive' Pete Hoekstra Ad Draws Big Bucks for Rival Sen.

=== Obama document ===
In 2012, Davis’ firm prepared a 57-page plan (commissioned by billionaire [[Joe Ricketts]]) for a $10 million campaign attempting to defeat the re-election of President Obama. It partially recycled points of criticism against Obama from the 2008 presidential campaign, including his relationship with Obama’s reverend, [[Jeremiah Wright]]. The proposal, titled, ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good,'' was initially approved by the Ricketts' Ending Spending Action Fund.

A copy of the proposal document was released by a person unconnected to the ad campaign to ''[[The New York Times]]'', after which it was roundly lambasted in external commentary. Ricketts then disavowed commissioning the plan. Although Davis' agency had gone at least as far as contacting [[Larry Elder]] to join the project, no ads were ever aired. Ricketts issued a statement disavowing the ad campaign hours after it was publicized by the ''New York Times.''
