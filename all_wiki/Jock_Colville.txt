'''Sir John Rupert Colville''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (28 January 1915 – 19 November 1987), known as '''Jock Colville''', was a British civil servant. He is best known for his diaries, which provide an intimate view of number [[10 Downing Street]] during the wartime Premiership of [[Winston Churchill]].

==Family background==
Colville came from a politically active and well-connected family, although, as he stated in the introduction to his published diaries, he was the younger son of a younger son and so did not inherit family wealth.

His father was the Hon. George Charles Colville, who was secretary of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales|Institute of Chartered Accountants]] and the younger son of [[Charles Colville, 1st Viscount Colville of Culross]], a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician who served as [[Master of the Buckhounds]] and Tory [[Chief Whip]].

His mother was [[Lady Cynthia Colville|Lady Cynthia]], a courtier and social worker. She was the daughter of [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe]],<ref name=peerage>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1108.htm#i11080 |title=p. 1108 §  11080 <!-- Bot generated title -->Sir John Rupert Colville |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref> by his first wife, the former Sibyl Graham, daughter of [[Graham Baronets|the Graham Baronets]] of [[Netherby, Cumbria|Netherby]]. Colville never knew his maternal grandmother, who died young; his maternal grandfather, a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Cabinet minister, remarried Margaret (Peggy) Primrose, daughter of [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery, Liberal Prime Minister in 1894–1895]], and [[Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery|his wife Hannah]], heiress to the [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild fortune]]. Lionel Nathan de Rothschild was a close friend of Colville's. Lady Cynthia, in addition to her duties as a [[Woman of the Bedchamber]] to [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], devoted her energies to alleviating the suffering of [[Shoreditch]], one of the poorest areas of the [[East End of London]].

Colville had two elder brothers, David Richard (11 May 1909 – 9 February 1987) and Major Philip Robert Colville (7 November 1910 – 11 April 1997). Colville's first cousin and schoolmate was [[Terence O'Neill]], later [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]] from 1964 to 1969. Other relatives include O'Neill's successor [[James Chichester-Clark]] and Colville's aunt [[Mary Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe]]. [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington]], a Conservative politician who served as Foreign Secretary in the [[List of Thatcher ministers 1979–90|Cabinet of Margaret Thatcher]] from 1979 to 1982, was his second cousin.{{efn|name=2ndcousins|Jock Colville, Lord Carrington and Harry Legge-Bourke were all great-grandsons of [[Robert Carrington, 2nd Baron Carrington]].}}

==Early life and education==
Colville served alongside [[Harry Legge-Bourke]] (his half–second cousin{{efn|name=2ndcousins}}) as a [[Page of Honour]] between 1927 and 1931, thanks to his mother's connections as attendant to the queen. She also ensured he saw the other side of life, by taking him to the infant welfare centre she ran in [[Shoreditch]] in London.<ref>''Footprints in Time''. John Colville. 1976. Chapter 3, The Loss of a Shirt.</ref> He was educated at [[West Downs School]], Winchester; [[Harrow School|Harrow]]; and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=peerage /> In preparation for a career in the diplomatic service, he twice spent a few months in the [[Black Forest]] to improve his German. The first time in the village of [[Marxzell]] was just before university in 1933, and the second was just after in 1937. He thus saw the very beginning of Hitler's chancellorship, and its effects once it had bedded in: "There was increasing Strength matched by diminishing Joy"<ref>''Footprints in Time''. John Colville. 1976. Chapter 8, Two Faces.</ref> (This was an ironic reference to the Nazi morale-building programme of ''Kraft durch Freude,'' [[Strength through Joy]]).

==Public life==
Colville was [[Private Secretary|Assistant Private Secretary]] to three Prime Ministers: 
* [[Neville Chamberlain]], 1939–40,
* [[Winston Churchill]], 1940–41 and 1943–45 (and Joint Principal Private Secretary, 1951–55),
* [[Clement Attlee]], 1945.

===Diaries===
Colville kept a diary from 1939–1957, parts of which have been published (''The Fringes of Power: 10 Downing Street Diaries 1939–1955''). The original diaries<ref>[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FCLVL%201 Janus: The Papers of Sir John Colville<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> are held at the [[Churchill Archives Centre]], [[Cambridge University]] and, with the exception of the final volume, are open to the public.<ref>[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FCLVL The Papers of Sir John Colville]. "Diaries: 10 Sep 1939–1957," CLVL 1/1-10. Held at the [http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/collections/ Churchill Archives Centre]</ref>

Churchill was, as appears from the diaries, fond of Colville, and, from reading the published diaries, it is apparent that Colville was close to the rest of the Churchill family. When Churchill was ill with pneumonia, it was Colville who was summoned from his brief stint of active service in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] to accompany [[Clementine Churchill]] on an aeroplane to Egypt to visit him, although it was clear on their arrival that Churchill's life was not in danger. Typical of the badinage between Churchill and his private secretary was the exchange when, immediately before Colville's departure for RAF service in 1941, Churchill asked him his age. On being told, Churchill pointed out that, at 26, [[Napoleon]] was commanding the armies of Italy. Colville replied that the [[Pitt the Younger|Younger Pitt]] was [[Prime Minister]] at the age of 24.

The diaries record many conversations between Churchill and his political and military colleagues, as well as his private thoughts. They illustrate the contrast between the "atmosphere of rush" about Churchill, as compared with the shorter hours and reduced energy levels associated with his predecessor [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]], whom Colville had also served. Commentaries in the diaries show how, even when beset by disasters in the early days of his premiership, Churchill was still able to raise the spirits of those around him, with his sense of purpose and his sense of humour. They reveal that much of Churchill's correspondence (although none of his speeches) was drafted by Colville and others in their imitations of Churchill's distinctive style, albeit subject to his approval. The diaries also cover Churchill's peacetime premiership and his regularly deferred retirement, and note that, when Churchill did finally retire, Colville found him sitting on his bed at 10 Downing Street saying (of his successor, [[Anthony Eden|Eden]]) "I don't think Anthony can do it!".<ref>Colville, John, The Fringes of Power (W.W. Norton & Company 1985), p. 708</ref>

===Career as pilot===
Colville served in [[World War II]] as a pilot in the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] (RAFVR), 1941–44.<ref>Colville, John, The Fringes of Power (W.W. Norton & Company 1985), p. 449 et seq.</ref>

==Later public career==
He served as [[Private Secretary]] to the then [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth]] 1947–49 and was Joint Principal Private Secretary to the [[Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], 1951–55.<ref>Colville, John, The Fringes of Power (W.W. Norton & Company 1985), p. 632.</ref>

He was an Executive Director of [[Hill Samuel Ltd]], 1955–80. Colville was instrumental in raising funds for the establishment of [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], as a national memorial to [[Winston Churchill]], and was made an Honorary Fellow of the College in 1971. {{citation needed|date=March 2010}} He was joint honorary secretary of [[the Other Club]] for many years. Colville was a Trustee of both Sir Winston and Lady Churchill's estates. At various times in his life, he was Company Director of the Provident Life Association, the London Committee, the [[Ottoman Bank]], and Eucalyptus Pulp Mills Ltd.
