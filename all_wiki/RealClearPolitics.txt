'''RealClearPolitics''' ('''RCP''') is an American [[Political journalism|political news]] site and [[Polling aggregator|polling data aggregator]] formed in 2000 by former [[option (finance)|options]] [[trader (finance)|trader]] [[John McIntyre (publisher)|John McIntyre]] and former [[advertising agency]] [[account executive]] Tom Bevan.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/polls/|title=Polling Averages| publisher=RealClearPolitics|date= April 21, 2008| access-date=2008-04-21}}</ref><ref name="D'Agostino">{{cite journal | title=Conservative Spotlight: Real Clear Politics | date=31 March 2003 | author=D'Agostino, Joseph A. | journal=[[Human Events]] | volume=59 | issue=11 | page=16}}</ref><ref name="Zorn 2004">{{cite journal|author=Zorn, Eric|author-link=Eric Zorn|date=October 26, 2004|title=Political site polls well with election junkies|url=http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2006/04/good_riddance_t.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119080924/http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2006/04/good_riddance_t.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 19, 2013|journal=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=Metro, 1}}<!-- Not dead, but link goes to an not-secure webpage warning --></ref><ref name="Wolinsky 2006">{{cite journal|author=Wolinsky, Howard|date=September 18, 2006|title=Politicking pays off: Web site a must-read for political fanatics|journal=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=55}}</ref> The site features selected political news stories and op-eds from various news publications in addition to commentary from its own contributors.<ref name=princeton /><ref name="D'Agostino" /> In 2008, the founders said their goal was to give readers "ideological diversity" in its commentary section.<ref name="The New York Sun">{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/on-web-political-junkies-make-a-real-clear-choice/72596/|title=On Web, Political Junkies Make a Real Clear Choice|work=[[The New York Sun]]|date= March 10, 2008|access-date=2008-08-08}}</ref>  RCP has been described as non-partisan or right-of-center, depending on the source.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Steffen W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA140|title=American Government and Politics Today, Brief|last2=Shelley|first2=Mack C.|last3=Bardes|first3=Barbara A.|date=2018|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-337-67017-3|pages=140|language=en}}</ref> The site publishes aggregation of polling data during election seasons.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/19/nation/na-indiana19|title=Candidates come courting the Hoosiers|last=Jones|first=Tim|date=2008-10-19|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/obamas-surge-swamps-hillary/news-story/0e738c0058389832c1184603610ab84a|title=Obama's surge swamps Hillary|date=2008-02-10|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/us-election/obama-cuts-into-clintons-pennsylvania-majority/2008/04/09/1207420422477.html|title=Obama cuts into Clinton's majority – US Election – smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref>

== Origin and philosophy ==

=== Origin ===
The web site was founded in 2000 by McIntyre, a former [[trader (finance)|trader]] at the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]], and Bevan, a former [[advertising agency]] [[account executive]].<ref name="Zorn 2004" />  McIntyre explained "it really wasn't any more complicated than there should be a place online that pulled together all this quality information".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/small-business-entrepreneurs/2007/12/12/politics-junkies-spawn-a-real-clear-success.html|title=Political Junkies Spawn a Real, Clear Success|publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|date=December 12, 2007|first=Liz|last=Wolgemuth|access-date=2008-04-07}}</ref> They call what they do "intelligent aggregation."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/technology_internetcritic/2008/02/real-clear-poli.html|title=Real Clear Politics Real Clear on its Growth, Mission|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|date=February 7, 2008|access-date=2008-04-07}}</ref> The site has grown in election-season spurts since it first went online. It has expanded from a two-man operation to a full-time staff of more than two dozen employees overseeing the company's mainstay, RealClearPolitics, as well as ten smaller sites.

=== Philosophy ===
In a 2001 article for ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'', which noted that "The articles selected invariably demonstrate McIntyre and Bevan's political bent, about which they are unabashedly forthcoming." McIntyre said, "I'm not really a die-hard Republican because my interests are less on social issues, more on taxing and spending. ... But I definitely don't want the government telling me what to do with my property...  Nevertheless, any political junkie—even a liberal—would enjoy our site because the topics we choose are current."<ref name="princeton">Rob MacKay, [https://www.princeton.edu/paw/web_exclusives/more/more_20.html "Political junkies create Web site for opinion and analysis"], June 6, 2001 ''Princeton Alumni Weekly''. Princeton</ref>

In a 2003 interview with the conservative magazine ''[[Human Events]]'', McIntyre described the philosophy behind the website as based on "freedom" and "common-sense values". Said Bevan, "We think debate on the issues is a very important thing. We post a variety of opinions". He further stated, "we have a frustration all conservatives have", which is "the bias in media against conservatives, religious conservatives, [and] Christian conservatives".<ref name="D'Agostino" />

In a 2004 article for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Patrick Stack described the website's commentary section as "right-leaning".<ref name="rcp100">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/election2004/article/0,18471,724310,00.html|title=Cheat Sheet: Election Websites|access-date= 2009-07-15|work=Time|last=Stack |first=Patrick|date=October 14, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016000559/http://www.time.com/time/election2004/article/0,18471,724310,00.html|archive-date=October 16, 2004 |quote=RealClearPolitics.com scores points for its in-depth, right-leaning commentary section}}</ref>

In a 2008 interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', McIntyre said, "We're trying to pull together the best political stories, op-eds, news analyses, editorials out there. The proliferation of content is enormous. Part of what we're trying to do is distill it in a clear, simple way for people who don't have hours to spend searching the Net".<ref name="Chicago Tribune">{{cite news |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/technology_internetcritic/2008/02/real-clear-poli.html|title=Real Clear Politics real clear on its growth, mission |work=Chicago Tribune |last=Johnson |first=Steve|date=February 7, 2008}}</ref> In 2009, RealClearPolitics was described as a weblog "in the conservative pantheon" by Richard Davis.<ref name=davis-2009>Richard Davis, ''Typing Politics: The Role of Blogs in American Politics'' p. 54 (2009) [[Oxford University Press]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=PWZ2-5wla3MC Google].</ref><ref>Richard Davis, ''Politics Online: Blogs, Chatrooms, and Discussion Groups in American Democracy'' p. 43 (2013) Routledge [https://books.google.com/books?id=DjfKKDrTETgC Google].</ref>

During the [[2008 United States presidential election]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' repeatedly referred to RealClearPolitics as "nonpartisan".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holmes |first1=Elizabeth |title=Polls Show Race Tightening in Florida |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122479684232764281 |website=Wall Street Journal |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chozick |first1=Amy |title=Candidates Focus on Western States |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122496954123469575 |website=Wall Street Journal |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> The ''New York Times'' referred to its polling practice as a "nonpartisan tally."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knowlton |first1=Brian |title=In projections, Obama holds electoral lead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/world/americas/16iht-campaign.4.17029402.html?_r=1 |website=The New York Times |access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>

The 2012–2013 edition of academic text ''Cengage Advantage Books: American Government and Politics Today, Brief Edition'' describes the site as being run by conservatives, and containing "opinion pieces from multiple media sources".<ref>Steffen Schmidt, Mack Shelley, Barbara Bardes, ''Cengage Advantage Books: American Government and Politics Today'' p. 140 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IXwJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA140#v=onepage&q&f=false Google.] Cengage Learning, 2012</ref>

An October 2019 article in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reported that Real Clear Media manages a [[Facebook]] page of "far-right memes and Islamophobic smears." Anand Ramanujan, Chief Technology Officer for Real Clear Media, responded that the company created the website that was affiliated with the Facebook page "as part of an effort to understand the flow of traffic from social media—particularly Facebook—to political websites."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/realclear-media-has-a-secret-facebook-page-filled-with-far-right-memes|title=RealClear Media Has a Secret Facebook Page to Push Far-Right Memes|last1=Poulse|first1=Kevin|last2=Maxwell|first2=Tani|date=October 8, 2019|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>

== Ownership ==
[[Forbes]] Media LLC bought a 51% equity interest in the site in 2007.<ref name="forbes">{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20071107006128&newsLang=en|title=Forbes Media Acquires Fifty-One Percent Stake in RealClearPolitics.com|publisher=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2009-11-05 }}</ref> On May 19, 2015, it was announced that RealClearInvestors and Crest Media bought out Forbes's stake for an undisclosed amount.<ref name="PR Newsire">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crest-media-and-real-clear-investors-buy-remaining-stake-in-realclearpolitics-300085649.html|title=Crest Media And Real Clear Investors Buy Remaining Stake In RealClearPolitics|publisher=PRNewswire.com|access-date=2015-05-19}}</ref>

RealClearPolitics also owns RealClearMarkets, RealClearWorld, and RealClearSports.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/72596?page_no=3|title=On Web, Political Junkies Make a Real Clear Choice|publisher=[[New York Sun]]|date= March 10, 2008|first=Colin|last=Gustafson|access-date=2008-03-25}}</ref> RealClearMarkets and RealClearSports were launched in November 2007.

== Original content ==
In addition to linking to external content, RealClearPolitics also provides original commentary and reporting, with a staff that includes Carl Cannon, Scott Conroy, [[Erin McPike]], Caitlin Huey-Burns, Alexis Simendinger, James Arkin, and [[Sean Trende]].

== Political poll averaging ==
RealClearPolitics aggregates polls for presidential and congressional races into averages, known as the RealClearPolitics average, which are widely cited by media outlets. However, some statisticians say that it is sometimes misleading to average results from multiple polls.<ref name="wsj_risky">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120303346890469991|title=Election Handicappers Are Using Risky Tool: Mixed Poll Averages|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 15, 2008|first=Carl|last=Bialik|access-date=2008-08-08}}</ref> When [[Nate Silver]] of rival site [[FiveThirtyEight]] claimed RealClearPolitics.com was rigging its averages to favor Senator [[John McCain]] and other Republicans, McIntyre denied having a conservative bent, stating, "We're running a business. We have no interest in screwing around with that for partisan purposes".<ref name="silver">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/us/politics/28pollsite.html?_r=1|title=Political Polling Sites Are in a Race of Their Own|work=New York Times|access-date=2009-11-07|first=Bernie|last=Becker|date=2008-10-28}}</ref> Silver later backed away from the claim and said the two sites had a friendly rivalry and grudging respect for each other.<ref name="silver" />

In 2016, Republicans performed 1.7% better than the final RealClearPolitics average,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2016_generic_congressional_vote-5279.html|title=RealClearPolitics - Election Other - 2016 Generic Congressional Vote|website=www.realclearpolitics.com}}</ref> and Republicans performed 3.3% better than the site's average in 2014.<ref>https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html</ref> In the 2016 presidential election, the final RealClearPolitics average margin overestimated Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]]'s popular vote performance by 1.3%. The final electoral college prediction map produced by RealClearPolitics predicted the average outcome to be that she would narrowly win the election with 272 electoral votes. However, she lost the election to Republican [[Donald Trump]] in spite of winning the popular vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html|title=RealClearPolitics - Election 2016 - General Election: Trump vs. Clinton vs. Johnson vs. Stein|website=www.realclearpolitics.com}}</ref> In 2018, the site underestimated the Democratic vote in the 2018 congressional elections by just over one percentage point.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2018_generic_congressional_vote-6185.html|title=RealClearPolitics - Election Other - 2018 Generic Congressional Vote|website=www.realclearpolitics.com}}</ref>
