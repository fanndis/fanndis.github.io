The [[California State University, Long Beach]], one of the largest universities in California by enrollment, is located in the city.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Long Beach, California}}

===Origins===
[[Native Americans in the United States|Indigenous people]] have lived in coastal Southern California for over 10,000 years, and several successive cultures have inhabited the present-day area of Long Beach. By the 16th-century arrival of Spanish explorers, the dominant group was the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] people. They had at least three major settlements within the present-day city. ''Tevaaxa'anga'' was an inland settlement near the [[Los Angeles River]], while ''Ahwaanga'' and ''[[Puvunga|Povuu'nga]]'' were coastal villages. Along with other Tongva villages, they were forced to relocate in the mid-19th century due to missionization, political change, and a drastic drop in population from exposure to European diseases.<ref name="tfa">{{Cite book | last = McCawley | first = William | title=The First Angelinos: The Gabrielino Indians of Los Angeles | orig-year = 1952 | edition = Paperback | year=1996 | publisher=Malki Museum Press/Ballena Press | isbn=978-0-9651016-0-8}}</ref>

In 1784, the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[King Carlos III]] granted [[Rancho Los Nietos]] to Spanish soldier [[Manuel Nieto]]. The [[Rancho Los Cerritos]] and [[Rancho Los Alamitos]] were divided from this territory. The boundary between the two ranchos ran through the center of Signal Hill on a southwest to northeast diagonal. A portion of western Long Beach was originally part of the [[Rancho San Pedro]]. Its boundaries were in dispute for years, due to flooding changing the [[Los Angeles River]] boundary between Rancho San Pedro and Rancho Los Nietos.

In 1843, [[Jonathan Temple]] bought [[Rancho Los Cerritos]], having arrived in California in 1827 from [[New England]]. He built what is now known as the "[[Los Cerritos Ranch House]]", a still-standing [[adobe]] which is a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Temple created a thriving cattle ranch and prospered, becoming the wealthiest man in Los Angeles County. Both Temple and his ranch house played important local roles in the [[Mexican–American War]]. On an island in the [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], [[Mormons|Mormon]] pioneers made an abortive attempt to establish a colony (as part of [[Brigham Young]]'s plan to establish a continuous chain of settlements from the Pacific to [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake]]).

[[File:Long Beach Pier 1905.png|thumb|Long Beach pier, 1905]]

In 1866, Temple sold Rancho Los Cerritos for $20,000 to the Northern California sheep-raising firm of [[Bixby land companies|Flint, Bixby & Company]], which consisted of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint and their cousin [[Bixby family|Lewellyn Bixby]]. Two years previous Flint, Bixby & Co had also purchased along with Northern California associate [[James Irvine (landowner)|James Irvine]], three ranchos which would later become the city that bears Irvine's name. To manage Rancho Los Cerritos, the company selected Lewellyn's brother Jotham Bixby, the "Father of Long Beach". Three years later, Bixby bought into the property and would later form the Bixby Land Company. In the 1870s, as many as 30,000 sheep were kept at the ranch and sheared twice yearly to provide wool for trade. In 1880, Bixby sold {{convert|4,000|acre|km2}} of the Rancho Los Cerritos to William E. Willmore, who subdivided it in hopes of creating a farm community, Willmore City. He failed and was bought out by a Los Angeles syndicate that called itself the "Long Beach Land and Water Company." They changed the name of the community to Long Beach at that time.

The City of Long Beach was officially incorporated in 1897.

Gradually the oil industry, Navy shipyard and facilities and port became the mainstays of the city. In the 1950s it was referred to as "Iowa by the sea," due to a large influx of people from that and other [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states. Huge picnics for migrants from each state were a popular annual event in Long Beach until the 1960s.

Another Bixby cousin, John W. Bixby, was influential in the city. After first working for his cousins at Los Cerritos, J.W. Bixby leased land at [[Rancho Los Alamitos]]. He put together a group: banker [[Isaias W. Hellman|I.W. Hellman]], Lewellyn and Jotham Bixby, and him, to purchase the rancho. In addition to bringing innovative farming methods to the Alamitos (which under [[Abel Stearns]] in the late 1850s and early 1860s was once the largest cattle ranch in the US), J.W. Bixby began the development of the oceanfront property near the city's picturesque bluffs. Under the name Alamitos Land Company, J.W. Bixby named the streets and laid out the parks of his new city. This area would include Belmont Heights, Belmont Shore and Naples; it soon became a thriving community of its own. J.W. Bixby died in 1888 of apparent [[appendicitis]]. The Rancho Los Alamitos property was split up, with Hellman getting the southern third, Jotham and Lewellyn, the northern third, and J.W. Bixby's widow and heirs keeping the central third. The Alamitos townsite was kept as a separate entity, but at first, it was primarily run by Lewellyn and Jotham Bixby, although I.W, Hellman (who had the largest single share) had a significant veto power, an influence made even stronger as the J.W. Bixby heirs began to side with Hellman more and more.

When Jotham Bixby died in 1916, the remaining {{convert|3,500|acre|km2}} of Rancho Los Cerritos was subdivided into the neighborhoods of [[Bixby Knolls]], [[California Heights, Long Beach, California|California Heights]], [[North Long Beach, Long Beach, California|North Long Beach]] and part of the city of [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]].

Pine Avenue near 4th became the center of a large shopping district. Besides upscale [[Buffums]] (1912; expanded 1926),<ref>{{cite news |title=New Buffums' Store Opens; 5th Under Way |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56018627/new-buffums-pomona-and-lb-history/ |publisher=Long Beach Independent |date=October 2, 1969 |page=9}}</ref> in 1929 alone [[Barker Brothers]], the Hugh A.

Oil was discovered in 1921 on Signal Hill, which split off as a separately incorporated city shortly afterward. The discovery of the [[Long Beach Oil Field]], brought in by the [[oil gusher|gusher]] at the Alamitos No. 1 well, made Long Beach a major oil producer; in the 1920s the field was the most productive in the world.<ref name="MMS">Schmitt, R.

Ford had earlier opened a Factory in Los Angeles at the location of 12th Street and Olive, with a later factory built at East Seventh Street and Santa Fe Avenue after 1914.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca1600/ca1604/data/ca1604data.pdf |title=page 13 |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904094158/http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca1600/ca1604/data/ca1604data.pdf |archive-date=September 4, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Come 1938, the creation of Housing Authorities for both the City and County of Los Angeles were complete — and North Long Beach was to be home to the County Authority's first order of business: the Carmelitos Housing Project, Southern California's first affordable housing complex.<ref name="auto"/>

The city was part of the [[Battle of Los Angeles]] during [[World War II]] when observers for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] reported shells being fired from the sea. Anti-aircraft batteries fired into the night sky, although no planes were ever sighted.

Before the war, Long Beach had a sizable Japanese-American population, who worked in the fish canneries on [[Terminal Island]] and owned small truck (produce) farms in the area. Due to exaggerated fears on the coast and racial prejudice, state officials persuaded the national government to remove Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans for [[Japanese American Internment|internment]] in 1942 to inland facilities. Most did not return to the city after their release from the camps. Due to this and other factors, Japanese Americans now make up less than 1% of the population of Long Beach, but the Japanese Community Center and a Japanese Buddhist Church survive. The Japanese-American Cultural Center is over the Gerald Desmond Bridge and the [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]] in [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]].

[[Douglas Aircraft Company]]'s largest facility was its Long Beach plant, totaling 1,422,350 sq. ft. The first plane rolled out the door on December 23, 1941. The plant produced [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] transports, [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, and [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]] attack bombers simultaneously. Douglas merged with the [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell Aircraft Company]] in 1967 where the [[Douglas DC-8]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] were built. In 1997 McDonnell Douglas merged with [[Boeing]], which made [[C-17 Globemaster]] transport planes in Long Beach until the close of the manufacturing facility in 2015.<ref>Herman, Arthur.

==Geography==

[[File:Long Beach CA Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Long Beach, California, looking southwards (2010)]]

Long Beach is located at 33° 47' North, 118° 10' West, about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} south of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|51.437|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which {{convert|50.293|sqmi|km2|1}} is land and {{convert|1.144|sqmi|km2}} (2.22%) is water. Long Beach completely surrounds the city of [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]].

===Neighborhoods===

{{main|Neighborhoods of Long Beach, California}}

[[File:LB Neighborhoods.jpg|thumb|Neighborhood map of the City of Long Beach, CA]]
Long Beach is composed of many different neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are named after thoroughfares, while others are named for nearby parks, schools, or city features.

===Climate===

Long Beach has a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean-type climate]], with [[semi-arid climate]] characteristics. In general, the city features hot summers and mild to warm winters with occasional rainfall. Days in Long Beach are mostly sunny, as in Southern California in general. Temperatures recorded at the weather station at the [[Long Beach Airport]], {{convert|4.0|mi|km}} inland from the ocean, range more greatly than those along the immediate coast. During the summer months, low clouds and fog occur frequently, developing overnight and blanketing the area on many mornings. This fog usually clears by the afternoon, and a westerly sea breeze often develops, keeping temperatures mild. Heat and high humidity can sometimes coincide in summer, which may cause discomfort due to the heat index.<ref>{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-IV/US/GROUP1/00045115.TXT |title=Weather data |website=ftp.atdd.noaa.gov |format=PDF |access-date=2019-05-16 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525051535/ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-IV/US/GROUP1/00045115.TXT |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Long Beach's location directly east of the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]], paired with its south facing coastline, results in the city sometimes experiencing different weather patterns than the Los Angeles metropolitan area coastal communities to the northwest and southeast of Long Beach, which largely have west facing coastlines. The 1200&nbsp;ft Palos Verdes hills block west to east airflow and a significant amount of the coastal moisture that marks other coastal cities, such as [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], [[Santa Monica]], and [[Newport Beach]].

As in most locations in Southern California, most rainfall in Long Beach occurs during the winter months. Storms can bring heavy rainfall.<ref>{{cite web

===Environment===

====Pollution====

Long Beach suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the entire [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://science.time.com/2013/11/05/the-10-most-polluted-cities-in-america/slide/4-los-angeles-long-beach-riverside-ca/|title=#4 (tie): Los Angeles-Long Beach-Riverside, CA - The 10 Most Polluted Cities in America - TIME.com|work=TIME.com|date=November 5, 2013|access-date=February 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301172743/http://science.time.com/2013/11/05/the-10-most-polluted-cities-in-america/slide/4-los-angeles-long-beach-riverside-ca/|archive-date=March 1, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Most of the city is in proximity to the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the prevailing westerly-to-west-south-westerly winds bring a large portion of the twin ports' air pollution directly into Long Beach before dispersing it northward then eastward.<ref name="lbds.info">{{cite web| url=http://www.lbds.info/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=2437| title=City of Long Beach General plan, Air Quality Element| work=City of Long Beach website| accessdate=February 4, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504051623/http://www.lbds.info/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=2437| archive-date=May 4, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref> Heavy pollution sources at the ports include the ships themselves, which burn high-sulfur, high-soot-producing [[bunker fuel]] to maintain internal electrical power while docked, as well as heavy diesel pollution from [[drayage]] trucks at the ports, and short-haul tractor-trailer trucks ferrying cargo from the ports to inland warehousing, rail yards, and shipping centers. Long-term average levels of toxic air pollutants (and the corresponding [[carcinogenic]] risk they create) can be two to three times higher in and around Long Beach, and in downwind areas to the east, than in other parts of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, such as the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]], [[San Fernando Valley]], or [[San Gabriel Valley]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aqmd.gov/prdas/matesIII/matesIII.html| title=Multiple Airborne Toxics Exposure Study (MATES III)| work=South Coast Air Quality Management District website| accessdate=February 4, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129223223/http://aqmd.gov/prdas/matesIII/matesIII.html| archive-date=January 29, 2011| df=mdy-all}}</ref> While overall regional pollution in the Los Angeles metropolitan area has declined in the last decade, pollution levels remain dangerously high in much of Long Beach due to the port pollution, with diesel exhaust from ships, trains, and trucks as the largest sources.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-aqmd5jan05,0,1913116.story |title=Cancer risk from toxic air drops by 17% in Southland |author=Janet Wilson, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer |date=January 5, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times newspaper |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811212537/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-aqmd5jan05,0,1913116.story |archive-date=August 11, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Additionally, Long Beach is directly downwind of several of the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] [[oil refineries]]. Any refinery process or chemical upset that results in the atmospheric release of refinery by-products (commonly [[sulfur dioxide]])<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aqmd.gov/comply/R1118_main.htm| title=SCAQMD Rule 1118| work=[[SCAQMD]] website| accessdate=March 29, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505171346/http://aqmd.gov/comply/R1118_main.htm| archive-date=May 5, 2012| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aqmd.gov/news1/2004/bs9_03_04.html| title=SCAQMD News: AQMD TO SEEK EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM REFINERY FLARES| work=[[SCAQMD]] website| accessdate=March 29, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012060051/http://www.aqmd.gov/news1/2004/bs9_03_04.html| archive-date=October 12, 2012| df=mdy-all}}</ref> will usually impact air quality in Long Beach due to the west-south-westerly prevailing wind.<ref name="lbds.info" />

Similarly, the water quality in the Long Beach portion of [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], which is enclosed by the [[San Pedro Breakwater|Federal Breakwater]], commonly ranks among the poorest on the entire West Coast during rainy periods. Long Beach beaches average a D or F grade on beach water quality during rainy periods in the ''Beach Report Card'' published by [[Heal the Bay]].<ref name="Heal the Bay">{{cite web| url=http://brc.healthebay.org/?st=CA&f=1&tabid=2| title=Beach Report Card for California| work=Heal the Bay website| accessdate=February 4, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514225904/http://brc.healthebay.org/?st=CA&f=1&tabid=2| archive-date=May 14, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref> However, during dry periods the water may have an A or B rating in the same reports. The [[Los Angeles River]] discharges directly into the Long Beach side of San Pedro Bay. meaning a large portion of all the [[urban runoff]] from the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area pours directly into the harbor water. This runoff contains most of the debris, garbage, chemical pollutants, and biological pathogens washed into storm drains in every upstream city each time it rains. Because the breakwater prevents [[Tidal currents|tidal flushing]] and [[wave action]], these pollutants build up in the harbor. The water enclosed by the breakwater, along most of the city's beaches, can be subject to [[red tide]]s due to this stagnation as well. Because of these factors, the water in Long Beach is unsafe for swimming on a few days or weeks each year.<ref name="Heal the Bay" />

====Ecology====

[[File:LongBeachLongView.jpg|thumb|View from Signal Hill to Villa Riviera and port cranes (ca. 2009)]]

The area that is now Long Beach historically included several ecological communities, with coastal scrub dominating.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/biogeodata/cwhr/wildlife_habitats.asp | title=Wildlife Habitats | work=[[California Department of Fish and Game]] website | accessdate=February 24, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302175730/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/biogeodata/cwhr/wildlife_habitats.asp | archive-date=March 2, 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref> A handful of the native plants of the region can still be found in the city. These include California buckwheat (''[[Eriogonum fasciculatum]]''), California sagebrush (''[[Artemisia californica]]''), and California poppy (''[[Eschscholzia californica]]''). Some stands of coast live oak (''[[Quercus agrifolia]]'') still remain in the El Dorado Nature Center. California fan palm (''[[Washingtonia filifera]]''), a plant that is native further inland, was introduced to the city as a garden ornamental and is now naturalized. Some indigenous species of birds, mammals, and other wildlife have adapted to development.

Since the arrival of Europeans, many alien species have become naturalized in the area. Introduced plants include yellow mustard, [[eucalyptus]], [[wild radish]], and [[Salsola|tumbleweed]]. Such plants now far outnumber the indigenous plants and spread rapidly in the city's vacant lots and oil fields.

The city and its residents have initiatives underway to preserve and reclaim part of its ecological heritage. The RiverLink project has begun to revegetate the Long Beach stretch of the [[Los Angeles River]] with indigenous plants. Part of the remaining [[Pacific Electric Railway|Pacific Electric]] right-of-way was cleared of nonnatives, planted with indigenous plants, and made accessible with foot and bike paths. This community open space is now known as [[Long Beach Green Belt path|The Long Beach Greenbelt]] and is the focus of continuing efforts in restoration and community education.

The El Dorado Nature Center has changed its original "hands-off" approach and has begun to actively introduce indigenous species.<ref name="ednc">{{cite web | url=http://longbeach.gov/Park/Park-and-Facilities/Parks-Centers-Pier/El-Dorado-Nature-Center/ | title=El Dorado Nature Center | work=City of Long Beach website | accessdate=February 24, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080223081256/http://www.longbeach.gov/park/facilities/parks/el_dorado_nature_center.asp |archive-date = February 23, 2008}}</ref> The [[Los Cerritos Wetlands]] Study Group, state government agencies, and grassroots groups are collaborating on a plan to preserve Long Beach's last remaining [[Los Cerritos Wetlands|wetlands]].<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=33.7565,-118.104&ie=UTF8&ll=33.756886,-118.103993&spn=0.008385,0.014462&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr Overhead view of ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023724/https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=33.7565,-118.104&ie=UTF8&ll=33.756886,-118.103993&spn=0.008385,0.014462&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr |date=January 11, 2014 }}[[Los Cerritos Wetlands]].</ref> Long Beach is the first city in California to join the 'EcoZone' Program, intended to measurably improve environmental conditions through public-private partnerships. Such projects seek to reduce pollution, restore native habitat, and provide green areas for the city's residents to enjoy.

Other places in Long Beach to see natural areas include Bluff Park (coastal bluffs), the Golden Shores Marine Reserve, the Jack Dunster Marine Reserve, Shoreline Park, and DeForest Park.

Long Beach led Southern California in parks access, size and spending, ranking 16th among a survey of 75 large U.S. cities, with Los Angeles and Anaheim tied for 51st and Santa Ana 69th, according to a study released by a national conservation group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstelegram.com//lifestyle/20150519/survey-of-best-cities-for-parks-lists-long-beach-ahead-of-los-angeles-anaheim|title=Survey of best cities for parks lists Long Beach ahead of Los Angeles, Anaheim|work=presstelegram.com|date=2015-05-20|access-date=May 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522183429/http://www.presstelegram.com/lifestyle/20150519/survey-of-best-cities-for-parks-lists-long-beach-ahead-of-los-angeles-anaheim|archive-date=May 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city has changed since the 1950s, when its population was predominantly European-American and the city was nicknamed "Iowa by the Sea" or "Iowa under Palm Trees" as it had a slower pace than neighboring Los Angeles. In 1950, whites represented 97.4% of Long Beach's population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Statistics On Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For Large Cities And Other Urban Places In The United States |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |accessdate=December 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref> Since the second half of the 20th century, the city has been a major port of entry for Asian and Latin American immigrants headed to Los Angeles. The Harbor section of downtown Long Beach was once home to people of [[Dutch American|Dutch]], [[Greek American|Greek]], [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Maltese American|Maltese]], [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish American|Spanish]] ancestry, most of them employed in manufacturing and fish canneries until the 1960s.

According to a report by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2000, Long Beach is the most ethnically diverse large city in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/22/AR2007012201143_2.html | title=Long Beach Awaits Hate-Crime Verdict | work=Washington Post website | first=Sonya | last=Geis | date=January 23, 2007 | accessdate=May 11, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108165441/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/22/AR2007012201143_2.html | archive-date=November 8, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> Non-Hispanic White Americans made up 30.0% of the city's population. Its Asian community includes the largest [[Cambodian American|Cambodian]] community in the United States, and the second-largest Cambodian community outside of Asia (after [[Paris]]). A neighborhood along Anaheim Street is called "[[Little Phnom Penh]]". There are also sizable populations of immigrants and descendants from [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]].

Long Beach had offered many industrial jobs to African Americans during the years of [[World War II]]. This resulted in the increase of blacks in Long Beach caused by the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]]. There are black communities in the Eastside, North Long Beach, and Upper Westside neighborhoods.

It has a relatively high proportion of Pacific Islanders (over 1% as of the 2000 Census), from [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]]. Most [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], about 0.8% of the city's population, arrived during the [[Department of the Interior]]'s [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] urban relocation programs in the 1950s.

Long Beach once had a sizable [[Japanese American]] population, which largely worked in the fish canneries on [[Terminal Island]] and on small truck farms in the area. In 1942, not long after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and subsequent [[Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued United States Executive Order 9066 which allowed military commanders to designate areas "from which any or all persons may be excluded." Under this order, all Japanese and Americans of Japanese ancestry were [[Japanese American internment|categorically removed from Western coastal regions]] and sent to [[internment camp]]s, without regard for [[due process]]. Most did not return to Long Beach after their release from the camps. Japanese Americans make up less than 1% of the population of Long Beach, yet the city still has a Japanese Community Center and a Japanese Buddhist Church from its earlier history.

The front beach area of the city was once home to a now-defunct amusement park. Its first rollercoaster opened for business in June 1907. It was named the Figure 8 after the shape of the tracks, and was built on pilings that reached out over the water. In 1914 the [[The Pike|Pike Amusement Zone]] undertook several upgrades and a new roller coaster named the Jack Rabbit Racer was opened in May 1915 becoming the second largest racing coaster in the country. It was part of the Silver Spray Pier which included several new rides and concessions. In the mid-twenties, several expansions were made to the area and the Jack Rabbit Racer was remodeled raising the ride's dips to a greater height and steepness but it was soon removed to make way for the Cyclone Racer roller coaster which opened May 1930. The new coaster was also built on pilings over the ocean, but as the breakwater was built and the harbor expanded, the sandy beach extended. Eventually the entire pier stood over the beach. When demolished in September 1968, the Cyclone Racer was the only two track roller coaster in the United States.

===Surfing===
Although California's surfing scene is said to have gotten its start in Long Beach when in 1911 two surfers returned from Hawaii and the city hosted the first National Surfing and Paddleboard Championships in 1938, surfing is now uncommon in Long Beach due to a {{convert|2.2|mi|km|adj=on}} long breakwater built in 1949 to protect the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The breakwater reduces "mighty waves to mere lake-like lapping along the city's beaches." The fleet left in the 1990s, and now some residents are calling for it to be lowered or eliminated and the city has commissioned a $100,000 study for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schoch |first=Deborah |title=Long Beach at sea over breakwater removal plan |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 30, 2008 |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-breakwater30-2008jun30,0,3801152.story |accessdate=July 1, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701155434/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-breakwater30-2008jun30,0,3801152.story |archive-date=July 1, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Government==
{{See also|Government of Los Angeles County}}

===Municipal===
Long Beach is a California [[charter city]], and is governed by nine City Council members, who are elected by district, and the [[Mayor of Long Beach|Mayor]], who is elected at-large since a citywide initiative passed in 1988. The City Attorney, City Auditor, and City Prosecutor are also elected positions. The city is supported by a budget of $2.3 billion, and has more than 5,500 employees.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.longbeach.gov | title=City of Long Beach Web Site | access-date=December 10, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210194951/http://www.longbeach.gov/ | archive-date=December 10, 2005 | url-status=live }}</ref> Long Beach was first incorporated in 1888 with 59 buildings and a new school. Nine years later, dissatisfaction with [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] and high taxes led to an abortive and short-lived disincorporation. Before the year 1897 was out, the citizens voted to reincorporate, and the 1897 date of incorporation is shown on the city seal.

Long Beach is a ''full-service city'' that provides nearly all of its own municipal services, in contrast with a [[contract city]]. City hall provides a full range of traditional municipal services through the various departments that make up its staff of civil servants. In addition to its own police and fire departments, Long Beach provides:
*Municipal water supply and sewer service through the Long Beach Water Department, which has a water treatment plant within the city
*A Gas & Oil Department, which manages consumer natural gas service and infrastructure, as well as crude oil extraction subsidence control<ref name="LBGO">{{cite web |url=http://www.longbeach.gov/lbgo/ |title=Long Beach Gas & Oil |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527214847/http://www.longbeach.gov/lbgo/ |archive-date=May 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>
*Health services through the Long Beach Health & Human Services Department, which handles both environmental health (such as restaurant/food inspection) and public health services. This is one of the only three municipal health departments in California (the other two being [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]])
*Sanitation and recycling services through the Environmental Services Bureau in the Public Works Department<ref name="Env Serv Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.longbeach-recycles.org/home/index.htm|title=Long Beach Environmental Services Bureau|website=Long Beach Environmental Services Bureau|accessdate=June 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618164853/http://longbeach-recycles.org/home/index.htm|archive-date=June 18, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Long Beach Police Department provides law enforcement for the City of Long Beach.

====Restrictions on registered sex offenders====
On March 18, 2008, Long Beach became the first city in California to heavily restrict residency and visitation rights for California [[Sex offender registries in the United States|registered sex offenders]]. Triggered by a local protest of a multi-apartment dwelling which tenanted several paroled registered sex offenders, and fueled by local radio hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou of [[KFI]]'s [[John and Ken]] show, city council members voted 7–0 to enact 18 ordinances, of which the most restrictive prohibits residency by all registered sex offenders, whether they are on parole or not, within {{convert|2000|ft|m}} of any child care center, public or private school, or park. [[Google Maps]] measurements indicate the total exclusion area encompasses over 96% of the area of Long Beach that is zoned for residential use. Registered sex offenders residing within the exclusion zone were given until September 2008 to vacate the restricted area. Once this happens, no sex offender will legally be able to live in the vast majority of Long Beach. While several other ordinances restrict the number of registered sex offenders who may reside in an apartment complex, there are no apartment complexes within city limits that are outside of the exclusion zone. In addition, the ordinances prohibit all registered sex offenders from using any park, beach, or facility that caters to children, such as amusement parks and restaurants with children's playgrounds, or even travel within {{convert|500|ft|m}} of such places.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lbreport.com/news/mar08/sexord2.htm | title=LBReport.com | work=Council Approves LB Muni Code Amendments Adding Sex Offender Residency/Loitering Restrictions | access-date=March 13, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019080019/http://www.lbreport.com/news/mar08/sexord2.htm | archive-date=October 19, 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.presstelegram.com/news/ci_8620321 | title=Long Beach Press-Telegram, March 19, 2008 | work=Long Beach passes sex offender rules | access-date=March 20, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210085018/http://www.presstelegram.com/news/ci_8620321 | archive-date=December 10, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://municipalcodes.lexisnexis.com/codes/longbeach/ | title=Long Beach Municipal Code Update (PDF) | work=ORDINANCE NO.

[[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX) is the nearest airport with international service. [[John Wayne Airport]] in [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] is another alternative to the airport. However, its only international services are to [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]]. Other airports with scheduled service are [[Bob Hope Airport]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Ontario International Airport]] in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]].

===Freeways and highways===
Several [[freeway]]s run through Long Beach, connecting it with the [[Greater Los Angeles area|greater Los Angeles]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] areas. The [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway (I-405)]] bisects the northern and southern portions of the city and takes commuters northwest or southeast to the [[Interstate 5 (California)|Golden State/Santa Ana Freeways (I-5)]]. The San Diego Freeway also provides regional access to Long Beach Airport, which is on the north side of the freeway near [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]]. The [[Interstate 710 (California)|Long Beach Freeway (I-710)]] runs north-south on the city's western border, with its southern terminus adjacent to the [[Port of Long Beach]] on [[Terminal Island]] at the intersection of the [[California State Route 103|Terminal Island Freeway (SR 103)]] and [[California State Route 47|State Route 47]]. The Long Beach Freeway is the major spur route serving Long Beach from downtown Los Angeles, with its northern terminus near downtown Los Angeles in [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]]. Along with the [[Interstate 110 (California)|Harbor Freeway (I-110)]] to the west, the Long Beach Freeway is one of the major routes for trucks transporting goods from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to railyards and [[distribution center]]s in downtown Los Angeles and the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]. The southern end of the Long Beach Freeway joins Long Beach with Terminal Island via the [[Gerald Desmond Bridge (2020-present)|Gerald Desmond Bridge]].

Southeast Long Beach is served by the [[Interstate 605 (California)|San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605)]], which joins the San Diego Freeway at the Long Beach/[[Los Alamitos, California|Los Alamitos]] border. The [[California State Route 91|Artesia Freeway (SR 91)]] runs east-west near the northern border of Long Beach.

===Bicycles and pedestrians===
The city of Long Beach has five major Class 1 bike paths (separate off-road bike paths) within its boundaries, encompassing over {{convert|60|mi|km}}. The city also has many Class 2 (painted lanes on roadway) and Class 3 paths (connecting bike routes with shared use of road with cars).<ref name=Destination>{{cite news |title=Here's How Long Beach Is Becoming a Top Open-Water Swimming Destination |work=Route Fifty |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |first=Dave |last=Nyczepir |date=July 13, 2016 |access-date=14 July 2016 |url=http://www.routefifty.com/2016/07/long-beach-swimability/129887/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726160735/http://www.routefifty.com/2016/07/long-beach-swimability/129887/ |archive-date=July 26, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A 2019 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Long Beach the tenth most walkable of over 100 cities around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/ |title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |access-date=28 August 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69hdEpBFH?url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/ |archive-date=August 6, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The {{convert|3.1|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Long Beach bicycle path|Shoreline Pedestrian Bikepath]] runs along the ocean from Shoreline Village to Belmont Shore. The southern terminus of the [[L.A. River bicycle path]] is in southwest Long Beach between downtown and the port. The southern terminus of the [[San Gabriel River bicycle path]] is just east of Long Beach in [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]], and the trail runs north through the [[El Dorado Park, Long Beach, California|El Dorado Park]] neighborhood in east Long Beach and adjacent to El Dorado Regional Park.

The city's green lane project in Belmont Shore ([[sharrows]], bike boxes) earned an award from the [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] for best innovative project of the year (2010). In an effort to provide sustainable transportation alternatives to the community, as well as a safe route to several neighborhood schools, the city of Long Beach is also installing a "bike boulevard" on Vista Street, extending from Temple Avenue to Nieto Avenue.

===Movies and television===
{{See also|The_Pike#In_film_and_television|label 1=The Pike in film and television}}
[[Balboa Amusement Producing Company]], also known as Balboa Studios, was at Sixth Street and Alamitos Avenue; they used {{convert|11|acre|m2|-3}} on [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]] for outdoor locations. [[Silent film]] stars who lived in Long Beach included [[Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Theda Bara]]. The 1917 film ''[[Cleopatra (1917 film)|Cleopatra]]'', starring Theda Bara, was shot at the [[Gardena Willows Wetland Preserve|Dominguez Slough]] just west of Long Beach, and Moses parted the Red Sea for [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s 1923 version of ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' on the flat seashore of [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]], southeast of Long Beach. Long Beach was the famous location of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] [[newsreel]] footage of the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]], out-takes from the [[W.C. Fields]] 1933 featurette [[International House (1933 film)|''International House'']] was possibly the first earthquake to be captured in action on film.

Because of its proximity to LA-area studios and its variety of locations, today Long Beach is regularly used for movies, television shows, and advertisements. The city has filled in for locations across the nation and around the globe.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmlongbeach.com/ | title=City of Long Beach Special Events | access-date=June 18, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615041335/http://www.filmlongbeach.com/ | archive-date=June 15, 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref> One advantage for Long Beach is that the video and film industry uses a zone that extends {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} from [[Beverly Boulevard|Beverly Blvd.]] and [[La Cienega Boulevard|La Cienega Blvd.]] in the [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] area. It is cheaper to shoot within that zone, so Long Beach and other South Bay cities often stand in for areas of Orange County (such as for ''[[The O.C.]]'' TV show<ref name="OC">{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/OC/ByLocation.shtml |title=The O.C.

One of the most famous Long Beach film locations is the home of Ferris Bueller in ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. Though the film was set in the North Shore suburbs of [[Chicago]] the actual house is at 4160 Country Club Dr.<ref>[https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=4160+Country+Club+Drive,+Long+Beach,+California&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=64.241198,108.28125&ie=UTF8&ll=33.831819,-118.199008&spn=0.008395,0.013218&t=h&z=16 https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=4160+Country+Club+Drive,+Long+Beach,+California&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=64.241198,108.28125&ie=UTF8&ll=33.831819,-118.199008&spn=0.008395,0.013218&t=h&z=16] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111033936/https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=4160+Country+Club+Drive,+Long+Beach,+California&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=64.241198,108.28125&ie=UTF8&ll=33.831819,-118.199008&spn=0.008395,0.013218&t=h&z=16 |date=January 11, 2014 }} ''maps.google.com''</ref>

The film ''[[Freedom Writers]]'', although not shot there, was based on Long Beach [[Wilson Classical High School|Woodrow Wilson High School]].

Other locations in Long Beach have been used frequently as well. An episode of ''[[The Lone Wolf (TV series)|The Lone Wolf]]'', "The Long Beach Story",<ref>{{cite web |title=The Long Beach Story (a.k.a. The Smuggling Story) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1036177/ |accessdate=20 June 2020}}</ref> features the [[Breakers Hotel (Long Beach, California)#Wilton (1947–1961)|Wilton Hotel]]. Shoreline Drive visually approximates a freeway but is a municipal roadway and permits are accepted for its closure for shooting video and film – it has become a frequent movie and television freeway stand-in. Many car chase and crash scenes have been shot on stretches of road near the Long Beach harbor and along the city's Shoreline Drive. Among these are the 1963 movie ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and numerous episodes of the 1970s TV drama ''[[CHiPs]]'' (as well as the 2017 film [[CHiPs (film)|''CHiPs'']]). Long Beach's downtown neighborhood has stood in for various urban areas in a variety of movies. Multiple scenes from the movie ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' and ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]''<ref name="Speed">{{cite web | url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Speed3.shtml | title=Speed Filming Locations | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012164558/http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Speed3.shtml | archive-date=October 12, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> were shot in Long Beach. ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' was also shot in Long Beach as was ''Big Momma's House 2''. ''[[CSI: Miami]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', and ''[[Jane the Virgin]]'', although set in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], Florida, regularly get shot in Long Beach. Much of ''[[Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny]]'' was shot in Long Beach. Although there was a chase scene downtown, most of Tenacious D was shot at [[Alex's Bar]] at 2913 E. Anaheim St., a punk rock/alternative rock venue. Most of the viral hit ''[[Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus]]'' was also shot by the Belmont Veterans Memorial Pier and Alamitos power station in Long Beach.
The Long Beach Terrace Theatre has also been used for various commercials, an episode of ''[[Glee (TV Series)|Glee]]'', as well as the film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.

In 2013 Freedom Communications, owner of the ''[[Orange County Register]]'', launched a five-day daily newspaper, the ''Long Beach Register'', aimed at competing with the ''Press-Telegram''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Despite-Odds-Calif-City-Becomes-2-Newspaper-Town-220104281.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_LABrand|title=Despite Odds, Calif.

===Radio===
Long Beach is part of the Los Angeles [[designated market area|DMA]] radio and television markets. Although a few radio stations have had studios in Long Beach over the years, including the 1980s [[alternative music]] and later [[hard rock]] station [[KNAC]], the only remaining radio stations in Long Beach are the jazz and blues station [[KKJZ]] on the [[California State University, Long Beach|Cal State Long Beach]] campus, and the [[Christian radio]] broadcaster [[KFRN]]. The most recent radio station to grace the Long Beach airways is public radio station KLBP, 99.1, a low-power station, which started broadcasting in December 2018.
