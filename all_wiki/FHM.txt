'''''FHM''''' is a men's lifestyle magazine that is published in several countries. Its master edition contained features such as the [[FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World|''FHM'' 100 Sexiest Women in the World]], which has featured models, TV presenters, reality stars and singers.<ref>http://www.fhm.com/posts/michelle-keegan-95580</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhm.com/|title=FHM Men's Magazine. Sexy Girls, News & Men's Fashion (homepage) |work=FHM|accessdate=8 September 2013}}</ref>

The final printed issue of British ''FHM'' was in December 2015, after which the magazine moved to a digital-only platform, where topics such as dating tips, style advice, viral news, life hacks, sports and entertainment, among other things, were covered daily.

High-profile names that have been published in the magazine include top models [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Rosie_Huntington-Whiteley/|title=Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - Fashion Model {{!}} Models {{!}} Photos, Editorials & Latest News {{!}} The FMD|last=FashionModelDirectory.com|first=The FMD -|website=The FMD - FashionModelDirectory.com|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> [[Anne Vyalitsyna]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hawtcelebs.com/anne-vyalitsyna-in-fhm-magazine-china-may-2014-issue/|title=ANNE VYALITSYNA in FHM Magazine, China May 2014 Issue|date=16 May 2014|work=HawtCelebs|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Miranda Kerr]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Miranda_Kerr/|title=Miranda Kerr - Fashion Model {{!}} Models {{!}} Photos, Editorials & Latest News {{!}} The FMD|last=FashionModelDirectory.com|first=The FMD -|website=The FMD - FashionModelDirectory.com|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> [[Candice Swanepoel]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/victorias-secret-model-candice-swanepoel-816795|title=Seen this FHM?

==History==
The magazine began publication in 1985 in the UK under the name ''For Him Magazine''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Di Hand|author2=Steve Middleditch|title=Design for Media: A Handbook for Students and Professionals in Journalism, PR, and Advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrAABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA8|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=10 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-86402-8|page=8}}</ref> and changed its title to '''''FHM''''' in May 1992, although the full ''For Him Magazine'' continued to be printed on the spine of each issue. The first woman to appear on the cover was [[Gina Davies]] in February 1993. The trend towards female cover stars grew over the following year, with both [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Andie MacDowell]] appearing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Circulation expanded to newsagents as a quarterly by the spring of 1987 and then monthly in 1994. EMAP Consumer Media bought the magazine in 1994 and it subsequently went on to dominate the UK men's market and began to expand internationally, being published in 32 countries including India.<ref name=bbcz />

On 17 November 2015, British ''FHM'' announced their intention to suspend publication alongside that of fellow men's magazine ''[[Zoo Weekly|ZOO]]''; while the website would still be updated online.<ref name=bbcz>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34845063|title=FHM and Zoo magazines to suspend publication|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=FHM magazine and Zoo to be suspended |url=https://filmindustry.network/fhm-magazine-and-zoo-to-be-suspended/29915 |publisher=Film Industry Network |date=17 November 2015}}</ref>

In August 2016, under the guidance of BauerXcel Media, a property of [[Bauer Media Group]], Nick Dimengo took over as the senior editor of FHM.com. FHM.com was subsequently shut down and redirected to Bauer's competition website, Win Something.
