==History==
The university was established as the '''Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State Normal School for Negroes''' in 1912.<ref name="tnencyclopedia">{{cite web|last1=Lovett |first1=Bobby L. |title=Tennessee State University |url=http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1358 |website=The Tennessee Encyclopedia of HIstory and Culture |publisher=[[Tennessee Historical Society]] and the [[University of Tennessee Press]] |accessdate=August 24, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503202457/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1358 |archive-date=May 3, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="lamonthetennesseeagricultural">{{cite journal|last1=Lamon|first1=Lester C.|title=The Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Normal School: Public Higher Education for Black Tennesseans|journal=Tennessee Historical Quarterly|date=Spring 1973|volume=32|issue=1|pages=42–58|jstor=42623357}}</ref> Its dedication was held on January 16, 1913.<ref name="tnencyclopedia"/> It changed its name to '''Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State Normal College''' in 1925.<ref name="tnencyclopedia"/> Two years later, in 1927, it became known as '''Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College'''.<ref name="tnencyclopedia"/>

In 1941, the Tennessee General Assembly directed the Board of Education to upgrade the educational program of the college.  Three years later the first master's degrees were awarded and by 1946 the college was fully accredited the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].<ref name="blackpast.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/tennessee-state-university-1912|title=Tennessee State University (1912- ) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org}}</ref>

Significant expansion occurred during the presidency of [[Walter S. Davis]] between 1943 and 1968, including the construction of "70 percent of the school's facilities" and the establishment of the graduate school and four other schools.<ref name="tennesseanblackhistory">{{cite news|title=Black History Month: Walter Davis helped build TSU while president|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2015/02/11/black-history-month-walter-davis-helped-build-tsu-while-president/23246837/|accessdate=December 18, 2017|work=The Tennessean|date=February 11, 2015}}</ref>

In 1968, the college officially changed its name to '''Tennessee State University'''.  And in 1979, the [[University of Tennessee at Nashville]] merged into Tennessee State due to a court mandate.<ref name="blackpast.org"/>

Today, Tennessee State University is divided into eight schools and colleges and has seen steady growth since its inception. It remains the only public university in Nashville and its health science program is the largest in the state and one of the largest in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnstate.edu/academic_programs/index.aspx|title=Academic Programs|first=Tennessee State|last=University|website=www.tnstate.edu}}</ref>

Aligned with the Tennessee Board of Regents, it is currently governed by an institutional Board of Trustees.

==Campus==
The {{convert|500|acre|km2}} main [[campus]] has more than 65 buildings, and is located in a residential setting at 3500 John A. Merritt Blvd in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Tennessee State's main campus has the most acres of any college campus in Nashville. The [[Avon Williams]] campus is located downtown, near the center of the Nashville business and government district. Tennessee State offers on-campus housing to students. There are on-campus dorms and two apartment complexes for upperclassmen.
