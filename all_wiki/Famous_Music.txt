'''Famous Music Corporation''' was the worldwide music publishing division of [[Paramount Pictures]], a division of [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]] since 1994. Its [[copyright]] holdings span several decades and includes music from such [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning motion pictures as ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. It was founded in 1928 by Paramount’s predecessor, the Famous-Lasky Corporation, to publish music from its "talking pictures." Some of the classic songs in the Famous Music catalog that originated in motion pictures include "[[Moon River]]", "[[Thanks for the Memory]]", "[[Silver Bells]]", "[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]", "[[(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story|Where Do I Begin?]]" (the theme from ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''), "[[Speak Softly, Love]]" (the theme from ''[[The Godfather]]''), "[[Up Where We Belong]]", "[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]", "[[Take My Breath Away]]" and "[[My Heart Will Go On]]".

Famous Music additionally owned music and songs from television programs produced by Paramount until ownership of most of those songs was transferred to CBS in 2006 as part of Viacom's split into two separate companies: CBS and "new" Viacom. These included the "[[Theme from Mission: Impossible|Theme from ''Mission: Impossible'']]" (ownership remained with Paramount), the "[[Theme from Star Trek|Theme from ''Star Trek'']]", and "[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]" (the theme from ''[[Cheers]]'').

Famous Music also provided licensing and administration services for many prominent music catalog owners such as CBS, The [[Clyde Otis]] Music Catalogs, as well as for other Viacom divisions including [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]] and [[BET]].

Starting mostly in the late 1980s and continuing until the company was sold in 2007 (see below), Famous Music was active in acquiring songs that did not originate in Paramount motion pictures or television programs. These included the purchase of many works from the [[Duke Ellington]] catalog, as well as acquisition or administration agreements with recording artists and producers such as [[Shakira]], [[Eminem]], [[Akon]], [[She Wants Revenge]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Paula Cole]], The Cunninghams, [[Björk]], [[Gavin Rossdale]], [[Daniel Powter]], [[Harvey Danger]], [[Martika]], [[KC Porter]], [[Linda Perry]], [[Kike Santander]], [[Irv Gotti]], [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]] and [[P.O.D.]]<ref name="Sony/ATV Music Publishing Completes Acquisition of Famous Music LLC from Viacom">{{cite news|url=http://sony.mediaroom.com/2007-08-01-Sony-ATV-Music-Publishing-Completes-Acquisition-of-Famous-Music-LLC-from-Viacom,1|title=Sony/ATV Music Publishing Completes Acquisition of Famous Music LLC from Viacom|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=April 14, 2009 | date=August 1, 2007}}</ref>

In December 2012, Sony/ATV sold the Famous Music UK song catalogue (which included Placebo and [[The Kooks]]) to [[BMG Rights Management]].<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bmg-buys-virgin-famous-music-406080 Scott Roxborough, "BMG Buys Virgin, Famous Music Catalog From Sony/ATV"], ''Hollywood Reporter'', December 21, 2012.</ref> Paramount Pictures moved the administration of its music to [[Universal Music Publishing Group]] sometime in the late 2010s; [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]] (excluding [[Showtime Networks]]) followed suit in 2020.

== Famous Music Records Group ==
For a number of years, Famous Music also had a record label group division which included [[Blue Thumb Records]], [[Dot Records]] and [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount Records]]. In 1974 these were acquired by [[ABC Records]] for $5.5 million with most of the Famous labels absorbed into ABC Records.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=%22famous+music%22+%2B++%22abc+records%22&hl=en&ei=x9IUTYWnKYOXnAfHiL3TCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22famous%20music%22%20%2B%20%20%22abc%20records%22&f=false "Famous Labels Bought By ABC"], ''Billboard'', August 10, 1974.</ref>

Famous had distribution deals with [[Neighborhood Records]] and [[Sire Records]], the latter of which continued under ABC until 1977.

The catalogs of all the ABC/Famous Music labels are now owned by [[Universal Music Group]] (with some exceptions, for example, the 1968-1970 catalog of [[Stax Records]], which during that period was owned by Famous, is owned by [[Concord Music Group]], itself distributed by UMG.)

Various labels under Universal manage different parts of the catalog depending on the genre. Here are some examples:

*Pop, rock, R&B: [[Geffen Records]]
*Country: [[MCA Nashville Records]]
*Jazz: [[Impulse! Records]]
*Classical: [[Deutsche Grammophon]]
*Musical theater: [[Verve Records]]
