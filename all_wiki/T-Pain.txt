==Early life==
Najm was born and raised in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], [[Florida]].<ref name="allmusic"/> His stage name is short for "Tallahassee Pain", and was chosen because of the hardships he experienced while living there.

Speaking in May 2007 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis, of the award-winning [[Blues & Soul]] about his reason for naming his second album 'Epiphany', T-Pain stated: "One of the two dictionary meanings of epiphany is 'a sudden moment of insight or revelation'. And to me the title 'Epiphany' signifies the moment I realized that, to make the best music I can, I needed to just go in the studio and be myself, and not concentrate so hard on following other people's formulas."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/238/no_pain_no_gain/ |title=T-Pain interview|publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date=February 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref>
