'''Barbie''' is a [[fashion doll]] manufactured by the American toy company [[Mattel|Mattel, Inc.]] and launched in March 1959. American businesswoman [[Ruth Handler]] is credited with the creation of the doll using a German doll called [[Bild Lilli doll|Bild Lilli]] as her inspiration.

Barbie is the figurehead of a brand of Mattel dolls and accessories, including other family members and collectible dolls. Barbie has been an important part of the toy [[fashion]] doll market for over fifty years, and has been the subject of numerous controversies and lawsuits, often involving parodies of the doll and her lifestyle.

Mattel has sold over a billion Barbie dolls, making it the company's largest and most profitable line. However, sales have declined sharply since 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattel-to-add-curvy-petite-tall-barbies-1453991134|title=Mattel to Add Curvy, Petite, Tall Barbies: Sales of the doll have fallen at double-digit rate for past eight quarters|author=Paul Ziobro|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date= January 28, 2016}}</ref>  The doll transformed the toy business in affluent communities worldwide by becoming a vehicle for the sale of related merchandise (accessories, clothes, friends of Barbie, etc.). She had a significant impact on social values by conveying characteristics of female independence, and with her multitude of accessories, an idealized upscale life-style that can be shared with affluent friends.<ref>Don Richard Cox, "Barbie and her playmates." ''Journal of Popular Culture'' 11.2 (1977): 303-307.</ref> Starting in 1987, Barbie has expanded into a [[media franchise]], including [[Barbie (film series)|animated films]], [[television special]]s, [[:Category:Barbie video games|video games]], and [[Barbie Girl|music]].

==History==
[[Image:MattelBarbieno1br.jpg|thumb|upright|The first Barbie doll was introduced in both blonde and brunette in March 1959.]]
Ruth Handler watched her daughter Barbara play with paper dolls, and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband [[Elliot Handler|Elliot]], a co-founder of the [[Mattel]] toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.<ref>Mary G. Lord, ''Forever Barbie: The unauthorized biography of a real doll'' (Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2004).</ref>

During a trip to Europe in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called [[Bild Lilli doll|Bild Lilli]].<ref>In an interview with M.G.Lord, the author of ''Forever Barbie'', Ruth Handler said that she saw the doll in Lucerne, Switzerland. However, the book points out that on other occasions Handler said that she saw the doll in Zurich or Vienna.</ref> The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a [[comic strip]] drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper ''[[Bild]]''. Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet Lilli, the High-end German Call Girl Who Became America's Iconic Barbie Doll|url=http://www.messynessychic.com/2016/01/29/meet-lilli-the-high-end-german-call-girl-who-became-americas-iconic-barbie-doll/|website=Messy Nessy|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=January 29, 2016}}</ref>

Upon her return to the United States, Handler redesigned the doll (with help from engineer [[Jack Ryan (designer)|Jack Ryan]]) and the doll was given a new name, ''Barbie'', after Handler's daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the [[American International Toy Fair]] in New York on March 9, 1959.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/mar/09/1959/ruth-mosko-handler | title=Ruth Mosko Handler unveils Barbie Doll | publisher=Jewish Women's Archive | accessdate=8 March 2014}}</ref> This date is also used as Barbie's official birthday.

The first Barbie doll wore a black and white zebra striped swimsuit and signature topknot [[ponytail]], and was available as either a blonde or brunette. The doll was marketed as a "Teen-age Fashion Model," with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson. The first Barbie dolls were manufactured in Japan, with their clothes hand-stitched by Japanese homeworkers. Around 350,000 Barbie dolls were sold during the first year of production.

[[Louis Marx and Company]] sued Mattel in March 1961. After licensing Lilli, they claimed that Mattel had “infringed on Greiner & Hausser's patent for Bild-Lilli’s hip joint, and also claimed that Barbie was "a direct take-off and copy" of Bild-Lilli. The company additionally claimed that Mattel "falsely and misleadingly represented itself as having originated the design". Mattel counter-claimed and the case was settled out of court in 1963. In 1964, Mattel bought Greiner & Hausser's copyright and patent rights for the Bild-Lilli doll for $21,600.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Toy monster: the big, bad world of Mattel|last = Oppenheimer|first = Jerry|publisher = Wiley|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0071402118|location = Hoboken, N.J.|pages = 33–34}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/23/business/fi-barbie23| title=Mattel Wins Ruling in Barbie Dispute | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref>

Ruth Handler believed that it was important for Barbie to have an adult appearance, and early [[market research]] showed that some parents were unhappy about the doll's chest, which had distinct breasts. Barbie's appearance has been changed many times, most notably in 1971 when the doll's eyes were adjusted to look forwards rather than having the demure sideways glance of the original model.

Barbie was one of the first toys to have a marketing strategy based extensively on television advertising, which has been copied widely by other toys. It is estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold worldwide in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three Barbie dolls are sold every second.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5370398.stm |work=BBC News | title=Vintage Barbie struts her stuff | date=September 22, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

The standard range of Barbie dolls and related accessories are manufactured to approximately [[1:6 scale modeling|1/6 scale]], which is also known as ''playscale''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miniatures.about.com/od/glossaryofminiatureterms/g/playscale.htm |title=Playscale per About.com |publisher=Miniatures.about.com |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 23, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075027/http://miniatures.about.com/od/glossaryofminiatureterms/g/playscale.htm| archive-date= July 7, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> The standard dolls are approximately 11½ inches tall.

==Media franchise==
{{See|Barbie (film series)}}

Barbie products include not only the range of dolls with their clothes and accessories, but also a large range of Barbie branded goods such as books, apparel, cosmetics, and [[:Category:Barbie video games|video games]]. Barbie has had a [[media franchise]] starting with ''[[Barbie in the Nutcracker]]'' in 2001, when she began appearing in a [[Barbie (film series)|series of animated films]].

Barbie's [[direct-to-DVD]] animated films have sold over 110{{nbsp}}million units worldwide, as of 2013.<ref>{{cite news |title=Barbie celebrates 25th DVD release today |url=https://ew.com/article/2013/02/26/barbie-25-dvd-release-pink-shoes/ |accessdate=February 6, 2019 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 26, 2013}}</ref> In addition, the brand has had two [[television special]]s in 1987, ''[[Barbie and the Rockers: Out of This World]]'' and ''[[Barbie and the Sensations: Rockin' Back to Earth]]'', as well as a hit song, "[[Barbie Girl]]" (1997) by [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]. She is also a supporting character in the ''[[My Scene]]'' films as well as in the [[Pixar]] films ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.

==Legacy and influence==
Barbie has become a [[cultural icon]] and has been given honors that are rare in the toy world. In 1974, a section of [[Times Square]] in New York City was renamed Barbie Boulevard for a week. The [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris]] at the Louvre held a Barbie exhibit in 2016.  The exhibit featured 700 Barbie dolls over two floors as well as works by contemporary artists and documents (newspapers, photos, video) that contextualize Barbie.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musée des Arts Décoratifs|url=http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/en/exhibitions/current-events-1322/musee-des-arts-decoratifs/barbie/|website=Musée des Arts Décoratifs}}</ref>

In 1986, the artist [[Andy Warhol]] created a painting of Barbie. The painting sold at auction at Christie's, London for $1.1 million.  In 2015, The Andy Warhol Foundation then teamed up with Mattel to create an Andy Warhol Barbie.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Limited Edition Andy Warhol Barbie Hits the Shelves|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/andy-warhol-barbie-doll-383987|website=Artnet|publisher=Artnet|date=December 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Hannah|title=Why Warhol painted Barbie|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34407991|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|date=October 2015}}</ref>

Outsider artist [[Al Carbee]] took thousands of photographs of Barbie and created countless collages and dioramas featuring Barbie in various settings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gómez|first1=Edward|title=Al Carbee's Art of Dolls and Yearning: "Oh, for a real, live Barbie!"|url=http://hyperallergic.com/125248/al-carbees-art-of-dolls-and-yearning-oh-for-a-real-live-barbie/|website=Hyperallergic|publisher=Hyperallergic|date=May 10, 2014}}</ref>  Carbee was the subject of the feature-length documentary [[Magical Universe]].

In 2013, in [[Taiwan]], the first Barbie-themed restaurant called "Barbie Café" opened under the Sinlaku group.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2013\story_31-1-2013_pg9_1 |title=First Barbie-themed restaurant opens in Taiwan |date=31 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] |accessdate=1 February 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The ''Economist'' has emphasized the importance of Barbie to children's imagination:{{quote|From her early days as a teenage fashion model, Barbie has appeared as an astronaut, surgeon, Olympic athlete, downhill skier, aerobics instructor, TV news reporter, vet, rock star, doctor, army officer, air force pilot, summit diplomat, rap musician, presidential candidate (party undefined), baseball player, scuba diver, lifeguard, fire-fighter, engineer, dentist, and many more....When Barbie first burst into the toy shops, just as the 1960s were breaking, the doll market consisted mostly of babies, designed for girls to cradle, rock and feed. By creating a doll with adult features, Mattel enabled girls to become anything they want.<ref>''Economist'' 21 Dec 2002, Vol. 365 Issue 8304, pp 20-22.</ref>}}

==Controversies==
{{Redirect|Black Barbies|the Nicki Minaj song|Black Barbies (song)}}

=== Body image ===
From the start, some have complained that "the blonde, plastic doll conveyed an unrealistic body image to girls."<ref>Ziobro, "Mattel to Add Curvy, Petite, Tall Barbies: Sales of the doll have fallen at double-digit rate for past eight quarters." ''Wall Street Journal'' Jan 28, 2016</ref>

Criticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]].<ref>Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive, "Does Barbie make girls want to be thin? The effect of experimental exposure to images of dolls on the body image of 5-to 8-year-old girls." ''Developmental psychology'' 42#2 (2006): 283.</ref>   A standard Barbie doll is 11.5&nbsp;inches tall, giving a height of 5 feet 9&nbsp;inches at [[1:6 scale modeling|1/6 scale]]. Barbie's vital statistics have been estimated at 36&nbsp;inches (chest), 18&nbsp;inches (waist) and 33&nbsp;inches (hips). According to research by the University Central Hospital in Helsinki, Finland, she would lack the 17 to 22 percent body fat required for a woman to [[Menstrual cycle|menstruate]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7920962.stm What would a real life Barbie look like?] BBC News, March 6, 2009</ref>  In 1963, the outfit "Barbie Baby-Sits" came with a book entitled ''How to Lose Weight'' which advised: "Don't eat!".<ref name="autogenerated1959">{{cite book|title=Barbie Doll Fashion: 1959–1967|last=Eames|first=Sarah Sink|publisher=Collector Books|year=1990|isbn=0-89145-418-7|url=https://archive.org/details/barbiedollfashio00eame}}</ref>  The same book was included in another ensemble called "Slumber Party" in 1965 along with a pink bathroom scale permanently set at 110&nbsp;lbs.,<ref name="autogenerated1959" /> which would be around 35&nbsp;lbs. underweight for a woman 5 feet 9&nbsp;inches tall.<ref>M.G.

=== Diversity ===
Complaints also point to a lack of diversity in the line.<ref>Marco Tosa, ''Barbie: Four decades of fashion, fantasy, and fun'' (1998).</ref>  Mattel responded to these criticisms. Starting in 1980, it produced Hispanic dolls, and later came models from across the globe. For example, in 2007, it introduced "Cinco de Mayo Barbie" wearing a ruffled red, white, and green dress (echoing the Mexican flag). ''Hispanic'' magazine reports that:
{{quote|[O]ne of the most dramatic developments in Barbie's history came when she embraced multi-culturalism and was released in a wide variety of native costumes, hair colors and skin tones to more closely resemble the girls who idolized her. Among these were Cinco De Mayo Barbie, Spanish Barbie, Peruvian Barbie, Mexican Barbie and Puerto Rican Barbie. She also has had close Hispanic friends, such as Teresa.<ref>"A Barbie for Everyone" ''Hispanic'' (February–March 2009), Vol. 22, Issue 1</ref>}}

"Colored [[Francie (Barbie)|Francie]]" made her debut in 1967, and she is sometimes described as the first African American Barbie doll. However, she was produced using the existing head molds for the white Francie doll and lacked African characteristics other than a dark skin. The first African American doll in the Barbie range is usually regarded as Christie, who made her debut in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercollector.com/articles/dolls/dollnews31301.shtml |title=African American Fashion Dolls of the 60s |publisher=Mastercollector.com |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822175140/http://www.mastercollector.com/articles/dolls/dollnews31301.shtml |archive-date=August 22, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kattisdolls.net/faces/christie.htm |title=Faces of Christie |publisher=Kattisdolls.net |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091540/http://kattisdolls.net/faces/christie.htm |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> Black Barbie was launched in 1980 but still had Caucasian features. In 1990, Mattel created a focus group with African American children and parents, early childhood specialists, and clinical psychologist, Darlene Powell Hudson.  Instead of using the same molds for the Caucasian Barbies, new ones were created. In addition, facial features, skin tones, hair texture, and names were all altered. The body shapes looked different, but the proportions were the same to ensure clothing and accessories were interchangeable.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ducille|first=Ann|date=1994|title=Dyes and Dolls: Multicultural Barbie and the merchandising of difference|journal= Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies |volume=6|pages=46}}</ref>  In September 2009, Mattel introduced the [[List of Barbie's friends and family#S.I.S./So In Style characters|So In Style]] range, which was intended to create a more realistic depiction of African American people than previous dolls.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,562706,00.html |title=Mattel introduces black Barbies, to mixed reviews |publisher=Fox News |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011234536/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C562706%2C00.html |archive-date=October 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2016, Mattel expanded this line to include seven skin tones, twenty-two eye colors, and twenty-four hairstyles. Part of the reason for this change was due to declining sales.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Barbie breaks the mold with ethnically diverse dolls|last=Shan|first=Li|date=January 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

Mattel teamed up with [[Nabisco]] to launch a cross-promotion of Barbie with [[Oreo]] [[cookie]]s.  ''Oreo Fun Barbie'' was marketed as someone with whom young girls could play after class and share "America's favorite cookie." As had become the custom, Mattel manufactured both a [[White people|white]] and a [[Black people|black]] version. Critics argued that in the African American community, ''Oreo'' is a derogatory term meaning that the person is "black on the outside and white on the inside," like the chocolate sandwich cookie itself. The doll was unsuccessful and Mattel recalled the unsold stock, making it sought after by collectors.<ref>[http://www.authentichistory.com/diversity/african/images/2001_Oreo_Barbie.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012041355/http://www.authentichistory.com/diversity/african/images/2001_Oreo_Barbie.html|date=October 12, 2007}}</ref>

In May 1997, Mattel introduced ''Share a Smile Becky'', a doll in a pink [[wheelchair]]. Kjersti Johnson, a 17-year-old high school student in [[Tacoma, Washington]] with [[cerebral palsy]], pointed out that the doll would not fit into the [[elevator]] of Barbie's $100 Dream House. Mattel announced that it would redesign the house in the future to accommodate the doll.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Press/barbie.html|title=Barbie's Disabled Friend Can't Fit|agency=Associated Press|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=November 6, 2010|location=EL SEGUNDO, Calif.| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101001040037/http://www.washington.edu/doit/Press/barbie.html| archive-date= October 1, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallery.bcentral.com/GID4729088P1681774-COLLECTIBLES/BARBIE/SHARE-A-SMILE-BECKY.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617002332/http://gallery.bcentral.com/GID4729088P1681774-COLLECTIBLES/BARBIE/SHARE-A-SMILE-BECKY.aspx |archive-date=June 17, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>

=== Bad influence concerns ===
In July 1992, Mattel released ''[[Teen Talk Barbie]]'', which spoke a number of phrases including "Will we ever have enough clothes?", "I love shopping!", and "Wanna have a pizza party?"  Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that no two given dolls were likely to be the same (the number of possible combinations is <math>270!/(266!4!) = 216,546,345</math>). One of these 270 phrases was "Math class is tough!". Although only about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase, it led to criticism from the [[American Association of University Women]]. In October 1992, Mattel announced that ''Teen Talk Barbie'' would no longer say the phrase, and offered a swap to anyone who owned a doll that did.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/21/business/company-news-mattel-says-it-erred-teen-talk-barbie-turns-silent-on-math.html?scp=1|title=COMPANY NEWS: Mattel Says It Erred; Teen Talk Barbie Turns Silent on Math|date=October 21, 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 15, 2010}}</ref>

In 2002, Mattel introduced a line of pregnant [[Midge_(Barbie)|Midge]] (and baby) dolls, but this ''Happy Family'' line was quickly pulled from the market due to complaints that she promoted teen pregnancy, though by that time, Barbie's friend [[Midge_(Barbie)|Midge]] was supposed to be a married adult.<ref>{{cite web | title=Pregnant doll pulled from Wal-Mart after customers complain |date=24 Dec 2002 |website=USA Today |url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2002-12-24-pregnant-doll_x.htm}}</ref>

In September 2003, the Middle Eastern country of [[Saudi Arabia]] outlawed the sale of Barbie dolls and franchises, stating that they did not conform to the ideals of [[Islam]]. The [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice]] warned, "Jewish Barbie dolls, with their revealing clothes and shameful postures, [[fashion accessory|accessories]] and tools are a symbol of decadence to the [[Perversion|perverted]] West.

In November 2014, Mattel received criticism over the book ''[[Computer Engineer Barbie|I Can Be a Computer Engineer]]'', which depicted Barbie as being [[Computer illiteracy|inept at computers]] and requiring that her two male friends complete all of the necessary tasks to restore two laptops after she accidentally [[USB flash drive security#Malware infections|infects]] her and her sister's laptop with a [[malware]]-laced USB flash drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/barbie-f-cks-it-up-again-1660326671|title=Barbie F*cks It Up Again|last1=Ribon|first1=Pamela|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> Critics complained that the book was sexist, as other books in the ''I Can Be...'' series depicted Barbie as someone who was competent in those jobs and did not require outside assistance from others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/barbie-engineer-book-girls-game-developers/|title=Barbie book about programming tells girls they need boys to code for them|last1=Romano|first1=Aja|work=Daily Dot|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> Mattel later removed the book from sale on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] in response to the criticism.<ref name="TC">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/mattel-pulls-sexist-barbie-book-i-can-be-a-computer-engineer-off-amazon/|title=Mattel Pulls Sexist Barbie Book "I Can Be A Computer Engineer" Off Amazon|last1=Buhr|first1=Sarah|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Safety concerns ===
In March 2000, stories appeared in the media claiming that the hard [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] used in vintage Barbie dolls could leak toxic chemicals, causing danger to children playing with them. The claim was described as an overreaction by Joseph Prohaska, a professor at the [[University of Minnesota Duluth]]. A modern Barbie doll has a body made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic, while the head is made from soft [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectdolls.about.com/library/ucbarbieresponse.htm |title=Kiss That Barbie!

In July 2010, Mattel released "Barbie Video Girl", a Barbie doll with a pinhole video camera in its chest, enabling clips of up to 30 minutes to be recorded, viewed, and uploaded to a computer via a [[USB]] cable. On November 30, 2010, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] issued a warning in a private memo that the doll could be used to produce [[child pornography]], although it stated publicly that there was "no reported evidence that the doll had been used in any way other than intended."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11930727 |work=BBC News | title=FBI memo raises Barbie child pornography fears | date=December 6, 2010 | accessdate=December 23, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101208044552/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11930727| archive-date= December 8, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/12/03/fbi.barbie.porn/ |publisher=CNN | title=FBI: New Barbie 'Video Girl' doll could be used for child porn | date=December 4, 2010 | accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref>

In March 2015, concerns were raised about a version of the doll called "Hello Barbie", which can hold conversations with a child using [[speech recognition]] technology. The doll transmits data back to a service called ToyTalk, which according to ''[[Forbes]]'', has a terms of service and privacy policy that allow it to “share audio recordings with third party vendors who assist us with speech recognition,” and states that “recordings and photos may also be used for research and development purposes, such as to improve speech recognition technology and artificial intelligence algorithms and create better entertainment experiences.”<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2015/03/20/this-new-toy-records-your-childrens-private-moments-buyer-beware/ |work=Forbes | title=This New Toy Records Your Children's Private Moments -- Buyer Beware | date=March 20, 2015 | accessdate=March 20, 2015 |author=Joseph Steinberg }}</ref>

==Role model Barbies==
In March 2018, in time for [[International Women's Day]], Mattel unveiled the "Barbie Celebrates Role Models" campaign with a line of 17 dolls, informally known as "sheroes", from diverse backgrounds "to showcase examples of extraordinary women".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://barbie.mattel.com/en-us/about/role-models.html|title=Barbie {{!}} Role Models {{!}} Inspiring Women {{!}} You Can Be Anything|date=2018|website=Barbie Mattel|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/06/us/barbie-dolls-inspiring-women-trnd/index.html|title=Barbie unveils dolls based on Amelia Earhart, Frida Kahlo, Katherine Johnson and Chloe Kim|last=Leguizamon|first=Mercedes|date=2018-03-07|work=CNN News|access-date=2018-03-08|last2=Ahmed|first2=Saeed}}</ref> Mattel developed this collection in response to mothers concerned about their daughters having positive female role models.<ref name=":0" /> Dolls in this collection include [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Patty Jenkins|Patti Jenkins]], [[Chloe Kim]], [[Nicola Adams]], [[Ibtihaj Muhammad]], [[Bindi Irwin]], [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Misty Copeland]], [[Hélène Darroze|Helene Darroze]], [[Katherine Johnson]], [[Sara Gama]], [[Martyna Wojciechowska]], [[Gabby Douglas]], [[Guan Xiaotong]], [[Ava DuVernay|Ava Duvernay]], [[Yuanyuan Tan|Yuan Yuan Tan]], [[Iris Apfel]], [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]], and [[Leyla Piedayesh]].<ref name=":0" /> In 2020, the company announced a new release of "shero" dolls, including Paralympic champion [[Madison de Rozario]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.com.au/barbie-shero-2020-madison-de-rozario|title=Barbie Has Created A Doll Of Madison De Rozario And It Is So Dang Powerful|website=Women's Health|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> 

==Collecting==
Mattel estimates that there are well over 100,000 avid Barbie collectors. Ninety percent are women, at an average age of 40, purchasing more than twenty Barbie dolls each year. Forty-five percent of them spend upwards of $1000 a year.
Vintage Barbie dolls from the early years are the most valuable at [[auction]], and while the original Barbie was sold for $3.00 in 1959, a mint boxed Barbie from 1959 sold for $3552.50 on [[eBay]] in October 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/scoop_article.asp?ai=6539&si=123|title=1959 Blonde Ponytail Barbie Brings Over $3,000!|date=October 16, 2004|work=Scoop|accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref>  On September 26, 2006, a Barbie doll set a world record at auction of £9,000 [[pound sterling|sterling]]  (US$17,000) at [[Christie's]] in London. The doll was a Barbie in Midnight Red from 1965 and was part of a private collection of 4,000 Barbie dolls being sold by two Dutch women, Ietje Raebel and her daughter Marina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/060926/15/10osv.html|title=Midnight Red Barbie Doll sets auction record|date=September 27, 2006|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=November 6, 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003010439/http://au.news.yahoo.com/060926/15/10osv.html|archive-date=October 3, 2006}}</ref>

In recent years, Mattel has sold a wide range of Barbie dolls aimed specifically at collectors, including [[porcelain]] versions, vintage reproductions, and depictions of Barbie as a range of characters from film and television series such as ''[[The Munsters]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=1001084&t=modern |title=Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector |publisher=BarbieCollector.com |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311173241/http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=1001084&t=modern |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=150303&t=modern |title=Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector |publisher=BarbieCollector.com |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311173251/http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.aspx?id=150303&t=modern |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>  There are also collector's edition dolls depicting Barbie dolls with a range of different ethnic identities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/gallery.aspx?t=modern&y=tmp1 |title=Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector |publisher=BarbieCollector.com |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311173304/http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/gallery.aspx?t=modern&y=tmp1 |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>  In 2004, Mattel introduced the Color Tier system for its collector's edition Barbie dolls including pink, silver, gold, and platinum, depending on how many of the dolls are produced.<ref>[http://www.barbiecollector.com/collecting/tiers/ BarbieCollector.com – Welcome to the official Mattel site for Barbie Collector] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828201824/http://www.barbiecollector.com/collecting/tiers/ |date=August 28, 2008 }}</ref> In 2020, Mattel introduced the [[Day of the Dead|Dia De Muertos]] collectible Barbie doll, the second collectible released as part of the company's La Catrina line which was launched in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Kelly Murray|title=Mattel releases second edition of 'Day of the Dead' Barbie|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/barbie-dia-de-los-muertos-trnd/index.html|access-date=2020-09-13|website=CNN|language=en}}</ref><!-- Deleted image removed: Image:Number 1 Ponytail Barbie II.jpg|The No. 1 vintage Ponytail Barbie issued in 1959</center> -->

==Parodies and lawsuits==

==Competition from Bratz dolls==
In June 2001, [[MGA Entertainment]] launched the [[Bratz]] series of dolls, a move that gave Barbie her first serious competition in the fashion doll market. In 2004, sales figures showed that Bratz dolls were outselling Barbie dolls in the United Kingdom, although [[Mattel]] maintained that in terms of the number of dolls, clothes, and accessories sold, Barbie remained the leading brand.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3640958.stm |work=BBC News | title=Bratz topple Barbie from top spot | date=September 9, 2004 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> In 2005, figures showed that sales of Barbie dolls had fallen by 30% in the United States, and by 18% worldwide, with much of the drop being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4350846.stm |work=BBC News | title=Barbie blues for toy-maker Mattel | date=October 17, 2005 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

In December 2006, Mattel sued MGA Entertainment for $500 million, alleging that Bratz creator Carter Bryant was working for Mattel when he developed the idea for Bratz.<ref>{{cite news |title = Barbie sues Bratz for $1bn|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/2601442/Barbie-sues-Bratz-for-1bn.html|work = The Daily Telegraph|location = London|date = August 22, 2008|accessdate = December 7, 2015}}</ref> On July 17, 2008, a federal jury agreed that the Bratz line was created by Carter Bryant while he was working for Mattel and that MGA and its Chief Executive Officer [[Isaac Larian]] were liable for converting Mattel property for their own use and intentionally interfering with the contractual duties owed by Bryant to Mattel.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/business/18toy.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin |title= Jury rules for Mattel in Bratz doll case |work=New York Times |date=July 18, 2008 |accessdate=December 7, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150623085951/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/business/18toy.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin| archive-date=June 23, 2015| url-status= live}}</ref> On August 26, the jury found that Mattel would have to be paid $100 million in damages.

[[Rodrigo Alves]], the "Human Ken Doll", has undergone over £373,000 worth of cosmetic procedures to match the appearance of Barbie's male counterpart.

In 2006, researchers Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive conducted an experiment testing how dolls, including Barbie, affect self-image in young girls. Dittmar, Halliwell, and Ive gave picture books to girls age 5&ndash;8, one with photos of Barbie and the other with photos of Emme, a doll with more realistic physical features. The girls were then asked about their ideal body size. Their research found that the girls who were exposed to the images of Barbie had significantly lower self-esteem than the girls who had photos of Emme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dittmar, Halliwell, Ive|first=Helga, Emma, Suzanne|date=2006|title=Does Barbie Make Girls Want to Be Thin?
