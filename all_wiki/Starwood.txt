Starwood was founded in 1969 as a [[real estate investment trust]]. In 1995, it was acquired and reorganized by [[Barry Sternlicht]], who was its chairman until 2005 and founder of the [[Starwood Capital Group]].<ref name=10K/><ref name=barry>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/15/barry-sternlicht.html | title=Barry Sternlicht | publisher=[[CNBC]] | date=June 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/12/08/234901/index.htm | title=HOW BARRY STERNLICHT BECAME THE KING OF HOTELS | first=MELANIE | last=WARNER | work=[[CNN]] | date=December 8, 1997}}</ref>

==Brands==
{{hatnote|The following list of Starwood brands is chronological, according to each brand's entry into Starwood.}}

===Westin===
[[Westin Hotels & Resorts]] was Starwood's largest upscale hotel and resorts brand. It was the oldest brand within Starwood, founded as Western Hotels in 1930, renamed Western International Hotels in 1963, and then Westin Hotels in 1981. The chain was acquired by Starwood in 1997.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.apnews.com/420b22aee83b117569f51ebd54e40658 | title=Starwood acquires Westin Hotels for $1.5 billion | first=GEORGE | last=TIBBITS | work=[[Associated Press]] | date=September 9, 1997}}</ref>

===Sheraton===
[[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]] was Starwood's flagship brand, providing luxury hotel and resort accommodation. It began operating in 1937 and was sold to Starwood in 1998 by [[ITT Inc.]]. Also under the Sheraton brand are seven vacation ownership properties.

===The Luxury Collection===
The Luxury Collection brand began on January 13, 1992, when ITC Sheraton designated 28 of its premier hotels and 33 of the Sheraton Towers, the luxury "hotel-within-a-hotel" facilities located within Sheraton's largest and most exclusive hotels, as the '''ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection'''.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101231953/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/ITT+SHERATON+CORPORATION+EXTENDS+SEGMENTATION+BY+PREMIERING+THE+ITT...-a014695306 | title=ITT SHERATON CORPORATION EXTENDS SEGMENTATION BY PREMIERING THE ITT SHERATON LUXURY COLLECTION | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=January 13, 1992}}</ref>

In February 1994, ITT Sheraton acquired a controlling interest in CIGA (Compagnia Italiana Grandi Alberghi, or Italian Grand Hotels Company), an Italian international hotel chain which owned several luxury properties in Europe.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/10/business/company-news-itt-s-sheraton-unit-in-pact-to-buy-ciga-hotels-of-italy.html | title=COMPANY NEWS; ITT's Sheraton Unit in Pact To Buy Ciga Hotels of Italy | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 10, 1994 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> The majority of the CIGA hotels were folded into The Luxury Collection. CIGA's original logo, the four horses of St. Mark, was kept for The Luxury Collection brand logo until 2010; each Luxury Collection hotel now uses its own logo. After Starwood acquired Sheraton, it established a separate brand identity for The Luxury Collection. Many hotels in The Luxury Collection are smaller establishments in converted palaces or other historically/culturally significant buildings; others are restored historic hotels, such as [[Hotel Kämp]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].

The Royal Penthouse Suite at [[Hotel President Wilson]] in [[Geneva]], part of The Luxury Collection, billed at {{US$|65,000}} per night, is listed at number 1 on the World's 15 Most Expensive Hotel Suites list compiled by [[CNN]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite news | last=Arnold | first=Helen | url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/expensive-hotel-suites-cnngo/index.html | title=World's 15 most expensive hotel suites | work=[[CNN]] | date=December 2, 2011}}</ref>

===Four Points by Sheraton===
[[Four Points by Sheraton]] was launched in April 1995 under the Sheraton Group's brand as a set of mid-range hotels that replaced the Sheraton Inn sub-brand of Sheraton.

===W Hotels===
[[W Hotels]] was Starwood's luxury lifestyle brand, generally marketed towards a younger crowd. It was launched in 1998 with the W New York,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Hotel-News/W-moves-to-abandon-older-properties | title=W, the brand that invented 'lifestyle,' moves to abandon older properties | first=Jeri | last=Clausing | work=[[Travel Weekly]] | date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> a conversion of the old Doral Inn hotel at 541 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan and the brand has since expanded with over 50 hotels and resorts.

Though the hotels vary from newly built flagship properties to more modest conversions of previous hotels, they have a common theme of spare, [[Minimalism|minimalist]] modern decor and hip, informal names for categories of rooms and public areas. For example, the lobbies of all the hotels are known as the "Living Room". W Hotels attempt to include the letter "W" wherever possible - the swimming pool is known as "Wet" and the laundry bag in every room is known as “Wash”. W Hotels are known for the trademarked “Whatever/Whenever” service philosophy and pioneered the now popular “lifestyle” hotels.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/hotels/articles/w-hotels-is-this-the-worlds-coolest-hotel-brand/ | title=W Hotels: Is this the world's coolest hotel brand? | first=Belinda | last=Maude | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>

===St. Regis===
[[St. Regis Hotels & Resorts]] was Starwood's main luxury brand, launched in 1899. It is named for [[St. Regis New York]], which was built in 1904 in [[Manhattan]] at 5th Avenue and 55th Street by [[John Jacob Astor IV]], who also founded the Astoria Hotel (which later became the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]) and who died in 1912 on the [[RMS Titanic]]. In the 1930s, head bartender [[Fernand Petiot]] introduced the [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] [[cocktail]]. The St. Regis was a Sheraton from 1966 on, and following a lavish restoration from 1985 to 1991, it was part of the ITT Sheraton Luxury division before it became the cornerstone and flagship of Starwood's new brand. The brand is represented on four continents, with a total pipeline of 57 operating and signed hotels as of April 2016.

===Le Méridien===
[[Le Méridien]] was founded by [[Air France]] in 1972 and was acquired by Starwood in November 2005, by which point it was based in the UK.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4025416.html | title=Starwood Capital Group Acquires Le Meridien Hotels & Resorts Portfolio | date=November 25, 2005}}</ref> It has a total of 137 properties operating or in the pipeline worldwide, with its first property being Le Méridien Etoile in Paris, France. Le Méridien is positioned as an upper-upscale brand in the Starwood hierarchy and offers properties with an edge towards art, design and local destination, with each hotel customized to its respective location with the intent of "unlocking destinations" for guests. Certain locations offer guests complimentary access to art galleries and museums through collaborations and partnerships. Le Méridien has a partnership with the Italian coffee roasting company [[Illy]], serving and promoting Illy-branded coffee and products throughout its hotels around the world.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/le-meridien-ties-up-with-italian-coffee-brand-illycaffe/articleshow/4600785.cms?from=mdr | title=Le Meridien ties up with Italian coffee brand illycaffe | work=[[Times Internet]] | date=May 31, 2009}}</ref>

Announced in 2006, and originally known as '''Element by Westin''', Element was Starwood's first brand of hotels intended to be environmentally friendly and [[LEED]] certified. The designs include energy and water efficient features. The first Element hotel opened in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] in July 2008.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080701005434/en/Opening-Day-ELEMENT-Lexington-Marks-World-Premiere | title=Starwood Hotels’ Newest Lifestyle Brand, ELEMENT Hotels Travelers in Lexington, MA Will Be First to Rise, Shine and Thrive at ELEMENT Hotel | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=July 1, 2008}}</ref> Element hotels are built eco-friendly from the ground up, from the floors made of recycled materials to energy-efficient lighting and plumbing fixtures.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://skift.com/2016/04/22/despite-marriott-merger-starwood-isnt-easing-up-on-element-hotel-rollouts/ | title=Despite Marriott Merger, Starwood Isn’t Easing Up on Element Hotel Rollouts | first=Deanna | last=Ting | work=[[Skift]] | date=April 22, 2016}}</ref>
