The use of '''cannabis in New Zealand''' is regulated by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1975]], which makes unauthorised possession of any amount of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] a crime. Cannabis is the fourth-most widely used [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]] in [[New Zealand]], after [[caffeine]], [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]], and the most widely used [[Prohibition of drugs|illicit drug]]. In 2001 a household survey revealed that 13.4% of New Zealanders aged 15–64 used cannabis. This ranked as the ninth-highest cannabis consumption level in the world.<ref name="UNOFFICE" />

From 18 December 2018, the Misuse of Drugs act was amended, allowing for much broader use of medical marijuana, making the drug available to terminally ill patients in the last 12 months of life.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/11/new-zealand-passes-laws-to-make-medical-marijuana-widely-available|title=New Zealand passes laws to make medical marijuana widely available|last=Roy|first=Eleanor Ainge|date=2018-12-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-12-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In December 2018, the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led government]] announced a [[2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum|referendum]] on the legality of cannabis for personal use, to be held as part of the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]].<ref name="Referendum-RNZ">{{cite news|title=Binding referendum on legalising cannabis for personal use to be held at 2020 election|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/378523/binding-referendum-on-legalising-cannabis-for-personal-use-to-be-held-at-2020-election|accessdate=18 December 2018|agency=Radio New Zealand|date=18 December 2018}}</ref> This was a condition of the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] giving [[confidence and supply]] to the Government.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Confidence and Supply Agreement between the New Zealand Labour Party and the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|url=https://www.parliament.nz/media/4487/nzlp___gp_c_s_agreement.pdf|access-date=7 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="Referendum-Stuff" /><ref name="Referendum-BBC" /> In 2020 the referendum was held, asking voters whether they support a new bill which would regulate sale, production and possession of cannabis in New Zealand,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/112513203/cannabis-law-will-not-be-passed-ahead-of-referendum-would-set-age-at-20|title=Cannabis referendum: A simple yes or no question on reform at 2020 General Election|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> in which the 'no' vote won, receiving 50.7% of the vote.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2020-11-06|title='No' vote for cannabis legalisation shrinks to 50.7 percent after final votes|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/430007/no-vote-for-cannabis-legalisation-shrinks-to-50-point-7-percent-after-final-votes|access-date=2020-11-06|website=RNZ|language=en-nz}}</ref>

==History==
Among Britain's colonies, New Zealand was one of the few areas where the [[United Kingdom]] did not encourage extensive industrial [[hemp]] production, as the native [[Phormium tenax|harakeke]] plant could instead be used for fibre.<ref name="Duvall2014">{{cite book|author=Chris Duvall|title=Cannabis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVU8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT67|date=15 November 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-386-4|pages=67}}</ref> In 1927, New Zealand passed the Dangerous Drugs Act, whose schedule listed, among other controlled drugs:

:(c) Extracts and tinctures of Indian hemp.<ref>http://www.enzs.auckland.ac.nz/docs/1927/1927A018.pdf</ref>}}

Cannabis continued to be used as a prescription medication. In accordance with its international obligations under the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], New Zealand passed the Narcotics Act in 1965, which banned a number of drugs, including cannabis.<ref name="Newbold2016"/>

Recreational cannabis use was rare in New Zealand for most of the 20th century, with one scholar noting 1967 as a watershed point where demand for cannabis boomed among "musicians and university students".<ref name="Newbold2016">{{cite book|author=Greg Newbold|title=Crime, Law and Justice in New Zealand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMZJDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA153|date=3 June 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-27561-9|pages=153–}}</ref>

Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in New Zealand and the fourth-most widely used recreational drug after [[caffeine]], alcohol and tobacco.<ref name="ndp">{{cite book|last=Ministerial Committee on Drug Policy |title=National Drug Policy 2007–2012 |publisher=Ministry of Health |location=Wellington |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-478-30751-1 |url= http://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/national-drug-policy-2007-2012.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref>

A 25-year longitudinal study of "1000 Christchurch born young people between the ages of 15–25"<ref name=Scoop/> called the "Christchurch Health and Development Study" found that over two thirds of the cohort had used cannabis at least once by the age of 21 with 5% of the cohort having used cannabis more than 400 times.<ref name=":1" /> The study concluded that "regular or heavy cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of using other illicit drugs, abusing or becoming dependent upon other illicit drugs, and using a wider variety of other illicit drugs".<ref name=Fergusson>{{cite journal|last=Fergusson|first=David|author2=Joseph M.

: Our research shows the regular use of cannabis increases the risks that young people will try other illicit drugs. What's not clear are the underlying processes that lead to this association. Understanding these processes is critical to how we view cannabis.

: If the association arises because using cannabis increases contact with illegal drug markets, this is a ground for the decriminalisation or legalisation of cannabis. If, however, the association arises because using cannabis encourages young people to experiment with other illicit drugs the results could be seen as supporting the prohibition of cannabis use.<ref name=Scoop>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0603/S00045.htm |title=Illicit drug use starts with cannabis|date=14 March 2006|publisher=Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Otago|accessdate=6 December 2008}}</ref>

==Legality==
{{See also|Legality of cannabis by country}}
Cannabis use is controlled by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1975]]. Possession of any amount of cannabis is illegal. The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or a $500 fine,<ref>Section 7(2)(b) Misuse of Drugs Act 1975</ref> although section 7(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 contains a rebuttable presumption against imprisonment in respect of possession offences in respect of class C controlled drugs, which include cannabis. Cultivation of cannabis carries a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment.<ref name="MoDA72">{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/drugs-and-alcohol/cannabis-and-law|title=Possession and use of controlled drugs|date=8 September 2011|work=Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 No 116 (as at 8 September 2011), Public Act|publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|New Zealand Parliamentary Counsel Office/Te Tari Tohutohu Pāremata]]|location=[[Wellington]], New Zealand|at=Section 7(2)|accessdate=26 February 2012|ref=MoDANZ311}}</ref> Selling cannabis, offering to sell or supplying cannabis to a person under the age of 18 years carries a maximum penalty of eight years' imprisonment.<ref name="ReferenceA">Section 6(2)(b) Misuse of Drugs Act 1975</ref> Cannabis oil and hashish are defined as class B<ref>Second Schedule Part 1 Misuse of Drugs Act 1975</ref> drugs, and those convicted of manufacturing or supplying face a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Possession of a class-B controlled drug carries a maximum sentence of up to three months' imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $500.

The current tariff case for cultivation and dealing in cannabis, is ''R v Terewi'' [1999]. There are three bands of offence: band 1 for personal or non-commercial operations, band 2 for small-scale operations, and band 3 for large-scale operations. Band 1 has a starting point of a community sentence or a short-term prison sentence; band 2 has a starting point of between 2 and 4 years imprisonment, and band 3 has a starting point of 4 or more years imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=R v Terewi|court=|reporter=NZCA|vol=1999|opinion=92|date=25 May 1999|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZCA/1999/92.html}}</ref>

They also held that it was not a justified limitation under section 5 of that Act,<ref>{{cite book|title=NZLC IP16 Controlling and regulating drugs|url=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/2010/02/Publication_143_455_IP16%20-%20Controlling%20and%20Regulating%20Drugs.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=11 February 2010|publisher=[[New Zealand Law Commission|Law Commission]]|location=[[Wellington]], New Zealand|isbn=978-1-877316-89-0|page=202|chapter=Chapter 10|chapter-url=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/2010/02/Publication_143_455_Part_12_IP16%20Chapter%2010%20-%20Controlling%20and%20Regulating%20Drugs.pdf}}</ref> but the presumption remains effective regardless of this inconsistency. Cannabis is a class C drug, of which the penalty for dealing can result in a maximum prison sentence of eight years under the Act. There have been many public campaigns to decriminalise cannabis but so far none have succeeded. It is generally accepted that the usage rate is high and possession in small quantities may not often be prosecuted. In some cases first offences may result in a formal warning and confiscation by police.

In March 2016, New Zealand's Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne has said that he would support policy change regarding medical marijuana if it is proven to be effective in treating illnesses.

==Enforcement==
<!-- This section needs stats.-->
Data from the "Christchurch Health and Development Study" shows that by the age of 21, 5.1% of cannabis users from the cohort had been arrested for a cannabis related offence while 3.6% had been convicted.<ref name=":1" /> Of those convicted, just under 10% received a custodial sentence with the remainder principally receiving fines. All cohort members with custodial sentences had been convicted of other crimes in addition to a cannabis related offence.<ref name=":1" />

=== Adult Diversion Scheme ===
First offenders charged with minor crimes and accepting full responsibility of their actions are considered for the New Zealand Police Adult Diversion Scheme. Given offenders agree to the conditions of diversion (which usually involves a written agreement tailored to change the offending behaviour), the offender may have the charge withdrawn.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About the Adult Diversion Scheme|url=https://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/programmes-and-initiatives/adult-diversion-scheme/about-adult-diversion-scheme|access-date=2020-09-13|website=New Zealand Police|language=en}}</ref>

During the 2009 [[Napier shootings]], Jan Molenaar fired on three police officers executing a cannabis search warrant, killing Senior Constable Len Snee. People who knew Molenaar described a long-standing, tense relationship between him and the police surrounding the legality of his cannabis involvement, saying, 'Molenaar believed his home was being watched and told friends he was determined to "go out in blaze of glory" if police came to arrest him',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10635492&pnum=0|title=Cop killer's last words|date=31 March 2010|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> and, 'police knew who Molenaar was and knew what he would do in a situation'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10635821|title=Napier siege inquest: Latest updates|date=1 April 2010|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>

=== Bias ===
Māori when accounting for rates of use and offending history, are four times more likely than non-Māori to be convicted on cannabis charges. Similarly, enforcement is inequitable when considering gender, with men nine times more likely to be arrested compared with women.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Fergusson|first=D.M|last2=Swain-Campbell|first2=N.R|last3=Horwood|first3=L.J|date=December 2002|title=Arrests and convictions for cannabis related offences in a New Zealand birth cohort|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0376-8716(02)00336-8|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=70|issue=1|pages=53–63|doi=10.1016/s0376-8716(02)00336-8|issn=0376-8716}}</ref>

==Medicinal use==
{{See also|Medical use of cannabis}}
Approved cannabis-based pharmaceuticals can be prescribed by a specialist doctor, but requires patients to meet strict criteria. As of April 2016, only [[Nabiximols|Sativex]] is approved for use in New Zealand; it is not subsidised, so patients must pay the full retail cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/consumers/cmi/s/sativex.pdf |title=New Zealand Consumer Medical Information – Sativex, Oral spray |work=New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> Unapproved cannabis-based pharmaceuticals (e.g. [[Nabilone|Cesamet]], [[Dronabinol|Marinol]]) and non-pharmaceutical cannabis products can be approved on case-by-case basis by the Minister of Health.

In December 2017, it was announced that medicinal use will be legalised, in order to "ease suffering" for those with "terminal illnesses or chronic pain". Those qualified to receive prescriptions will be able to purchase medicinal cannabis from licensed pharmacies. Additionally, the terminally ill who are found to possess cannabis without a license will not be prosecuted or penalised. [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]] [[David Clark (New Zealand politician)|David Clark]] stated that "the compassionate measure legalises what some people are already doing, and will ensure no prosecutions while the new prescribing framework is set-up." The particulars were to be discussed in the future.<ref name="NZ Herald 2017">{{cite web | title=Medicinal cannabis legislation introduced to 'ease suffering' | website=NZ Herald | date=20 December 2017 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11963230 | access-date=20 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Newshub 2017">{{cite web | title=Government rules terminally ill people allowed to smoke cannabis | website=Newshub | date=20 December 2017 | url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/12/government-rules-terminally-ill-people-allowed-to-smoke-cannabis.amp.html | access-date=20 December 2017}}</ref>

A medicinal cannabis industry body, the New Zealand Medical Cannabis Council<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzmcc.nz|title=New Zealand Medical Cannabis Council|website=NZMCC|accessdate=24 September 2018}}</ref> was established in September 2018.

The [[Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Act]] was passed on 11 December 2018 and received royal assent on 17 December.<ref name="NZ Parliament">{{cite web |title=Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_75877/misuse-of-drugs-medicinal-cannabis-amendment-bill |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref> It gives patients in palliative care the right to possess and use cannabis while also providing them with a defence to possess and use even illegal cannabis.
