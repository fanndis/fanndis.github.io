'''Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|k|n|ɒ|p|f}}) is an American publishing house that was founded by [[Alfred A. Knopf Sr.]] and [[Blanche Knopf]] in 1915.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016}} Blanche and Alfred traveled abroad regularly and were known for publishing European, Asian, and Latin American writers in addition to leading American literary trends. It was acquired by [[Random House]] in 1960, and is now part of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group division of [[Penguin Random House]] which is owned by the German conglomerate [[Bertelsmann]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Penguin Random House |url=https://www.bertelsmann.com/divisions/penguin-random-house |website=bertelsmann.com |publisher=Bertelsmann SE & Co |access-date=27 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00301p1 |title=Alfred A.

==History==
[[File:Portrait of Alfred Knopf and Blanche Knopf LCCN2004663143.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Alfred Knopf and Blanche Knopf LCCN2004663143]]

=== Early years ===

==== 1915–1920 ====
Knopf was founded in 1915 by [[Alfred A. Knopf Sr.]] along with [[Blanche Knopf]], on a $5,000 advance from his father, Samuel Knopf.<ref name=PWCentury /> The first office was located in New York's [[Candler Building (New York City)|Candler Building]].{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=29-47}} The publishing house was officially incorporated in 1918, with Alfred Knopf as president, Blanche Knopf as vice president, and Samuel Knopf as treasurer.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=54-57}}

From the start, Knopf focused on European translations and high-brow works of literature. Among their initial publications were French author [[Émile Augier]]'s ''Four Plays'', Ukrainian writer [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[Taras Bulba]]'', Polish novelist [[Stanisław Przybyszewski]]'s novel ''[[Homo sapiens (novel)|Homo Sapiens]]'', and French writer [[Guy de Maupassant]]'s ''Yvette, a Novelette, and Ten Other Stories''.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=29-47}} During World War I these books were cheap to obtain and helped establish Knopf as an American firm publishing European works.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|page=5}} Their first bestseller was a new edition of ''[[Green Mansions]]'', a novel by [[William Henry Hudson|W. H. Hudson]] which went through nine printings by 1919 and sold over 20,000 copies.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=29-47}} Their first original American novel, ''The Three Black Pennys'' by [[Joseph Hergesheimer]], was published in 1917.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=29-47}}

==== 1920s ====

With the start of the 1920s Knopf began using innovative advertising techniques to draw attention to their books and authors. Beginning in 1920, Knopf produced a [[chapbook]], for the purpose of promoting new books. [[iarchive:beingsborzoi192000alfrrich|The Borzoi]] was published periodically over the years, the first being a hardback called the Borzoi and sometimes quarterly as the Borzoi Quarterly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/about/about.html |title=About the Borzoi Reader Online |access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref> For Floyd Dell's coming-of-age novel, ''Moon-Calf'', they paid men to walk the streets of the financial and theatre districts dressed in artist costumes with [[sandwich board]]s. The placards had a copy of the book for browsing and directed interested buyers to local book shops.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=65-78}}

[[File:RR v01 d077 russian literature - advertisement by alfred a knopf.jpg|thumb|Advertisement by Knopf]]

The unique look of their books along with their expertise in advertising their authors drew [[Willa Cather]] to leave her previous publisher [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] to join Alfred A. Knopf.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=61-63}} As she was still under contract for her novels, the Knopfs suggested publishing a collection of her short stories, ''[[Youth and the Bright Medusa]]'' in 1920.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=61-63}} Cather was pleased with the results and the advertisement of the book in the New Republic and would go on to publish sixteen books with Knopf including their first Pulitzer prize winner, [[One of Ours|''One Of Ours'']].{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=61-63}}

Before they had married, Alfred had promised Blanche that they would be equal partners in the publishing company, but it was clear by the company's fifth anniversary that this was not to be the case. Knopf published a celebratory 5th anniversary book in which Alfred was the focus of anecdotes by authors and Blanche's name was only mentioned once to note that "Mrs. Knopf" had found a manuscript. This despite ample evidence from authors and others that Blanche was in fact the soul of the company. This was covered extensively in ''The Lady with the Borzoi'' by Laura Claridge.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016}}

In 1923 Knopf also started publishing periodicals, beginning with ''[[The American Mercury]]'', founded by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan, which it published through 1934.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biblio.com/publisher/alfred-a-knopf |title=Alfred A. Knopf — First Edition Identification |website=Biblio.com |language=en |access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref>

1923 also marked the year that Knopf published [[Kahlil Gibran]]'s ''[[The Prophet (book)|the Prophet]]''. Knopf had published Gibran's earlier works which had disappointing sales. In its first year, the Prophet only sold 1,159 copies. It would double sales the next year and keep doubling becoming one of the firm's most successful books. In 1965 the book sold 240,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The lady with the Borzoi : Blanche Knopf, literary tastemaker extraordinaire|last=Claridge|first=Laura|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2016|isbn=9780374114251|location=New York|pages=81–83|oclc=908176194}}</ref>

==== 1930s ====


Samuel Knopf died in 1932. William A. Koshland joined the company in 1934, and worked with the firm for more than fifty years, rising to take the positions of President and Chairman of the Board. Blanche became President in 1957 when Alfred became Chairman of the Board, and worked steadily for the firm until her death in 1966. Alfred Knopf retired in 1972, becoming chairman emeritus of the firm until his death in 1984. Alfred Knopf also had a summer home in [[Purchase, New York]].

==== 1940s ====
Following the [[Good Neighbor policy]], Blanche Knopf visited South America in 1942, so the firm could start producing texts from there. She was one of the first publishers to visit Europe after World War II. Her trips, and those of other editors, brought in new writers from Europe, South America, and Asia. Alfred traveled to Brazil in 1961, which spurred a corresponding interest on his part in South America. Penn Publishing Company was acquired in 1943. The Knopfs' son, Alfred "Pat" Jr., was hired on as secretary and trade books manager after the war.

==== 1950s ====
In 1952, editor [[Judith Jones]] joined Knopf as an editor. Jones, who had discovered ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank]]: Diary of a Young Girl'' while working at Doubleday, acquired [[Julia Child]]'s ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' for Knopf.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=297-298}} Jones would remain with Knopf, retiring in 2011 as a senior editor and vice-president after a career that included working with [[John Updike]] and [[Anne Tyler]].{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=297-298}}

Pat Knopf left his parents' publishing company in 1959 to launch his own, [[Atheneum Books|Atheneum Publishers]], with two other partners.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=302-303}} The story made the front page of the New York Times.{{sfnp|Claridge|2016|pages=302-303}}<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://nyti.ms/2GdRoiA |title=3 Book Executives Forming Own Firm |author=Robert Conley |date=March 15, 1959 |work=The New York Times |url-access=subscription |access-date=2018-05-12 |language=en}}</ref>

In a 1957 advertisement in the [[Atlantic Monthly]], Alfred A. Knopf published the Borzoi Credo. The credo includes a list of what Knopf's beliefs for publishing including the statement that he never published an unworthy book. Among a list of beliefs listed is the final one--"I believe that magazines, movies, television, and radio will never replace good books."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knopf |first1=Alfred A. |title=The Borzoi Credo |url=http://aaknopf.tumblr.com/Motto |publisher=Borzoi Reader |access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Acquisition by Random House ===
In 1960 [[Random House]] acquired Alfred A. Knopf.<ref name="PWCentury" /> It is believed that the decision to sell was prompted by [[Alfred A. Knopf, Jr.]], leaving Knopf to found his own book company, [[Atheneum Books]] in 1959.<ref name="Random House">{{cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another life : a memoir of other people|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0679456597|edition=1st|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord}}</ref>

Since its founding, Knopf has paid close attention to design and [[typography]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aigany.org/events/details/10KF/ |title=Knopf: Then and Now |date=21 October 2009 |access-date=2010-04-06 |website=AIGA/NY |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043338/http://aigany.org/events/details/10KF/ |archive-date=2010-06-16}}</ref> employing notable designers and typographers including [[William Addison Dwiggins]], Harry Ford, [[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Steven Heller]], [[Chip Kidd]], [[Lorraine Louie]], [[Bruce Rogers (typographer)|Bruce Rogers]], [[Rudolph Ruzicka|Rudolf Ruzicka]], and [[Beatrice Warde]]. Knopf books conclude with an unnumbered page titled "A Note on the Type", which describes the history of the [[typeface]] used for the book. In addition, Knopf books date the year of the book's current printing on the title page.

Knopf published textbooks until 1988, when Random House's schools and colleges division was sold to [[McGraw-Hill]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/29/business/the-media-business-mcgraw-hill-is-buying-2-random-house-units.html |title=McGraw-Hill Is Buying 2 Random House Units |author=Edwin McDowell |work=The New York Times |date=September 29, 1988}}</ref>

In 1991, Knopf revived the "[[Everyman's Library]]" series, originally published in England in the early 20th century. This series consists of classics of world literature in affordable hardcover editions. The series has grown over the years to include lines of ''Children's Classics'' and ''Pocket Poets''.

Random House was acquired by [[Bertelsmann AG]] in 1998.<ref name="PWCentury" /> In late 2008 and early 2009, the Knopf Publishing Group merged with [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081203/FREE/812039987/1084/toc |title=Shakeups hit Random House, other publishers |last=Flamm |first=Matthew |date=2008-12-03 |access-date=2010-04-06 |website=Crain's New York Business}}</ref> Random House has been owned since its 2013 merger of [[Penguin Group]] by [[Penguin Random House]], a [[joint venture]] between [[Bertelsmann]] (53%) and [[Pearson PLC]] (47%).

Many of Knopf's hardcover books are published later as [[Vintage Books|Vintage paperbacks]]. Vintage Books is a sister imprint of Random House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/imprint/knopf/|website=knopfdoubleday.com|access-date=2020-05-21}}</ref>

In October 2012, Bertelsmann entered into talks with rival conglomerate [[Pearson plc]], over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Random House and [[Penguin Group]]. The merger was completed on 1 July 2013 and the new company is [[Penguin Random House]].<ref>{{Cite news|title =Penguin and Random House in deal talks|date=26 October 2012|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/eaf8eaaa-1eac-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|last2=Wiesmann|first2=Gerrit|access-date=2013-08-12|work=[[Financial Times]]|department=Media}}{{Registration required}}</ref> Bertelsmann owns 53% of the joint venture while Pearson owns 47%.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/business/media/merger-of-penguin-and-random-house-is-completed.html|title=Penguin and Random House Merge, Saying Change Will Come Slowly|last=Bosman|first=Julie|date=2013-07-01|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref> At the time of the acquisition the combined companies controlled 25% of the book business with more than 10,000 employees and 250 independent publishing imprints and with about $3.9 billion in annual revenues.<ref name=":0" /> The move to consolidate was to provide leverage against [[Amazon.com]] and battle the shrinking state of [[bookstore]]s.<ref name=":0" />

In 2015, Knopf celebrated its 100th Anniversary by publishing a commemorative book, ''Alfred A. Knopf, 1915-2015: A Century of Publishing.''<ref name="PWCentury"/>
