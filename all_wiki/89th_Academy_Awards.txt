The awards continued to be criticized by actors and media organizations representing non-black minorities. The [[National Hispanic Media Coalition]] stated that Latino actors were "not getting the opportunities to work in front of camera, and with few exceptions, in back of the camera as well." Daniel Mayeda, chair of the Asian Pacific American Media Coalition, stated that the omission of Asian actors from the nominations list (with only one actor, [[Dev Patel]], nominated) reflected "the continued lack of real opportunities for Asians in Hollywood".<ref>{{cite news |last=Puente |first=Maria |date=January 24, 2017 |title=Oscar nominations 2017: Diversity is not a simple black-or-white issue |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/01/24/oscar-diversity-more-than-black-or-white-latinos-asians-excluded/96951730/ |work=USA Today |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225124803/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/01/24/oscar-diversity-more-than-black-or-white-latinos-asians-excluded/96951730/ |archivedate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> A skit performed during the ceremony, in which a group of tourists enter the theater, led to criticism of host Kimmel over his mocking of an Asian woman's name.<ref>{{cite news |last=Verhoeven |first=Beatrice |date=February 26, 2017 |title=Jimmy Kimmel Slammed for Mocking Asian Woman's Name at Oscars |url=https://www.thewrap.com/jimmy-kimmel-slammed-mocking-asian-oscars/ |work=TheWrap |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227090754/http://www.thewrap.com/jimmy-kimmel-slammed-mocking-asian-oscars/ |archivedate=February 27, 2017}}</ref>

Beatty was then given the correct opened envelope as ''La La Land'' producer [[Jordan Horowitz]] stepped to the microphone, announced the error, stated that ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'' had actually won the award, and took the card bearing the film's title from Beatty's hand and showed it to the camera and the audience as proof.
