==History==
''Metro'' was established in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Magazine's The Best of Auckland 2009|url=http://kiwicrime.blogspot.com.tr/2009/12/metro-magazines-best-of-auckland-2009.html|work=Crime Watch|accessdate=23 November 2015|date=4 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Metro|url=https://twitter.com/MetroMagNZ|work=Twitter|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref> The debut of the magazine coincided with the rapid expansion of the New Zealand economy that occurred from 1984, following the election of the [[Fourth Labour Government]], who implemented widespread neoliberal deregulation and economic reform. The increased access to imported luxury goods made ''Metro'' magazine an attractive media environment for advertisers.

From ''Metro'''s ninth issue in March 1982 until 2002, the magazine featured an influential gossip column called Felicity Ferret.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://i.stuff.co.nz/life-style/96988656/word-is-out-the-death-of-gossip-in-new-zealand|title=Word is out: the death of gossip in New Zealand|last=Olds|first=Jeremy|date=1 October 2017|work=Sunday Magazine|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref> The writer was anonymous, although in May 2006 Auckland restaurant owner Fran Fisher told ''Metro'' that she had pitched the idea to editor [[Warwick Roger]] in 1982, and had contributed to it – along with Roger – until she left New Zealand in December 1983.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Fur & Loathing in Auckland|last=Fisher|first=Fran|date=May 2006|work=Metro}}</ref> The Ferret's initials hinted at her own name. While multiple writers were known to have written for the column over the years, after 1983 the Ferret was suspected to be largely the work of former model and notorious Auckland socialite [[Judith Baragwanath]].<ref name=":0" />

''Metro'' magazine's success led to the launch of a sister title ''[[North and South (New Zealand magazine)|North and South]]'', edited by Robyn Langwell. This publication took a wider look at New Zealand regional stories. Langwell was editor of ''North & South'' until June 2007. A third title, women's interest magazine ''More'', was launched before the stable was bought by [[ACP Media]], an Australian publishing consortium.

Both ''Metro'' and ''North & South'' have won awards for publishing and journalism and ''Metro'', in particular, has been well known for its standard of photography and design under art directors William Chen and Jenny Nicholls. This tradition is still strong, with ''Metro'' winning Best Art Director (Charlie McKay) at the 2010 [[Qantas Media Awards]].

[[ACP Media]] was the former owner of ''Metro'' until 2013 when the magazine was acquired by [[Bauer Media Group]].

''Metro'''s fortunes have varied since Warwick Roger gave up the editor's chair. The appointment of [[Bill Ralston]] saw dramatic shifts in the magazine's editorial focus away from the rigor of Roger's style to a more flamboyant, celebrity style format. Sales were disappointing and a period of decline followed.

The magazine was relaunched as a large format glossy title while led by Nicola Legat, a long-time contributing journalist. The changes were intended to reverse the decline of sales and readership. At its peak ''Metro'' sold 40,000 copies, but this had fallen to less than 20,000. During this period the society scandal column Felicity Ferret was dropped from ''Metro'''s pages. The Ferret briefly returned to the pages of ''Metro'' in 2009.

In 2005, Legat left the magazine to join publishing company [[Random House]]. She was replaced by Lauren Quaintance, a former ''North & South'' writer, who oversaw a 5 per cent increase in circulation. Quaintance left in June 2007 to return to the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and the long-serving deputy Bevan Rapson was appointed acting editor.

A makeover in 2009 saw ''Metro'' changed to a smaller size, and the incorporation of ''Citymix'' magazine within its pages.

In mid-2010, Rapson was replaced as editor by [[Simon Wilson (editor)|Simon Wilson]], a ''Metro'' senior writer and former editor of ''[[Cuisine (magazine)|Cuisine]]'' and ''Consumer'', the magazine published by the [[Consumers' Institute of New Zealand]]. In 2010, Wilson oversaw a 25 per cent increase in ''Metro's'' readership, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]]. In August 2015 Susannah Walker became the editor of the magazine, replacing Simon Wilson in the post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arrivals & Departures: Simon Wilson steps back as Metro taps new ed|url=http://www.mad-daily.com/arrivals-departures-simon-wilson-steps-aside-as-metro-taps-new-ed/|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Mad Daily|date=24 August 2015}}</ref>

In early April 2020, the Bauer Media Group closed down ''Metro'' and several of its New Zealand operations in response to the economic effects of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand]].<ref name="Stuff closure" /><ref name="NZ Herald closure" /><ref name="RNZ closure" /><ref name="The Spinoff closure" /> On 17 June 2020, Sydney investment firm [[Mercury Capital]] purchased ''Metro'' as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media's New Zealand and Australian media assets.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bauer Media NZ bought by Australian investment company |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/419186/bauer-media-nz-bought-by-australian-investment-company |accessdate=18 June 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=17 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200618055702/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/419186/bauer-media-nz-bought-by-australian-investment-company |archive-date=18 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Edmunds |first1=Susan |title=Bauer magazines sold to private equity firm |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300036475/bauer-magazines-sold-to-private-equity-firm |accessdate=18 June 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=17 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200618055742/https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/300036475/bauer-magazines-sold-to-private-equity-firm |archive-date=18 June 2020}}</ref> On 17 July, Mercury Capital confirmed that it would be selling ''Metro'' to independent publisher Simon Chesterman.<ref name="Stuff 17 July 2020" /><ref name="NZ Herald 17 July 2020" />
