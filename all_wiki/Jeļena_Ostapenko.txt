In a 2017 article, Steve Tignor of ''Tennis.com'' described Ostapenko's mentality as "See ball, hit winner."<ref name=st>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Tignor |title=Jelena Ostapenko's two-month clay run has her two wins from the title |work=Tennis.com |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/06/jelena-ostapenkos-two-month-clay-run-has-her-two-wins-title/66654/}}</ref> [[Eurosport]] labeled her style as "risky, aggressive, fun tennis".<ref>{{cite news |title=Jelena Ostapenko – Caroline Wozniacki French Open women |work=Eurosport.com |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=http://www.eurosport.com/tennis/french-open-women/2017/live-jelena-ostapenko-caroline-wozniacki_mtc933448/live.shtml}}</ref>

Ostapenko moves opponents around the court by aiming long strokes at corners and lines, then changes direction to hit powerful winners.<ref>{{cite news |first=Don |last=Han |title=French Open quarterfinal preview: Jelena Ostapenko vs Caroline Wozniacki |work=Vavel.com |date=5 June 2017 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=https://www.vavel.com/en-us/tennis-usa/796007-french-open-quarterfinal-preview-jelena-ostapenko-vs-caroline-wozniacki.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Brooks |last=Giardina |title=2016 Wimbledon player profile: Jelena Ostapenko |work=Vavel.com |date=23 June 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=https://www.vavel.com/en-us/tennis-usa/661866-2016-wimbledon-player-profile-jelena-ostapenko.html}}</ref><ref name=volvo>{{cite news |title=Singles Final |work=volvocaropen.com |date=8 April 2017 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=http://www.volvocaropen.com/articles/20170408232207.html}}</ref> After putting an opponent in a vulnerable position, she regularly seeks to end the point with a cross-court forehand, a down-the-line backhand, a swinging volley, or a drop shot.<ref name=ny/><ref>{{cite news |title=French Open 2017: Teenager Jelena Ostapenko stuns Caroline Wozniacki to reach last four |work=Eurosport.com |date=6 July 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=http://www.eurosport.com/tennis/french-open-women/2017/french-open-2017-teenager-jelena-ostapenko-stuns-caroline-wozniacki-to-reach-last-four_sto6203493/story.shtml}}</ref> Several journalists have observed her interest in using the entire court, along with her tendency to finish points. Before her participation in the [[2017 Volvo Car Open|2017 Charleston Open]] final, an article on the event's website declared, "Most impressive about Ostapenko is her willingness to strike big to all corners of the court, be it a cross-court laser or a bold down-the-line winner."<ref name=volvo/> One of her main weaknesses is a high error rate due to her high-risk approach.<ref name=ny/>

She hits powerfully on both wings. In a 2016 interview, ''Crosscourt View'' labeled Ostapenko's backhand her "strongest weapon"; the same year, ''Hartford Courant'' stated that she "hits a lot of forehand winners".<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Higgins |title=Q&A: Jelena Ostapenko |work=crosscourtview.ie |date=25 June 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=https://crosscourtview.com/interviews/jelena-ostapenko.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Radwanska Doesn't Need Another Marathon in Dispatching Ostapenko |work=courant.com |date=23 August 2016 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=http://www.courant.com/sports/tennis/pilot-pen/hc-jacobs-column-connecticut-open-0824-20160823-story.html}}</ref>

One of Ostapenko's main weaknesses is her serve. In 2019, she was the WTA Tour leader in double faults, hitting 436 in 51 matches,<ref>{{cite web|title=Match Stats - 2019|date=4 November 2019|accessdate=18 November 2019|url=http://wtafiles.wtatennis.com/pdf/rankings/WTAMatchStats.pdf}}</ref> and had one of the lowest first serve percentages on the entire tour; in her first-round match at the China Open against [[Karolína Plíšková]], she served 25 double faults whilst still winning the match. However, after partnering with [[Marion Bartoli]] at Linz, her serve began to show some improvement, and in the final against [[Julia Görges]] at Luxembourg, she did not double fault once.

At the 2017 French Open, where Ostapenko won her first professional title, she regularly hit between 35 and 45 winners throughout her matches.<ref name=ny/><ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Oddo |title=Ostapenko Cracks Milestone with Win over Stosur in Paris |work=tennisnow.com |date=4 June 2017 |accessdate=7 June 2017 |url=http://www.tennisnow.com/News/2017/June/Ostapenko-Cracks-Milestone-with-Win-over-Stosur-in.aspx}}</ref> Following her quarterfinal performance, she attracted multiple comparisons to [[Monica Seles]].<ref name=semi/><ref name=st/> Ostapenko said in an interview at the event that "aggressive is my style of game".<ref name=st/> After the final match of that French Open, analysts highlighted the differences between her performance and opponent Simona Halep's performance; Ostapenko had 54 winners and 54 unforced errors, while Halep had eight winners and ten unforced errors. [[ESPN]]'s Simon Cambers wrote "Fear just does not seem to come into [Ostapenko's] vocabulary... Her groundstrokes are simply massive, flat swipes of the ball that left Halep... grasping at shadows."<ref>Bodo, Peter.

She is coached by her mother, with her father serving as a fitness trainer.

Retrieved 14 January 2018.</ref> In October 2019, Ostapenko partnered with 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli on a trial basis; their partnership resulted in Ostapenko reaching two finals in two weeks, and winning the title in Luxembourg. Bartoli announced that their partnership would continue into 2020, and that she would be Ostapenko's full time coach throughout the year. After a poor start to the 2020 season, and Bartoli's pregnancy, Ostapenko ended their partnership during the suspension of the WTA Tour due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], and began to be coached by [[Thomas Högstedt]], the former coach of [[Maria Sharapova]], [[Eugenie Bouchard]], [[Madison Keys]], [[Caroline Wozniacki]], [[Li Na]], and [[Simona Halep]].

Between 2016 and 2019, Ostapenko held remarkable distinction of being the only player in recorded tennis history to have won a Grand Slam title (2017 French Open), and lost in the first round the three other times she has competed at that same tournament (2016, 2018 and 2019). This no longer applied from 2020, as she advanced to the second round following her defeat of [[Madison Brengle]].
