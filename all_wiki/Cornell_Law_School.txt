'''Cornell Law School''' is the law school of [[Cornell University]], a [[private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] university in [[Ithaca, New York]]. One of the five [[Ivy League law schools]], it offers three [[law degree|law degree programs]], [[Juris Doctor|JD]], [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], and [[Doctor of Juridical Science|JSD]], along with several dual-degree programs in conjunction with other professional schools at the university. Established in 1887 as Cornell's Department of Law, the school today is one of the smallest top-tier JD-conferring institutions in the country, with around two-hundred students graduating each year. Since its inception, Cornell Law School has always ranked among the top 14 law schools in the nation, known as the [[Law school rankings in the United States#List of T14 law schools|T14]].

Cornell Law alumni include business executive and philanthropist [[Myron Charles Taylor]], namesake of the law school building, along with [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretaries of State]] [[Edmund Muskie]] and [[William P. Rogers]], [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] [[Samuel Pierce]], the first female President of Taiwan, [[Tsai Ing-wen]], federal judge and first female editor-in-chief of a [[law review]] [[Mary Donlon Alger]], former President of the [[International Criminal Court]] [[Song Sang-Hyun]], as well as many members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], governors, state [[Attorney general|attorneys general]], U.S. federal and state judges, diplomats and businesspeople.

Cornell Law School is home to the [[Legal Information Institute]] (LII), the ''[[Journal of Empirical Legal Studies]]'', the ''[[Cornell Law Review]]'', the ''[[Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy]]'' and the ''[[Cornell International Law Journal]]''. The current dean of the law school is [[Eduardo Peñalver]], who assumed the role in 2014.

==History==
[[File:Myron Taylor Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to Myron Taylor Hall, Cornell Law's principal building for instruction]]
The Law Department at Cornell opened in 1887 in [[Morrill Hall (Cornell University)|Morrill Hall]] with Judge [[Douglass Boardman]] as its first dean. At that time, admission did not require even a high school diploma. In 1917, two years of undergraduate education were required for admission, and in 1924, it became a graduate degree program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/about/history.cfm |title=Cornell Law School: History |publisher=Lawschool.cornell.edu |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> The department was renamed the Cornell Law School in 1925. In 1890, [[George Washington Fields]] graduated, one of the first law-school-graduates of color in the United States.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/about/timeline/ |title=Cornell Law School: Historical Timeline |publisher=Lawschool.cornell.edu |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> In 1893, Cornell had its first female graduate, Mary Kennedy Brown. Future Governor, Secretary of State, and Chief Justice of the United States, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], was a professor of law at Cornell from 1891 to 1893, and after returning to legal practice he continued to teach at the law school as a special lecturer from 1893 to 1895.  Hughes Hall, one of the law school's central buildings, is named in his honor.

In 1892, the school moved into Boardman Hall, which was constructed specifically for legal instruction. The school moved from Boardman Hall (now the site of Olin Library) to its present-day location at Myron Taylor Hall in 1937. The law school building, an ornate, [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] structure, was the result of a donation by [[Myron Charles Taylor]], a former CEO of [[US Steel]], and a member of the Cornell Law class of 1894. Hughes Hall was built as an addition to Myron Taylor Hall and completed in 1963.  It was also funded by a gift from Taylor. Another addition to Myron Taylor Hall, the Jane M.G. Foster wing, was completed in 1988 and added more space to the library. Foster was a member of the class of 1918, an editor of the ''[[Cornell Law Review]]'' (then ''[[Cornell Law Quarterly]]''), and an [[Order of the Coif]] graduate. In June 2012 the school embarked on a three-year, multi-phase expansion and renovation. The first phase created additional classroom space underground, adjacent to Myron Taylor Hall along College Avenue. The second phase will include the removal and digitization of printed materials from the library stacks so that the space can be converted to additional classroom and student space. The third phase involves converting Hughes Hall into office space.<ref>Okin, Harrison.

Cornellsun.com. Retrieved August 27, 2013.</ref>

In 1948, Cornell Law School established a program of specialization in international affairs and also started awarding LL.B. degrees.  In 1968, the school began to publish the ''[[Cornell International Law Journal]].'' In 1991, the school established the Berger International Legal Studies Program. In 1994, the school established a partnership with the [[University of Paris]] I law faculty to establish a Paris-based Summer Institute of International and Comparative Law. From 1999 to 2004 the school hosted the [[Feminism and Legal Theory Project]]. In 2006, the school established its second summer law institute in Suzhou, China. The Clarke Program in East Asian Law and Culture was established in 2002.

Myron Taylor Hall saw the addition of 40,000 square feet of underground classrooms in 2012–2014. Hughes Hall was renovated in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Crandall|first1=Brian|title=Cornell plans renovation for Hughes Hall|url=https://ithacavoice.com/2015/11/cornell-plans-renovation-for-hughes-hall/|accessdate=May 27, 2018|publisher=The Ithaca Voice|date=November 27, 2015}}</ref>

==Admissions==
[[File:Cornell Law banner.JPG|thumb|right|Banner outside the law school's Jane M.G. Foster wing]]
Cornell Law School is highly selective: for the class entering in the fall of 2018, 872 out of 4,126 applicants (21.13%) were offered admission, with 195 matriculating. The 25th and 75th [[LSAT]] percentiles for the 2019 entering class were 165 and 169, respectively, with a median of 168. The 25th and 75th undergraduate [[GPA]] percentiles were 3.71 and 3.91, respectively, with a median of 3.82.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ABA Standard 509|url=https://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/about/upload/2019-Standard-509-Report.pdf}}</ref>

In the LL.M. program, which is designed for non-U.S.-trained lawyers, 900 applications were received for the 50 to 60 openings. LL.M. students come from over 30 different countries.<ref name="Cornell Law School">{{cite web | url = http://www.law-school-admission.com/cornell/#students| title = Cornell Law School| publisher = JDAadmission.com | accessdate = June 23, 2006}}</ref>

Along with consideration of the quality of an applicant's academic record and LSAT scores, the full-file-review admissions process places a heavy emphasis on an applicant's personal statement, letters of recommendation, community/extracurricular involvement, and work experience. The application also invites a statement on diversity and a short note on why an applicant particularly wants to attend Cornell. The law school values applicants who have done their research and have particular interests or goals that would be served by attending the school versus one of its peer institutions.<ref name="Cornell Law School"/>
