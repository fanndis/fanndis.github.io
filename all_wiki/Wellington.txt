'''Wellington''' ({{lang-mi|[[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]]}} {{IPA-mi|tɛ ˈfaŋanʉi a taɾa|}}) is the capital city of [[New Zealand]]. It is located at the south-western tip of the [[North Island]], between [[Cook Strait]] and the [[Remutaka Range]]. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island, and is the administrative centre of the [[Wellington Region]], which also includes the [[Kapiti Coast]] and the [[Wairarapa]]. It is the [[List of national capitals by latitude|world's southernmost capital]] of a [[sovereign state]].<ref name="World Record" /> Wellington features a temperate maritime climate, and is the world's windiest city by average [[wind speed]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Where is the world's windiest city?

The position of Wellington as [[capital of New Zealand]] is not defined in legislation, but established by convention.<ref name="Levine" /> Its [[metropolitan area]], considered the greatest extent of Wellington itself, comprises four [[local government in New Zealand|local authorities]]: [[Wellington City]], on the peninsula between Cook Strait and [[Wellington Harbour]], contains the central business district; [[Porirua]] on [[Porirua Harbour]] to the north is notable for its large [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Island]] communities; [[Lower Hutt]] and [[Upper Hutt]] are largely suburban areas to the northeast, together known as the [[Hutt Valley]]. The Wellington [[Urban areas of New Zealand|urban area]], which only includes urbanised areas within Wellington City, has a population of {{NZ population data 2018|Wellington|y|}} residents as of {{NZ population data 2018|||y}}.<ref name="NZ_population_data_2018" /> The urban areas of the four local authorities have a combined population of {{Decimals|({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington|y}}|R}})|0}} residents as of {{NZ population data 2018|||y}}.

Wellington's economy is primarily [[service sector|service]]-based, with an emphasis on finance, business services, and government. It is the centre of New Zealand's [[cinema of New Zealand|film]] and special effects industries, and increasingly a hub for information technology and innovation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jlim/2015/11/29/wellington-is-bigger-on-tech-and-innovation-than-you-think/#703bd7661687}|title=Wellington Is Bigger On Tech And Innovation Than You Think|last1=Lim|first1=Jason|date=29 November 2015|website=Forbes|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref> with two public research universities. Wellington is one of New Zealand's chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. The city is served by [[Wellington International Airport]], the third busiest airport in the country. Wellington's transport network includes train and bus lines which reach as far as the [[Kapiti Coast]] and [[Wairarapa|the Wairarapa]], and ferries connect the city to the [[South Island]].

==Toponymy==
Wellington takes its name from [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], the first [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]] and victor of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815): his title comes from the town of [[Wellington, Somerset|Wellington]] in the [[Counties of England|English county]] of [[Somerset]]. It was named in November 1840 by the original settlers of the [[New Zealand Company]] on the suggestion of the directors of the same, in recognition of the Duke's strong support for the company's principles of colonisation and his "strenuous and successful defence against its enemies of the measure for colonising South Australia". One of the founders of the settlement, [[Edward Jerningham Wakefield]], reported that the settlers "took up the views of the directors with great cordiality and the new name was at once adopted".<ref name=Edward>Wakefield, Edward Jerningham (1845). ''Adventure in New Zealand'', Vol. 1, pub. John Murray.</ref>

In the [[Māori language]], Wellington has three names. ''[[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]]'' refers to [[Wellington Harbour]] and means "the great harbour of Tara";<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Te Āti Awa of Wellington |first=Morris |last=Love |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/te-ati-awa-of-wellington |encyclopedia=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=3 March 2017 |access-date=28 October 2019}}</ref> ''Pōneke'' is a transliteration of ''Port Nick'', short for ''Port Nicholson'' (the city's central [[marae]], the community supporting it and its ''[[kapa haka]]'' have the pseudo-tribal name of [[Ngāti Poneke|Ngāti Pōneke]]);<ref>{{cite web|title = Poneke: Wellington places to visit|url = http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/placeprofilesummary.aspx?id=35015|date = 20 February 2007|access-date = 19 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220225053/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/placeprofilesummary.aspx?id=35015|archive-date=20 February 2007 |url-status = dead|publisher = [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]]}}</ref> ''Te Upoko-o-te-Ika-a-Māui'', meaning 'The Head of the Fish of Māui' (often shortened to ''Te Upoko-o-te-Ika''), a traditional name for the southernmost part of the North Island, deriving from the legend of the fishing up of the island by the demi-god [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]]. The legendary Maori explorer [[Kupe]], a chief from [[Hawaiki]] (the homeland of Polynesian explorers, of unconfirmed geographical location, not to be confused with [[Hawaii]]), was said to have stayed in the harbour prior to 1000 CE.<ref name=WCC_Maori_hist>{{Cite web|url=http://wellington.govt.nz/about-wellington/history/history-of-wellington-waterfront/maori|title=Māori history|website=Wellington City Council|language=en-NZ|access-date=2019-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410012111/https://wellington.govt.nz/about-wellington/history/history-of-wellington-waterfront/maori|archive-date=10 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Here, it is said he had a notable impact on the area, with local mythology stating he named the two islands in the harbour after his daughters, [[Matiu / Somes Island|Matiu (Somes Island)]], and [[Mākaro / Ward Island|Mākaro (Ward Island)]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Wellington region – Early Māori history |first=Chris |last=Maclean |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-5 |encyclopedia=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=1 August 2015 |access-date=28 October 2019}}</ref> However, the primary settlement of Wellington is said to have been executed by Tara, the son of [[Whatonga]], a chief from the [[Mahia Peninsula]], who told his son to travel south, to find more fertile lands to settle.<ref name=WCC_Maori_hist/>

In [[New Zealand Sign Language]], the name is signed by raising the index, middle and ring fingers of one hand, palm forward, to form a "W", and shaking it slightly from side to side twice.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz/signs/4738 |title= Wellington – New Zealand Sign Language Online |publisher=Deaf Studies Research Unit, [[Victoria University of Wellington]] |access-date= 11 November 2013}}</ref>

The city's location close to the mouth of the narrow Cook Strait leaves it vulnerable to strong gales, leading to the [[nickname]] of "Windy Wellington".<ref name="windy">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Maclean|first1=Chris|title=Wellington region – Climate: Windy Wellington |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/diagram/13182/windy-wellington |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|access-date=28 October 2019 |language=en|date=1 August 2015}}</ref>

===Māori settlement===
Legends recount that [[Kupe]] discovered and explored the region in about the 10th century. Before European colonisation, the area in which the city of Wellington would eventually be founded was seasonally inhabited by indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]]. The earliest date with hard evidence for human activity in New Zealand is about 1280.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Te Whanganui a Tara me ona takiwa : report on the Wellington District.|last=Waitangi Tribunal.|date=2003|publisher=Legislation Direct|isbn=186956264X|location=Wellington, N.Z.|pages=17|oclc=53261192}}</ref>

Wellington and its environs have been occupied by various Māori groups from the 12th century. The legendary Polynesian explorer [[Kupe]], a chief from [[Hawaiki]] (the homeland of Polynesian explorers, of unconfirmed geographical location, not to be confused with [[Hawaii]]), was said to have stayed in the harbour from {{circa|925}}.<ref name=WCC_Maori_hist/><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Te Whanganui a Tara me ona takiwa : report on the Wellington District.|last=Waitangi Tribunal|date=2003|publisher=Legislation Direct|isbn=186956264X|location=Wellington, N.Z.|pages=13|oclc=53261192}}</ref> A later Māori explorer, Whatonga, named the harbour ''[[Te Whanganui-a-Tara]]'' after his son Tara.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, Te Whanganui a Tara me ona Takiwa, page 18, https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68452530/Wai145.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122114129/https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68452530/Wai145.pdf |date=22 January 2019 }}</ref> Before the 1820s, most of the inhabitants of the Wellington region were Whatonga's descendants.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, Te Whanganui a Tara me ona Takiwa, page 18</ref>

At about 1820, the people living there were Ngāti Ira and other groups who traced their descent from the explorer Whātonga, including [[Rangitāne]] and [[Muaūpoko]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Te Whanganui a Tara me ona takiwa : report on the Wellington District.|last=Waitangi Tribunal|date=2003|publisher=Legislation Direct|isbn=186956264X|location=Wellington, N.Z.|oclc=53261192}}</ref> However, these groups were eventually forced out of ''Te Whanganui-a-Tara'' by a series of migrations other [[iwi]] (Māori tribes) from the north.<ref name=":2" /> The migrating groups were [[Ngāti Toa]], which came from [[Kawhia Harbour|Kāwhia]], Ngāti Rangatahi, from near [[Taumarunui]], and [[Te Āti Awa|Te Atiawa]], [[Ngāti Tama]], [[Ngāti Mutunga]], Taranaki and [[Ngāti Ruanui]] from [[Taranaki]]. Ngāti Mutunga later moved on to the [[Chatham Islands]]. The [[Waitangi Tribunal]] has found that at the time of the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840, Te Atiawa, Taranaki, Ngati Ruanui, Ngati Tama, and Ngati Toa held [[mana whenua]] interests in the area, through conquest and occupation.<ref name=":2" />

===Early European settlement===

European settlement began with the arrival of an advance party of the New Zealand Company on the ship ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Tory|Tory]]'' on 20 September 1839, followed by 150 settlers on the ''[[New Zealand Company ships#Aurora|Aurora]]'' on 22 January 1840. Thus the Wellington settlement preceded the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] (on 6 February 1840). The 1840 settlers constructed their first homes at [[Petone]] (which they called Britannia for a time) on the flat area at the mouth of the [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt River]]. Within months that area proved swampy and flood-prone, and most of the newcomers transplanted their settlement, which had been planned without regard for a hilly terrain,{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} across Wellington Harbour to [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] in the present-day site of Wellington city.

Wellington was declared a city in 1840, and was chosen to be the capital city of New Zealand in [[timeline of New Zealand history#1860s|1865]].<ref name="Levine"/>

Wellington became the capital city in place of [[Auckland]], which [[William Hobson]] had made the capital in [[timeline of New Zealand history#1840s|1841]]. The [[New Zealand Parliament]] had first met in Wellington on 7 July 1862, on a temporary basis; in November 1863, the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]], [[Alfred Domett]], placed a resolution before Parliament in Auckland that "... it has become necessary that the [[seat of government]]&nbsp;... should be transferred to some suitable locality in [[Cook Strait]] [region]." There had been some concerns that the more populous [[South Island]] (where the goldfields were located) would choose to form a separate colony in the [[British Empire]]. Several commissioners (delegates) invited from Australia, chosen for their neutral status, declared that the city was a suitable location because of its central location in New Zealand and its good [[Wellington Harbour|harbour]]; it was believed that the whole [[Royal Navy]] fleet could fit into the harbour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/history-of-new-zealand-1769-1914|title=History of New Zealand, 1769–1914 – A history of New Zealand 1769–1914|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|access-date=10 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720150026/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/history-of-new-zealand-1769-1914|archive-date=20 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wellington's status as capital is a result of [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] rather than statute.<ref name="Levine"/>

Wellington is New Zealand's [[politics of New Zealand|political]] centre, housing the nation's major government institutions. The New Zealand Parliament relocated to the new capital city, having spent the first ten years of its existence in Auckland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament moves to Wellington |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/parliament-sits-for-the-first-time-in-wellington |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=25 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425175533/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/parliament-sits-for-the-first-time-in-wellington |archive-date=25 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A session of parliament officially met in the capital for the first time on 26 July 1865.

The [[Old Government Buildings, Wellington|Government Buildings]] were constructed at [[Lambton Quay]] in 1876. The site housed the original [[public sector organisations in New Zealand|government departments in New Zealand]]. The public service rapidly expanded beyond the capacity of the building, with the first department leaving shortly after it was opened; by 1975 only the Education Department remained, and by 1990 the building was empty. The capital city is also the location of the highest court, the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]], and the historic former High Court building (opened 1881) has been enlarged and restored for its use. The Governor-General's residence, [[Government House, Wellington|Government House]] (the current building completed in 1910) is situated in [[Newtown, New Zealand|Newtown]], opposite the [[Basin Reserve]]. [[Premier House]] (built in 1843 for Wellington's first mayor, [[George Hunter (mayor)|George Hunter]]), the official residence of the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], is in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] on Tinakori Road.

Over six months in 1939 and 1940 Wellington hosted the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition]], celebrating a century since the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. Held on 55 acres of land at Rongotai it featured three exhibition courts, grand Art Deco-style edifices and a hugely popular three-acre amusement park. Wellington attracted more than 2.5 million visitors at a time when New Zealand's population was 1.6 million.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Maclean |first1=Chris |title=Wellington region – Boom and bust: 1900–1940 |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-9 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=9 July 2007 |access-date=23 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720233251/https://teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-9 |archive-date=20 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Wellington, New Zealand.JPG|thumb|Satellite view of the Wellington area]]
Wellington is at the south-western tip of the [[North Island]] on [[Cook Strait]], separating the North and South Islands. On a clear day the snowcapped [[Kaikoura Ranges]] are visible to the south across the strait. To the north stretch the golden beaches of the [[Kapiti Coast]]. On the east the [[Remutaka Range]] divides Wellington from the broad plains of the [[Wairarapa]], a [[list of wine-producing regions|wine region]] of national notability. 

With a [[latitude]] of 41° 17' South, Wellington is the [[List of southernmost items|southernmost capital city in the world]].<ref name="World Record">{{cite book |title= Guinness World Records 2009|year= 2008 |publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-1-904994-36-7 |page= [https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec00crai_0/page/277 277] |title-link= Guinness World Records}}</ref> It is also the [[extreme points of Earth#Remoteness|most remote]] capital city, the farthest away from any other capital. 

Wellington is more densely populated than most other cities in New Zealand due to the restricted amount of land that is available between its harbour and the surrounding hills. It has very few open areas in which to expand, and this has brought about the development of the suburban towns. Because of its location in the [[Roaring Forties]] and its exposure to the winds blowing through [[Cook Strait]], Wellington is the world's windiest city, with an average wind speed of {{convert|27|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where is the world's windiest city?

[[File:Wellington Urban Area.png|thumb|left|The Wellington urban area (pink) is administered by four local authorities]]
The urban area stretches across the areas administered by the city councils of Wellington, [[Lower Hutt]], [[Upper Hutt]] and [[Porirua]]. The suburb of Porirua lies on Porirua Harbour to the north. [[Lower Hutt]] and [[Upper Hutt]], collectively referred to as the [[Hutt Valley]], are suburban areas to the northeast of Wellington City.

[[File:WELLINGTON, BOTANICAL GARDENS (44448999).jpg|thumb|right|[[Wellington Botanic Gardens]]]]
Wellington's scenic natural harbour and green hillsides adorned with tiered suburbs of colonial villas are popular with tourists. The central business district (CBD) is close to Lambton Harbour, an arm of [[Wellington Harbour]], which lies along an active [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]], clearly evident on its straight western shore. The land to the west of this rises abruptly, meaning that many suburbs sit high above the centre of the city. There is a network of bush walks and reserves maintained by the [[Wellington City|Wellington City Council]] and local volunteers. These include Otari-Wilton's Bush, dedicated to the protection and propagation of native plants. The Wellington region has {{convert|500|km2|sqmi|-1}} of regional parks and forests. In the east is the [[Miramar Peninsula]], connected to the rest of the city by a low-lying isthmus at [[Rongotai]], the site of [[Wellington International Airport]]. Industry has developed mainly in the Hutt Valley, where there are food-processing plants, engineering industries, vehicle assembly and oil refineries.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Paxton |editor-first=John |encyclopedia=The Penguin Encyclopedia of Places |title=Wellington, New Zealand |edition=3rd |year=1999 |via=[[Credo Reference]]}}</ref>

The narrow entrance to the harbour is to the east of the Miramar Peninsula, and contains the dangerous shallows of [[Barrett Reef]], where many ships have been wrecked (notably the inter-island ferry {{ship|TEV|Wahine}} in [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1960s|1968]]).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/wahine.asp |title= New Zealand Disasters – Wahine Shipwreck |publisher=Christchurch City Libraries |date= 10 April 1968 |access-date= 28 July 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110819160954/http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/kids/nzdisasters/wahine.asp |archive-date= 19 August 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The harbour has three islands: [[Matiu/Somes Island]], [[Makaro/Ward Island]] and [[Mokopuna Island]]. Only Matiu/Somes Island is large enough for habitation. It has been used as a quarantine station for people and animals, and was an [[internment|internment camp]] during World War I and World War II. It is a conservation island, providing refuge for [[endangered species]], much like [[Kapiti Island]] farther up the coast. There is access during daylight hours by the Dominion Post Ferry.

Wellington is primarily surrounded by water, but some of the nearby locations are listed below.

Steep landforms shape and constrain much of Wellington city. Notable hills in and around Wellington include:
* [[Mount Victoria, Wellington|Mount Victoria]] – 196 m. Mt Vic is a popular walk for tourists and Wellingtonians alike, as from the summit one can see most of Wellington. There are numerous mountain bike and walking tracks on the hill.

===Climate===
Averaging 2,055 hours of sunshine per year, the climate of Wellington is temperate [[Oceanic climate|marine]], ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), generally moderate all year round with warm summers and mild winters, and rarely sees temperatures above {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} or below {{convert|4|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

It is generally very windy all year round with high rainfall; average annual rainfall is {{convert|1250|mm|0|abbr=on}}, June and July being the wettest months. [[Frost]]s are quite common in the hill suburbs and the [[Hutt Valley]] between May and September.

Wellington suffered serious damage in a series of [[1848 Marlborough earthquake|earthquakes in]] [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1840s|1848]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/2/en |title=The 1848 Marlborough earthquake – Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=30 March 2005 |access-date=6 February 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hEkAwvul?url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/2/en |archive-date=2 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> and from another earthquake in [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1850s|1855]]. The [[1855 Wairarapa earthquake]] occurred on the [[Wairarapa Fault]] to the north and east of Wellington. It was probably the most powerful earthquake in recorded New Zealand history,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/3/en |title=The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake – Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=21 September 2007 |access-date=6 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221195734/http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/NaturalHazardsAndDisasters/HistoricEarthquakes/3/en |archive-date=21 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> with an estimated magnitude of at least 8.2 on the [[Moment magnitude scale]]. It caused vertical movements of two to three metres over a large area, including raising land out of the harbour and turning it into a tidal swamp. Much of this land was subsequently [[Reclamation of Wellington Harbour|reclaimed]] and is now part of the central business district. For this reason, the street named [[Lambton Quay]] is 100 to 200 metres (325 to 650&nbsp;ft) from the harbour – plaques set into the footpath mark the shoreline in [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1840s|1840]], indicating the extent of reclamation. The [[1942 Wairarapa earthquakes]] caused considerable damage in Wellington.

The area has high seismic activity even by New Zealand standards, with a major fault, the [[Wellington Fault]], running through the centre of the city and several others nearby. Several hundred minor faults lines have been identified within the urban area. Inhabitants, particularly in high-rise buildings, typically notice several earthquakes every year. For many years after the 1855 earthquake, the majority of buildings were made entirely from wood. The 1996-restored [[Government Buildings (Wellington, New Zealand)|Government Buildings]]<ref>{{NZHPT|37|Government Buildings|2009-02-06}}</ref> near Parliament is the largest wooden building in the Southern Hemisphere. While masonry and [[structural steel]] have subsequently been used in building construction, especially for office buildings, [[timber framing]] remains the primary structural component of almost all residential construction. Residents place their confidence in good [[building code|building regulations]], which became more stringent in the 20th century. Since the Canterbury earthquakes of [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|2010]] and [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|2011]], earthquake readiness has become even more of an issue, with buildings declared by [[Wellington City Council]] to be earthquake-prone,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4761054/Shuddering-in-Wellington|title=Shuddering in Wellington|author=Dave Burgess|publisher=Fairfax NZ|date=14 March 2011|access-date=28 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323052804/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4761054/Shuddering-in-Wellington|archive-date=23 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/commercial-property/7031111/How-safe-are-the-capitals-office-buildings|title=How safe are the capital's office buildings?|author=Hank Schouten|publisher=Dominion Post|date=2 June 2012|access-date=28 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604002602/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/commercial-property/7031111/How-safe-are-the-capitals-office-buildings|archive-date=4 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> and the costs of meeting new standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington-central/7822064/Councillors-question-quake-costs|title=Councillors question quake costs|author=Kate Chapman|publisher=The Dominion Post|date=16 October 2012|access-date=28 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019022226/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington-central/7822064/Councillors-question-quake-costs|archive-date=19 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5714033/Quake-shakes-capital-insurance-market|title=Quake shakes capital insurance market|author=Dave Burgess & Hank Schouten|publisher=The Dominion Post|date=1 October 2011|access-date=28 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024173536/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5714033/Quake-shakes-capital-insurance-market|archive-date=24 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

At two minutes after midnight on Monday 14 November 2016, the 7.8 magnitude [[2016 Kaikoura earthquake|Kaikoura earthquake]], which was centred between Culverden and Kaikoura in the South Island, caused the Wellington CBD, [[Victoria University of Wellington]], and the [[Public transport in the Wellington Region#Trains|Wellington suburban rail network]] to be largely closed for the day to allow inspections. The earthquake damaged a considerable number of buildings, with 65% of the damage being in Wellington. Subsequently, a number of recent buildings were demolished rather than being rebuilt, often a decision made by the insurer.

==Demographics==
[[File:ANZAC Day Dawn Service at Wellington Cenotaph - Flickr - NZ Defence Force (2).jpg|thumb|Wellingtonians gathered for the [[Anzac Day]] dawn service (2011)]]
The four cities comprising Greater Wellington have a total population of {{formatnum:{{#expr: {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington city|y}}|R}} }}}} {{NZ population data 2018|||y|y|(|),}} with the urban area containing {{Decimals|({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington|y}}|R}}) / ({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt city|y}}|R}} + {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington city|y}}|R}})*100|1}}% of that population. The remaining areas are largely mountainous and sparsely farmed or parkland and are outside the urban area boundary. More than most cities, life is dominated by its central business district (CBD). Approximately 62,000 people work in the CBD, only 4,000 fewer than work in Auckland's CBD, despite that city having four times the population. The population is often extended unofficially by {{NZ population data 2018|Kapiti Coast district|y}} when the [[Kapiti Coast]] is included as part of Wellington area, given its suburb/exurb nature and short distance.<ref name="NZ_population_data_2018" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Visiting Kāpiti - Kāpiti Coast District Council|url=https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/our-district/visiting-k%C4%81piti/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=www.kapiticoast.govt.nz}}</ref>

The four urban areas combined had a usual resident population of 401,850 at the [[2018 New Zealand census]], an increase of 26,307 people (7.0%) since the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]], and an increase of 42,726 people (11.9%) since the [[2006 New Zealand census|2006 census]]. There were 196,911 males and 204,936 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.961 males per female. Of the total population, 74,892 people (18.6%) were aged up to 15 years, 93,966 (23.4%) were 15 to 29, 185,052 (46.1%) were 30 to 64, and 47,952 (11.9%) were 65 or older.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|title=Age and sex by ethnic group (grouped total response), for census usually resident population counts, 2006, 2013, and 2018 Censuses (urban rural areas)|url=http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8318|access-date=2020-09-13|website=nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz}}</ref>

[[File:Public Trust Office Building, Wellington 6146.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The old [[Public Trust Building]] in Lambton Quay is an example of Edwardian architecture in Wellington, built entirely from granite]]

Wellington showcases a variety of architectural styles from the past 150 years – 19th-century wooden cottages ([[Painted Ladies]]), such as the [[Italianate]] [[Katherine Mansfield Birthplace]] in Thorndon; streamlined [[Art Deco]] structures such as the old [[Wellington Free Ambulance]] headquarters, the Central Fire Station, Fountain Court Apartments, the [[City Gallery Wellington|City Gallery]], and the [[former Post and Telegraph Building]]; and the curves and vibrant colours of post-modern architecture in the CBD.

==Economy==
[[File:Wellington Harbour, New Zealand, Nov. 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Wellington Harbour]], November 2009]]
[[Wellington Harbour]] ranks as one of New Zealand's chief seaports and serves both domestic and international shipping. The port handles approximately 10.5 million tonnes of cargo on an annual basis,<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.centreport.co.nz/faqs|website=www.centreport.co.nz|access-date=10 February 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081457/http://www.centreport.co.nz/faqs|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> importing petroleum products, motor vehicles, minerals and exporting meats, wood products, dairy products, wool, and fruit. Many [[cruise ship]]s also use the port.

The Government sector has long been a mainstay of the economy, which has typically risen and fallen with it. Traditionally, its central location meant it was the location of many head offices of various sectors – particularly finance, technology and heavy industry – many of which have since relocated to Auckland following economic deregulation and privatisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-11 |title=The Encyclopedia of NZ – Economic fall and rise: 1976–2006 |publisher=Te Ara |date=13 July 2012 |access-date=16 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905154140/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wellington-region/page-11 |archive-date=5 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/7327389/Wellington-businesses-are-fighting-back|title=Wellington businesses are fighting back|author=Terry Hall|publisher=The Dominion Post|date=23 July 2012|access-date=28 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825074107/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/7327389/Wellington-businesses-are-fighting-back|archive-date=25 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Wellington is served by [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] in the west and [[New Zealand State Highway 2|State Highway 2]] in the east, meeting at the [[Ngauranga Interchange]] north of the city centre, where SH 1 runs through the city to the airport. Road access into the capital is constrained by the mountainous terrain – between Wellington and the Kapiti Coast, SH 1 travels along the Centennial Highway, a narrow section of road, and between Wellington and Wairarapa SH 2 transverses the [[Rimutaka Range]]s on a similar narrow winding road. Wellington has two motorways, both part of SH 1: the [[Johnsonville–Porirua Motorway]] and the [[Wellington Urban Motorway]], which in combination with a small non-motorway section in the Ngauranga Gorge connect Porirua with Wellington city.

Bus transport in Wellington is supplied by several different operators under the banner of Metlink. Buses serve almost every part of Wellington city, with most of them running along the "Golden Mile" from [[Wellington railway station]] to [[Courtenay Place, Wellington|Courtenay Place]]. Until October 2017 there were nine [[trolleybus]] routes, all other buses running on [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. The [[Trolleybuses in Wellington|trolleybus network]] was the last public system of its kind in the southern hemisphere.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Wellington lies at the southern end of the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway (NIMT) and the [[Wairarapa Line]], converging on [[Wellington railway station]] at the northern end of central Wellington. Two long-distance services leave from Wellington: the [[Capital Connection]], for commuters from [[Palmerston North]], and the [[Northern Explorer]] to Auckland.

Four [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] [[suburban rail|suburban]] lines radiate from Wellington railway station to the outer suburbs to the north of Wellington – the [[Johnsonville Line]] through the hillside suburbs north of central Wellington; the [[Kapiti Line]] along the NIMT to Waikanae on the Kapiti Coast via Porirua and Paraparaumu; the [[Melling Line]] to Lower Hutt via Petone; and the [[Hutt Valley Line]] along the Wairarapa Line via Waterloo and [[Taitā, New Zealand|Taitā]] to Upper Hutt. A diesel-hauled carriage service, the [[Wairarapa Connection]], connects several times daily to Masterton in the Wairarapa via the {{convert|8.8|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} [[Rimutaka Tunnel]].

Local ferries connect Wellington city centre with Eastbourne and Seatoun.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eastbywest.co.nz/destinations|title=Destinations {{!}} East by West Ferries|website=eastbywest.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>

[[Wellington International Airport]] is {{convert|6|km}} south-east of the city centre. It is serviced by flights from across New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Fiji. Flights to other international destinations require a transfer at another airport, as larger aircraft cannot use Wellington's short ({{convert|2081|m|disp=or|adj=on}}) [[runway]], which has become an issue in recent years in regards to the Wellington region's economic performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Calls-for-Wellington-Airport-to-extend-runway/tabid/369/articleID/281961/Default.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703153712/http://www.3news.co.nz/Calls-for-Wellington-Airport-to-extend-runway/tabid/369/articleID/281961/Default.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 July 2013 |title=Calls for Wellington Airport to extend runway |publisher=3 News |access-date=16 September 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=53371 |title=Upper Hutt wants a longer runway at Wellington Airport, for flights to Asia |work=Wellington.Scoop |publisher=Scoop Media |date=6 March 2013 |access-date=16 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120956/http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=53371 |archive-date=26 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Electric power===
Wellington's first public electricity supply was established in 1904, alongside the introduction of electric trams, and was originally supplied at 105&nbsp;volts 80&nbsp;hertz. The conversion to the now-standard 230/400&nbsp;volts 50&nbsp;hertz began in 1925, the same year the city was connected to the [[Mangahao Power Station|Mangahao hydroelectric scheme]]. Between 1924 and 1968, the city's supply was supplemented by a coal-fired power station at Evans Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnz.org/our-work/heritage/heritage-records/evans-bay-power-station/|title=Evans Bay Power Station – Engineering New Zealand|website=www.engineeringnz.org|access-date=9 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509100127/https://www.engineeringnz.org/our-work/heritage/heritage-records/evans-bay-power-station/|archive-date=9 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Today, Wellington is supplied from nine [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] substations, however the design of the transmission system means that the city is ultimately fed by only two Transpower substations: [[Haywards]] and [[Wilton, New Zealand|Wilton]]. [[Wellington Electricity]] owns and operates the local distribution network.

The city is home to two large wind farms, [[Project West Wind|West Wind]] and [[Mill Creek Wind Farm|Mill Creek]], which combined contribute up to 213&nbsp;MW of electricity to the city and the national grid. Haywards substation in Lower Hutt is the site of the [[HVDC Inter-Island]]'s North Island converter station; the HVDC link connects the North and South Island grids together and allows surplus South Island hydroelectricity to be transmitted the North Island's electricity demand.

While Wellington experiences regular strong winds, and only 63% of Wellington Electricity's network is underground, the city has a very reliable power supply. In the year to March 2018, Wellington Electricity disclosed the average customer spent just 55 minutes without power due to unplanned outages.<ref>{{cite web|title= EDB Information Disclosure Requirements – Wellington Electricity Lines Limited – year ended 31 March 2018|url= https://www.welectricity.co.nz/dmsdocument/156|access-date= 18 October 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181018122249/https://www.welectricity.co.nz/dmsdocument/156|archive-date= 18 October 2018|url-status= dead}}</ref>

===Natural gas===
Wellington and the Hutt Valley were two of the original nine towns and cities in New Zealand to be supplied with natural gas when the [[Kapuni|Kapuni gas field]] entered production in 1970, and a {{convert|260|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} high-pressure pipeline from the field in Taranaki to the city was completed. The high-pressure transmission pipelines supplying Wellington are now owned and operated by [[First Gas]], with [[Powerco]] owning and operating the medium- and low-pressure distribution pipelines within the urban area.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://gasindustry.co.nz/dmsdocument/5344 |title= The New Zealand Gas Story |publisher=Gas Industry Company |date= December 2016 |access-date= 13 February 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202151245/http://gasindustry.co.nz/dmsdocument/5344 |archive-date= 2 February 2017 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

=== The three waters ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in the Wellington region}}
The "three waters" – [[drinking water]], [[stormwater]], and [[wastewater]] services for Wellington are provided by five councils: Wellington City, Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua city councils, and the [[Wellington Region|Greater Wellington]] Regional Council.  However, the water assets of these councils are managed by an [[infrastructure asset management]] company, [[Wellington Water]].

Wellington's first piped water supply came from a spring in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/Our-Environment/Water-Supply/PDFs/Our-water-history-on-tap-complete-document.pdf|title=Our water history – on tap Water supply in the Wellington region 1867–2006|publisher=WRC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201015113/http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/Our-Environment/Water-Supply/PDFs/Our-water-history-on-tap-complete-document.pdf|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Wellington Region|Greater Wellington Regional Council]] now supplies Lower Hutt, Porirua, Upper Hutt and Wellington with up to 220 million litres a day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/bulk-water-supply-live/|title=Bulk water supply – live {{!}} Greater Wellington Regional Council|website=www.gw.govt.nz|access-date=20 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516004711/http://www.gw.govt.nz/bulk-water-supply-live/|archive-date=16 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The water comes from [[Wainuiomata River]] (since 1884), [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt River]] (1914), [[Orongorongo River]] (1926) and the Lower Hutt aquifer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/live-water-supply/|title=Watermap {{!}} Greater Wellington Regional Council|website=www.gw.govt.nz|access-date=20 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531161619/http://www.gw.govt.nz/live-water-supply/|archive-date=31 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There are four wastewater treatment stations serving the region, located at:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.learnz.org.nz/water172/bg-standard-f/wastewater/| title=Wastewater| publisher=LEARNZ| access-date=14 April 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414020034/http://www.learnz.org.nz/water172/bg-standard-f/wastewater/| archive-date=14 April 2020| url-status=live}}</ref>
* Moa Point (serving Wellington city)
* Seaview (serving Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt)
* Karori (serving the suburb)
* Porirua (serving northern Wellington suburbs, Tawa and Porirua city)
The city faces challenges with ageing infrastructure for the three waters and there have been some significant failures, particularly in wastewater systems. The water supply is vulnerable to severe disruption during a major earthquake, although a wide range of projects are planned to improve resilience of the water supply and allow a limited water supply post-earthquake.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| title= Wellington Lifelines Project – Regional Resilience Report| publisher=Wellington Region Emergency Management Office| date= Oct 2019| access-date= 11 April 2020| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200411040711/https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| archive-date= 11 April 2020| url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=George|first=Damian |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/nz-earthquake/117783826/wellington-lifelines-group-calls-for-20year-investment-programme-to-guard-against-major-earthquake |title= Wellington Lifelines Group calls for 20-year investment programme to guard against major earthquake|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 3 December 2019|publisher=Stuff |access-date= 12 April 2020}}</ref>

== Media ==

=== Television ===
Television broadcasts began in Wellington on 1 July 1961 with the launch of channel WNTV1, becoming the third New Zealand city (after Auckland and Christchurch) to receive regular television broadcasts. WNTV1's main studios were in Waring Taylor Street in central Wellington and broadcast from a transmitter atop Mount Victoria. In 1967, the Mount Victoria transmitter was replaced with a more powerful transmitter at [[Mount Kaukau]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=28 June 1967|title=Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|volume=351|page=1394}}</ref> In November 1969, WNTV1 was networked with its counterpart stations in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin to form NZBC TV. 

In 1975, the NZBC was broken up with Wellington and Dunedin studios taking over NZBC TV as [[TVNZ 1|Television One]] while Auckland and Christchurch studios launched [[TVNZ 2|Television Two]]. At the same time, the Wellington studios moved to the new purpose-built [[Avalon, New Zealand|Avalon Television Centre]] in Lower Hutt. In 1980, Televisions One and Two merged under a single company, [[TVNZ|Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ). The majority of television production moved to Auckland over the 1980s, culminating in the opening of TVNZ's new Auckland television centre in 1989.

== Twin cities ==
Wellington is twinned with the following cities:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wellington.govt.nz/about-wellington/international-relations/sister-cities|title=International Relations – Sister Cities|website=Wellington City Council|language=en-NZ|access-date=1 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129021125/https://wellington.govt.nz/about-wellington/international-relations/sister-cities|archive-date=29 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

* [[Xiamen]], People's Republic of China (1987)
* [[Sakai]], Japan (1994)
* [[Beijing]], People's Republic of China (2006)
* [[Canberra]], Australia (2016)

It also has historical ties with [[Chania]], Greece; [[Harrogate]], England; and [[Çanakkale]], Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wellington.govt.nz/about-wellington/international-relations/sister-cities/historical-sister-cities|title=Historical sister cities|publisher=Wellington City Council}}</ref>
