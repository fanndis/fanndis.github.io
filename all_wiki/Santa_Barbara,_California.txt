'''Santa Barbara''' ({{lang-es|Santa Bárbara}}; {{langnf||Spanish|[[Saint Barbara]]}}) is a coastal city in, and the [[county seat]] of, [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]] in the U.S. state of [[California]]. Situated on a south-facing section of coastline, the longest such section on the [[West Coast of the United States]], the city lies between the steeply rising [[Santa Ynez Mountains]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Santa Barbara, California}}

Evidence of human habitation of the area begins at least 13,000 years ago. Evidence for a [[Paleo-Indians|Paleoindian]] presence includes a fluted [[Clovis culture|Clovis]]-like point found in the 1980s along the western Santa Barbara County coast, as well as the remains of [[Arlington Springs Man]], found on Santa Rosa Island in the 1960s. An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 [[Chumash people|Chumash]] lived on the south coast of Santa Barbara County at the time of the first European explorations.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Five Chumash villages flourished in the area. The present-day area of Santa Barbara City College was the village of ''Mispu''; the site of the Los Baños pool (along west beach, was the village of ''Syukhtun'', chief Yanonalit's large village located between Bath and Chapala streets; ''Amolomol'' was at the mouth of Mission Creek; and ''Swetete'', above the bird refuge.<ref name="radic">{{Cite web

===Spanish period===
[[File:Santa Barbara mission CA1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mission Santa Barbara]], known as "the Queen of the Missions," was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[friars]] in 1786.]]
Spanish explorer [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], sailing for the [[Kingdom of Spain]], sailed through what is now called the [[Santa Barbara Channel]] in 1542, anchoring briefly in the area. In 1602, Spanish maritime explorer [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] gave the name "Santa Barbara" to the channel and also to one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gudde |first=Erwin G. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/californiaplacen0000gudd/page/294 294] |year=1969 |title=California Place Names |url=https://archive.org/details/californiaplacen0000gudd|url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref>

A land [[Portola expedition|expedition]] led by [[Gaspar de Portolà]] visited around 1769, and Franciscan missionary [[Juan Crespi]], who accompanied the expedition, named a large native town "Laguna de la Concepcion". Cabrillo's earlier name, however, is the one that has survived.
[[File:SB Presidio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Presidio of Santa Barbara]], chapel in downtown Santa Barbara, rebuilt in the late 20th c.]] 
The first permanent European residents were Spanish missionaries and soldiers under [[Felipe de Neve]], who came in 1782 to build the [[Santa Barbara Presidio|Presidio]]. They were sent both to fortify the region against expansion by other powers such as England and Russia, and to convert the natives to Christianity. Many of the Spaniards brought their families with them, and those formed the nucleus of the small town&nbsp;– at first just a cluster of adobes&nbsp;– that surrounded the [[Presidio of Santa Barbara]]. The Santa Barbara Mission was established on the Feast of [[Saint Barbara]], December 4, 1786. It was the tenth of the California Missions to be founded by the Spanish Franciscans. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150206112826/http://www.santabarbaramission.org/history] It was dedicated by Padre [[Fermín Lasuén]], who succeeded Padre [[Junipero Serra]] as the second president and founder of the California Franciscan Mission Chain. The Chumash laborers built a connection between the canyon creek and the Santa Barbara Mission water system through the use of a dam and an aqueduct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2015/jan/20/history-rattlesnake-canyon/|title=The History of Rattlesnake Canyon|last=Redmon|first=Michael|date=2015-01-20|work=Santa Barbara Independent|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> During the following decades, many of the natives died of diseases such as [[smallpox]], against which they had no [[Innate immune system|natural immunity]].<ref>Baker, Gayle, ''Santa Barbara'' HarborTown Histories Publishers, Santa Barbara, CA, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-9710984-1-1}} (print) 978-0-9879038-1-5 (e-book) p. 12-13</ref>

The most dramatic event of the Spanish period was the powerful [[1812 San Juan Capistrano earthquake|1812 earthquake]], and [[tsunami]], with an estimated magnitude of 7.1, which destroyed the Mission as well as the rest of the town; water reached as high as present-day Anapamu street, and carried a ship half a mile up Refugio Canyon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/tsunamis/2005/news/articles/pdfs/2005_01_09_tsunami_LAT.pdf |title=Los Angeles Times article on 1812 tsunami |access-date=2012-05-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917105445/http://www.usc.edu/dept/tsunamis/2005/news/articles/pdfs/2005_01_09_tsunami_LAT.pdf |archive-date=September 17, 2012  }}</ref><ref>Tompkins, 1975, p. 13-14</ref>  The Mission was rebuilt by 1820 after the earthquake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.athanasius.com/camission/barbara.htm|title=Mission Santa Barbara|website=Athanasius.com|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref> Following the earthquake, the Mission fathers chose to rebuild in a grander manner, and it is this construction that survives to the present day, the best-preserved of the California Missions, and still functioning as an active church by the Franciscans.  After the Mexican government secularized the missions in the 1830s, the baptismal, marriage, and burial records of other missions were transferred to Santa Barbara, and now found in the [[Santa Barbara Mission-Archive Library|Santa Barbara Mission Archive-Library]]. [[C-SPAN]] has produced a program on the mission and the mission archive-library.<ref>http://www.c-span.org/video/?404339-1/mission-santa-barbara-library-archives accessed May 25, 2018</ref>

The Spanish period ended in 1822 with the end of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], which terminated 300 years of colonial rule. The flag of Mexico went up the flagpole at the Presidio, but only for 24 years.

Santa Barbara street names reflect this time period as well. The names ''de le Guerra'' and ''Carrillo'' come from citizens of the town of this time. They were instrumental in building up the town, so they were honored by having streets named after them.<ref>Redmon, Michael (November 21, 2014) [http://www.independent.com/news/2014/nov/21/history-behind-street-names/ "The History Behind Street Names"] ''[[Santa Barbara Independent]]''</ref>

===Mexican and Rancho period===
After the forced [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularization of the Missions in 1833]], successive [[Governor of Alta California#Mexican Governors of Alta California|Mexican Governors]] distributed the large land tracts formerly held by the Franciscan Order to various families in order to reward service or build alliances. These land grants to local notable families mark the beginning of the "Rancho Period" in California and Santa Barbara history. The Fernando Tico was one of the first settlers who received land grants for the local area. Fernando led the Native Americans against the Argentinian pirate in the 1800s. The population remained sparse, with enormous cattle operations run by wealthy families. It was during this period that [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] first visited Santa Barbara and wrote about the [[culture]] and people of Santa Barbara in his book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]''.

[[File:Santa Barbara County Courthouse Mural room.jpg|right|thumb|Mural Room (formerly Board of Supervisors' Hearing Room) within the Santa Barbara County Courthouse. Wall murals depict the history of Santa Barbara. The room is used occasionally as a courtroom.]]
Santa Barbara fell bloodlessly to a battalion of American soldiers under John C. Frémont on December 27, 1846, during the [[Mexican–American War]], and after the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848 it became part of the expanding United States.

===Middle and late 19th century===
[[File:Sant Barbara - State Street 1880s.jpg|left|thumb|State Street in the 1880s looking north from Canon Perdido Street]]
Change came quickly after Santa Barbara's acquisition by the United States. The population doubled between 1850 and 1860. In 1851, land surveyor Salisbury Haley designed the street grid, famously botching the block measurements, misaligning the streets, thereby creating doglegs at certain intersections.<ref>Tompkins, 1983, p. 113</ref>  Wood construction replaced adobe as American settlers moved in; during the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush years]] and following, the town became a haven for bandits and gamblers, and a dangerous and lawless place. Charismatic gambler and [[highwayman]] [[Jack Powers]] had virtual control of the town in the early 1850s, until driven out by a posse organized in San Luis Obispo. English gradually supplanted Spanish as the language of daily life, becoming the language of official record in 1870.<ref>Baker, p. 34-35</ref>  The first newspaper, the ''Santa Barbara Gazette'', was founded in 1855.<ref>Baker, p. 39</ref>

While the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had little effect on Santa Barbara, the disastrous drought of 1863 ended the Rancho Period, as most of the cattle died and ranchos were broken up and sold. Mortimer Cook, a wealthy entrepreneur, arrived in 1871 and opened the city's first bank. Cook later served two terms as mayor.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Redmon|first1=Michael|title=Early Banks and Banking in Santa Barbara|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/dec/10/early-banks-and-banking-santa-barbara/|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=December 10, 2014}}</ref> Cook founded the first National Gold Bank of Santa Barbara in 1873. The building of [[Stearns Wharf]] in 1872 enhanced Santa Barbara's commercial and tourist accessibility; previously goods and visitors had to transfer from [[steamboat]]s to smaller craft to row ashore. During the 1870s, writer [[Charles Nordhoff (journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]] promoted the town as a health resort and destination for well-to-do travelers from other parts of the U.S.; many of them came, and many stayed. The luxurious [[Arlington Hotel (Santa Barbara, California)|Arlington Hotel]] dated from this period. In 1887 the railroad finally went through to Los Angeles, and in 1901 to San Francisco: Santa Barbara was now easily accessible by land and by sea, and subsequent development was brisk.<ref>Baker, pp. 56–59, 66</ref>

[[Peter J. Barber]], an architect, designed many Late Victorian style residences, and served twice as mayor, in 1880 and again in 1890. A year after Barber's term as mayor, President Benjamin Harrison became the first of five presidents to visit Santa Barbara.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Redmon|first1=Michael|title=Theodore Roosevelt visits Santa Barbara|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/sep/16/theodore-roosevelt-visits-santa-barbara/|access-date=February 5, 2015|agency=Independent|newspaper=Independent|date=September 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Early 20th century to World War II===
[[File:SantaBarbaraVenturaOilGasFields.png|thumb|Map of Santa Barbara Oil and Gas Fields]]
Just before the turn of the 20th century, oil was discovered at the [[Summerland Oil Field]], and the region along the beach east of Santa Barbara sprouted numerous oil derricks and piers for [[Offshore drilling|drilling offshore]]. This was the first offshore oil development in the world; oil drilling offshore would become a contentious practice in the Santa Barbara area, which continues to the present day.<ref>Baker, p. 63</ref>

Santa Barbara housed the world's largest movie studio during the era of silent film. Flying A Studios, a division of the [[American Film Manufacturing Company]], operated on two city blocks centered at State and Mission between 1910 and 1922, with the industry shutting down locally and moving to Hollywood once it outgrew the area, needing the resources of a larger city. Flying A and the other smaller local studios produced approximately 1,200 films during their tenure in Santa Barbara, of which approximately 100 survive.<ref>Tompkins, 1976, p. 258</ref><ref>Baker, p. 72</ref><ref>Birchard, p. 49</ref>

During this period, the [[Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company|Loughead Aircraft Company]] was established on lower State Street, and regularly tested [[seaplane]]s off of East Beach. This was the genesis of what would later become [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].

While this quake, like the one in 1812, was centered in the Santa Barbara Channel, it caused no tsunami. It came at an opportune time for rebuilding, since a movement for architectural reform and unification around a [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial style]] was already underway. Under the leadership of [[Pearl Chase]], many of the city's famous buildings rose as part of the rebuilding process, including the [[Santa Barbara County Courthouse]], sometimes praised as the "most beautiful public building in the United States." There is also the unfortunate incident that happened in 1907, which included a horrific train accident that took the lives of 32 people.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Redmon|first1=Michael|title=1907 Train Wreck|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2013/jul/02/1907-train-wreck/ |work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=July 2, 2013}}</ref>

During World War II, Santa Barbara was home to [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara]], and [[Naval Reserve Center Santa Barbara]] at the harbor. Up the coast, west of the city, was the Army's Camp Cooke (the present-day [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]). In the city,
Hoff General Hospital treated servicemen wounded in the Pacific Theatre. On February 23, 1942, not long after the outbreak of war in the Pacific, the Japanese submarine ''[[Japanese submarine I-17|I-17]]'' surfaced offshore and [[Bombardment of Ellwood|lobbed 16 shells]] at the [[Ellwood Oil Field]], about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of Santa Barbara, in the first shelling attack by an enemy power on the continental U.S. since the [[Attack on Orleans|bombardment of Orleans]] in [[World War I]]. Although the shelling was inaccurate and only caused about $500 damage to a catwalk, panic was immediate. Many Santa Barbara residents fled, and land values plummeted to historic lows.

===After World War II===
[[File:Santa Barbara Harbor by Don Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Santa Barbara Harbor.]]
After the war many of the servicemen who had seen Santa Barbara returned to stay. The population surged by 10,000 people between the end of the war and 1950.  This burst of growth had dramatic consequences for the local economy and infrastructure. [[U.S. Highway 101|Highway 101]] was built through town during this period, and newly built [[Lake Cachuma]] began supplying water via a tunnel dug through the mountains between 1950 and 1956.<ref>[http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/cachuma.html U.S. Bureau of Reclamation: page on the Lake Cachuma project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609100621/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/cachuma.html |date=June 9, 2009 }}</ref>

Local relations with the oil industry gradually soured through the period. Production at Summerland had ended, Elwood was winding down, and to find new fields oil companies carried out seismic exploration of the Channel using explosives, a controversial practice that local fishermen claimed harmed their catch. The culminating disaster, and one of the formative events in the modern environmental movement, was the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill|blowout at Union Oil's Platform A]] on the [[Dos Cuadras Offshore Oil Field|Dos Cuadras Field]], about eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southeast of Santa Barbara in the Santa Barbara Channel, on January 28, 1969. Approximately {{convert|100000|oilbbl}} of oil surged out of a huge undersea break, fouling hundreds of square miles of ocean and all the coastline from Ventura to Goleta, as well north facing beaches on the Channel Islands. Two legislative consequences of the spill in the next year were the passages of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA); locally, outraged citizens formed GOO (Get Oil Out).<ref name="Baker, pp. 88-89">Baker, pp. 88–89</ref>
Santa Barbara's business community strove to attract development until the surge in the anti-growth movement in the 1970s.  Many "clean" industries, especially aerospace firms such as Raytheon and Delco Electronics, moved to town in the 1950s and 1960s, bringing employees from other parts of the U.S. UCSB itself became a major employer.<ref name="Baker, pp. 88-89"/>  In 1975, the city passed an ordinance restricting growth to a maximum of 85,000 residents, through zoning. Growth in the adjacent Goleta Valley could be shut down by denying water meters to developers seeking permits. As a result of these changes, growth slowed down, but prices rose sharply.<ref>Tompkins, 1975, p. 115</ref><ref>Baker, pp. 89–91</ref>

When voters approved connection to State water supplies in 1991, parts of the city, especially outlying areas, resumed growth, but more slowly than during the boom period of the 1950s and 1960s. While the slower growth preserved the quality of life for most residents and prevented the [[urban sprawl]] notorious in the [[Los Angeles Basin|Los Angeles basin]], housing in the Santa Barbara area was in short supply, and prices soared: in 2006, only six percent of residents could afford a median-value house. As a result, many people who work in Santa Barbara commute from adjacent, more affordable areas, such as Santa Maria, [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]], and Ventura. The resultant traffic on incoming arteries, in particular the stretch of Highway 101 between Ventura and Santa Barbara, is another problem being addressed by long-range planners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/06/local/me-slowgrow6 |title=Slow Growth Movement &#124; 'Slow Growth' Has Come at a Cost in Santa Barbara|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=1999-04-13 |access-date=2012-05-20|first1=Jeffrey L.|last1=Rabin|first2=Daryl|last2=Kelley}}</ref>

====Notable wildfires====
Since the middle of the twentieth century, several destructive fires have affected Santa Barbara: the 1964 Coyote Fire, which burned {{convert|67000|acre|km2}} of backcountry along with 106 homes; the smaller, but quickly moving, Sycamore Fire in 1977, which burned 200 homes; the disastrous 1990 [[Painted Cave, California|Painted Cave]] Fire, which incinerated over 500 homes in only several hours, during an intense [[Sundowner (wind)|Sundowner wind]] event; the November 2008 [[Montecito Tea Fire|Tea Fire]], which destroyed 210 homes in the foothills of Santa Barbara and Montecito; and the 2009 [[Jesusita Fire]] that burned {{convert|8733|acre|km2}} and destroyed 160 homes above the [[Santa Barbara, California#Neighborhoods|San Roque]] region of Santa Barbara.<ref name=city1>{{cite web|url=http://www.santabarbaraca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/00BDE41C-79A6-4862-8D02-89E16FCB01CB/0/0611_Get_Ready_Santa_Barbara.pdf|title=City of Santa Barbara: Historical Santa Barbara Area Fires|website=Santabarbaraca.gov |date=June 2011 |access-date=2012-07-31}}</ref><ref name=county1>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/au/dphist/history.htm |title=History of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department |access-date=2012-07-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720065051/http://www.sbcfire.com/au/dphist/history.htm |archive-date=July 20, 2012  }}</ref>

The [[Thomas Fire]] burned from its origins in [[Santa Paula, California|Santa Paula]] {{convert|60| miles}} to the east of Santa Barbara and consumed {{convert|281,893 |acre|km2}} in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, most of which consisted of rural land and wilderness areas. The fire started December 4, 2017 and was 100% contained by January 12, 2018. 1,050 structures were lost in the Thomas Fire, mostly east of Santa Barbara in Ventura County. The Thomas Fire has been the largest Santa Barbara County fire ever recorded to date.

==Geography==
[[File:Santabarbarastreetscene.jpg|thumb|left|Looking north from a Santa Barbara street toward "the Riviera" and the Santa Ynez Mountains beyond]]

Santa Barbara is located about {{convert|90|mi|0}} west-northwest of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast. This stretch of coast along southern [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]] is sometimes referred to as "The American Riviera",<ref>[http://www.santabarbaraca.com/visitor-info/ Santa Barbara tourism website, showing "The American Riviera" trademark] (accessed February 2014)</ref> presumably because its geography and climate are similar to that of areas along the northern [[Mediterranean Sea]] coast (especially in southern France) known as the [[Riviera]]. The [[Santa Ynez Mountains]], an east–west trending range, rise dramatically behind the city, with several peaks exceeding {{convert|4000|ft|sigfig=2}}. Covered with [[chaparral]], oaks and [[sandstone]] [[outcrop]]s, they make a scenic backdrop to the town. Sometimes, perhaps once every three years, snow falls on the mountains, but it rarely stays for more than a few days. Nearer to town, directly east and adjacent to [[Mission Santa Barbara]], is an east-west ridge known locally as "the Riviera," traversed by a road called "Alameda Padre Serra" (shortened APS, which translates to "Father Serra's pathway").

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|42.0|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|19.5|sqmi}} of it is land and {{convert|22.5|sqmi}} of it (53.61%) is water. The high official figures for water is due to the extension of the city limit into the ocean, including a strip of city reaching out into the sea and inland again to keep the Santa Barbara Airport (SBA) within the city boundary.

==Climate==

Santa Barbara experiences a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Csb) characteristic of coastal California. Santa Barbara's weather was ranked number 1 in the United States in 2018 by U.S. News & World Report. Because the city lies along the ocean and parallel to the predominant westerly winds, sideshore and light onshore breezes moderate temperatures resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places farther inland.

In the winter, storms reach California, some of which bring heavy rainfall but the rainshadow effect of the coastal mountains can at times moderate or enhance the rainfall depending on local storm wind flows. Local rainfall totals can be enhanced by [[orographic lift]] when storms are accompanied by southerly flow pushing moist air over the Santa Ynez mountains, producing greater rainfall than in other coastal areas. [[Diurnal temperature variation]] reaches a maximum in winter due to lower humidity and the absence of summer fog. On average, only 1.7 nights have freezing lows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/zip-code/california/santa_barbara/93111|title=Zip 93111 (Santa Barbara, CA) Climate|website=https://www.bestplaces.net|access-date=2019-08-04}}</ref>

Summers in Santa Barbara are mostly rainless due to the presence of a high-pressure area over the eastern Pacific, but summer showers can happen due to tropical hurricane/Monsoonal flows that rarely reach the region, thunderstorms could also occur during the [[North American Monsoon]]. In the fall, afternoon or evening downslope winds, locally called "Sundowners", can raise temperatures into the high 90s and drop humidities into the single digits, increasing the chance due to downed powerlines etc. and severity of wildfires in the foothills north of the city.

Annual rainfall totals are highly variable and in exceptional years like 1940–1941 and 1997–1998 over {{convert|40|in|m}} of rain have fallen in a year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca7902 |title=Santa Barbara (COOP) |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=2012-05-20}}</ref> but in dry seasons less than {{convert|6|in|mm|-1}} is not unheard of. Snow sometimes covers higher elevations of the Santa Ynez Mountains but is extremely rare in the city itself. The most recent accumulating snow to fall near sea level was in January 1949, when approximately two inches fell in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edhat.com/site/tidbit.cfm?nid=11115 |title=Snow in Santa Barbara |publisher=Edhat |access-date=2015-12-20}}</ref>

===Geology and soils===
[[Image:Cliffs at Arroyo Burro Beach Park.jpg|thumb|left|Eastward view of the coastal bluffs of the [[Douglas Family Preserve]] park from [[Arroyo Burro Beach]].]]
The city of Santa Barbara is situated on a coastal plain between the Santa Ynez Mountains and the sea. This coastal plain consists of a complex array of [[Holocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[alluvial]] and [[colluvial]] deposits, [[marine terrace]]s, debris flows, and [[estuarine]] deposits.<ref name="Norris">{{cite book |title=The geology and landscape of Santa Barbara County, California|last= Norris|first= Robert M.|year= 2003|publisher= Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History|location= Santa Barbara, California|isbn= 978-0-936494-35-7|page= 33}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|author=Dibblee, T.W., and Ehrenspeck, H.E., ed.|title=Geologic map of the Santa Barbara quadrangle, Santa Barbara County, California|map=Santa Barbara quadrangle, Santa Barbara County, California|year=1986|url=https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Prodesc/proddesc_192.htm|scale=1:24,000|publisher=Dibblee Geological Foundation|location=Santa Barbara County, California|format=image|id=Dibblee Foundation Map DF-06|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>  Soils are mostly well drained brown fine sandy loam of the Milpitas series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/|title=SoilWeb: An Online Soil Survey Browser {{!}} California Soil Resource Lab|website=casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-08}}</ref>  Rapid geologic uplift is characteristic of the entire region, as evidenced by the coastal bluffs and narrow beaches that are present along most of the coastline.<ref>Norris, p. 33</ref>

Downtown Santa Barbara occupies a floodplain between two major geologic faults, the Mission Ridge Fault Zone to the north and the Mesa Fault to the south. The Mission Ridge Fault Zone runs along the range of hills known locally as the "Riviera", and the Mesa Fault defines the northern boundary of the band of hills called the "Mesa". These two faults converge near the Five Points Shopping Center at Los Positas and State Streets. Neither is well-exposed, with their locations being inferred from topography, springs, seeps, and well logs.<ref>Norris, p. 101</ref>  The Mesa Fault continues southeast offshore into the Santa Barbara Channel; the portion of the fault offshore is believed to have been responsible for the destructive earthquake of 1925.<ref>Norris, p. 102</ref> The Mission Ridge Fault trends east-west, being named the More Ranch Fault west of Santa Barbara, and forms the northern boundary of the uplands which include Isla Vista, More Mesa, and the Hope Ranch Hills.<ref>Norris, p. 100-101</ref>

Three major sedimentary bedrock units underlie the coastal plain: the [[Monterey Formation]], the [[Sisquoc Formation]], and the [[Santa Barbara Formation]].  The Santa Barbara Formation is one of the main units in the [[aquifer]] underlying the city. Its coarse-grained freshwater-bearing portion, much of which is below sea level, is protected from seawater intrusion by the More Ranch Fault, which has shielded it by uplifting less-permeable rocks between it and the sea. The majority of water wells in the Santa Barbara-Goleta area pull from this geologic unit.<ref>Norris, p. 95, 101</ref>

The Santa Ynez Mountains to the north of the city consist of multiple layers of sandstone and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] units dating from the [[Jurassic|Jurassic Age]] to the present, uplifted rapidly since the [[Pliocene]], upended, and in some areas completely overturned. Rapid uplift has given these mountains their craggy, scenic character, and numerous landslides and debris flows, which form some of the urban and suburban lowland area, are testament to their geologically active nature.<ref name="Minor">{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3001/downloads/pdf/SIM3001map.pdf |title=Geologic Map of the Santa Barbara Coastal Plain Area, Santa Barbara County, California |last1=Minor |first1=S.A. |display-authors=etal |date=2009 |publisher=USGS|access-date=December 20, 2015}}</ref>

===Architecture===
The first Monterey-style adobe in California was built on State Street of Santa Barbara by the wealthy merchant Alpheus Thompson.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Redmon|first1=Michael|title=Alpheus Thompson|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/oct/01/alpheus-thompson/ |work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> The dominant architectural themes of Santa Barbara are the [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] and the related [[Mission Revival style architecture|Mission Revival style]], encouraged through design guidelines adopted by city leaders after the 1925 earthquake destroyed much of the downtown commercial district. Residential architectural styles in Santa Barbara reflect the era of their construction. Many late 1800s [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] homes remain downtown and in the "Upper East" neighborhood. [[California Bungalow|California bungalows]] are common, built in the early decades of the 20th century. Spanish Colonial Revival-style homes built after 1925 are common all over the city, especially in newer upscale residential areas like Montecito and Hope Ranch.  Notable modernist and contemporary homes can be found as well.

===Neighborhoods===
Santa Barbara has a range of neighborhoods with distinctive histories, architecture, and culture. While considerable consensus exists as to the identification of neighborhood names and boundaries, variations exist between observers. For example, real estate agents may use different names than those used by public utilities or municipal service providers, such as police, fire, or water services. The following is a list of neighborhoods with descriptions and comments on each.

* '''The Mesa''' stretches {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} from Santa Barbara City College on the east to Arroyo Burro County Beach (or "Hendry's/The Pit" to locals) on the west. "The Mesa" embodies a beach vibe. The neighborhood has beach access to Mesa Lane Beach, as well as Thousand Steps Beach. This is considered to be a desirable neighborhood due to its proximity to the ocean as well as the college. Residential development began here in the 1920s but was interrupted by the discovery of the [[Mesa Oil Field]]. The field was quickly exhausted, and after the Second World War building of houses resumed, although the last oil tanks and sumps did not disappear until the early 1970s.<ref name="Easton">{{cite book |title=Black tide: the Santa Barbara oil spill and its consequences|last= Easton|first= Robert Olney|year= 1972|publisher= Delacorte Press|location= New York, New York|pages= 89–90}}</ref>
* [[Mission Canyon, California|'''Mission Canyon''']] contains the wooded hilly area beginning at the Old Mission and extending along Foothill Road, north and east into Mission Canyon Road and Las Canoas Road. A popular spot as an entry-point for weekend foothill hiking, it is one of the most rustically beautiful, yet fire-prone areas of Santa Barbara due to heavy natural vegetation.
* '''The Riviera''' encompasses an ocean-facing hillside and back hillside extending for approximately two miles, with the north side extending from Foothill Road to Sycamore Canyon Road, and the south side from the Santa Barbara Mission to North Salinas Street. The ribbon-like [[Alameda Padre Serra]] serves as the principal entry point from the Mission and the City of Santa Barbara. Since the past century, it has been known as "the Riviera" due to its resemblance to the Mediterranean coastal towns of France and Italy. The neighborhood has winding streets with intricate stonework terracing built by early 20th-century Italian immigrants. Most of the topography of the Riviera is relatively steep, making it particularly noteworthy for homes with outstanding views of the City of Santa Barbara and the Pacific Ocean.
* '''The Westside''' ("west of State Street") lies predominantly in the lowlands between State Street and the Mesa, including Highway 101, and also reaches down to Cliff Drive, incorporating [[Santa Barbara City College]].
* '''The Eastside''' ("east of State Street") is generally the area east of State to the base of the Riviera, and includes [[Santa Barbara Junior High School]], [[Santa Barbara High School]], and the [[Santa Barbara Bowl]].
* '''The Waterfront''' comprises roughly commercial and tourist-oriented business structures along Cabrillo Boulevard including [[Stearns Wharf]], the Santa Barbara Harbor and the breakwater, and extending east toward the Bird Refuge and west along Shoreline Drive above the SBCC campus West.
* '''Upper State Street''' is a residential and commercial district that includes numerous professional offices, and much of the medical infrastructure of the city. Upper State is generally defined by the location of the Granada Theatre and points Northwest. Upper State includes the Santa Barbara Mission and the late Pearl Chase's influence on home design is ever-present in this area.
* [[San Roque, California|'''San Roque''']] is located northwest of the downtown area and north of '''Samarkand'''. This area is said to be a constant 5 degrees warmer than the coastal areas, due to its greater distance from the ocean than other Santa Barbara neighborhoods, and being separated from the sea by a low range of hills to the south of the 101 freeway, occupied by the Mesa and [[Hope Ranch]]. San Roque area weather is considered by locals as the most temperate of all Santa Barbara Cities areas.
* '''Samarkand''' currently has approximately 630 homes on {{convert|184|acre|km2}} with a population of about 2,000 people. The name Samarkand comes from an Old Persian word meaning "the land of heart's desire." It was first applied to a deluxe Persian-style hotel that was converted from a boys' school in 1920. Samarkand later became identified as its own neighborhood located between Las Positas, State Street, De La Vina, Oak Park, and the Freeway. Earle Ovington built the first home here in 1920 at 3030 Samarkand Drive. As a pilot, Ovington established the Casa Loma Air Field with a {{convert|1500|ft|m|adj=on}} runway that was used by legendary pilots Lindbergh and Earhart.

The annual Fiesta (originally called "Old Spanish Days") is celebrated every year in August. The Fiesta is hosted by the [[Native Daughters of the Golden West]] and the [[Native Sons of the Golden West]] in a joint committee called the Fiesta Board. Fiesta was originally started as a tourist attraction, like the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], to draw business into the town in the 1920s.<ref>Patricia Ann Hardwick. (2010).

For over 40 years, the Santa Barbara Arts and Crafts Show has been held on Cabrillo Boulevard, east of [[Stearns Wharf]] and along the beach, attracting thousands of people to see artwork made by artists and crafts people that live in Santa Barbara county. By the rules of the show, all the works displayed must have been made by the artists and craftspeople themselves, who sell their own goods. The show started in the early 1960s, and now has over 200 booths on Sundays. The show is also held on some Saturdays that are national holidays, but not during inclement weather.

The [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], another local non-profit, draws over 50,000 attendees during what is usually Santa Barbara's slow season in late January. SBIFF hosts a wide variety of celebrities, premieres, panels and movies from around the world and runs for 10 days.

The annual [[Santa Barbara Summer Solstice Parade|Summer Solstice Parade]] draws up to 100,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solsticeparade.com/history.htm |title=History – Santa Barbara Summer Solstice Celebration |publisher=Solsticeparade.com |access-date=2012-05-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514052829/http://solsticeparade.com/history.htm |archive-date=May 14, 2009  }}</ref> It is a colorful themed parade put on by local residents, and follows a route along State Street for approximately one mile, ending at [[Alameda Park]]. Its main rule is that no written messages or banners with words are allowed. Floats and costumes vary from the whimsical to the outrageous; parties and street events take place throughout the weekend of the parade, the first weekend after the solstice.

Surfing is a part of Santa Barbara culture. The late [[Bruce Brown]]'s cult classic, ''[[The Endless Summer]]'', put surfing on the map, and he was often seen around town prior to his passing in December 2017. Surfing legend [[Pat Curren]] and his son, three time world champion [[Tom Curren]], as well as ten time world champion [[Kelly Slater]], and other popular surfers such as [[Shaun Tompson]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Chris Brown-deceased]] call Santa Barbara home. The Channel Islands block summer surf swells that come from the tropics or further south, the southern hemisphere. For these reasons Santa Barbara is viewed as a winter surf location.
