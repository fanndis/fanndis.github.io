'''Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US''' was the title of the [[President's Daily Brief]] prepared by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and given to U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] on Monday, August 6, 2001.  The brief warned, 36 days before the [[September 11 attacks]], of [[terrorism]] threats from [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al-Qaeda]], including "patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]" of U.S. [[aircraft]].<ref name="Blanton">{{cite web|last=Blanton|first=Thomas S.|date=April 12, 2004|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/index.htm|title=The President's Daily Brief|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|access-date=August 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806112749/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/index.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

== President's Daily Brief ==
The President's Daily Brief (PDB) is a brief of important [[classified information]] on [[national security]] collected by various [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence agencies]] given to the president and a select group of senior officials.  On August 6, 2001, the Central Intelligence Agency delivered a President's Daily Brief to President Bush, who was vacationing at [[Prairie Chapel Ranch|his ranch]] in [[Crawford, Texas]].<ref name="Thompson"/><ref>{{YouTube|id=DIpEwGmSsmM|title="Condoleezza Rice asserts 'Bin Laden Determined To Attack' wasn't a warning. sickhorses.com"}}</ref>

President Bush's response of "All right. You've covered your ass." has been erroneously linked to this PDB. This response, however, came from a separate PDB linked to Bin Laden from several months earlier. During 2001, CIA analysts produced several reports warning of imminent attacks by Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. Senior officials, including Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and staff from [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s office at the Department of Defense, questioned whether these reports might not be deception on the part of al-Qaeda, purposely designed to needlessly expend resources in response. After reevaluating the legitimate risks of these recent reports, CIA analysts produced a report titled "UBL [Usama Bin Laden] Threats Are Real". It was after this report that the president gave that now-infamous response.<ref>[[Michael Morell]], "The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism - from al Qa'ida to ISIS" (New York: [[Hatchette Book Group]], 2015), p. 41</ref>

== Release ==
The content of the memo was kept secret, as with all but a handful of PDBs, until it was leaked in 2002.<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Paul|year=2004|title=[[The Terror Timeline]]|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-078338-9|page=100}}</ref> ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' reported on the document on May 15.<ref name="Blanton"/><ref>{{YouTube|id=KIz_4D5vli0|title="911 Foreknowledge - Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."}}</ref>

The PDB was declassified and approved for release to the [[9/11 Commission]] on April 10, 2004, and reported in the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]'' on July 22, 2004.<ref>{{cite book|author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|authorlink=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|year=2004|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/fullreport.pdf|chapter=The System was Blinking Red|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]|isbn=0-16-072304-3|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423032225/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/fullreport.pdf|archivedate=April 23, 2016}}</ref> According to the [[National Security Archive]],  President Bush was the first sitting president to release a PDB to the public.<ref name="Blanton"/>

== Analysis ==
In response to accusations that the Administration failed to act on the contents of the briefing, U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] and General [[Richard Myers]] emphasized that the CIA's PDB did not warn the President of a specific new threat but "contained historical information based on old reporting".<ref>{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Myers|year=2009|title=Eyes on the Horizon: Serving on the Front Lines of National Security|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-6031-9|page=186}}  See: {{cite book|last=Felix|first=Antonia|year=2005|title=Condi: The Condoleezza Rice Story|publisher=Newmarket Press|isbn=1-55704-675-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/condicondoleezza00feli/page/228 228–229]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/condicondoleezza00feli/page/228}} According to Felix, at the 9/11 Commission, "Condi stressed that the administration did not anticipate any strikes within the country, but was focused on terrorist activities in other parts of the world.  Commission member Richard Ben-Veniste brought the subject back to the memo, however, to point out that its very title pointed to a domestic attack."  <blockquote>BEN-VENISTE: Isn't it a fact, Dr. Rice, that the Aug. 6 P.D.B. warned against possible attacks in this country? [...]<br> RICE: You said did it not warn of attacks.  It did not warn of attacks inside the United States.  It was historical information based on old reporting.  There was no new threat information.  And it did not, in fact, warn of any coming attacks inside the United States.</blockquote></ref>
