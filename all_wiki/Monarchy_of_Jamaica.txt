{{Politics of Jamaica}}

The '''monarchy of Jamaica''' is a [[constitution]]al system of government in which a [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarch]] is the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[head of state]] of [[Jamaica]].<ref name=Buck1>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4923.asp |title=Buckingham Palace: Queen and Commonwealth: Jamaica |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607011458/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4923.asp |archivedate=7 June 2007 }}</ref> The terms ''[[The Crown|Crown in Right of]] Jamaica'', ''Her Majesty in Right of Jamaica'', or ''The Queen in Right of Jamaica'' may also be used to refer to the entire [[Politics of Jamaica#Executive branch|executive of the government of Jamaica]]. Though the Jamaican Crown has its roots in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Crown]], it has evolved to become a distinctly Jamaican institution, represented by its own unique symbols.

The present monarch is [[Queen Elizabeth II]]—officially titled Queen of Jamaica—who has reigned since 6 August 1962. She, her [[Prince consort|consort]], and other members of the [[Commonwealth realm#Royal family|Royal Family]] undertake various public and private functions across Jamaica and on behalf of the country abroad. However, the Queen is the only member of the Royal Family with any constitutional role, holding ultimate [[Executive (government)|executive authority]],<ref name=Const>{{cite web| url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Jamaica/jam62.html| last=Elizabeth II| title=The Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962| publisher=Georgetown University|year=1962| accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> though her [[Royal Prerogative]] remains bound by laws enacted by her in parliament and by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]s and precedents, leaving the day-to-day exercise of executive power to her [[Cabinet of Jamaica|Cabinet]]. While several powers are the sovereign's alone, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in Jamaica are carried out by the Queen's representative, the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|governor-general]]. While several British kings ruled over Jamaica before independence, none held the specific, separate title "King of Jamaica."

The Jamaican monarch, besides reigning in Jamaica, separately serves as monarch for each of fifteen other [[Commonwealth realm]]s. This developed from the former colonial relationship of these countries to Britain, now independent each realm of the Commonwealth is legally distinct.

==International and domestic aspects==
{{further|Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms}}
Jamaica has the same person as their monarch as other [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Each country is sovereign and independent of the others,<ref name="HCA">The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] ruled in 1982, while "there is only one person who is the Sovereign within the British Commonwealth&nbsp;... in matters of law and government the Queen of the United Kingdom, for example, is entirely independent and distinct from the Queen of Canada". [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1999/30.html R v Foreign Secretary; Ex parte Indian Association, QB 892 at 928; as referenced in High Court of Australia: Sue v Hill [1999&#93; HCA 30; 23 June 1999; S179/1998 and B49/1998]</ref> meaning the Jamaican monarchy has both a separate and a shared character, and the monarchy has also thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution, although it has often been called ''British'' since this time (in both legal and common language) for reasons historical, political, and of convenience. On all matters of the Jamaican state, the monarch is advised solely by Jamaican [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]].<ref name=Buck2>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4924.asp |title=Buckingham Palace: Queen and Commonwealth: Jamaica: The Queen's role in Jamaica |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-02-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120071400/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4924.asp |archivedate=20 January 2016 }}</ref> and, effective with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962, no British or other realm government can advise the monarch on matters pertinent to Jamaica.

Given these arrangements, it is considered impossible for the monarch of Jamaica to receive an ambassador from, or send an ambassador to, any country of which he or she is also monarch; essentially sending an ambassador to him or herself. Instead, the practice of sending [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioners]] developed, wherein an individual is sent to be a representative in one realm of the government in another.

===Title and style===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The shared and domestic aspects of the Crown are also highlighted in the sovereign's Jamaican title, currently ''Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Jamaica and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth''. The sovereign's role specifically as Queen of Jamaica, as well as her status as monarch of other nations, is communicated by mentioning Jamaica separately from, but along with, the Queen's other lands. Typically, the sovereign is styled ''Queen of Jamaica'', and is addressed as such when in Jamaica or performing duties on behalf of Jamaica abroad.

===Finance===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The sovereign only draws from Jamaican coffers for support in the performance of her duties when in Jamaica or acting as Queen of Jamaica abroad; Jamaicans do not pay any money to the Queen, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside Jamaica. This applies equally to other members of the royal family. Normally, tax dollars pay only for the costs associated with the Governor-General in the exercise of the powers of the Crown, including travel, security, residences, offices, ceremonies, and the like.

===Succession===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
{{Further|Succession to the Jamaican throne}}
[[File:Charles, Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], is the [[heir apparent]] to the Jamaican throne.]]

Succession is by [[primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]] governed by the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement, 1701]], and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights, 1689]]. This legislation limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-[[adoption|adopted]]), legitimate descendants of [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a [[Roman Catholic]], nor married to one, and must be in communion with the [[Church of England]] upon ascending the throne. Though these constitutional laws, as they apply to Jamaica, still lie within the control of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]], via adopting the Statute of Westminster both the United Kingdom and Jamaica agreed not to change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies identically in all the other realms, and which has been likened to a [[treaty]] amongst these countries.<ref>Justice Rouleau in a [[O'Donohue v. Canada|2003 court ruling]] wrote that "Union under the&nbsp;... Crown together with other Commonwealth countries [is a] constitutional principle". [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii41404/2003canlii41404.html O’Donohue v. Canada, 2003 CanLII 41404 (ON S.C.)]</ref> Thus, Jamaica's line of succession remains identical to [[Succession to the British Throne|that of the United Kingdom]].

Upon a ''[[demise of the Crown]]'' (the death or abdication of a sovereign) it is customary for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly [[Proclamation|proclaimed]] by the Governor-General. Regardless of any proclamations, the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony; hence arises the phrase "[[The king is dead, long live the king!]]" Following an appropriate period of [[mourning]], the monarch is also [[coronation of the British monarch|crowned]] in the United Kingdom, though this ritual is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne. All incumbent [[viceroy]]s, judges, [[National Union of Public Workers|civil servants]], legislators, military officers, etc., are not affected by the death of the monarch. After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death. Monarchs are not allowed to unilaterally abdicate; the only monarch to abdicate, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], did so before Jamaica was independent, and, even then, only with the authorization of specials [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] in the [[British Dominions|Dominions]].

==Personification of the state==
[[File:Royal Standard of Jamaica.svg|thumb|right|[[Queen's Personal Jamaican Flag|Royal Standard of Jamaica]]]]
{{Further|The Crown}}

Since the independence of Jamaica, the sovereign's role as monarch of Jamaica has been recognised and promoted as separate to his or her position as monarch of the United Kingdom.<ref name="Buck1" /> From the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II's reign onwards, royal symbols in Jamaica were altered or new ones created to make them distinctly Jamaican, such as the augmentation of the [[Coat of arms of Jamaica|Royal Arms of Jamaica]] in 1962 and [[Queen's Personal Jamaican Flag|Queen's Royal Standard for Jamaica]], created in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/jm_qe2.html |title=Flags of the World: Flag of Queen Elizabeth II in Jamaica |publisher=Crwflags.com |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> Today the sovereign is regarded as the personification, or legal personality, of the Jamaican [[Sovereign state|state]]. Therefore, the state is referred to as ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Jamaica''; for example, if a lawsuit is filed against the government, the respondent is formally described as ''Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Jamaica'', or simply ''[[Queen regnant|Regina]]''. As such, the monarch is the owner of all state lands (called ''[[Crown land]]''), buildings and equipment (called ''Crown held property''), state owned companies (called ''[[Crown Corporation]]s''), and the [[copyright]] for all government publications (called ''[[Crown copyright]]''), as well as guardianship of foster children (called ''[[Crown ward]]s''), in his or her position as sovereign, and not as an individual. Government staff are also employed by the monarch, as are the Governor-General, judges, members of the [[Jamaica Defence Force]], [[police]] officers, and [[Parliament of Jamaica|parliamentarians]], who all technically work for the monarch. Many employees of the Crown were once required by law to recite an [[oath of allegiance]] to the monarch before taking their posts, in [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocation]] to the sovereign's [[Coronation]] Oath, wherein he or she promises "to govern the Peoples of&nbsp;... [Jamaica]&nbsp;... according to their respective laws and customs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html |title=The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953 |publisher=Oremus.org |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> Save for that taken by senators,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040118231528/http://www.mct.gov.jm/senate%20standing%20orders.pdf Standing Orders of the Senate of Jamaica 1964]</ref> the oaths of allegiance were altered in 2002, removing mention of the monarch.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Constitutional role==
Jamaica's constitution is made up of a variety of statutes and conventions that are either British or Jamaican in origin, which gives Jamaica a similar parliamentary system of government to the other Commonwealth realms, wherein the role of the Queen and the Governor-General is both legal and practical. The Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the Queen as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct,<ref name="Murdoch">{{cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html |title=Cox, Noel; '&#39;Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law'&#39;: Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence; Volume 9, Number 3 (September 2002) |publisher=Murdoch.edu.au |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> meaning all powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch, who is represented by the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]]{{spaced ndash}}appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]].<ref name=Const /> Most of the Queen's domestic duties are performed by this [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representative, though she is briefed through regular communications from her Jamaican ministers, and holds audience with them whenever possible.<ref name=Buck2 />

All institutions of government are said to act under the sovereign's authority; the vast powers that belong to the Crown are collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative]]. Parliamentary approval is not required for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative; moreover, the consent of the Crown must be obtained before either of the houses of parliament may even debate a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests. While the Royal Prerogative is extensive, it is not unlimited; for example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes{{spaced ndash}}such an action requires the authorization of an [[Act of Parliament]]. The government of Jamaica is also thus formally referred to as ''[[Politics of Jamaica|Her Majesty's Government]]''. Further, the constitution instructs that any change to the position of the monarch, or the monarch's representative in Jamaica, requires the consent of a two-thirds majority of each house of parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Jamaica/overview.html |title=Political Database of the Americas: Jamaica: Constitutional Overview |publisher=Pdba.georgetown.edu |date=2005-06-09 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>

When Jamaica attained fully responsible status within the Commonwealth provision for the new constitution, with effect from 6 August 1962, was made by The Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, under the West Indies Act,1962 and the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962. The Form of Oath of Allegiance set out in the First Schedule of the Order in Council, is a declaration of allegiance to "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors".<ref>[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Jamaica/jam62.html Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council 1962]</ref>

===Executive (Queen-in-Council)===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In Jamaica's constitutional system, one of the main duties of the Crown is to appoint a [[prime minister]],<ref name=Const /> who thereafter heads the [[Cabinet of Jamaica|Cabinet]] and [[Advice (constitutional)|advises the monarch and Governor-General]] on how to execute their executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs; this requirement is, unlike in other Commonwealth realms where it is a matter of [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]], constitutionally enshrined in Jamaica.<ref name=Const /> Though the monarch's power is still a part of the executive process{{spaced ndash}}the operation of the Cabinet is technically known as the ''[[Queen-in-Council]]'' (or ''Governor-in-Council''){{spaced ndash}}the advice tendered is typically binding. Since the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714, the last monarch to head the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]], the monarch ''reigns'' but does not ''rule''. This means that the monarch's role, and thereby the viceroys' role, is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate, while the Cabinet directs the use of the Royal Prerogative, which includes the privilege to declare war, maintain the [[Queen's peace]], and direct the actions of the [[Jamaica Defence Force]], as well as to [[Parliamentary session|summon and prorogue parliament]], and [[Dropping the writ|call elections]]. However, it is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, and not to any of the ministers, though it may sometimes appear that way,<ref name="Murdoch" /> and the royal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional [[constitutional crisis]] situations. There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by, or bills that require assent by, the Queen. These include signing the appointment papers of Governors-General, the confirmation of awards of [[Jamaican honours system]], and the approval of any change in her Jamaican title.

In accordance with [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], the monarch or Governor-General, to maintain the stability of government, must appoint as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the support of the [[Parliament of Jamaica|House of Representatives]]: usually the leader of the [[List of political parties in Jamaica|political party]] with a majority in that house, but also when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a [[minority government]] situation), or other scenarios in which the Governor-General's judgement about the most suitable candidate for prime minister has to be brought into play. The Governor-General also appoints to the Cabinet the other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]], who are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Representatives, and through it, to the people. The Queen is informed by her viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and other members of the [[Cabinet of Jamaica|ministry]].

Members of various executive agencies, and other officials are appointed by the Crown. The commissioning of privy councillors, [[Parliament of Jamaica|senators]], the Speaker of the Senate, [[Politics of Jamaica#Judicial branch|Supreme Court]] justices also falls under the Royal Prerogative, though these duties are specifically assigned to the Governor-General by the constitution.<ref name=Const /> [[Public inquiries]] are also commissioned by the Crown through a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]], and are called [[Royal Commission]]s.

====Foreign affairs====
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The Royal Prerogative also extends to foreign affairs: the sovereign or Governor-General negotiates and ratifies treaties, alliances, and international agreements. As with other uses of the Royal Prerogative, no parliamentary approval is required; however, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Jamaica; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The Governor-General, on behalf of the Queen, also accredits Jamaican [[High Commissioner]]s and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, the issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative, and, as such, all [[Jamaican passport]]s are issued in the monarch's name.

===Parliament (Queen-in-Parliament)===
The sovereign, along with the [[Senate of Jamaica|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of Jamaica|House of Representatives]], is one of the three components of [[Parliament of Jamaica|Parliament]],<ref name=Const /> called the ''[[Queen-in-Parliament]]''. The authority of the Crown therein is embodied in the mace for each house,<ref>[http://www.mct.gov.jm/paraphernalia.htm Jamaica Houses of Parliament: Mace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175502/http://www.mct.gov.jm/paraphernalia.htm |date=24 July 2008 }}</ref> which both bear a crown at their apex. Per the constitution, the monarch does not, however, participate in the legislative process; the viceroy does, though only in the granting of [[Royal Assent]].<ref name=Const /> Further, the constitution outlines that the Governor-General alone is responsible for summoning, [[Legislative session|proroguing]], and [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolving]] parliament,<ref name=Const /> after which the [[Writ of election|writs for a general election]] are usually [[Dropping the writ|dropped by the Governor-General]] at [[King's House, Jamaica|Government House]]. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament]], during which either the monarch or the Governor-General reads the [[Speech from the Throne]]. As the monarch and viceroy cannot enter the House of Representatives, this, as well as the bestowing of Royal Assent, takes place in the Senate chamber; Members of Parliament are summoned to these ceremonies from the Commons by the Crown's messenger, the [[Black Rod|Usher of the Black Rod]], after he knocks on the doors of the lower house that have been slammed closed on him, to symbolise the barring of the monarch from the assembly.

All laws in Jamaica are enacted only with the viceroy's granting of [[Royal Assent]]; usually done by the Governor-General, with the Broad Seal of Jamaica. Thus, all bills begin with the phrase "BE IT ENACTED by The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Representatives of Jamaica, and by the authority of the same, as follows..."<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1OC_v5vBL5UC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=BE+IT+ENACTED+by+The+Queen%27s+Most+Excellent+Majesty,+by+and+with+the+advice+and+consent+of+the+Senate+and+House+of+Representatives+of+Jamaica,+and+by+the+authority+of+the+same,+as+follows&source=bl&ots=kwv3wEg5ZM&sig=AvFWTBhfaWxpLs3av4a7ZqxVuvU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN-q-2ubzMAhUsIMAKHVfTDBQQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&q=BE%20IT%20ENACTED%20by%20The%20Queen's%20Most%20Excellent%20Majesty%2C%20by%20and%20with%20the%20advice%20and%20consent%20of%20the%20Senate%20and%20House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Jamaica%2C%20and%20by%20the%20authority%20of%20the%20same%2C%20as%20follows&f=false ''The Caribbean Court of Justice: Closing the Circle of Independence''], Duke E. Pollard, Ian Randle Publishers, 2004, page 153</ref>

===Courts (Queen-on-the-Bench)===
{{main|Judiciary of Jamaica}}

The sovereign is deemed the ''fount of justice'', and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects, known in this role as the ''[[Queen's Bench|Queen on the Bench]]''. However, he or she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name by what are termed ''Her Majesty's [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moj.gov.jm/laws/statutes/The%20Justices%20of%20the%20Peace%20Jurisdiction%20Act.pdf |title=The Justices of the Peace Jurisdiction Act |publisher=Moj.gov.jm |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign "can do no wrong"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences. Civil lawsuits against the Crown in its public capacity (that is, lawsuits against the government) are permitted; however, lawsuits against the monarch personally are not cognizable. In international cases, as a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and under established principles of [[international law]], the Queen of Jamaica is not subject to suit in foreign courts without her express consent. The sovereign, and by extension the governor-general, also exercises the ''[[Pardon|prerogative of mercy]]'',<ref name=Const /> and may pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial. In addition, the monarch also serves as a symbol of the legitimacy of courts of justice, and of their judicial authority. An image of the Queen or the [[Coat of arms of Jamaica]] is always displayed in Jamaican courtrooms.
