'''''Journeys with George''''' is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] by [[Alexandra Pelosi]] and [[Aaron Lubarsky]] that follows [[George W. Bush]] for more than a year on his campaign trail in the [[2000 United States presidential election]].

Working for [[NBC]] and as part of what she calls the "travelling [[press corps]]," Pelosi offers the only behind-the-scenes look at Bush's campaign.  With light [[journalism]], she achieves considerable access to the then-[[Governor of Texas]].
 
The film focuses on the relationship between the press and presidential candidates, the life of a traveling journalist in such a relationship, and Bush, usually in a humorous light, with less attention given to the issues. It earned six [[Emmy]] nominations including one win for Lubarsky's editing. It scored 48 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>''[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/journeys-with-george]'', Metacritic.</ref> In April 2007, it was shown on [[MSNBC]].

The last two seasons of ''[[The West Wing]]'', which follow the presidential campaigns of [[Matt Santos]] and [[Arnold Vinick]], were inspired in part by scenes in ''Journeys''.
