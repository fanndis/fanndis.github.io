During the [[Viking Age]] the area was part of [[Viken (region)|Viken]]. Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the name '''Ánslo''', and established as a [[kjobstad|''kaupstad'']] or trading place in 1048 by [[Harald Hardrada]]. The city was elevated to a [[diocese of Oslo|bishopric]] in 1070 and a capital under [[Haakon V of Norway]] around 1300. [[Personal union]]s with Denmark from [[Kalmar Union|1397 to 1523]] and again from [[Denmark–Norway|1536 to 1814]] reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|King Christian IV]], a new city was built closer to [[Akershus Fortress]] and named '''Christiania''' in the king's honour. It was established as a [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipality]] (''[[formannskapsdistrikt]]'') on 1 January 1838. The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814–1905 [[union between Sweden and Norway]]. From 1877, the city's name was spelled '''Kristiania''' in government usage, a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897. In 1925 the city, after incorporating the village retaining its former name, was renamed Oslo. In 1948 Oslo merged with [[Aker, Norway|Aker]], a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger, thus creating the modern, vastly enlarged Oslo municipality.

Oslo is the [[Economy of Norway|economic]] and [[Politics of Norway|governmental]] centre of Norway. The city is also a hub of Norwegian trade, banking, industry and shipping. It is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to many companies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is a pilot city of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Commission]] intercultural cities programme.

Oslo is considered a [[global city]] and was ranked "Beta World City" in studies carried out by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |title=GaWC – The World According to GaWC 2008 |publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> It was ranked number one in terms of quality of life among European large cities in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by ''fDi'' magazine.<ref name="fdiintelligence.com">{{cite web|author=Rachel Craig |url=http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/Europe/European-Cities-and-Regions-of-the-Future-2012-13 |title=European Cities and Regions of the Future 2012/13 |publisher=fDiIntelligence.com |date=13 February 2012 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> A survey conducted by [[ECA International]] in 2011 placed Oslo as the second most expensive city in the world for living expenses after [[Tokyo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eca-international.com/news/press_releases/7355/Sydney_rockets_up_the_list_of_the_world_s_most_expensive_cities |title=Sydney rockets up the list of the world's most expensive cities |publisher=[[ECA International]] |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003163654/http://www.eca-international.com/news/press_releases/7355/Sydney_rockets_up_the_list_of_the_world_s_most_expensive_cities |archivedate=3 October 2011 }}</ref> In 2013 Oslo tied with the Australian city of [[Melbourne]] as the fourth most expensive city in the world, according to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] (EIU)'s Worldwide Cost of Living study.<ref>{{cite news|title=The world's most expensive cities|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2014/feb/14/most-expensive-cities|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 February 2014|author=George Arnett|author2=Chris Michael}}</ref> Oslo was ranked as the 24th most liveable city in the world by Monocle magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/quality-of-life-survey-top-25-cities-2019/|title=Quality of Life Survey: top 25 cities, 2019 - Film|website=Monocle}}</ref>

To the north and east, wide forested hills (''Marka'') rise above the city giving the location the shape of a giant [[amphitheatre]]. The urban [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipality]] (''bykommune'') of Oslo and county [''[[Counties of Norway|fylke]]''] of Oslo are two parts of the same entity, making Oslo the only city in Norway where two administrative levels are integrated.

The city of Oslo was established as a municipality on 3 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). It was separated from the county of [[Akershus]] to become a county of its own in 1842. The rural municipality of [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] was merged with Oslo on 1 January 1948 (and simultaneously transferred from Akershus county to Oslo county). Furthermore, Oslo shares several important functions with Akershus county.

== Name and seal==
After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|King Christian IV]], a new city was built closer to [[Akershus Fortress]] and named Christiania in the king's honour. The old site east of the Aker river was not abandoned however and the village of Oslo remained as a suburb outside the city gates. The suburb called Oslo was eventually included in the city proper. In 1925 the name of the suburb was transferred to the whole city, while the suburb was renamed [[Old Town, Oslo|"Gamlebyen" (literally "the Old town")]] to avoid confusion.<ref>Aftenposten, 12 October 2014, p. 15.</ref><ref name=Osloby>[http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Han-har-kartlagt-Christianias-karthistorie-7810898.html Han har kartlagt Christianias karthistorie], ''Osloby'', 8 December 2014.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://snl.no/Oslo/historie | title=Oslo – historie| date=3 August 2018}}</ref> The Old Town is an area within the administrative district [[Gamle Oslo]].

=== Toponymy ===
{{Hatnote|For full article, see [[History of Oslo's name]]}}
<!-- [[File:Oslo Royal Palace left.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] is the home of the [[Norwegian royal family]]]] -->

The origin of the name ''Oslo'' has been the subject of much debate. It is certainly derived from [[Old Norse]] and was — in all probability — originally the name of a large farm at [[Bjørvika]], but the meaning of that name is disputed. Modern linguists generally interpret the original ''Óslo'', ''Áslo'' or ''Ánslo'' as either "Meadow at the Foot of a Hill" or "Meadow Consecrated to the [[Æsir|Gods]]", with both considered equally likely.<ref>Cf. Bjorvand, Harald (2008). "Oslo." In: ''Namn och bygd. Tidskrift för nordisk ortnamnsforskning'', vol. 96, 2008.</ref>

Erroneously, it was once assumed that ''Oslo'' meant "the mouth of the Lo river", a supposed previous name for the [[Alnaelva|river Alna]]. However, not only has no evidence been found of a river "Lo" predating the work where [[Peder Claussøn Friis]] first proposed this etymology, but the very name is ungrammatical in Norwegian: the correct form would have been ''Loaros'' (cf. [[Nidaros]]).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Peder_Clauss%C3%B8n_Friis/utdypning |title=Peder Claussøn Friis |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |language=Norwegian |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |last=Jørgensen |first=Jon G. |authorlink=Jon Gunnar Jørgensen |location=Oslo |editor=Helle, Knut |editor-link=Knut Helle|date=28 September 2014 }}</ref> The name ''Lo'' is now believed to be a [[back-formation]] arrived at by Friis in support of his [idea about] etymology for ''Oslo''.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/Alna/elv_i_Oslo "Alna – elv i Oslo"], In: ''Store Norske Leksikon'' (in Norwegian).</ref>

=== Seal ===
{{Main|Seal of Oslo}}
Oslo is one of very few cities in Norway, besides [[Bergen]] and [[Tønsberg]], that does not have a formal [[coat of arms]], but which uses a city seal instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslo.kommune.no/the_city_of_oslo/government/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174658/http://www.oslo.kommune.no/the_city_of_oslo/government/|url-status=dead|title=Government – Oslo kommune|archivedate=14 October 2014}}</ref> The seal of Oslo shows the city's [[patron saint]], [[Hallvard Vebjørnsson|St. Hallvard]], with his attributes, the [[millstone]] and [[arrow]]s, with a naked woman at his feet. He is seated on a throne with lion decorations, which at the time was also commonly used by the [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Norwegian kings]].<ref name="Heraldry">{{cite web |url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/o/oslo.htm |title=Oslo byvåpen |last=Heraldry of the World |work=ngw.nl |year=2010 |accessdate=5 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728135507/http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/o/oslo.htm |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Other names===
Oslo has various nicknames and names in other languages. The city is sometimes known under the nickname "The Tiger City" ({{lang-no|Tigerstaden}}), probably inspired by an 1870 poem by [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] which referenced then-Christiania in central Oslo. The nickname is mostly used by Norwegians from out of town, and rarely by people from the Oslo region.<ref>"Fra Språkrøret: Hvorfor kaller vi Oslo for Tigerstaden?," ''St. Hallvard'', 3/1991, p. 61</ref> 

== History ==
{{Oslo major events timeline}}
During the [[Viking Age]] the area that includes modern Oslo was located in [[Viken, Norway|Viken]], the northernmost province of [[Denmark]]. Control over the area shifted between Danish and Norwegian kings in the Middle Ages, and Denmark continued to claim the area until 1241.

According to the Norse [[saga]]s, Oslo was founded around 1049 by [[Harald Hardrada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g190479-s1/Oslo:Norway:Inside.html |title=Inside Oslo : Inside |publisher=TripAdvisor |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> Recent archaeological research however has uncovered Christian burials which can be dated to prior to AD 1000, evidence of a preceding urban settlement.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This called for the celebration of Oslo's millennium in 2000.

It has been regarded as the capital city since the reign of [[Haakon V of Norway]] (1299–1319), the first king to reside permanently in the city. He also started the construction of the [[Akershus Fortress]] and the Oslo [[Kongsgård]]. A century later, Norway was the weaker part in a [[personal union]] with Denmark, and Oslo's role was reduced to that of provincial administrative centre, with the monarchs residing in [[Copenhagen]]. The fact that the [[University of Oslo]] was founded as late as 1811 had an adverse effect on the development of the nation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Michael|date=July 1965|title=The growth of population in Norway 1735–1855|journal=Scandinavian Economic History Review|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=97–142|doi=10.1080/03585522.1965.10414366|issn=0358-5522}}</ref>

Oslo was destroyed several times by fire, and after the fourteenth calamity, in 1624, [[Christian IV of Denmark]] and Norway ordered it rebuilt at a new site across the bay, near Akershus Castle and given the name ''Christiania''. Long before this, Christiania had started to establish its stature as a [[Market town|centre of commerce]] and culture in Norway. The part of the city built starting in 1624 is now often called ''[[Kvadraturen (Oslo)|Kvadraturen]]'' because of its orthogonal layout in regular, square blocks.<ref>{{ cite book| year= 2000 | title = Oslo byleksikon | isbn = 9788257308155 | place= Oslo | publisher = Kunnskapsforl. | url = http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2009011300087 }}</ref> The last [[Black Death]] outbreak in Oslo occurred in 1654.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnms.no/index.php?seks_id=110569&a=1 |title=DNMS.NO : Michael: 2005 : 03/2005 : Book review: Black Death and hard facts |publisher=Norwegian Medical Society |author=Øivind Larsen |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref> In 1814 Christiania once more became a real capital when the union with Denmark was dissolved.

Many landmarks were built in the 19th century, including the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] (1825–1848), [[Storting building]] (the Parliament) (1861–1866), the [[University of Oslo|University]], [[National Theatre (Oslo)|National Theatre]] and the [[Oslo Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]]. Among the world-famous artists who lived here during this period were [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Knut Hamsun]] (the latter was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature). In 1850, Christiania also overtook [[Bergen]] and became the most populous city in the country. In 1877 the city was renamed ''Kristiania''. The original name of Oslo [[Geographical renaming|was restored]] in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/tobias/tobiasartikler/tob2001-1_01.htm |title=Oslo kommune byarkivet (Oslo City Archives) |publisher=Oslo Kommune |author=Bård Alsvik |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref>

=== 1000–1600 ===
{{Main|Old Town, Oslo}}
Under the reign of [[Olaf III of Norway]], Oslo became a cultural centre for [[Eastern Norway]]. [[Hallvard Vebjørnsson]] became the city's [[patron saint]] and is depicted on the city's seal.

In 1174, [[Hovedøya Abbey]] was built. The churches and abbeys became major owners of large tracts of land, which proved important for the city's economic development, especially before the Black Death.

On 25 July 1197, [[Sverre of Norway]] and his soldiers attacked Oslo from [[Hovedøya]].<ref name="AttackFromHovedøya">{{cite news|author1=Leif Gjerland|title=Kongen som angrep Oslo fra Hovedøya|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=25 July 2014|author1-link=Leif Gjerland}}</ref>

During the [[Middle Ages]], Oslo reached its heights in the reign of [[Haakon V of Norway]]. He started building Akershus Fortress and was also the first king to reside permanently in the city, which helped to make Oslo the capital of Norway.

In the end of the 12th century, [[Hanseatic League]] traders from [[Rostock]] moved into the city and gained major influence in the city. The Black Death came to Norway in 1349 and, like other cities in Europe, the city suffered greatly. The churches' earnings from their land also dropped so much that the Hanseatic traders dominated the city's foreign trade in the 15th century.

=== 17th century ===
Over the years, fire destroyed major parts of the city many times, as many of the city's buildings were built entirely of wood. After the last fire in 1624, which lasted for three days, [[Christian IV of Denmark]] decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again. His men built a network of roads in Akershagen near Akershus Castle. He demanded that all citizens should move their shops and workplaces to the newly built city Christiania, named as an honor to the king.

The transformation of the city went slowly for the first hundred years. Outside the city, near [[Vaterland, Norway|Vaterland]] and [[Grønland, Oslo|Grønland]] near [[Old Town, Oslo]], a new, unmanaged part of the city grew up filled with citizens of low class status.

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, after the [[Great Northern War]], the city's economy boomed with shipbuilding and trade. The strong economy transformed Christiania into a trading port.

=== 19th century ===
In 1814 the former provincial town of Christiania became the capital of the independent Kingdom of Norway, in a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]]. Several state institutions were established and the city's role as a capital initiated a period of rapidly increasing population. The government of this new state needed buildings for its expanding administration and institutions. Several important buildings were erected – The [[Bank of Norway]] (1828), the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] (1848), and the [[Storting]] (1866). Large areas of the surrounding [[Aker, Norway|Aker municipality]] were incorporated in 1839, 1859 an 1878. The 1859 expansion included [[Grünerløkka]], [[Grønland, Oslo|Grønland]] and [[Old Town, Oslo|Oslo]]. At that time the area called ''Oslo'' (now ''Gamlebyen'' or Old Town) was a village or suburb outside the city borders east of Aker river.<ref>Boye, Else: ''Christiania 1814-1905''. Oslo: Grøndahl, 1976.</ref> The population increased from approximately 10 000 in 1814 to 230 000 in 1900. Christiania expanded its industry from 1840, most importantly around [[Akerselva]].  There was a spectacular building boom during the last decades of the 19th century, with many new apartment buildings and renewal of the city center, but the boom collapsed in 1899.

=== 1900–present ===
In 1948, Oslo merged with [[Aker, Norway|Aker]], a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger, thus creating the modern, vastly enlarged Oslo municipality. At the time, Aker was a mostly affluent, green suburban community, and the merger was unpopular in Aker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/oslo/kommunen-som-ble-slukt-av-oslo-1.1080868|title=Da Høyre kjempet mot kommunesammenslåing|website=www.dagsavisen.no}}</ref>

The municipality developed new areas such as [[Ullevål Hageby|Ullevål garden city]] (1918–1926) and [[Torshov]] (1917–1925). [[Oslo City Hall|City Hall]] was constructed in the former slum area of [[Vika, Oslo|Vika]] from 1931 to 1950. The municipality of [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] was incorporated into Oslo in 1948, and suburbs were developed, such as [[Lambertseter]] (from 1951). [[Aker Brygge]] was constructed on the site of the former [[shipyard]] [[Aker ASA|Akers Mekaniske Verksted]], from 1982 to 1998.

The city and municipality used the name ''Kristiania'' until 1 January 1925 when the name changed to ''Oslo''. Oslo was the name of an eastern suburb - it had been the site of the city centre, until the devastating 1624 fire. King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] ordered a new city built with his own name; Oslo remained a poor suburb outside the city border. In the early-20th century, Norwegians argued that a name memorialising a Danish king was inappropriate as the name of the capital of Norway, which became fully independent in 1905.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/xl/da-oslo-ble-oslo-1.13150638|title= Da Oslo ble Oslo|last= NRK|work= NRK|access-date= 2018-05-05|language= nb-NO}}</ref>

In the [[2011 Norway attacks|2011 Norway terror attacks]], Oslo was hit by a bomb blast that ripped through the [[Regjeringskvartalet|Government quarter]], damaging several buildings including the building that houses the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Norway)|Office of the Prime Minister]]. Eight people died in the bomb attack.

[[File:Tettstedet Oslo 2005.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A map of the urban areas of Oslo in 2005. The grey area in the middle indicates Oslo's city centre.]]
Oslo occupies an arc of land at the northernmost end of the [[Oslofjord]]. The [[fjord]], which is nearly bisected by the [[Nesodden]] peninsula opposite Oslo, lies to the south; in all other directions Oslo is surrounded by green hills and mountains. There are 40 islands within the city limits, the largest being [[Malmøya]] ({{convert|0.56|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and scores more around the Oslofjord. Oslo has 343 lakes, the largest being Maridalsvannet ({{convert|3.91|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}). This is also a main source of drinking water for large parts of Oslo.

Although [[Eastern Norway]] has a number of rivers, none of these flow into the ocean at Oslo. Instead Oslo has two smaller rivers: [[Akerselva]] (draining Maridalsvannet, which flows into the fjord in [[Bjørvika]]), and [[Alna River|Alna]]. The waterfalls in Akerselva gave power to some of the first modern industry of Norway in the 1840s. Later in the century, the river became the symbol of the stable and consistent economic and social divide of the city into [[East End and West End of Oslo|an East End and a West End]]; the labourers' neighbourhoods lie on both sides of the river, and the divide in reality follows Uelands street a bit further west. River Alna flows through Groruddalen, Oslo's major suburb and industrial area. The highest point is Kirkeberget, at {{convert|629|m}}. Although the city's population is small compared to most European capitals, it occupies an unusually large land area, of which two-thirds are [[protected area]]s of forests, hills and lakes. Its boundaries encompass many [[Parks and open spaces in Oslo|parks and open areas]], giving it an airy and green appearance. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Climate ===

Due to oceanic influences, winters are less cold than more continental areas at same latitude, but still cold enough to be continental.  Oslo has a significant amount of rainfall during the year. This is true even for the driest month.<ref name="en.climate-data.org"/> Because of the city's northern latitude, daylight varies greatly, from more than 18 hours in midsummer, when it never gets completely dark at night (no darker than [[nautical twilight]]), to around 6 hours in midwinter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/norway/oslo|title=Sun & moon times today, Oslo, Norway|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref> Oslo sits right on the border between [[hardiness zones]] 7a and 7b.

== Parks and recreation areas ==
{{Main|Parks and open spaces in Oslo}}
[[File:Frogner Park with Vigeland Sculpture Arrangement.jpg|thumb|[[Frogner Park]]]]
Oslo has many parks and green areas within the city core, as well as outside it.
* [[Frogner Park]] is a large park located a few minutes' walk away from the city centre. This is the biggest and best-known park in Norway, with a large collection of sculptures by [[Gustav Vigeland]].
* [[Bygdøy]] is a large green area, commonly called the Museum Peninsula of Oslo. The area is surrounded by the sea and is one of the most expensive districts in Norway.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* [[Ekebergparken Sculpture Park]] is a sculpture park and a national heritage park with a panoramic view of the city at [[Ekeberg]] in the southeast of the city.
* [[St. Hanshaugen Park]] is an old public park on a high hill in central Oslo. "St. Hanshaugen" is also the name of the surrounding neighbourhood as well as the larger administrative district (borough) that includes major parts of central Oslo.<ref>[http://www.friluftsetaten.oslo.kommune.no/parker_friomrader/parker/st_hanshaugen/ City of Oslo parks] {{in lang|no}}</ref>
* [[Tøyen Park]] stretches out behind the [[Munch Museum]], and is a vast, grassy expanse. In the north, there is a lookout point known as Ola Narr. The Tøyen area also includes the [[University Botanical Garden (Oslo)|Botanical Garden]] and Museum belonging to the University of Oslo.<ref>[http://www.friluftsetaten.oslo.kommune.no/parker_friomrader/parker/toyen_kulturpark/ City of Oslo parks] {{in lang|no}}</ref>
Oslo (with neighbouring Sandvika-Asker) is built in a horseshoe shape on the shores of the Oslofjord and limited in most directions by hills and forests. As a result, any point within the city is relatively close to the forest. There are two major forests bordering the city: ''[[Østmarka]]'' (literally "Eastern Forest", on the eastern perimeter of the city), and the very large ''[[Nordmarka]]'' (literally "Northern Forest", stretching from the northern perimeter of the city deep into the hinterland).
* [[Sognsvann]] is a lake in Oslomarka, located at the land border, just north of Oslo. Sognsvann was drinking water for Oslo from 1876 to 1967.
The lake's altitude above sea level is 183 metres. The water is in a popular hiking area. Near the water itself, it is great for barbecues, swimming, beach volleyball and other activities.

The municipality operates eight public swimming pools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idrettsetaten.oslo.kommune.no/oslobadene/ |title=Municipal swimming pools |publisher=Idrettsetaten.oslo.kommune.no |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> [[Tøyenbadet]] is the largest indoor swimming facility in Oslo and one of the few pools in Norway offering a 50-metre main pool. Another in that size is the outdoor pool [[Frognerbadet]].

Oslo's cityscape is being redeveloped as a modern city with various access-points, an extensive metro-system with a new financial district and a cultural city. In 2008, an exhibition was held in London presenting the award-winning [[Oslo Opera House]], the urban regeneration scheme of Oslo's seafront, [[Munch/Stenersen]] and the new Deichman Library. Most of the buildings in the city and in neighbouring communities are low in height with only the [[Oslo Plaza|Plaza]], [[Posthuset (building)|Posthuset]] and the highrises at Bjørvika considerably taller.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2011/06/23/oslos-developing-waterfront-in-a-photo-collage/|title=Oslo's developing waterfront, in a photo collage|publisher=}}</ref>

=== Architecture ===
{{See also|Architecture of Norway}}
[[File:Fjordbyen.gif|left|thumb|[[Fjordbyen]] is a large construction project in the seaside of central Oslo, stretching from [[Bygdøy]] in the west to [[Ormøya]] in the east. Some areas include: [[Bjørvika]], [[Aker brygge]], [[Tjuvholmen]], the [[Oslo Central Station|cental station]] area]]
Oslo's architecture is very diverse. The architect [[Carl Frederik Stanley]] (1769–1805), who was educated in [[Copenhagen]], spent some years in Norway around the turn of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major achievement was the renovation of the [[Oslo Katedralskole]], completed in 1800.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oslotouristinformation.com/art|title=OSLO TOURIST GUIDE — A hive of Art & Architecture|website=OSLO TOURIST GUIDE|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-09}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semicircular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at [[Norsk Folkemuseum]] as a national monument.

When Christiania was made capital of Norway in 1814, there were practically no buildings suitable for the many new government institutions. An ambitious building program was initiated, but realised very slowly because of economic constraints. The first major undertaking was the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]], designed by [[Hans Linstow]] and built between 1824 and 1848. Linstow also planned [[Karl Johans gate]], the avenue connecting the Palace and the city, with a monumental square halfway to be surrounded by buildings for [[Oslo University|University]], the [[Stortinget|Parliament]] (Storting) and other institutions. Only the university buildings were realised according to this plan. [[Christian Heinrich Grosch]], one of the first architects educated completely within Norway, designed the original building for the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] (1826–1828), the local branch of the [[Bank of Norway]] (1828), [[Christiania Theatre]] (1836–1837), and the first campus for the [[University of Oslo]] (1841–1856). For the university buildings, he sought the assistance of the renowned German architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. German architectural influence persisted in Norway, and many wooden buildings followed the principles of [[Neoclassicism]]. In Oslo, the German architect [[Alexis de Chateauneuf]] designed [[Trefoldighetskirken (Oslo)|Trefoldighetskirken]], the first neo-gothic church, completed by von Hanno in 1858.

A number of landmark buildings, particularly in Oslo, were built in the [[functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] style (better known in the US and Britain as Modernist), the first being [[Skansen]] restaurant (1925–1927) by [[Lars Backer]], demolished in 1970. Backer also designed the restaurant at Ekeberg, which opened in 1929. [[Kunstnernes Hus]] art gallery by [[Gudolf Blakstad]] and [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]] (1930) still shows the influence of the preceding classicist trend of the 1920s. The redevelopment of [[Gardermoen|Oslo Airport]] (by the Aviaplan consortium) at Gardermoen, which opened in 1998, was Norway's largest construction project to date.

Oslo is the capital of Norway, and as such is the seat of Norway's national government. Most government offices, including that of the [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]], are gathered at ''Regjeringskvartalet'', a cluster of buildings close to the national Parliament, the [[Parliament of Norway|Storting]].

Constituting both a municipality and a county of Norway, the city of Oslo is represented in the Storting by nineteen members of parliament. The [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] is the most represented party in Oslo with six members, the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] has five, the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Norway|Liberals]] and the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] have two each; the [[Green Party (Norway)|Green Party]] and the [[Red Party (Norway)|Red Party]] have one each.

The combined municipality and county of Oslo has had a [[parliamentary system]] of government since 1986. The supreme authority of the city is the City Council (''Bystyret''), which  has 59 seats. Representatives are popularly elected every four years. The City Council has five [[standing committees]], each having its own areas of responsibility. The largest parties in the City Council after the 2015-elections are the Labour Party and the Conservatives, with 20 and 19 representatives respectively.

=== 2015 elections ===
{{multiple image |align=left |image1=Stortinget, Oslo, Norway.jpg |width1=200 |caption1=[[Parliament of Norway]] |width2=200 |caption2=[[Oslo City Hall]] |image2=Oslo rådhus (by alexao).jpg}}
The [[Mayor of Oslo]] is the head of the City Council and the highest ranking representative of the city. This used to be the most powerful political position in Oslo, but following the implementation of parliamentarism, the mayor has had more of a ceremonial role, similar to that of the President of the Storting at the national level. The Mayor of Oslo is [[Marianne Borgen]].

Since the local elections of 2015, the [[Local government|city government]] has been a coalition of the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Socialist Left. Based mostly on support from the Red Party, the coalition maintains a workable majority in the City Council. Following the local elections of 2019, the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] coalition remained in government.

The [[Governing Mayor of Oslo]] is the head of the City government. The post was created with the implementation of parliamentarism in Oslo and is similar to the role of the prime minister at the national level. The governing mayor is [[Raymond Johansen]].<ref>[https://www.nrk.no/valg/2019/resultat/nb/sted/0301 "Valgresultat for Oslo kommune"], ''Nrk Valg'', 2019</ref>
