As First Lady, she was active in social policy and set a precedent as a politically active presidential spouse.<ref name="Time"/> Ford also served as the [[Second Lady of the United States]] from 1973 to 1974.

Throughout her husband's term in office, she maintained high approval ratings despite opposition from some conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] who objected to her more moderate and liberal positions on social issues. Ford was noted for raising breast cancer awareness following her 1974 [[mastectomy]]. In addition, she was a passionate supporter of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). As a supporter of [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]] and a leader in the [[Feminism in the United States|women's rights movement]], she gained fame as one of the most candid first ladies in history, commenting on every hot-button issue of the time, including [[feminism]], [[Equal pay for women|equal pay]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], [[sex]], [[Drugs in the United States|drugs]], [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]], and [[gun control]]. She also raised awareness of [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] when in the 1970s, she announced her long-running battle with [[alcoholism]] and [[substance abuse]], being the first First Lady to do so.

Following her White House years, she continued to lobby for the ERA and remained active in the feminist movement. She was the founder, and served as the first chair of the board of directors, of the [[Betty Ford Center]] for substance abuse and addiction. She was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] (co-presentation with her husband on October 21, 1998) and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] (presented 1991 by [[George H. W. Bush]]).

==Early life and career==
[[File:Betty Bloomer at age 18, 1936.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Betty Bloomer at age 18, 1936]]
Ford was born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in 1918 in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the third child and only daughter of Hortense (''née'' Neahr; 1884 – 1948) and William Stephenson Bloomer, Sr. (1874 – 1934), who was a traveling salesman for Royal Rubber Co.<ref name="FLbiogs">{{cite web|author=Staff |date= n.d.|url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=39|title=First Lady Biography&nbsp;— Betty Ford|publisher=[[First Ladies National Historic Site|National First Ladies' Library]]|accessdate=July 10, 2011}}</ref> She was called Betty as a child.

Hortense and William married on November 9, 1904, in Chicago. Betty's two older brothers were Robert (d. 1971) and William Jr. After the family lived briefly in [[Denver]], Colorado, she grew up in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], where she graduated from [[Central High School (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Central High School]].<ref name="Ford 1978 p22">Ford, Betty; [[Chris Chase|Chase, Chris]] (1978). ''The Times of My Life''. p. 22.</ref>

At the age of 11, she began modeling clothes and teaching children popular dances, such as the [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]], [[waltz]], and [[Big Apple (dance)|big apple]], to earn money in the wake of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. She worked with children with [[disabilities]] at the Mary Free Bed Home for Crippled Children. She studied dance at the Calla Travis Dance Studio, graduating in 1935.<ref name="FLbiogs"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business2community.com/trends-news/betty-ford-dies-at-age-93-a-look-back-on-the-former-first-lady-042973|title=Betty Ford Dies at Age 93; A Look Back on the Former First Lady|work=Business 2 Community|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605142350/http://www.business2community.com/trends-news/betty-ford-dies-at-age-93-a-look-back-on-the-former-first-lady-042973|archivedate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

When Bloomer was age 16, her father died of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] in the family's garage while working under their car, despite the garage doors being open.<ref>Ford, Betty; [[Chris Chase|Chase, Chris]] (1978). ''The Times of My Life''. p. 21.</ref><ref name="washingtonpost">Tucker, Neely (December 29, 2006).

Retrieved July 16, 2011.</ref> He died the day before his 60th birthday.<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

In 1936, after graduating from high school, Bloomer proposed continuing her study of dance in New York City, but her mother refused.{{why|date=March 2018}}  She instead attended the [[American Dance Festival|Bennington School of Dance]] in [[Bennington, Vermont]], for two summers, where she studied under director [[Martha Hill]] with choreographers [[Martha Graham]] and [[Hanya Holm]]. After being accepted by Graham as a student, Bloomer moved to New York City to live in its [[Manhattan]]'s [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood; she worked as a fashion model for the [[John Robert Powers]] firm in order to finance her dance studies. She joined Graham's auxiliary troupe and eventually performed with the [[Martha Graham Dance Company|company]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City.<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

Bloomer's mother was opposed to her pursuing a career and insisted that she return home, and, as a compromise, they agreed that Bloomer would return home for six months and, if she still wanted to return to New York City at the end of that time, her mother would not protest further. Bloomer became immersed in her life in Grand Rapids and did not return to New York. Her mother remarried, to family friend and neighbor Arthur Meigs Goodwin, and Bloomer lived with them. She got a job as assistant to the fashion coordinator for [[Herpolsheimer's]], a local [[department store]]. She also organized her own dance group and taught dance at various sites in Grand Rapids.<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

==Marriages and family==
[[File:Gerald R. Ford, Jr., and Betty Ford following their marriage.jpg|left|thumb|Betty and Gerald Ford on their wedding day, 1948]]
In 1942, Elizabeth Bloomer married William G. Warren,<ref name="Ford 1978 p22"/> who worked for his father in insurance sales, and whom she had known since she was 12. William Warren began selling insurance for another company shortly after their marriage. He later worked for Continental Can Co., and after that for Widdicomb Furniture. The couple moved frequently because of his work. At one point, they lived in [[Toledo, Ohio]], where Elizabeth was employed at the department store [[Lasalle & Koch]] as a demonstrator, a job that entailed being a model and saleswoman. She worked a production line for a frozen-food company in [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton, New York]]. When they returned to Grand Rapids, she worked again at Herpolsheimer's, this time as ''the'' fashion coordinator.<ref>Ford, Betty; [[Chris Chase|Chase, Chris]] (1978). ''The Times of My Life''. pp. 39, 41.</ref> Warren was an [[alcoholic]] and in poor health. Just after Betty decided to file for divorce, he went into a [[coma]]. She took care of him for another two years as he convalesced, at his family's home. She stayed upstairs while he was nursed downstairs. After he recovered, they were divorced on September 22, 1947.<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

On October 15, 1948, Elizabeth married [[Gerald Ford]], a lawyer and World War II veteran, at Grace [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], in Grand Rapids. Gerald Ford was then campaigning for what would be his first of thirteen terms as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. In the first of adjustments for politics, he asked her to delay the wedding until shortly before the elections because, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported, "Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer."<ref name="FLbiogs"/><ref name="NYTHoward">Abstract; subscription required <!--{{subscription required|date=July 2011}} - didn't use template as it doesn't style correctly for this usage--> for full article) [[Jane Howard (journalist)|Jane Howard]] (December 8, 1974).

Gerald and Elizabeth Ford had four children together:  Michael Gerald Ford (born 1950), [[John Gardner Ford]] (nicknamed Jack; born 1952), [[Steven Ford|Steven Meigs Ford]] (born 1956), and [[Susan Ford|Susan Elizabeth Ford]] (born 1957).<ref name="NYTobit"/>  Betty Ford never spanked or hit her children, believing that there were better, more constructive ways to deal with discipline and punishment.<ref>{{cite book | author = Ashley, Jeffrey S. | title = Betty Ford: A Symbol of Strength | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Nova Publishers]] | isbn = 978-1-59033-407-2 | page = 52}}</ref>

The Fords moved to the [[Virginia]] suburbs of Washington, D.C., and lived there for twenty-five years. Gerald Ford rose to become the highest-ranking Republican in the House. After [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned as Vice President in 1973, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Gerald Ford to the position. He succeeded to the presidency in 1974, upon Nixon's resignation in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/timeline.html|title=The Watergate Story |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

The Fords, who were married 58 years until Gerald's death, were among the more openly affectionate First Couples in United States history. Neither was shy about their mutual love and equal respect, and they were known to have a strong personal and political partnership.<ref name="PBS">Video documentary (May 16, 2009).

==First Lady of the United States==

===National influence and candor===
[[Image:Ford sworn-in.jpg|right|thumb|Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] is sworn in as the 38th President of the United States by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] in the [[East Room]] at the [[White House]] as Betty Ford looks on.]]
Reporters wondered what kind of first lady Ford would be, as they thought her predecessor, [[Pat Nixon]], as noted by one reporter, to be the "most disciplined, composed first lady in history."<ref>*{{cite book | author = Anthony, Carl Sferrazza | title = First Ladies: The Saga of the Presidents' Wives and Their Power; 1961&ndash;1990 (Volume II) | year = 1991 | publisher = [[William Morrow and Company]] | location = New York City | isbn = 978-0-688-10562-4 | page = [https://archive.org/details/firstladiessaga100anth/page/220 220] | url = https://archive.org/details/firstladiessaga100anth/page/220 }}</ref> In the opinion of ''The New York Times'' and several presidential historians, "Mrs. Ford's impact on American culture may be far wider and more lasting than that of her husband, who served a mere 896 days, much of it spent trying to restore the dignity of the office of the president."<ref>[https://archive.today/20130129153940/http://www.nationaljournal.com/whitehouse/betty-ford-s-legacy-wide-and-lasting-20110709 "Betty Ford's Legacy Wide and Lasting"], ''National Journal,'' July 9, 2011</ref>

Steinhauer of ''The New York Times'' described Ford as "a product and symbol of the cultural and political times&nbsp;— doing [[Bump (dance)|the Bump]] dance along the corridors of the White House, donning a [[mood ring]], chatting on her [[CB radio]] with the handle First Mama&nbsp;— a housewife who argued passionately for equal rights for women, a mother of four who mused about drugs, abortion and premarital sex aloud and without regret."<ref name="nytimes2006">Steinhauer, Jennifer (December 31, 2006).

Retrieved July 16, 2011.</ref> In 1975, in an interview with ''[[McCall's]]'', Ford said that she was asked just about everything, except for how often she and the president had sex. "And if they'd asked me that I would have told them," she said, adding that her response would be, "As often as possible."<ref name="washingtonpost" />

She was open about the benefits of [[psychiatric treatment]], and spoke understandingly about [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] use and [[premarital sex]]. The new First Lady noted during a televised White House tour that she and the President shared the same bed. Ford was a guest on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and, in a characteristically candid interview, she discussed how she would counsel her daughter if she was having an [[affair]]. She said she "would not be surprised" by that,<ref name="millercenter">{{cite web | author = Staff | date = n.d. | title = Elizabeth "Betty" Ford | url = http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/ford/essays/firstlady/elizabeth | publisher = [[Miller Center of Public Affairs]] | accessdate = July 11, 2011 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120118190856/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/ford/essays/firstlady/elizabeth | archivedate = January 18, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and also acknowledged that her children may have experimented with marijuana, which was popular among the young. Some [[conservatism|conservatives]] called her "No Lady" for her comments and demanded her "resignation", but her overall approval rating was at a high seventy-five percent. As she later said, during her husband's failed 1976 presidential campaign, "I would give my life to have Jerry have my poll numbers."<ref name="nytimes2006" />

Her outspoken comments also caused President Ford's advisors dismay due to their attempts at restoring America's composure in the wake of Watergate.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.bet.com/news/national/2011/07/09/former-first-lady-betty-ford-dies-at-93-.html |title=Former First Lady Betty Ford Dies at 93 |agency=BET.com |date=July 9, 2011}}</ref>

===Social policy and political activism===
During her time as First Lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of [[women's rights]] and was a prominent force in the [[Feminist Movement in the United States|Women's Movement of the 1970s]]. She supported the proposed ERA and lobbied state legislatures to ratify the amendment, and took on opponents of the amendment. She was also un-apologetically [[pro-choice|pro-abortion rights]].<ref name="CNN Transcript">{{cite web | author = Transcript | date = December 30, 2006 | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0612/30/lkl.01.html| title = Special Encore Presentation&nbsp;— Interview with Gerald Ford | work = [[Larry King Live]] | publisher = [[CNN]] | accessdate =July 11, 2011}}</ref> Her active political role prompted ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' to call her the country's "Fighting First Lady" and name her a [[Time's Person of the Year|Woman of the Year]] in 1975, as representing American women, along with other feminist icons.<ref name="Time">{{cite news | title= Women: A Fighting First Lady| date= March 3, 1975| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912914,00.html| work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref>

In May 1975, during a four-day trip,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/25/archives/bettyford-in-tiptop-shape-after-grueling-fourday-trip.html|title=Betty Ford 'in Tip‐Top Shape' After Grueling Four‐Day Trip|first=Marjorie|last=Hunter|work=The New York Times|date=May 25, 1975}}</ref> Ford met with former [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Vietnam]] [[Nguyễn Cao Kỳ]] to discuss [[Southeast Asia]] refugees, Ford afterward stating she was impressed with the conduct of the refugees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/22/archives/first-lady-visits-with-ky-on-coast-mrs-ford-tours-a-refugee-camp.html?_r=0|title=FIRST LADY VISITS WITH KY ON COAST|date=May 22, 1975|work=The New York Times|first=Marjorie|last=Hunter}}</ref>

On June 30, 1976, Ford attended the opening of "Remember the Ladies", a Revolutionary War era women exhibit. She drew boos from demonstrators against the Equal Rights Amendment in stating, "This exhibit about neglected Americans should give us strength and courage to seek equal rights for women today."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/30/archives/mrs-ford-helps-remember-the-ladies-of-revolutionary-era.html?_r=0|title=Mrs. Ford Helps 'Remember the Ladies' of Revolutionary Era|first=Judy|last=Klemesrud|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

For a time, it was unclear whether Gerald Ford shared his wife's [[pro-choice|pro-abortion rights]] viewpoint. In December 1999, he told interviewer [[Larry King]] that he, too, was pro-abortion rights and had been criticized for that stance by conservative forces within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name="CNN Transcript"/>

===Health and breast cancer awareness===
[[File:Betty Ford and Rosalind Russell (1976-05-11)(1).jpg|thumb|left|Betty Ford hosts actress [[Rosalind Russell]] at the White House on May 11, 1976. Russell was suffering from breast cancer, and would die 6 months later.]]

Weeks after Ford became First Lady, she underwent a [[mastectomy]] for breast cancer on September 28, 1974, after having been diagnosed with the disease.<ref>[http://cancertodaymag.org/Fall2012/Pages/betty-ford-yesterday-and-today.aspx "A Leading Lady," ''Cancer Today magazine,'' Fall 2012]</ref> Ford decided to be open about her illness  because "There had been so much cover-up during [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]] that we wanted to be sure there would be no cover-up in the Ford administration."<ref name=Timeobit/> Her openness about her cancer and treatment raised the visibility of a disease that Americans had previously been reluctant to talk about.

<blockquote>"When other women have this same operation, it doesn't make any headlines," she told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. "But the fact that I was the wife of the President put it in headlines and brought before the public this particular experience I was going through. It made a lot of women realize that it could happen to them. I'm sure I've saved at least one person&nbsp;— maybe more."<ref name="cancer"/></blockquote>

Adding to heightened public [[breast cancer awareness|awareness of breast cancer]] were reports that several weeks after Ford's cancer surgery, [[Margaretta Fitler Murphy Rockefeller|Happy Rockefeller]], the wife of vice president [[Nelson Rockefeller]], also had a mastectomy.<ref name="cancer">Staff (November 4, 1974).  [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945077,00.html "Breast Cancer: Fear and Facts"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.  Retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref> The spike in women [[Breast self-examination|self-examining]] after Ford went public with the diagnosis led to an increase in reported cases of breast cancer, a phenomenon known as the "Betty Ford blip".<ref name=Timeobit>[[Nancy Gibbs|Gibbs, Nancy]] (July 8, 2011).

According to Tasha N.  Dubriwny, the massive media coverage of Ford's mastectomy was constrained by stereotypical gender roles, particularly the need for breast cancer patients to maintain their femininity. Betty Ford was portrayed as an ideal patient within a success narrative that presented the key sequences of her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment in a progressive, linear fashion that inspired optimism. Her coverage minimized the complexity of breast cancer as a disease and ignored the debates surrounding best treatment practices. It amounted to as aestheticization of breast cancer and her coverage became the major discursive model for looking at all breast cancer survivors.<ref>Tasha N. Dubriwny, "Constructing breast cancer in the news: Betty Ford and the evolution of the breast cancer patient." ''Journal of Communication Inquiry'' 33.2 (2009): 104-125.</ref>

===The arts===
As First Lady, Ford was an advocate of the arts; she was instrumental in gaining award of the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for choreographer and dancer [[Martha Graham]] in 1976. She received an award from [[Parsons The New School for Design]] in recognition of her style.<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

===Television===
In January 1976, Ford made a cameo appearance on ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.

===Conceding the 1976 election===

==Post-White House career==

In 1978, the Ford family staged an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] and forced her to confront her [[alcoholism]] and an addiction to [[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s, which had been prescribed in the early 1960s for a pinched nerve.<ref name="FLbiogs"/> "I liked alcohol," she wrote in her 1987 memoir. "It made me feel warm. And I loved pills. They took away my tension and my pain". She went into treatment for substance abuse.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Betty Ford, 1918–2011|last=Gibbs|first=Nancy|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2082229-4,00.html|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref>

In 1982, after her recovery, she established the [[Betty Ford Center]] (initially called the Betty Ford Clinic) in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], for the treatment of chemical dependency,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bettyfordcenter.org/about-betty-ford-center/our-history.php|title=Addiction Treatment – Betty Ford Center – Rancho Mirage, CA|work=bettyfordcenter.org}}</ref> including treating the children of alcoholics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/spotlight000.htm|title=Betty Ford targets children of addicted families|date=January 16, 2002|newspaper=USA Today}}</ref> She served as chair of the board of directors. She also co-authored with [[Chris Chase]] a book about her treatment, ''Betty: A Glad Awakening'' (1987). In 2003, Ford produced another book, ''Healing and Hope: Six Women from the Betty Ford Center Share Their Powerful Journeys of Addiction and Recovery''. In 2005, Ford relinquished her chair of the center's board of directors to her daughter Susan. She had held the top post at the center since its founding.<ref name="PBS"/>

[[Barbara Bush]], one of Ford's successors as First Lady, observed that Ford, after discovering she was dependent on drugs, "transformed her pain into something great for the common good. Because she suffered, there will be more healing. Because of her grief, there will be more joy."<ref>{{cite book|title=Barbara Bush: A Memoir|first=Barbara|last=Bush|authorlink=Barbara Bush|page=180|year=2015|isbn=978-1501117787|publisher=Scribner}}</ref>

===Women's movement===
[[File:First Lady Betty Ford’s “Bloomer Flag”.jpg|thumb|right|A handmade flag given to Betty Ford that demonstrates her support for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]]]
Ford continued to be an active leader and activist of the feminist movement after the Ford administration. She continued to strongly advocate and lobby politicians and state legislatures for passage of the ERA. In 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed Ford to the second National Commission on the Observance of [[International Women's Year]] (the first had been appointed by President Ford). That same year, she joined First Ladies [[Lady Bird Johnson]] and [[Rosalynn Carter]] to open and participate in the [[National Women's Conference]] in [[Houston]], Texas, where she endorsed measures in the convention's National Plan of Action, a report sent to the state legislatures, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and the President on how to improve the status of American women.<ref name="sisters">{{cite web |author=Staff |date=n.d. |title=''Sisters of '77'': The Conference |url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/sistersof77/conference.html |work=[[Independent Lens]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] | accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Ford continued to be an outspoken supporter of equal pay for women, breast cancer awareness, and the ERA throughout her life.<ref name="aclu">{{cite web| title=Former First Lady and Women's Rights Advocate: Betty Ford| url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/womens-rights/former-first-lady-and-womens-rights-advocate-betty-ford|work=Blog of Rights |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] | author= Barth-Werb, Zoë | date= July 12, 2011| accessdate=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

In 1978, the deadline for ratification of the ERA was extended from 1979 to 1982, resulting largely from a march of a hundred thousand people on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] in Washington. The march was led by prominent feminist leaders, including Ford, [[Bella Abzug]], [[Elizabeth Chittick]], [[Betty Friedan]] and [[Gloria Steinem]]. In 1981, [[Eleanor Smeal]], the [[National Organization for Women]]'s president, announced Ford's appointment to be the co-chair, with [[Alan Alda]], of the ERA Countdown Campaign.<ref name="smeal">{{cite news |title=Betty Ford, Champion of Women's Rights |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-09/opinion/smeal.betty.ford_1_betty-ford-equal-rights-amendment-era-vote?_s=PM:OPINION |date=July 9, 2011 |author=[[Eleanor Smeal|Smeal, Eleanor]] (opinion essay) |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716011857/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-09/opinion/smeal.betty.ford_1_betty-ford-equal-rights-amendment-era-vote?_s=PM%3AOPINION |archivedate=July 16, 2011  }}</ref>  In November 1981, Ford stated that [[Governor of Illinois]] [[James R. Thompson]] had not done enough in support of the ERA as well as her disappointment with First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] not being in favor of the measure, though also relayed her hopes to change the incumbent First Lady's mind in further encounters with her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/11/18/Former-first-lady-Betty-Ford-says-she-is-disappointed/3258374907600/|title=Former first lady Betty Ford says she is disappointed...|date=November 18, 1981|publisher=UPI}}</ref> As the deadline approached, Ford led marches, parades and rallies for the ERA with other feminists, including First Daughter [[Maureen Reagan]] and various Hollywood actors. Ford was credited with rejuvenating the ERA movement and inspiring more women to continue working for the ERA. She visited states, including Illinois, where ratification was believed to have the most realistic chance of passing.<ref name="feminist">{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/feministchronicl00cara| title=Feminist Chronicles 1953&ndash;1993| year=1993| author1=Carabillo, Toni| author2=Meuli, Judith| author3=Csida, June Bundy| place=Los Angeles, California| publisher=[[Women's Graphics]] (via [[Feminist Majority Foundation]])| accessdate=July 16, 2011| isbn=978-0-9634912-0-6}}</ref> The amendment did not receive enough states' ratification. In 2004, Ford reaffirmed her pro-abortion rights stance and her support for the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]],'' as well as her belief in and support for the ratification of the ERA.<ref>{{cite news | title= Betty Ford's death marks the passing of a lost generation of moderate Republican women| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100096173/betty-fords-death-marks-the-passing-of-a-lost-generation-of-moderate-republican-women/ | date= July 9, 2011| author= [[Tim Stanley|Stanley, Tim]] (opinion essay) |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK| accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>

In 1987, Ford underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple coronary bypass surgery]] and recovered without complications.<ref>{{cite news |title=Betty Ford Returns Home |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/02/us/betty-ford-returns-home.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 2, 1987 |accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref>

In November 18, 1991, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President George H.W.

That same year, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to her and her husband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars%20by%20date/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf|title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars: By Date Dedicated|website=palmspringswalkofstars.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208224143/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars%20by%20date/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf|archivedate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>

On May 8, 2003, Ford received the [[Woodrow Wilson Awards|Woodrow Wilson Award]] in Los Angeles for her public service, awarded by the [[Woodrow Wilson Center]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

During these years, she and her husband resided in Rancho Mirage and in [[Beaver Creek, Colorado]].<ref name="FLbiogs"/> Gerald Ford died, aged 93, of heart failure on December 26, 2006 at their Rancho Mirage home. Despite her advanced age and own frail physical condition, Ford traveled across the country and took part in the funeral events in California, Washington, D.C., and Michigan.<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

Following her husband's death, Ford continued to live in Rancho Mirage. Poor health and increasing frailty due to operations in August 2006 and April 2007 for blood clots in her legs caused her to largely curtail her public life. Her ill health prevented her from attending [[Lady Bird Johnson]]'s funeral in July 2007; her daughter Susan Ford represented her mother at the funeral service.<ref name="FLbiogs"/>

In July 2018, a statue of Betty Ford was unveiled outside of the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Betty Ford Sculpture Unveiled at Ford Museum |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/07/14/betty-ford-sculpture-grand-rapids/785458002/ |website=Detroit Free Press |accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>

==Legacy and awards==
By repeatedly speaking out on women's issues, Betty Ford became a leader in the changing status of women in American society. She surprised the media and the public by explicitly supporting a woman's right to an abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, and grass roots activism.  She knew her new roles caused a political risk of  conservative backlash against the president. Not everything was innovative. She enjoyed the traditional role as hostess of the White House and on a daily basis she spent most of her energy on the family, health, and filling in for her husband on the hustings.<ref>Leesa E. Tobin, "Betty Ford as first lady: A woman for women." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 20.4 (1990): 761-767. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20700159 online]</ref>

According to John Robert Greene:
:Only a part of Betty Ford's legacy will be that of her role as first lady. Throughout her post-Washington life, she established herself as one of the nation's first public advocates for women's self-examination, a prodigious fund-raiser for arthritis research, and, most important, a tireless campaigner for the rights and dignity of those afflicted with the disease of substance abuse. Her role as a public health advocate distinguishes her as one of the most influential women of the latter part of the twentieth century.<ref>John Robert Greene. "Ford. Betty" (2013).</ref>

In 1985, Ford received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National - Jefferson Awards|publisher=Jefferson Awards|access-date=August 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|archive-date=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> In that same year, she received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]], presented by her husband, President Gerald Ford, an Academy Awards Council member.<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#public-service}}</ref>

In 2013, Ford was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/betty-ford/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Betty Ford]</ref>
