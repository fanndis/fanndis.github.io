{{Arlene Foster Sidebar}}

'''Arlene Isabel Foster''' [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (née '''Kelly'''; born 17 July 1970)<ref name="dob"/> is a Northern Irish politician serving as [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] since January 2020, and previously from 2016 to 2017. She has served as Leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) since 2015 and [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly]] (MLA) for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Assembly constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] since 2003.

Foster served in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] as [[Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland)|Minister of the Environment]] from 2007 until 2008, [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment|Minister for Enterprise and Investment]] from 2008 until 2015 and [[Department of Finance and Personnel|Minister for Finance and Personnel]] from 2015 until 2016. In January 2016, Foster became [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] and shared power with [[Martin McGuinness]].

McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister in January 2017 amid the [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal]], which involved a green energy scheme that Foster set up during her time as Minister for Enterprise and Investment. The scheme was set to cost the taxpayer £490 million and there were allegations of corruption surrounding it. McGuinness asked Foster to step aside as First Minister while her involvement in the scheme was investigated, but she refused to step aside or resign and said that the voices calling for her resignation were those of "[[misogynists]] and male [[chauvinists]]".<ref name=":0">{{cite news |last1=Cunliffe |first1=Rachel |title=By crying wolf over sexism, Arlene Foster undermines other women's achievements |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/05/crying-wolf-sexism-arlene-foster-undermines-womens-achievements/ |access-date=10 June 2017 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 January 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033223/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/05/crying-wolf-sexism-arlene-foster-undermines-womens-achievements/ |archive-date=1 April 2017}}</ref> Under the terms of the Northern Ireland power-sharing agreement known as the [[Good Friday Agreement]], the First and deputy First Ministers are equal and, therefore, Foster could not remain in her post as First Minister, even in a caretaker capacity. McGuinness's resignation caused a [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2017 snap assembly election]] to be held, in which the DUP lost 10 seats. In January 2020 she became [[First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|First minister of Northern Ireland]] again after the cabinet was reinstated.

As a teenager, Foster was on a school bus that was bombed by the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]], the vehicle targeted because its driver was a soldier in the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]]. A girl sitting near her was seriously injured.<ref>{{cite web |author=Staff |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bombs-ballot-box-new-dup-leader-arlene-foster-symbolises-provinces-newfound-hopes-1533899 |title=From bombs to the ballot box: New DUP leader Arlene Foster symbolises the Province's newfound hopes |work=International Business Times |access-date=17 December 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218002409/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bombs-ballot-box-new-dup-leader-arlene-foster-symbolises-provinces-newfound-hopes-1533899 |archive-date=18 December 2015}}</ref> She was a pupil at [[Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[County Fermanagh]] from 1982 to 1989, and attended [[Queen's University, Belfast]] where she graduated with an [[LL.B.]] degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/members/biogs_07/foster_a.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313050408/http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/members/biogs_07/foster_a.htm|url-status=dead|title=Biography – Arlene Foster|archive-date=13 March 2010}}</ref> Her political career began at Queen's University after she joined the Queen's Unionist Association, part of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6973957/Arlene-Fosters-unlikely-path-to-Northern-Irelands-top-job.html Arlene Foster's unlikely path to Northern Ireland's top job] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115171841/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6973957/Arlene-Fosters-unlikely-path-to-Northern-Irelands-top-job.html |date=15 January 2010}}, ''The Daily Telegraph'', 12 January 2010.</ref>

==Assembly career==
She was elected as an Ulster Unionist in the [[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly elections]]. While a member of the UUP, she was part of a "rightwing cabal within the UUP known as the 'baby barristers'." They actively opposed party leader [[David Trimble]], and were a "thorn in [his] side" after he supported the [[Belfast Agreement]].<ref name="Guardian Profile">{{cite news |last=McDonald |first=Henry |title=Robinson saga: Profile of Arlene Foster |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/11/profile-arlene-foster-northern-ireland |work=The Guardian |access-date=13 June 2012 |location=London |date=11 January 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013518/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/11/profile-arlene-foster-northern-ireland |archive-date=19 May 2015}}</ref>

In 2004, Foster resigned from the UUP and joined the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), together with fellow Assembly members [[Jeffrey Donaldson]] and [[Norah Beare]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Donaldson resigns from UUP |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3331805.stm |access-date=10 June 2017 |work=BBC News |date=18 December 2003 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040607220554/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3331805.stm|archive-date=7 June 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=George |title=Ulster Unionist MP defects to Paisley |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1451006/Ulster-Unionist-MP-defects-to-Paisley.html |access-date=10 June 2017 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 January 2004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301083525/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1451006/Ulster-Unionist-MP-defects-to-Paisley.html |archive-date=1 March 2016}}</ref> She was selected as the DUP's candidate for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 UK general election]], where she gained 28.8% of the vote.<ref name=electoralcalculus2005>{{cite web |title=Election Data 2005 |url=http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_2005ob.txt |publisher=[[Electoral Calculus]] |access-date=18 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054249/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_2005ob.txt |archive-date=15 October 2011}}</ref>

Negotiations took place between the local branches of the DUP and UUP with the aim of finding an agreed [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] candidate. The negotiations broke down with neither party willing to accept the electoral dominance of the other; the UUP claiming Foster's defection to the DUP disguised the reality of the UUP's electoral strength, while the DUP pointed to the change in the unionist political landscape following the 2003 Assembly election and the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European Parliament election]]. The UUP candidate was [[Tom Elliott (politician)|Tom Elliott]]. Foster finished second in the 2005 general election with 14,056 votes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On 11 January 2010, she assumed the duties of the [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]], as [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] stepped aside for a planned period of up to six weeks. Foster worked alongside the deputy First Minister [[Martin McGuinness]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8450854.stm Peter Robinson steps aside as NI first minister] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114095307/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8450854.stm |date=14 January 2010}} BBC News, 11 January 2010</ref> Robinson returned earlier than planned, on 3 February 2010.<ref name=PRBack>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8497072.stm Robinson back as Northern Ireland first minister], BBC News, 4 February 2010.</ref>

In September 2007, a privately financed proposal for a new [[Giant's Causeway]] centre was given preliminary approval by Foster in her role as Northern Ireland Environment Minister.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6987303.stm Developer set to get Causeway nod], BBC, 10 September 2007.</ref> Immediately afterwards, the public money that had been allocated to the causeway development was frozen. The proposal resulted in a public row about the relationship between the private developer Seymour Sweeney and the DUP; Sweeney was a member of the DUP, although both he and the DUP denied that he had ever donated financially to the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6989808.stm Developer's DUP link 'no bearing'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111222253/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6989808.stm |date=11 January 2009}}, BBC News, 11 September 2007</ref>

On 29 January 2008, Foster announced that she had decided against Sweeney's proposal for a £21 million visitors' centre on a protected greenfield site, reversing her earlier position of "being minded" to approve it.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Gordon |title=Foster ditches Sweeney centre |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |pages=1–2 |date=29 January 2008}}</ref> Although the public funds for a causeway scheme remained frozen, it seemed highly likely that the publicly funded plan for the causeway would go ahead with the support of deputy DUP leader [[Nigel Dodds]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/3306937/Giants-Causeway-development-plan-anger.html |title=Giants Causeway Development Plan Anger |date=14 September 2017 |author=Tom Peterkin |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>

===Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment===
A major concession for Northern Ireland was the reduction to zero of [[Air Passenger Duty]] on long-haul flights from the province. In the devolution settlement such burdens were to be born by the Assembly government. But negotiations proved how DUP could sell their support to Whitehall.<ref>An Air Transport Policy for Northern Ireland, 28 May 2012, House of Commons Northern Ireland Committee hearings, p.81.</ref> In 2011, she had written to the [[Organised Crime Task Force]] about the need to bring fuel licensing within the remit of the Petrol licensing Consolidation (NI) Act 1929, demonstrating the relevance of cross-border law enforcement jurisdiction in helping to reduce frauds.<ref>Fuel Laundering and Smuggling in Northern Ireland: 3rd Report, House of Commons, Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, December 2011.</ref>

As the minister responsible for energy policy in June 2012, Foster criticised the Co-operative Group over the showing of a documentary opposing [[fracking]], saying: "I find your claim that you take 'ethics to the next level' hard to reconcile with your demonstrable support for a film which presents a wholly one-sided and partial approach to the debate about hydraulic fracturing."<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news |last=Magee |first=Kevin |title=Arlene Foster criticises Co-operative Group over fracking film |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18434707 |work=BBC News |access-date=24 August 2012 |date=14 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620074217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18434707 |archive-date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

In March 2014, Foster called for an apology for what she described as "deeply insulting" language" in a comment made by fellow MLA [[Anna Lo]] of the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]]. Lo had described herself as "anti-colonial" and said the [[partition of Ireland]] was "artificial".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-26667174 |work=BBC News |title=Anna Lo: 'United Ireland' remarks 'insulting', say unionists |date=20 March 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324214747/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-26667174 |archive-date=24 March 2014}}</ref> Foster herself was challenged in a blog by Irish writer Jude Collins over the fact that she had chosen to speak out so robustly on the matter after not commenting about remarks made the previous day by another Unionist politician, [[Progressive Unionist Party]] leader [[Billy Hutchinson]]. The former UVF member who was responsible for two sectarian murders during [[The Troubles]] stated that he had "no regrets in terms of my past because I believe that I contributed to preventing a united Ireland." Hutchinson also stated: "There is no room for violence in this society."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/my-murder-of-two-catholics-helped-prevent-united-ireland-pup-leader-billy-hutchinson-1-5945099 |title=My murder of two Catholics helped prevent united Ireland – PUP leader Billy Hutchinson |last=McBride |first=Sam |date=19 March 2014 |newspaper=News Letter |location=Belfast |access-date=3 March 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806224449/http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/my-murder-of-two-catholics-helped-prevent-united-ireland-pup-leader-billy-hutchinson-1-5945099 |archive-date=6 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.judecollins.com/2014/03/anna-said |title=What Anna said |publisher=Jude Collins |access-date=17 December 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222142129/http://www.judecollins.com/2014/03/anna-said/ |archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=The specific criticism of Arlene Foster on this issue appears to be the thoughts of Collins from a blog or personal webpage|date=November 2018}}

In January 2016, as she was poised to become First Minister, Foster stated that she would not be travelling to Dublin for the official centenary celebrations of the [[Easter Rising|1916 uprising]] against British rule, describing the rising as "an attack on democracy".<ref>{{cite news|author=Henry McDonald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/arlene-foster-easter-northern-ireland-first-minister-dup|title=Arlene Foster: Easter Rising was attack on democracy|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=17 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117150841/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/arlene-foster-easter-northern-ireland-first-minister-dup|archive-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

Arlene Foster was First Minister of Northern Ireland from January 2016 to January 2017. She set the agenda during her maiden speech as First Minister as one of "hope for all the community".<ref>[http://arlenefoster.org.uk/first-minister/  Maiden speech as Leader] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612144106/http://arlenefoster.org.uk/first-minister/ |date=12 June 2018 }} Retrieved 6 June 2018.</ref> Throughout Foster's period in office, a return to conservative social issues compounded by strong support for the government in Westminster made her a scourge of her left-wing critics.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} In May 2018, she announced she would be leading an [[Orange Order]] march in Fife, Scotland. As a committed member of the Order, this was a reason behind the original defection from the UUP ten years ago. As First Minister, Foster was emphatic in support for Brexit with a soft border along the republic; yet leaving the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK.

The assembly was suspended following disagreements between the parties, particularly over the  [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal]]. While the Government talked about restoring the Executive as a "top priority" the constitutional impasse has made it impossible.<ref>vol.791, Hansard, Lord Duncan of Springbank, House of Lords, 23 May 2018.</ref> In May 2018, the High Court ruled that the civil service could not grant planning permission for an incinerator in Mallusk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44084384|title=Mallusk incinerator plan blocked by court|date=2018-05-14|access-date=2019-10-24|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Committed to a business case, Foster was responsible for a super-fast broadband connection designed to enhance communications with international offerings. Her success at liaison with ministers, such as [[Theresa Villiers]] MP demonstrated administrative competence. The case of [[HMS Caroline (1914)#Preservation|HMS Caroline]] also bore witness how feminine leadership agenda could draw praise from her colleagues in the [[House of Commons|House]], and attract business to Belfast, while galvanising an heroic Unionist vision for Northern Ireland. Regional Aid proved a vital part of the budget within the devolved framework. The reduction of sales and purchase taxes, such as Air Passenger Duty was typically part of her wider experience of stimulating business at DETI.<ref>vol.554, Inward Investment debate, House of Commons, 5 December 2012.</ref> Fighting the cause of private enterprise has been an important issue for Foster: mobile phone companies and saving Bombardier jobs brought investment of £500 million, while public sector employment has declined.<ref>vol.675, 26 February 2014, Public Sector Jobs debate, House of Commons</ref>

===Renewable Heat Incentive scandal===
{{main|Renewable Heat Incentive scandal}}
In December 2016, Foster faced criticism and controversy after a whistleblower revealed that the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme overspent by £400m, a failure which has been nicknamed the ''Cash for Ash'' scandal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38414486|title=RHI scandal: RHI 'cash for ash' scandal to cost NI taxpayers £490m|work=[[BBC News]]|date=23 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328131700/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38414486|archive-date=28 March 2017}}</ref> The scheme was originally set up by the [[Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment]] (DETI, now Department for the Economy) when she was Minister of the department and the scheme offered incentives to businesses if they installed renewable heating systems, such as burning wooden pellets.

She faced strong criticism after it was claimed that she personally campaigned to keep the scheme open, even when senior civil servants warned of the overspend and the Minister responsible, [[Jonathan Bell (politician)|Jonathan Bell]], planned on closing it. It remained open for an extra two weeks before it was finally closed. It was also revealed that the Northern Ireland budget would lose £400m over the next 20 years as a result of the failure of the scheme. An independent audit investigated 300 sites and found there were issues at half of them, including 14 cases where there were suspicions of 'serious fraud'.

When senior civil servants suggested the closure of the scheme in September 2015, the [[Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister]] (now the [[Executive Office (Northern Ireland)|Executive Office]]) pressured the department to keep the scheme open, which is when there was a spike in applications.<ref>{{cite news|title=Foster 'intervened to keep heat scheme subsidy open'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-38312906|work=BBC News|date=14 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215053254/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-38312906|archive-date=15 December 2016}}</ref> There were calls for Foster to resign as First Minister after the scandal broke.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Claire|title=People Before Profit to hold rallies calling for Arlene Foster's resignation|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2016/12/14/news/people-before-profit-to-hold-rallies-calling-for-arlene-foster-s-resignation-836122|access-date=14 December 2016|work=The Irish News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220155445/http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2016/12/14/news/people-before-profit-to-hold-rallies-calling-for-arlene-foster-s-resignation-836122/|archive-date=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Arlene Foster rejects call to resign over botched renewable energy scheme|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/arlene-foster-rejects-call-to-resign-over-botched-renewable-energy-scheme-35276860.html|access-date=14 December 2016|work=Belfast Telegraph}}</ref>

On 9 January 2017, McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister. Under the terms of the power-sharing agreement that created what is now the Executive Office, his resignation has also resulted in Foster being removed from office, until Sinn Féin nominates a new deputy First Minister; the party stated that it will not replace McGuinness. No nomination was made before 16 January, resulting in the collapse of the Executive. [[James Brokenshire]], the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], assumed the powers of the Executive and called for a [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|snap election]] scheduled for 2 March.<ref>{{cite news|title=Elections to be held in NI on 2 March|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38641857|work=BBC News|date=16 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116234645/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38641857|archive-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>

In a statement posted to Facebook, Foster said that she was "disappointed" with McGuinness' decision and condemned it as "not principled": "At a time when we are dealing with Brexit, needing to create more jobs and investing in our health and education system, Northern Ireland needs stability. But because of Sinn Féin's selfish reactions, we now have instability, and I very much regret that." She expressed concern over the possibility of another election less than a year after [[2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election|the previous one]], and said "this is not an election of our making", but that "the DUP will always defend unionism and stand up for what is best for Northern Ireland."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38561507 |title=Martin McGuinness resigns as NI deputy first minister |date=9 January 2017 |work=BBC News |access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref>

===Northern Ireland political deadlock===
{{further|Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019}}
Since McGuinness' resignation, Northern Ireland was in a continuous state of political deadlock until January 2020. One of the key issues was the [[Irish Language Act]], which Sinn Féin insist on and Foster has said that her party will never agree to. With regard to the proposed act, she said "If you feed a crocodile, it will keep coming back for more." This remark was widely cited during the [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election]] even though Foster later apologised for it.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Devenport |first1=Mark |title=Language issue still has (crocodile) teeth |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-39854102 |access-date=24 September 2019 |date=9 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gordon |first1=Gareth |title=Crocodiles, alligators and Irish language |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-northern-ireland-2017-38892198 |access-date=24 September 2019 |date=7 February 2017}}</ref> On 11 January 2020, the Executive was re-formed with Arlene Foster as First Minister and Sinn Féin's [[Michelle O'Neill]] as deputy first minister.

==Brexit==
Following a [[Brexit]] breakthrough on 8 December 2017, Foster broadly welcomed the deal to progress talks, stating that she was "pleased" to see changes which meant there is "no red line down the Irish Sea".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-42277798|title=Brexit: Broad welcome in NI and Republic for UK-EU deal|date=8 December 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208154956/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-42277798|archive-date=8 December 2017}}</ref>
